"It's been three days since the US election. You might have reasonably expected to have some kind of clue about the results by now. We still cannot say, because not enough votes have been counted for either Donald Trump or Joe Biden to claim victory. But the moment we will be able to tell you someone has won does seem to be getting much closer. And results are still coming in. The huge number of postal votes cast during this pandemic election, and different states' laws about how to count them, meant this always was going to take longer if the race was tight. Yes, so far, and by a big margin, but that's not what decides who gets to be president. Instead, a candidate has to win the majority in a system called the electoral college, where each state gets a certain number of votes or ""electors"" roughly in proportion to its population. If you win a state, you win all its votes (except Nebraska and Maine, but that's complicated). There are 538 state votes and the person who gets 270 wins the prize. Mr Biden is on 253 electoral college votes to Mr Trump's 214. There are several ways each of them could reach 270. If Mr Biden gets Pennsylvania, that's all he needs - he is over the line. Georgia and any of Nevada, Arizona or North Carolina works for him too. Mr Trump would need Pennsylvania's votes and to win three states out of Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada or Arizona. So how are they doing in these states? Georgia (16 votes):The story here is about how Mr Biden ate into Mr Trump's lead in a solid Republican state as postal votes and tallies from more Democratic counties came in. Mr Biden has taken a very slim lead in the state and there are still votes to be counted, such as military and overseas votes.  But because the margin is so tight, there is going to be a recount. Pennsylvania (20 votes):There are fewer than 115,000 mail ballots left to count,external, and Mr Biden has now taken the lead. As mail ballots in most places tend to go Democratic, analysts are watching to see how wide this lead gets. Nevada (6 votes):Mr Biden has pulled ahead in Nevada. About 150,000 ballots are yet to be counted, many of them from Clark county, which leans Democratic. Arizona (11 votes):Joe Biden has a lead that is narrowing. Many of those votes still to be counted are from Maricopa County, home to 60% of the state's population - and Mr Trump has been catching up a bit as these votes get counted. Donald Trump has done better than expected and Joe Biden has failed to win those battleground states which count votes quickly, but the Democrat is closing the gap in crucial states as votes get counted. How close are we to knowing the winner? Who has lead in states still counting? How Americans are coping with the long wait What happens if there is a tie, and other questions Election results in full Each state has its own laws and systems for counting votes. Individual states are also in charge of the order in which they count different types of votes - for example postal votes are often counted last. So that makes a difference when Republicans tend to vote in person on the day and postal votes tend to skew Democratic. As there were so many postal votes cast during this pandemic election, this is why we have seen such late dramatic shifts in who leads a race. Another thing to be aware of is that different news outlets have different tallies for each candidate dependingon where they get election data from.So some outlets have called Arizona for Mr Biden, but the BBC thinks it's still not decided. Mr Trump has launched some legal challenges, but analysts suggest most of these challengesconcern small numbers of ballots that might not make a difference in the end,with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Supreme Court previously hinted it could revisit the rules about deadlines for accepting postal votes. Poll officials in Michigan - now projected for Biden - work to tally ballots It now looks like polling data ahead of the election didn't tell us the whole story about the American public. Many observers didn't realise the race would be so tight. Robert Cuffe, the BBC's head of statistics, says it's still too early to say whether this election has been a pollster's nightmare. Final national polls showed Mr Biden leading Mr Trump by about eight points. In battleground states Mr Biden also polled in the lead, but by a much slimmer margin. Currently Mr Biden leads Mr Trump in the share of the popular vote by about three percentage points. Some experts suspect there's a part of the American public which won't even participate in polls because they don't trust institutions - they're more likely to vote for Mr Trump. Voter priorities may have also been slightly misjudged. While the coronavirus pandemic has dominated headlines, a survey conducted by Edison Research found that more voters (a third in total) listed the economy as their key issue - it was a core Trump message. Mr Trump's vote also looks a little bit more diverse than many might have assumed. You can read more about the resultshere.

"Ballots being collated for counting in Philadelphia With no result yet in a tightly-contested US election, claims which can be misleading are circulating on social media about voting and counting in key states. The count is still going on in the battleground state of Pennsylvania - we've looked at some of the most widely shared claims about the situation there. One viral video showed a poll watcher being denied entry to a Philadelphia polling station. It has had almost two million views on Twitter, and was shared by multiple pro-Trump accounts, saying Republican poll watchers were being banned. The man in the video, Gary Feldman, a local Republican, was asked to wait outside by officials - with a woman telling him that his ""city-wide"" poll watching certificate was not valid in that particular polling station. The video was authentic, and the man was being stopped from entering, but it turns out there was confusion over the rules. Poll watchers used to only be allowed in a certain station, but they can now visit multiple sites across Philadelphia. Philadelphia city commissioners said the man was later allowed into the station and received an apology. A tweet shared by Mike Roman, who worked for the Trump election campaign, claimed that a Democratic poster was a ""violation in sight"" for being in close proximity to a polling station. His tweet referred to ""bad things"" happening. Election rules in Pennsylvania prohibit campaign materials, signs, banners and literature being within 10 feet of a polling station. The post that Mr Roman originally amplified - now labelled as violating Twitter rules - gained significant traction online, but was rebutted by the Philadelphia District Attorney's office. They said they had investigated the claim and found that the actual polling place was ""located in an interior room and the sign in question was further than 10 feet from it"". So, that's not violating the election rules as they are in that area. This false claim appeared on Instagram, saying that an election worker in Erie County, Pennsylvania had thrown out more than 100 votes for President Trump. It was shared as a screenshot by businessman Mike Coudrey, who then deleted the tweet, although it had been re-tweeted more than 6,000 times by then. Screenshots have also been shared on Facebook by various pro-Trump and other groups, but some have been deleted. The election board for Erie Countyhas rejected the claim,external, calling it ""false"". It said in a statement: ""The person making the statements [about throwing out ballots] does not work in any way with Erie County or have any part of Erie County's election process. In fact, the individual is not a registered voter and is not believed to be a resident of Erie County."" A claim that election workers in the city of Philadelphia were no longer counting ballots has been circulating, and was picked up by President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Allow Twitter content?

But this has been denied by the Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt, who put out a statement on Twitter saying that Philadelphia will not stop counting. Another statement from the city commissioners clarified that counting was continuing, but there were some delays in reporting. ""We're going to continue to count all day long."" The statement did acknowledge that for technical reasons, and due to the number of mail-in ballots, reporting the results would be held up until the following day.

"Students in cities across England could begin a mass exodus back to their families ahead of new lockdown measures coming into force on Thursday. Hilary Gyebi-Ababio, National Union of Students vice president for higher education, said students were ""really wanting to go home"". ""There's a sense there could be a mass exodus,"" she told the BBC. It comes after Universities Minister Michelle Donelan urged students, in a letter on Monday, not to ""rush home"". Her message aimed to prevent these young people from travelling across the country to their families and potentially taking coronavirus with them, thus fuelling the pandemic. What can you do during England's new lockdown? Students told not to rush home for lockdown Student lockdown: Should I stay or should I go? Those in tier 3 restriction areas are not allowed by law to visit other households, which would include their family homes, but those in lower tier areas do not face the same restrictions until Thursday when the new lockdown rules come into force. The NUS and the lecturers' union, UCU, have repeated a joint demand for all university teaching to move online, as much as possible, saying not to do so would cause a public health emergency New government guidance published on Tuesday says some face-to-face teaching should continue. But thousands of students have spent several weeks of this term effectively locked down already, self-isolating due to real or suspected Covid-19 cases in their halls of residence. Ms Gyebi-Ababio, 22, said: ""We are really concerned about the the minister's statement, saying don't go home. ""It's not healthy or considerate to students."" She said students really wanted to do what was safe for others and right for them, and that it was important that they were allowed to have agency and make their own decisions. She pointed out that the prime minister had said other members of the public could move to be in new households before the new lockdown measures come into force. Many students did not have the usual support networks of friends, she said, or the formal support usually provided by universities, huge parts of which are closed. ""It's been really difficult for students - they do not have one ounce of certainty about what might happen."" She said the NUS was hearing from students who were ""worried and confused right now"", and this was only to be expected as they had not had any clear information. ""My younger brother is at university now, and I've had so many phone calls from him asking what he should do."" In some universities, students are reporting empty rooms in halls of residence which some students have already vacated. Archaeology lecturer at University of Leicester, Dr Rachel Crellin, tweeted: ""I've just taught: some students have been told to come home by their parents, some worried about being trapped alone in accommodation, others who don't want to take Covid home to vulnerable family and some who don't want to go home. ""This is causing chaos."" Ms Gyebi-Ababio said the government had talked weeks ago about a  ""mandatory two-week lockdown"" to enable students to return home for Christmas but there were still no details about this. She added: ""After this four-week lockdown, students could be locked down for a further two weeks - that's a total of six. This could be really detrimental to their wellbeing and mental health."" Many students work while they study, to support themselves, but as in the previous spring lockdown, many had lost their jobs and were facing financial hardship, she said, and the government should have reflected on what happened then.

"The government is facing criticism over its guidance on safe visits to care homes in England. Labour and a number of charities have described the suggestions, including floor-to-ceiling screens, designated visitor pods and window visits, as impractical. Alzheimer's Society has said it ""completely misses the point"". Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the guidance was ""non-exhaustive"". The updated government advice,,externalwhich came into effect on Thursday, says care homes - especially those which have not allowed visits since March - ""will be encouraged and supported to provide safe visiting opportunities"". Locked down and lonely: 'Why doesn't anyone want us?' 'We sprang Grandma from the care home' Covid care home policies 'violated human rights' Visits should be ""tailored to residents and facilities and should prioritise residents and staff's safety"" to limit the spread of coronavirus, the advice says, with measures such as social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE). Care minister Helen Whately said the new measures would give people more opportunities to see loved ones ""in a safe way"". However, Julia Jones, co-founder of dementia charity John's Campaign, told the Today programme that visits should be more ""meaningful"" than meeting through a window. ""When people are in the later stages of dementia, when people love each other, when people are approaching the end of their lives, they need to hold hands,"" she said. The chief executive of leading care home group MHA, Sam Monaghan, told the programme the best way to carry out Covid-secure visits in care homes was ""through routine testing of at least one relative for each resident"". Asked about such a scheme, Mr Buckland stressed the government was ""interested in all ideas that are Covid-compliant"" and that the guidance was not an exhaustive list of options. The guidance also suggests: Visitors and residents enter through different entrances, meet in Covid-secure areas/pods separated by floor-to-ceiling screens, and visitors should not enter or pass through the care home Window visits where visitors don't need to come inside the care home or they remain in their car, and the resident is socially distanced Outdoor visits - with one other person - in areas which can be accessed without anyone going through a shared building Virtual visits, with care homes encouraging the use of video calls All face-to-face visits were banned during the first national lockdown in the spring. Guidance in England over recent months has allowed visits on a ""limited basis"" where alternative arrangements were not possible, but visits have been severely curtailed or prohibited entirely in those areas subject to enhanced restrictions, which have applied to large parts of England. Ms Whately said she knew the restrictions on visiting had been ""incredibly painful"" and she had been ""in tears"" with some of the stories she had heard. She said the government was ""absolutely trying to enable more visiting"" but, against the ""backdrop of this second wave"", it was ""only right that we make sure visiting care homes is safe"". She said a trial would start later this week as part of plans to carry out testing on visitors to care homes. The government also said a new national programme for weekly testing of professionals who regularly visit care homes would be ""rolled out in the coming weeks"" following a pilot in Cambridgeshire, Peterborough and Northamptonshire. Labour's shadow care minister Liz Kendall said many care homes would not be able to comply with the government's requirements which meant ""in reality thousands of families are likely to be banned from visiting their loved ones"". She said instead of suggesting measures such as screens, the government should ""designate a single family member as a key worker - making them a priority for weekly testing and proper PPE"". Kate Lee, chief executive at Alzheimer's Society, said: ""We're devastated by today's new care home visitor guidance - it completely misses the point: this attempt to protect people will kill them."" She said the pandemic had left people with dementia isolated and thousands had died. The guidelines ""completely ignore the vital role of family carers in providing the care for their loved ones with dementia that no one else can"", she added. She said the ""prison-style screens"" proposed by the government with people speaking through phones were ""frankly ridiculous when you consider someone with advanced dementia can often be bed-bound and struggling to speak"". That view was echoed by Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, who said she was ""acutely aware"" that the methods being sanctioned were ""unlikely to be useable by many older people with dementia, or indeed sensory loss"". She added: ""Overall we think this new guidance is too restrictive. In practice we fear it will result in many care homes halting meaningful visiting altogether, because they will be unable to comply with the requirements laid down.""

"Clinically extremely vulnerable people in England are being strongly advised not to go to work outside their homes during lockdown from Thursday. Underupdated government guidance,external, they should only go out for exercise and to attend health appointments. People with stage-five chronic kidney disease, those undergoing dialysis and adults with Down's syndrome are now also advised to follow the advice. This group is at higher risk from Covid-19 than the general population. The government will give local councils in England more than Â£32m to fund support and access to local services for more than 2.24 million clinically extremely vulnerable people. Is shielding coming back? They include people undergoing treatment for serious medical conditions, such as certain cancers, or those with rare diseases. This number could rise by 80,000 over the next few weeks, as NHS England sends letters to those affected. PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages?

New national restrictions,externalwill apply to everyone in England from 00:01 on Thursday, 5 November, until Wednesday 2 December. Theupdated guidance for clinically extremely vulnerable people,externalstrongly advises: Stay at home as much as possible, although people can exercise outside in their support bubble Avoid all non-essential travel, except to GP and hospital appointments unless told otherwise Don't go to any shops or pharmacies Don't go to work if you cannot work from home - you may be eligible for statutory sick pay or other allowances - but people in the same household can still attend work Most children who were shielding no longer need to be and can go to school - but parents should check with their GP if they are unsure Children who live with someone who is clinically extremely vulnerable should still go to school An online support service,externalhas been set up to help people in this group access supermarket deliveries and other local support. Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation said the guidance was ""a step forward"" but had given people less than 24 hours to prepare for the changes to their lives. ""While it's good news that furlough is still an option for some, it is very late in the day for people to be having this discussion with their employers and there is no guarantee that everyone who needs it will be able to access it,"" said Sarah MacFadyen, head of policy. She said it was vital that no one was left without essentials and delivery systems were easy to access. Nine ways this lockdown is different from last time 'No added Covid risk' from living with children The clinically extremely vulnerable group includes: solid organ transplant recipients people with specific cancers people having active chemotherapy for cancer people having radical radiotherapy for lung cancer people having any treatment for cancers of the blood or bone marrow, such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma people having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for cancer people having other targeted cancer treatments that can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors people who have had bone marrow or stem-cell transplants in the past six months or are still taking immunosuppression drugs people with severe respiratory conditions, including all cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) people with rare diseases that significantly increase the risk of infections, such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) or homozygous sickle cell people on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase risk of infection adults with Down's syndrome adults on dialysis or with chronic kidney disease (stage five) pregnant women with significant congenital or acquired heart disease others classed as clinically extremely vulnerable based on clinical judgement and an assessment of their needs - GPs and hospital clinicians have been provided with guidance to support these decisions The over 70s, pregnant women and people who are very obese are not included in this group - they are classified as clinically vulnerable.

"Shoppers in England are flocking to make last-minute buys ahead of lockdown, which will see non-essential retailers shut for a month. The number of shoppers on Tuesday was up 19% compared with the same day last week, industry figures show. Footfall was sharply higher in shopping centres and retail parks, according to the retail data firm Springboard. It said that there had ""clearly been panic buying"" as people rush to buy Christmas presents before shops close. It comes amid reports of lengthy queues outside stores such as Ikea, Primark, Zara and The Card Factory, with some shoppers venting their frustration at the long waits on social media.

Clothes shops and card retailers are among those non-essential retailers who will have to shut their doors for the month-long lockdown from Thursday 5 November. Retailers such as John Lewis, Currys PC World and toy chain the Entertainer have all extended their opening hours in order to cope with the surge in demand ahead of the new restrictions. Gary Grant, boss of the Entertainer, told the BBC that it was ""just like Christmas"". His 173 shops are extending their hours until 7pm or 8pm from 5.30pm and expect brisk trading right up until Wednesday night. Shopping centres in particular have seen a big rise in the number of customers through their doors, with a 19.9% increase on Tuesday. High Streets and retail parks followed with a 19.1% and 18.4% uplift. There were queues outside Selfridges in London Chris Geaves, the boss of Sovereign Centros - which operates shopping centres such as the MetroCentre complex in Gateshead, said its sites had been ""incredibly busy"" in the last few days. ""With lockdown from tomorrow, people have thought: 'Crikey, I need to get out there shopping',"" he said. ""It's very positive and anecdotally, footfall has been strong, with big brands really having strong sales over the last few days."" Mr Geaves said that footfall at the MetroCentre last week was around 250,000, up 30% week-on-week, although still lower than 2019 figures for the same time of year. Springboard also pointed out that although footfall in England had been boosted recently by last-minute shoppers, overall it still remains more than 10% down on the same period in 2019. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said footfall had risen above 2019 levels for the first time in the pandemic. ""Despite essential stores remaining open during the lockdown there clearly has been panic buying, as footfall in retail parks on Monday and Tuesday actually rose from the same two days last year. ""Even in high streets and shopping centres footfall has strengthened, which is very likely due to shoppers buying Christmas presents early before stores close on Wednesday for a month.""

"Many shops are closing their doors for four weeks, as England enters a second national lockdown. In June, when stores reopened after the spring national lockdown,we spoke to shoppers about the first thing they bought.Now we're back at the same shopping centre - centre.mk in Milton Keynes - to see what people are stocking up on this time. ""As soon as I knew about lockdown, I went into work on Monday and said 'can I book off Wednesday because I need to go Christmas shopping',"" says Joanne Nixey, 28, from Windsor. She messaged her friend, Chloe Gould, straight away and the pair have been stocking up on Christmas presents and decorations. ""I love funky Christmas decorations so I got a rubber duck and a fish,"" says Chloe. ""It's random. A cushion, some candles. I'm trying to get it all done."" ""It gets us out before lockdown,"" says Joanne, pointing to her Primark bags. Sue Stone also booked some time off of work to get the bulk of her Christmas shopping done. ""Boris knew we had a day off, so luckily he moved the lockdown to Thursday,"" she jokes. ""It's just the last day before lockdown so it's Christmas shopping,"" says Sue, 52, a company director. She and Lorraine Stonell spent Â£130 at Hotel Chocolat, as well as bagging perfumes, toiletries and a hoodie. ""I have bought my coffee pods,"" she adds, pointing to a Nespresso bag. ""They are an essential, but the shop will still shut."" ""I got my work bonus so have come shopping,"" says Phil Read, 47, from Bletchley. ""Considering the situation, I'm surprised I got a bonus. I work for the government so a very secure job thankfully."" In his shopping bags are clothes - ""winter clothes, basically"" - including sweaters, pants and some waterproof trousers to play football in. He says the thought of lockdown ""feels rubbish"". ""I have actually got a week off work,"" he says. ""They are forcing us to use our holiday so I took this week off and have been doing all I can in these few days, cramming it in."" ""Everything's half price,"" says Jenny Holloway, 40, referring to the Christmas pop-up shop, where she and her mother Helen McGill bought reindeer decorations for Â£10 each. ""We are just mother and daughter"", adds Helen, ""and we don't get to spend that much time together anyway because of work, and thinking about lockdown we won't be seeing each other. We are just trying to spend time together today before lockdown. ""It's a happy-sad feeling. Happy that we're out now, but sad for the people in shops. At 5pm the shutters are going to come down and when will they come up again? We were hearing whispers about furlough and I just thought it was really sad."" Elizabeth Morris, 38, and her mother, also called Elizabeth Morris, managed to do all of their Christmas shopping back in September and they are now ""just getting some little bits"". ""We have got some matching pyjamas, to wear for a whole month,"" jokes Elizabeth, holding up the bedwear for her and one-year-old son George. ""It's that last opportunity to go to the shops. It's our last hurrah. Last day before we're grounded again."" On the prospect of another lockdown, Elizabeth, 58, says: ""We are positive about it all now. We look forward to reinstating our walks."" Her daughter adds: ""It's my mum and dad's ruby wedding anniversary in November and we were going to Tenerife but can't now. We are now finding other things to do to celebrate. We'll find something."" ""There's a couple of celebrations in our house at the weekend,"" says childminder Rose Iroegbu, 47. ""My son is 18 on Friday. ""I plan to cook his best delicacy, rice and stew."" She's bought balloons and some surprise gifts for him (she can't tell us what they are to risk spoiling the surprise) as well as a phone charging cable for herself. ""I feel a mixture of emotions"" about a second lockdown, she says. ""Worry and anxiety about the future."" ""I have done most of my shopping for Christmas,"" says electrician Chris Locke, 41, from Luton. ""I have bought some stuff this morning and put that in my car. I can't carry everything. I'll be finished today, kids as well."" Chris has bought some socks and slippers for his mother-in-law, plus some toys for his children, including Mario Kart Live and some Lego. ""I'm fairly organised, like I always get stuff done before December. But more in advance this year."" ""They don't send it out online,"" says Sarah Bennett, talking about the six rolls of wrapping paper she's just bought from Card Factory, which had a fast-moving queue outside. ""With two kids you need a lot of Christmas paper."" ""We are just getting bits,"" adds Sarah, who runs a cleaning business and has come shopping with her teenage daughter. ""If I like it, I buy it. We got two standing Santas, reduced to Â£12.99 from the Christmas shop. ""We just came out for a mother and daughter day and we are going to TGI Fridays after.""

"Kris Gumbrell,, who runs 22-pub chain Brewhouse & Kitchen, says the shift is 'a tremendous result' A government U-turn allowing pubs to sell takeaway beer during the latest lockdown has been broadly welcomed by the industry, but some chains say they will still struggle to survive. Kris Gumbrell, chief executive officer of 22-pub chain Brewhouse & Kitchen, said it was ""a tremendous result"". ""I think it will make a significant difference, not only for my company, but for the entire sector"", he told Radio 4's Today Programme. During the first lockdown, a lot of pubs served takeaway meals and drinks as another revenue stream, which was ""essential"", he said. ""What we noticed is that businesses evolve through a crisis, and also the guest evolves through a crisis as well. People miss pubs, they miss the connection, they miss the community part of what a pub actually means, so they want to support their local pub,"" he said. ""Giving a pub the opportunity to open up a new revenue stream was really critical in helping to pay those bills,"" he said. Mark Newcombe says: ""Our income will be reduced to nothing."" However, Mark Newcombe, head of a community-run pub called the Craufurd Arms, in Maidenhead, says his pub will still have to close for the duration. Under the new restrictions, customers must order their drink via a website, phone or text message. Deliveries are also allowed. Pre-ordered alcohol can be collected by customers as long as they do not enter the premises, the legislation says. Mr Newcombe's pub stayed open when the first lockdown rules were eased because it was able to serve takeaway real ale on the spot. But this time it will close for the second one because his pub doesn't have an app, and is ""not in the position to run a [pre-ordered] takeaway service,"" he said. To keep its head above water, the pub will furlough staff, apply for local government grants, launch a crowdfunding campaign, and perhaps sell more shares in the venture. As for the pub's longer-term future, he said it was ""very difficult to plan"" as he didn't know when it would be able to reopen. ""At the end of the day our income will be reduced to nothing,"" he said. But Mr Newcombe was also concerned about the wider implications of shutting the pub on the local community, particularly on the mental health of people adjusting to a second lockdown who may use the pub for social interactions. The new restrictions ""take away that social engagement"", he said. Plans published at the weekend originally suggested that while restaurants could sell takeaway food, takeaway alcohol was to be banned. The industry has hailed the turnaround as a small victory but said the rules should allow venues to sell drink in the same way as an off-licence. ""Takeaway alcohol from pubs if it is pre-ordered and customers don't enter the premises is movement, but still not anywhere near enough,"" said Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association. ""Supermarkets and off-licences can still sell alcohol, so this is grossly unfair on pubs with off-licences. It remains the case that to help pubs and brewers survive, and to stop up to 7.5 million pints from being wasted, the government needs to give pubs the same ability to sell off-licence alcohol as it did in the first lockdown."" In the last lockdown, pubs in England had been allowed to sell takeaway pints and food, and were concerned that closure for a month would mean pouring millions of pints of ale down the drain as open kegs would go off. ""It is a welcome and helpful clarification that pubs and restaurants will be permitted to continue with off-licence sales of alcohol through delivery, as well as click and collect for pre-ordered sales,"" said Kate Nichols of lobby group UK Hospitality. ""This was a lifeline to many businesses in the first lockdown and it is good to see common sense prevail this time too - avoiding waste and providing a valuable community service - although we can see no reason why a pub could not operate as a retail outlet for pre-packaged food and drink as many did last time."" A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise that these are extremely challenging circumstances for pubs and the hospitality industry. Public health and safety remains our number one priority and that is why pubs and other hospitality venues cannot serve alcohol on site to takeaway to prevent people from gathering outside their premises. ""However, they can sell alcohol as part of delivery services, including through click and collect, over the telephone and by other remote methods of ordering for collection, provided customers do not congregate as groups once they have picked up their order.""

"John Lewis Partnership and Lloyds Banking Group have announced plans to cut many hundreds of jobs. John Lewis, which also runs Waitrose supermarkets, says it will axe up to 1,500 jobs at its head office as it makes further cost cuts. It says the move will help it to save another Â£50m as it looks to make Â£300m in annual savings by 2022. Meanwhile, Lloyds is cutting a further 730 jobs as part of a major restructuring programme. The proposed John Lewis Partnership cuts will be made across the two head offices in London Victoria and Bracknell, where John Lewis employs about 5,000 people. They will come in two phases, the first of which will begin immediately. The second phase will be completed by April 2021. John Lewis said it would seek to find new roles for staff and, if that is not possible, will offer redundancy support and retraining funds for those with more than two years service. Partnership chairman Sharon White has set out a five-year recovery plan for the group, which like other retailers has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. In July, the department store divisionsaid it would shut eight shops, putting 1,300 jobs at risk, and close four Waitrose stores, with the loss of 124 jobs. In September, the group told staff they would not receive a bonus for the first time since 1953 after it dived to a Â£635m pre-tax loss for the six months to July, following a Â£470m writedown on its stores. The cuts at Lloyds Banking Group will mainly affect staff in its group transformation and retail banking teams, and will result in no further bank closures, it said. Lloyds employees to work from home until spring Lloyds Bank and Pizza Hut cut more than 1,000 jobs John Lewis and Boots to cut 5,300 jobs A Lloyds Banking Group spokeswoman said: ""This morning we shared changes to some of our teams. ""These changes reflect our ongoing plans to continue to meet our customers' changing needs and make parts of our business simpler. ""The majority of colleagues briefed today will not leave until January at the earliest."" The Unite union said the move was ""shameful"", and that the decision was taken despite recent strong results. It called for the bank to postpone restructuring amid the rising threat of Covid-19. ""Unite cannot comprehend why Lloyds Banking Group would choose to cut 1,000 staff who have given the bank such commitment and dedication during a global pandemic,"" said Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer. Lloyds posted forecast-beating quarterly profits last month after cashing in on a coronavirus-driven boom in demand for mortgages. But in July the bank warned that lockdown washaving a greater economic shock than expected. In September, Lloydssaid it planned to cut 865 jobs, mainly in its insurance, wealth and retail teams.

"President Trump announcing the US pull out from Paris in June 2017 After a three-year delay, the US has become the first nation in the world to formally withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. President Trump announced the move in June 2017, but UN regulations meant that his decision only takes effect today, the day after the US election. The US could re-join it in future, should a president choose to do so. The Paris deal was drafted in 2015 to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change. It aims to keep the global temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C. What is in the Paris climate agreement? What US election results will mean for climate change 'I'll vote for you if you save my life' You've got cheap data, how about cheap power too? The delay is down to the complex rules that were built into the Paris agreement to cope with the possibility that a future US president might decide to withdraw the country from the deal. Protestors objecting to President Trump's climate policies project their message onto one of his hotels Previous attempts to put together a global pact on climate change had foundered because of internal US politics. The Clinton administration was unable to secure Senate backing for theKyoto Protocol,external, agreed in 1997. So in the run up to the Paris climate talks, President Obama's negotiators wanted to ensure that it would take time for the US to get out if there was a change in leadership. Even though the agreement was signed in December 2015, thetreaty only came into force on 4 November 2016, 30 days after at least 55 countries representing 55% of global emissions had ratified it. No country could give notice to leave the agreement until three years had passed from the date of ratification. Even then, a member state still had to serve a 12-month notice period on the UN. This video can not be played Trump: The world won't laugh any more at the US So, despite President Trump'sWhite House announcement in June 2017, the US was only able to formally give notice to the UN in November last year. The time has elapsed and the US is now out. While the US now represents around 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions, it remains the world's biggest and most powerful economy. So when it becomes the only country to withdraw from a global solution to a global problem it raises questions of trust. Former Secretary of State John Kerry holds his granddaughter as he signs the Paris agreement at the UN For the past three years, US negotiators have attended UN climate talks while the administration has triedto use these events to promote fossil fuels. ""Being out formally obviously hurts the US reputation,"" said Andrew Light, a former senior climate change official in the Obama administration. ""This will be the second time that the United States has been the primary force behind negotiating a new climate deal - with the Kyoto Protocol we never ratified it, in the case of the Paris Agreement, we left it."" ""So, I think it's obviously a problem."" Although this has been a long time coming, there is still a palpable sense of disappointment for many Americans who believe that climate change is the biggest global challenge and the US should be leading the fight against it. ""The decision to leave the Paris agreement was wrong when it was announced and it is still wrong today,"" said Helen Mountford from theWorld Resources Institute,external. ""Simply put the US should stay with the other 189 parties to the agreement, not go out alone."" The formal withdrawal has also re-opened old wounds for climate diplomats. ""It's definitely a big blow to the Paris agreement,"" said Carlos Fuller, from Belize, the lead negotiator for theAlliance of Small Island States,externalin the UN talks. ""We actually worked very hard to ensure that every country in the world could accede to this new agreement. And so, by losing one, we feel that basically we have failed."" Others say that the US pull-out is partly due to the failure of the Obama administration to have the Paris agreement ratified by the US Senate. ""What Obama did at the end of his second term was fundamentally undemocratic, to sign up to a Paris agreement without going to the Senate and the Congress and instead doing it via executive order,"" said former UN climate chief, Yvo De Boer. ""And then, in a way, you're setting yourself up for what has happened now."" Yes, it could. In fact, while on the campaign trail, Joe Biden said he would seek to re-join as soon as possible - if he was elected President. Under the rules, all that is required is a month's notice and the US should be back in the fold. However, even if the US chose to re-enter the agreement, there would be consequences for being out - even for a few months. ""We know that the UK and the EU and the UN Secretary General are planning an event on 12 December, on the fifth anniversary of the conclusion of negotiations for the Paris agreement, where they're going to try to drive more ambition,"" said Andrew Light. ""Under the Paris rules, the US will not be able to participate in that."" President Trump made leaving Paris a key part of his election platform in 2016, tying it into his vision of a revitalised US with booming energy production, especially coal and oil. His perspective on the Paris agreement was that it was unfair to the US, leaving countries like India and China free to use fossil fuels while the US had to curb their carbon. ""I'm not sure what Paris actually accomplishes,"" said Katie Tubb, a senior policy analyst at theHeritage Foundation,external, a conservative US think tank. ""In terms of getting to the end of the century, if the goal is to reduce global temperatures, it just can't be done on the backs of the industrialised world."" ""No matter what you think about global warming, and the nature of it, the pace of it, you have to take these growing economies seriously, and help them and I just didn't see Paris getting to that end, in any efficient or constructive manner."" In the wake of the President's announcement back in 2017, a number of states and businesses have pledged to continue cutting carbon and to try and make up for the Federal government's decision to walk away from the US commitment under Paris. Among them areAmerica's Pledge,external, put together by former California governor Jerry Brown and the former mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg. They say that states and cities will help cut US emissions by 19% compared to 2025 from what they were in 2005 - that's not enough to make up for the US promise under Paris but it keeps those targets ""within reach"". At UN climate talks, groups representing states and cities that want to remain in the Paris pact have made their presence felt ""The public understands that fighting climate change goes hand in hand with protecting our health and growing our economy,"" said Michael Bloomberg in a statement. ""So despite the White House's best efforts to drag our country backward, it hasn't stopped our climate progress over the past four years."" On the business front, there has been growing pressure from shareholders of large fossil fuel-based industries to face up to the climate challenge. A proposal filed by BNP Paribas Asset Management won a 53% majority vote at Chevron - it called on the oil giant to ensure that its climate lobbying was in line with the goals of the Paris agreement. ""I don't think anyone will follow Mr Trump out of Paris,"" said Peter Betts, a former lead negotiator for the UK and the EU in the global climate negotiations, and now an associate fellow atChatham House,external. ""Nobody has in the last four years and I don't think they will in the future."" Some are worried that the US withdrawal will see other countries adopt a go-slow attitude, at a time when scientists are saying that efforts should be speeded up. China's President Xi speaking to the UN on climate change, seen on an outdoor screen in Beijing A number of countries, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russiahave already shown a willingness to side with US effortsto push back on the science around global warming. ""They are biding their time, they are saying that if the US is not in then we don't need to rush to do anything at this time',"" said Carlos Fuller, lead negotiator from the Alliance of Small Island States. ""I think they are hedging their bets to see what kind of a better deal they can get out of it, and not actually withdraw."" Others are hopeful that the US withdrawal will drive a sense of unity among others, and see new leadership emerge. ""The EU green deal andcarbon neutrality commitments from China, Japan and South Korea point to the inevitability of our collective transition off fossil fuels,"" said Laurence Tubiana, one of the architects of the Paris agreement and now chief executive of theEuropean Climate Foundation,external. ""There were always going to be speed bumps as the global economy shifted off oil, gas and coal - but the overall direction of travel is clear. As governments prepare stimulus packages to rescue their economies from covid-19 it's vital they invest in technologies of the future, not the past.""

"Marks & Spencer sank to the first loss in its 94 years as a publicly-listed company as the coronavirus crisis hit trading. In the six months to 26 September, the retailer made a loss of Â£87.6m, compared with profits of Â£158.8m in the same period last year. But chief executive Steve Rowe said the firm's performance had been ""much more robust than at first seemed possible"". In August M&S announcedit was set to cut 7,000 jobs over three months. Sales for the six-month period across the group slid by 15.8% to Â£4.09bn - largely impacted by lower clothing and home sales. Clothing sales in particular were dented by lockdowns and the desire for more casual clothes, the firm said. Between July and September, clothing sales in its city centre stores, for example, were down by 53%. However, M&S does anticipate that demand for more formal clothes and occasion-wear will return, it said in a statement. Small shops better at surviving virus than big ones Ocado says M&S switchover 'successful' after rocky start Shoppers defy economic gloom in September Catherine Shuttleworth, retail analyst and chief executive at retail marketing agency Savvy, told the BBC: ""Marks and Spencer is committed to the High Street, but that comes at an enormous cost. ""Its 600 stores were closed [during lockdown], they've picked up on online and online sales are stronger than they've ever been. But that in no way covers the amount of sales loss they've covered this year."" ""You've got to change to survive. While Marks was saying it, they weren't necessarily doing it, but it has now changed the way they work even at a simple level."" The group also reported strong growth in its Ocado Retail joint venture, which started delivering M&S food at the start of September. It said the partnership has reported a 47.9% jump in sales, while profitability has also improved. M&S created over 750 new lines including in grocery and homecare to broaden its appeal on the Ocado platform, which previously delivered for Waitrose. M&S was one of the few big food retailers without its own internet-based delivery service, and the tie-up with Ocado had been described as a key moment in the retailer's shift to online. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said that M&S ""is already reaping the rewards of an excellent partnership with Ocado. ""Its food business could benefit from the forthcoming national lockdown [in England] as consumers look for high-quality meals as an alternative to going out. ""This could help it counter the effects of fewer people grabbing a sandwich while nipping out of the office for lunch,"" she said. M&S also said its grocery business had performed ""strongly"" over the half-year, with like-for-like sales rising by 2.7% on the back of substantial growth from its Simply Food stores. Ms Palmer added: ""M&S has an opportunity to step up and sit at the table with the big players in the retail market once more, but to stake its claim, it can't just bring food to the party, it has to dress better and provide the furniture too."" Detractors have often described M&S as the lame duck of UK retail, forever struggling to reinvent itself quickly enough to keep up with changing consumer tastes. Its current management, however, will hope that this set of results will persuade investors that a more apt comparison would be with another bird, the phoenix. Today's loss is the ashes from which the management hopes a new, slimmed-down and digital-savvy M&S will emerge. Steve Rowe talks of the pandemic having forced the company to compress three years' of changes into a single year - a hint, perhaps that the crisis may have come by chance at a good time in his plan to revive the company's fortunes. There are signs that the big bet on a commercial alliance with Ocado is paying off, but the Achilles heel remains weak sales in clothing and general merchandise. M&S shares were up more than 4% in early trading, suggesting that investors may discern the first flaps of the phoenix's wings. The update came as M&S continues to push forward with its transformation strategy. The plans, which saw M&S announce 7,000 job cuts across stores and management in August, will enable the business to emerge from the crisis in a ""stronger, leaner and more focused position"", the firm said in a statement. The half-year results included a Â£92m exceptional cost reflecting these cuts. The group said it would also see further charges of up to Â£120m due to store closures over the next seven years. In a call with journalists, Mr Rowe said: ""My goal remains unchanged - that is to deliver the long-term transformation for M&S, building a brand that is more digital in a world that will never be the same again."" ""We know the challenges we're facing will continue,"" he added, citing the upcoming lockdown in England, but said the firm was in a ""much better position"" as the key Christmas trading period approaches.

"Marks & Spencer sank to the first loss in its 94 years as a publicly-listed company as the coronavirus crisis hit trading. In the six months to 26 September, the retailer made a loss of Â£87.6m, compared with profits of Â£158.8m in the same period last year. But chief executive Steve Rowe said the firm's performance had been ""much more robust than at first seemed possible"". In August M&S announcedit was set to cut 7,000 jobs over three months. Sales for the six-month period across the group slid by 15.8% to Â£4.09bn - largely impacted by lower clothing and home sales. Clothing sales in particular were dented by lockdowns and the desire for more casual clothes, the firm said. Between July and September, clothing sales in its city centre stores, for example, were down by 53%. However, M&S does anticipate that demand for more formal clothes and occasion-wear will return, it said in a statement. Small shops better at surviving virus than big ones Ocado says M&S switchover 'successful' after rocky start Shoppers defy economic gloom in September Catherine Shuttleworth, retail analyst and chief executive at retail marketing agency Savvy, told the BBC: ""Marks and Spencer is committed to the High Street, but that comes at an enormous cost. ""Its 600 stores were closed [during lockdown], they've picked up on online and online sales are stronger than they've ever been. But that in no way covers the amount of sales loss they've covered this year."" ""You've got to change to survive. While Marks was saying it, they weren't necessarily doing it, but it has now changed the way they work even at a simple level."" The group also reported strong growth in its Ocado Retail joint venture, which started delivering M&S food at the start of September. It said the partnership has reported a 47.9% jump in sales, while profitability has also improved. M&S created over 750 new lines including in grocery and homecare to broaden its appeal on the Ocado platform, which previously delivered for Waitrose. M&S was one of the few big food retailers without its own internet-based delivery service, and the tie-up with Ocado had been described as a key moment in the retailer's shift to online. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said that M&S ""is already reaping the rewards of an excellent partnership with Ocado. ""Its food business could benefit from the forthcoming national lockdown [in England] as consumers look for high-quality meals as an alternative to going out. ""This could help it counter the effects of fewer people grabbing a sandwich while nipping out of the office for lunch,"" she said. M&S also said its grocery business had performed ""strongly"" over the half-year, with like-for-like sales rising by 2.7% on the back of substantial growth from its Simply Food stores. Ms Palmer added: ""M&S has an opportunity to step up and sit at the table with the big players in the retail market once more, but to stake its claim, it can't just bring food to the party, it has to dress better and provide the furniture too."" Detractors have often described M&S as the lame duck of UK retail, forever struggling to reinvent itself quickly enough to keep up with changing consumer tastes. Its current management, however, will hope that this set of results will persuade investors that a more apt comparison would be with another bird, the phoenix. Today's loss is the ashes from which the management hopes a new, slimmed-down and digital-savvy M&S will emerge. Steve Rowe talks of the pandemic having forced the company to compress three years' of changes into a single year - a hint, perhaps that the crisis may have come by chance at a good time in his plan to revive the company's fortunes. There are signs that the big bet on a commercial alliance with Ocado is paying off, but the Achilles heel remains weak sales in clothing and general merchandise.

"Students in cities across England could begin a mass exodus back to their families ahead of new lockdown measures coming into force on Thursday. Hilary Gyebi-Ababio, National Union of Students vice president for higher education, said students were ""really wanting to go home"". ""There's a sense there could be a mass exodus,"" she told the BBC. It comes after Universities Minister Michelle Donelan urged students, in a letter on Monday, not to ""rush home"". Her message aimed to prevent these young people from travelling across the country to their families and potentially taking coronavirus with them, thus fuelling the pandemic. What can you do during England's new lockdown? Students told not to rush home for lockdown Student lockdown: Should I stay or should I go? Those in tier 3 restriction areas are not allowed by law to visit other households, which would include their family homes, but those in lower tier areas do not face the same restrictions until Thursday when the new lockdown rules come into force. The NUS and the lecturers' union, UCU, have repeated a joint demand for all university teaching to move online, as much as possible, saying not to do so would cause a public health emergency New government guidance published on Tuesday says some face-to-face teaching should continue. But thousands of students have spent several weeks of this term effectively locked down already, self-isolating due to real or suspected Covid-19 cases in their halls of residence. Ms Gyebi-Ababio, 22, said: ""We are really concerned about the the minister's statement, saying don't go home. ""It's not healthy or considerate to students."" She said students really wanted to do what was safe for others and right for them, and that it was important that they were allowed to have agency and make their own decisions. She pointed out that the prime minister had said other members of the public could move to be in new households before the new lockdown measures come into force. Many students did not have the usual support networks of friends, she said, or the formal support usually provided by universities, huge parts of which are closed. ""It's been really difficult for students - they do not have one ounce of certainty about what might happen."" She said the NUS was hearing from students who were ""worried and confused right now"", and this was only to be expected as they had not had any clear information. ""My younger brother is at university now, and I've had so many phone calls from him asking what he should do."" In some universities, students are reporting empty rooms in halls of residence which some students have already vacated. Archaeology lecturer at University of Leicester, Dr Rachel Crellin, tweeted: ""I've just taught: some students have been told to come home by their parents, some worried about being trapped alone in accommodation, others who don't want to take Covid home to vulnerable family and some who don't want to go home. ""This is causing chaos."" Ms Gyebi-Ababio said the government had talked weeks ago about a  ""mandatory two-week lockdown"" to enable students to return home for Christmas but there were still no details about this. She added: ""After this four-week lockdown, students could be locked down for a further two weeks - that's a total of six. This could be really detrimental to their wellbeing and mental health."" Many students work while they study, to support themselves, but as in the previous spring lockdown, many had lost their jobs and were facing financial hardship, she said, and the government should have reflected on what happened then.

"John Lewis Partnership and Lloyds Banking Group have announced plans to cut many hundreds of jobs. John Lewis, which also runs Waitrose supermarkets, says it will axe up to 1,500 jobs at its head office as it makes further cost cuts. It says the move will help it to save another Â£50m as it looks to make Â£300m in annual savings by 2022. Meanwhile, Lloyds is cutting a further 730 jobs as part of a major restructuring programme. The proposed John Lewis Partnership cuts will be made across the two head offices in London Victoria and Bracknell, where John Lewis employs about 5,000 people. They will come in two phases, the first of which will begin immediately. The second phase will be completed by April 2021. John Lewis said it would seek to find new roles for staff and, if that is not possible, will offer redundancy support and retraining funds for those with more than two years service. Partnership chairman Sharon White has set out a five-year recovery plan for the group, which like other retailers has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. In July, the department store divisionsaid it would shut eight shops, putting 1,300 jobs at risk, and close four Waitrose stores, with the loss of 124 jobs. In September, the group told staff they would not receive a bonus for the first time since 1953 after it dived to a Â£635m pre-tax loss for the six months to July, following a Â£470m writedown on its stores. The cuts at Lloyds Banking Group will mainly affect staff in its group transformation and retail banking teams, and will result in no further bank closures, it said. Lloyds employees to work from home until spring Lloyds Bank and Pizza Hut cut more than 1,000 jobs John Lewis and Boots to cut 5,300 jobs A Lloyds Banking Group spokeswoman said: ""This morning we shared changes to some of our teams. ""These changes reflect our ongoing plans to continue to meet our customers' changing needs and make parts of our business simpler. ""The majority of colleagues briefed today will not leave until January at the earliest."" The Unite union said the move was ""shameful"", and that the decision was taken despite recent strong results. It called for the bank to postpone restructuring amid the rising threat of Covid-19. ""Unite cannot comprehend why Lloyds Banking Group would choose to cut 1,000 staff who have given the bank such commitment and dedication during a global pandemic,"" said Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer. Lloyds posted forecast-beating quarterly profits last month after cashing in on a coronavirus-driven boom in demand for mortgages. But in July the bank warned that lockdown washaving a greater economic shock than expected. In September, Lloydssaid it planned to cut 865 jobs, mainly in its insurance, wealth and retail teams.

"Clinically extremely vulnerable people in England are being strongly advised not to go to work outside their homes during lockdown from Thursday. Underupdated government guidance,external, they should only go out for exercise and to attend health appointments. People with stage-five chronic kidney disease, those undergoing dialysis and adults with Down's syndrome are now also advised to follow the advice. This group is at higher risk from Covid-19 than the general population.

Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation said the guidance was ""a step forward"" but had given people less than 24 hours to prepare for the changes to their lives.

"MPs will vote later on the plan for a four-week lockdown in England. The restrictions, which include the closure of pubs, restaurants gyms and non-essential shops, will come into force after midnight if approved. It comes as the head of NHS England warned there are 11,000 coronavirus patients in hospital in England - up from 2,000 at the start of October. Sir Simon Stevens also said the NHS would be ""geared up"" to deliver a potential vaccine before Christmas. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told business leaders the lockdown, which is due to end on 2 December, will not be extended beyond that date. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Sir Simon said there had been a ""very substantial"" increase in ""desperately sick patients in hospitals"" in October. He said: ""So, put another way, we've got 22 hospitals' worth of coronavirus patients across England. ""And indeed, even since Saturday, when the prime minister gave his press conference, we filled another two hospitals full of severely ill coronavirus patients."" 'Destructive' rules only current option - Whitty What are the new lockdown rules for England? City-wide Covid testing to be piloted in Liverpool A number of Conservative MPs have criticised the nationwide lockdown. But Labour's support for the new measures mean they are highly likely to be approved, even if there is a rebellion from Tory backbenchers. Sir Simon said the actions taken by Parliament would mean the health service should be able to avoid postponing routine operations. He also said the NHS would be writing to GP practices this week to get them prepared to deliver a vaccine by Christmas, if one becomes available. Sir Simon said: ""There are over 200 vaccines in development and we believe that we should hopefully get one or more of those available from the first part of next year. ""In anticipation of that, we're also gearing the NHS up to be ready to make a start on administering Covid vaccines before Christmas, if they become available."" Sir Simon later told a briefing the NHS's ""central expectation"" was that a vaccine would be possible by the start of next year. He said: ""The bulk of this is likely to be the other side of Christmas, but we want to be ready in the event that those optimistic signs you've been hearing about come to pass. "" And he suggested that all patient-facing NHS staff would soon be given routine testing, regardless of symptoms. Meg and Matt, pictured with their daughter, got married this week after twice moving the date Meanwhile, Mr Johnson apologised to businesses for the ""nightmare"" Covid situation. In a pre-recorded speech to the Confederation of British Industry's annual conference, the prime minister said the restrictions went ""against every free market instinct I possess"". ""And, believe me, we will end these autumn measures on 2 December when they expire,"" he added. A number of shops have been extending their opening hours ahead of the lockdown Ahead of the expected new restrictions, a number of retailers and other businesses areextending their opening hoursto meet a surge in demand. From Thursday, non-essential retailers and other businesses including hairdressers will be required to close until the lockdown is lifted.

Andupdated guidance has been published for those deemed to be extremely vulnerable,external, including advice that people should not attend work if they cannot do it from home. The extremely vulnerable group has been expanded to also include adults with Down's Syndrome. The advice also says that most children originally on the shielded patient list no longer need to be because of the very low risk of them becoming sick from coronavirus, and can therefore attend school. Labourfirst called for a short lockdown or ""circuit-breaker"" in England last monthand have criticised the government for not acting quickly or decisively enough. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said that Labour's support will be enough to deter some Tories who have criticised the measures from rebelling, because they would see it as a ""senseless sacrifice"". ""A relatively small number, however, will still vote against their own government,"" our correspondent said. The BBC has been told that former chief whip Mark Harper, who has openly criticised NHS Test and Trace, is expected to be among them. A very senior Tory privately described the handling of the pandemic as a farce. Others have been pushing for an economic assessment of the lockdown to be published, and several MPs questioned the data informing the government's decisions. On Tuesday, Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, defended lockdowns, telling MPsthey were the only practical option to stem the spread of Covid-19until a vaccine and better drugs become available. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty says the three-tier system of restrictions has âslowed things down"". Among the Conservative MPs to criticise the nationwide lockdown during a parliamentary debate on Tuesday was Richard Drax, who said they were ""destructive, divisive, and don't work"". ""They simply delay the inevitable - the re-emergence of the virus when lockdown ends, as has been shown,"" he said. ""Have we over-reacted? Yes, I think we have. A draconian, onerous and invasive set of rules and regulations now govern our very existence."" Meanwhile, Commons Health Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt said it would be ""quite unforgivable"" if the UK this winter saw similar levels of Covid transmission in hospitals as experienced during the first coronavirus wave. Speaking to Today, he called for more routine testing of NHS staff to be carried out. PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages?

"McDonald's said the store will create more than 65 jobs in the community England's only McDonald's-free county is no more, as a branch of the fast food chain has opened. Rutland, in the East Midlands, had escaped the lure of the golden arches butplans to build a diner and drive-thru were approved in January. The restaurant, based on the outskirts of Oakham, will move to a drive-thru only service on Thursday as the country goes into a second lockdown. McDonald's said the store will create more than 65 jobs in the community. Before Rutland County Council approved the plan for the fast food chain, there was some resistance among residents. County to get first McDonald's as plan is approved England's only county without a McDonald's Among the 55 objections made to the authority, one person wrote: ""I'm proud Rutland is the only county not to have a McDonald's."" Several others expressed concerns about the impact a McDonald's would have on smaller, independent, businesses in Oakham. Oakham is a market town with prestigious schools and traditional buildings But landlady of the Crown Tavern, Lindsay Taylor, said once lockdown had lifted, it ""could bring people to Oakham and help shops on the high street"". ""At the end of the day people are worried about littering and that sort of stuff, but that's not McDonald's fault,"" she said. ""People think we live in a posh area, as it's Rutland, but there's a split."" Franchise owner Glyn Pashley, who operates the new restaurant, said he was ""delighted to be opening in Oakham"" and holding the mantle of ""the first [McDonald's] restaurant in Rutland"". Oakham's mayor David Romney officially opened the restaurant at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. He said: ""It was getting very busy when I left, which was nice to see. There were no planning grounds for this not to go ahead and I think, in terms of the employment and visitors it will provide, it will be a win-win situation for the town."" Paul Stainton saw up to 30 cars in the drive-thru on the morning McDonald's opened in Rutland Paul Stainton, who lives in Stretton, Rutland, drove past the new McDonald's earlier said it was ""very busy"". ""I'd say there were probably 25 to 30 cars in the drive-thru, the restaurant was busy, there were people sat outside in the sunshine - it looks like it's got off to a pretty good start,"" he said. Mr Stainton didn't have any issues with the restaurant being built in his local area and said it looks ""quite swanky"". ""I think it's a balancing act between the tradition of Rutland and also the fact that people need jobs. ""To be fair, it makes a scruffy little area of Rutland look quite nice,"" he said. Some of those opposing the new McDonald's had suggested using the space for something ""more healthy"" One of those that is unlikely to join the drive-thru queue is Charlie Pallett, also known as the Rutland Blogger. She said the absence of a McDonald's in the county was a ""quirk"" that had now gone. ""We've got one everywhere else around us within a 10 to 15-minute drive so I don't think we need it,"" she said. She supported the idea of using the space for something ""more healthy"". ""There were quite a lot of people that would have liked to have seen something more active there for children could do - a trampoline park or something like that,"" she said. ""Obviously, now with Covid I don't know if that would have been able to happen or not."" However, Ms Pallett said she could not dispute the benefit of the extra jobs in the area. ""That's fantastic, especially during the circumstances at the moment,"" she said. Rutland lies between Leicestershire and Lincolnshire and has a population of 39,500 The county's Latin motto, Multum in Parvo, means ""much in little"" The average house price is Â£327,000 - almost Â£100,000 above the national average, according to the Land Registry It has returned Conservative MPs to Parliament with comfortable majorities since the seat was created in 1983.

"This video can not be played Eyewitness Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister talks about the 2 November Vienna attack Austrian police have carried out a series of raids and made 14 arrests after a gunman murdered four people in the heart of Vienna on Monday. The man, described as a 20-year-old Islamist terrorist who had been freed from jail last December, was shot dead by police as he fired on passers-by. Security has been tight in the Austrian capital as police launched a manhunt for any further attackers. But authorities now believe the gunman may have acted alone. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the four who died were an elderly woman, an elderly man, a young man and a waitress. Another 22 people were wounded. One of the women who died was German, Germany's foreign minister said. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said there was no indication that a second assailant had been involved, though that could no be ruled out. Police were still assessing some 20,000 mobile phone videos of what happened. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed in a video on its online propaganda channel that it was behind the attacks, without providing any evidence. Security remained high in Vienna as authorities suggested the attacker may have acted alone The attacks began at 20:00 (19:00 GMT) on Monday, opposite the main synagogue in a pedestrian alley called Seitenstettengasse, and continued until the gunman was shot dead at 20:09. Police identified a total of six crime scenes in the area. It was clearly an attack driven by ""hatred of our way of life, our democracy"", Chancellor Kurz said. Nine minutes of murder in Vienna: What we know Three days of national mourning have begun, with flags flying at half mast. Children - those in Vienna were kept at home for safety on Tuesday - will observe a minute's silence at school on Wednesday. The UK raised its terrorism alert levelto ""severe"", from ""substantial"", meaning an attack is highly likely, but no specific intelligence points to one. It has also emerged that a police officer who was shot and wounded by the gunman was taken to safety by two men of Turkish descent. ""I took his legs, he took his shoulders, the police were there too of course and helped, and we quickly got him to the ambulance,"" Mikail Ãzen, a personal trainer and mixed martial arts fighter, told journalists. Mr Nehammer praised them, saying ""more than ever: if people think that they can divide our society with violence, terror and fear it's important to stand together"". 'Heroes' praised for helping Vienna attack victims He said 14 people linked to the gunman had been arrested in the Vienna area, the town of St PÃ¶lten and the city of Linz. Two Swiss citizens - men aged 18 and 24 - were also arrested in Winterthur near Zurich, suspected of links to the gunman. This video can not be played ""This was one of the scariest moments in my life"" Earlier, Mr Nehammer described the gunman as an ""Islamist terrorist"" named Kujtim Fejzulai, who had been jailed for 22 months in April 2019 for trying to travel to Syria to join IS jihadists. He was released early in December under more lenient terms for young adults, after convincing the authorities that he no longer held extremist Islamist views, Mr Nehammer said. Originally from North Macedonia, he had both Austrian and Macedonian citizenship. He had posted a photo on a social media, showing himself with weapons, before the attack, the minister said. Police searched his home and seized video material. As well as being heavily armed, he was wearing a fake explosive belt, police said. Mr Nehammer said the gunman opened fire with a shortened Kalashnikov assault rifle, but was also armed with a machete and a pistol. In pictures: Scene of gun attack in Vienna Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat The attack came hours before Austria imposed new national restrictions to try to stem rising cases of coronavirus. Many people were enjoying having a drink or eating out before a midnight curfew. Elsewhere in Europe, France has suffered a spate of Islamist militant attacks recently, involving ""lone wolf"" jihadists. The gunman had posted a photo showing himself with weapons before the attack, the interior minister said Last month French history teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded outside a school in a suburb of Paris by a Chechen youth, who was then shot dead by police. As the French government launched new measures to tackle militant Islam, a Tunisian man fatally stabbed three people in a cathedral in Nice. The worst IS attack in Europe in recent years was in November 2015, when gunmen killed 130 people in Paris.

"MPs will vote later on the plan for a four-week lockdown in England. The restrictions, which include the closure of pubs, restaurants gyms and non-essential shops, will come into force after midnight if approved. It comes as the head of NHS England warned there are 11,000 coronavirus patients in hospital in England - up from 2,000 at the start of October. Sir Simon Stevens also said the NHS would be ""geared up"" to deliver a potential vaccine before Christmas. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told business leaders the lockdown, which is due to end on 2 December, will not be extended beyond that date. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Sir Simon said there had been a ""very substantial"" increase in ""desperately sick patients in hospitals"" in October. He said: ""So, put another way, we've got 22 hospitals' worth of coronavirus patients across England. ""And indeed, even since Saturday, when the prime minister gave his press conference, we filled another two hospitals full of severely ill coronavirus patients."" 'Destructive' rules only current option - Whitty What are the new lockdown rules for England? City-wide Covid testing to be piloted in Liverpool A number of Conservative MPs have criticised the nationwide lockdown. But Labour's support for the new measures mean they are highly likely to be approved, even if there is a rebellion from Tory backbenchers. Sir Simon said the actions taken by Parliament would mean the health service should be able to avoid postponing routine operations. He also said the NHS would be writing to GP practices this week to get them prepared to deliver a vaccine by Christmas, if one becomes available. Sir Simon said: ""There are over 200 vaccines in development and we believe that we should hopefully get one or more of those available from the first part of next year. ""In anticipation of that, we're also gearing the NHS up to be ready to make a start on administering Covid vaccines before Christmas, if they become available."" Sir Simon later told a briefing the NHS's ""central expectation"" was that a vaccine would be possible by the start of next year. He said: ""The bulk of this is likely to be the other side of Christmas, but we want to be ready in the event that those optimistic signs you've been hearing about come to pass. "" And he suggested that all patient-facing NHS staff would soon be given routine testing, regardless of symptoms. Meg and Matt, pictured with their daughter, got married this week after twice moving the date Meanwhile, Mr Johnson apologised to businesses for the ""nightmare"" Covid situation. In a pre-recorded speech to the Confederation of British Industry's annual conference, the prime minister said the restrictions went ""against every free market instinct I possess"". ""And, believe me, we will end these autumn measures on 2 December when they expire,"" he added. A number of shops have been extending their opening hours ahead of the lockdown Ahead of the expected new restrictions, a number of retailers and other businesses areextending their opening hoursto meet a surge in demand.

Andupdated guidance has been published for those deemed to be extremely vulnerable,external, including advice that people should not attend work if they cannot do it from home. The extremely vulnerable group has been expanded to also include adults with Down's Syndrome. The advice also says that most children originally on the shielded patient list no longer need to be because of the very low risk of them becoming sick from coronavirus, and can therefore attend school. Labourfirst called for a short lockdown or ""circuit-breaker"" in England last monthand have criticised the government for not acting quickly or decisively enough. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said that Labour's support will be enough to deter some Tories who have criticised the measures from rebelling, because they would see it as a ""senseless sacrifice"". ""A relatively small number, however, will still vote against their own government,"" our correspondent said. The BBC has been told that former chief whip Mark Harper, who has openly criticised NHS Test and Trace, is expected to be among them. A very senior Tory privately described the handling of the pandemic as a farce. Others have been pushing for an economic assessment of the lockdown to be published, and several MPs questioned the data informing the government's decisions. On Tuesday, Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, defended lockdowns, telling MPsthey were the only practical option to stem the spread of Covid-19until a vaccine and better drugs become available. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty says the three-tier system of restrictions has âslowed things down"". Among the Conservative MPs to criticise the nationwide lockdown during a parliamentary debate on Tuesday was Richard Drax, who said they were ""destructive, divisive, and don't work"". ""They simply delay the inevitable - the re-emergence of the virus when lockdown ends, as has been shown,"" he said. ""Have we over-reacted? Yes, I think we have. A draconian, onerous and invasive set of rules and regulations now govern our very existence."" Meanwhile, Commons Health Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt said it would be ""quite unforgivable"" if the UK this winter saw similar levels of Covid transmission in hospitals as experienced during the first coronavirus wave. Speaking to Today, he called for more routine testing of NHS staff to be carried out. PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages?

"Marks & Spencer sank to the first loss in its 94 years as a publicly-listed company as the coronavirus crisis hit trading. In the six months to 26 September, the retailer made a loss of Â£87.6m, compared with profits of Â£158.8m in the same period last year. But chief executive Steve Rowe said the firm's performance had been ""much more robust than at first seemed possible"". In August M&S announcedit was set to cut 7,000 jobs over three months. Sales for the six-month period across the group slid by 15.8% to Â£4.09bn - largely impacted by lower clothing and home sales. Clothing sales in particular were dented by lockdowns and the desire for more casual clothes, the firm said. Between July and September, clothing sales in its city centre stores, for example, were down by 53%. However, M&S does anticipate that demand for more formal clothes and occasion-wear will return, it said in a statement. Small shops better at surviving virus than big ones Ocado says M&S switchover 'successful' after rocky start Shoppers defy economic gloom in September Catherine Shuttleworth, retail analyst and chief executive at retail marketing agency Savvy, told the BBC: ""Marks and Spencer is committed to the High Street, but that comes at an enormous cost. ""Its 600 stores were closed [during lockdown], they've picked up on online and online sales are stronger than they've ever been. But that in no way covers the amount of sales loss they've covered this year."" ""You've got to change to survive. While Marks was saying it, they weren't necessarily doing it, but it has now changed the way they work even at a simple level."" The group also reported strong growth in its Ocado Retail joint venture, which started delivering M&S food at the start of September. It said the partnership has reported a 47.9% jump in sales, while profitability has also improved. M&S created over 750 new lines including in grocery and homecare to broaden its appeal on the Ocado platform, which previously delivered for Waitrose. M&S was one of the few big food retailers without its own internet-based delivery service, and the tie-up with Ocado had been described as a key moment in the retailer's shift to online. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said that M&S ""is already reaping the rewards of an excellent partnership with Ocado. ""Its food business could benefit from the forthcoming national lockdown [in England] as consumers look for high-quality meals as an alternative to going out. ""This could help it counter the effects of fewer people grabbing a sandwich while nipping out of the office for lunch,"" she said. M&S also said its grocery business had performed ""strongly"" over the half-year, with like-for-like sales rising by 2.7% on the back of substantial growth from its Simply Food stores. Ms Palmer added: ""M&S has an opportunity to step up and sit at the table with the big players in the retail market once more, but to stake its claim, it can't just bring food to the party, it has to dress better and provide the furniture too."" Detractors have often described M&S as the lame duck of UK retail, forever struggling to reinvent itself quickly enough to keep up with changing consumer tastes. Its current management, however, will hope that this set of results will persuade investors that a more apt comparison would be with another bird, the phoenix. Today's loss is the ashes from which the management hopes a new, slimmed-down and digital-savvy M&S will emerge. Steve Rowe talks of the pandemic having forced the company to compress three years' of changes into a single year - a hint, perhaps that the crisis may have come by chance at a good time in his plan to revive the company's fortunes. There are signs that the big bet on a commercial alliance with Ocado is paying off, but the Achilles heel remains weak sales in clothing and general merchandise. M&S shares were up more than 4% in early trading, suggesting that investors may discern the first flaps of the phoenix's wings. The update came as M&S continues to push forward with its transformation strategy. The plans, which saw M&S announce 7,000 job cuts across stores and management in August, will enable the business to emerge from the crisis in a ""stronger, leaner and more focused position"", the firm said in a statement. The half-year results included a Â£92m exceptional cost reflecting these cuts. The group said it would also see further charges of up to Â£120m due to store closures over the next seven years. In a call with journalists, Mr Rowe said: ""My goal remains unchanged - that is to deliver the long-term transformation for M&S, building a brand that is more digital in a world that will never be the same again."" ""We know the challenges we're facing will continue,"" he added, citing the upcoming lockdown in England, but said the firm was in a ""much better position"" as the key Christmas trading period approaches.

"Small retailers have suffered fewer closures than big firms Independent shops have been ""more agile"" and better at surviving Covid-19 than chain stores, data indicates. Small independent firms on the High Street suffered a net decline of 1,833 stores in the first half of 2020, according to research by the Local Data Company (LDC) and accountancy firm PwC. That was less than a third ofthe 6,001 chain stores lost, the LDC said. However, the two sectors together saw the biggest decline seen in the first half of a year since its records began. Lucy Stainton, head of retail and strategic partnerships at the LDC, said it had been ""an immensely challenging few months for the retail and hospitality sector"". She said the independent market had fared better as those businesses had been ""more agile, bringing in new product lines and offering food deliveries"". They also had a smaller cost base to cover during periods of little or no trade and had been able to take advantage of government support schemes. ""However, as we continue through the year with various local lockdowns and restrictions, life will not get any easier for operators,"" she added. ""These figures mark only the first phase in the impact of the pandemic on the retail economy this year, with 20% of the market still temporarily shut and with more months of difficult trading conditions ahead."" Coronavirus drives shop closures to new record During the period surveyed, there were 20,019 closures of independent shops and 18,186 openings. That compares with 11,120 chain-store closures and 5,119 openings. Put together, that gives 31,139 closures and a net decrease of 7,834 shops. In percentage terms, the gap between big and small retailers is even greater, since 64% of the retail and leisure market is comprised of independent businesses, according to the LDC. That means independent businesses declined by 0.54%, compared with 2.77% for the chain units. The LDC and PwC have been analysing the changes in the top 500 shopping locations for the past decade. The LDC said its latest surveys covered the January-to-August period, to compensate for a short time during lockdown when its researchers were unable to work. However, it said that it had surveyed the same number of units as in a normal first-half period and that its figures were comparable to those of previous years.

"Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer faced each other in the Commons for this week's PMQs Sir Keir challenged the PM on test and trace SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford challenged the PM to clarify if full furlough support would be available for future lockdown in Scotland Mr Johnson insisted the month-long lockdown in England 'will expire on 2 December' The Labour leader said it would be 'madness' to go back to the tiered system if infections were rising MPs will vote later to rubber stamp England's four week coronavirus lockdown New restrictions will come in to force from 00:01 on Thursday Labour will support the government but some Tory MPs are expected to vote against the measures Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he has ""full faith"" US institutions will produce a ""definitive result"" in the US presidential election Gavin Stamp and Kate Whannel BBC Politics We'll pause our coverage of PMQs for this week. Thanks for following along with us. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Boris Johnson was
challenged in Prime Ministerâs Questions about the UKâs Internal Market Bill,
and how it could complicate relations with the United States - if Joe Biden
were to win the Presidential election. Mr Biden has
never been a fan of Brexit and his
view would be closer to the European - and more specifically the Irish view of
what it means. Donald Trump has also listened to Irish concerns about
Brexit. But he has always made it clear that he is comfortable with a more
radical split between the UK and the rest of Europe. Biden has already warned that the Internal Market Bill, which allows
the government to ignore specific obligations on Northern Ireland contained in
the Brexit withdrawal agreement, could have a negative impact on efforts to
agree a free trade deal between the UK and the US. âWe canât allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to
Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit,â Mr Biden said in a tweet in September,
referring to the 1998 agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland. He made his comments after details of the Internal Market
Bill were first published. âAny trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent,â Mr
Biden said, âupon respect for the Agreement and preventing the return of a hard
border. Period.â Boris Johnson of course argues that he is not trying to undermine the
Good Friday agreement, simply to maintain the integrity of the United Kingdom. If there were to be a Biden
administration, they might not see things in quite
the same way. Reality Check At PMQs, Labour leader Sir Keir
Starmer called on the prime minister âto fix test and traceâ during Englandâs
four-week lockdown. Sir Keir criticised NHS Test and Trace data, saying âthe majority of people
still donât get results within 24 hoursâ. He was correct. In the
week to 21 October, only 11.3% of all pillar 2 test results - testing in the community - were received in the 24 hours after the swab was taken. But
the number of test results received within 24 hours was an improvement on the
previous week, where the figure was as low as 6.7%. The labs processing tests do
not, however, operate 24 hours a day and, therefore,
a more reliable measure of turnaround times is the number of results received at some point on the day after the
test. On this
count, 46.5% of results were received on the day after the test was taken.  Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Trying to respond to what's going on in the United
States at the moment is for the government equivalent of handling a grenade
with the pin pulled. They don't know what the result is going to be, the US
is an enormously important ally, and therefore they want to tread
extremely carefully - not condemning anything, not saying that anything's gone wrong and not giving either the Biden camp or the Trump camp, any sniff of a
hint that they could leave themselves open to the accusation that they were
somehow interfering. That said, it was very uncomfortable for the foreign secretary this morning, when he was asked straightforwardly, about the president's comment that they should stop counting votes. Dominic Raab was so careful that
he didn't want to offend anybody or try to anticipate the result in any
way that he wouldn't even go anywhere near condemning that which is a very
important principle in a democracy. But the reality is this a very, very awkward moment
for the government. There are positives and negatives for this
administration whoever the eventual winner of this is. But a contested, conflicted result makes it very difficult for them to engage. Allow Twitter content?

prime minister told the House of Commons: âTo go from 3,000 tests a day â 2,000
tests a day â to 500,000 is a quite remarkable feat.â Boris
Johnson was talking about the governmentâs target to reach 500,000 daily
testing capacity (the amount of tests labs can process in theory) by the end of
October. The data for 31 October did indeed
show that 525,000 tests could have been done on 31 October, which was a
doubling of capacity in two months, although fewer than 300,000 tests were
actually processed. Officials say it is natural that
all the capacity is not being used up. They say there needs to be flexibility
in the system to cope with surges in demand or problems occurring with
equipment or staff. Youcan read more about the testing target here. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House of CommonsParliament And as the PM leaves the Commons chamber that's it for this week's prime minister's questions. House of CommonsParliament The last question is from Labour's Ruth Jones, who says a more effective test and trace system ""driven by local authorities"" is needed to bring the pandemic under control. The PM says he will not pretend that ""every aspect of NHS Test and Trace has worked in the way I want it to"". But he says the system has achieve some quite remarkable things and co-operation with local government has been strong, including on the rollout of mass testing in Liverpool. House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Mary Kelly Foy, who represents the City of Durham, says the PM's chief aide Dominic Cummings flouted coronavirus regulations when he travelled to the region during the lockdown and undermined public confidence in the rules. The PM disagrees, suggesting what is eroding confidence is the opposition's ""political point scoring"" and says Labour MPs are better served focusing on advising their constituents.  House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Chi Csays her constituent built a private coach business with 18 employees and a Â£1m turnover. She says he can't get grants because coaches are not classed as either tourism or leisure and that banks won't accept his assets for loan guarantees. Boris Johnson replies that the company should be eligible for bounce back loans. When Ms Onwurah shakes her head, he asks her to send him the details of her constituent. Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor Ministers have been under a lot of pressure from SNP to
guarantee that furlough scheme will be available in future if Scotland decides
another lockdown is necessary there. The chancellor will be making statement to MPs
tomorrow and will have to clarify this. House of CommonsParliament The next question is from the SNP MP Carol Monaghan. She makes the same point as her colleague Ian Blackford, calling for a cast-iron guarantee that Scottish firms will have access to the furlough scheme at 80% of wages. The PM repeats his earlier comment that furlough is a UK scheme and ""of course it will be available to the people of Scotland"". House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Natalie Elphicke says it is not long before the UK comes out of the EU transition period. She seeks confirmation that the government will ensure that Dover is kept free from traffic gridlock. Boris Johnson replies that Highways England is developing plans to improve access into Dover.

House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP and former Chancellor Sajid Javid says a report shows that the writing ability of year 7 pupils are 22 months behind expectations. He says ""it is the life chances of the most disadvantage that are hit hardest when schools close"" and asks the PM how he will help those children. Boris Johnson says one on one tutoring is one ""innovative idea"" that has come out of the pandemic. He says he wants to continue providing such support when the pandemic ends. Conservative MP Nusrat Ghani says that following the attack in Vienna the must ""redouble our support for anti-extremism programmes"". She asks the PM if he shares her concerns about a UK-based TV channel Islam TV which she says has been fined by Ofcom for giving air time to preachers who justify anti-Semitism and wife beating? Boris Johnson agrees and says the UK stands shoulder to should with France and Austria ""in our joint war against this abominable ideology"" ""And together we will defeat it."" House of CommonsParliament Now it is the turn of the SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford who starts by inviting the PM to ""condemn"" Donald Trump's comments earlier suggesting his opponents were trying to defraud him of election victory. Moving onto Covid, he asks for a firm commitment that the government will extend the 80% support for wage subsidies through the furlough scheme to Scotland if it goes into lockdown. He says ministers are ""rolling back"" on the promise seemingly made by the Chancellor and PM last week. But the PM says he will not ""budge"" from the commitment. The furlough is a UK-wide scheme and has saved thousands of jobs, he says, adding that Chancellor Rishi Sunak will make a statement on general economic support on Thursday. Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor Labour leader and lots of Conservative MPs want to pin the
PM down on how the government will assess whether lockdown in England has
worked â will it be R rate, case numbers, hospitalisations, deaths? Johnson
reiterates that the measures will definitely be lifted on 2nd December.
Big questions will replace them. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,2.5122668e-05

"It's been three days since the US election. You might have reasonably expected to have some kind of clue about the results by now. We still cannot say, because not enough votes have been counted for either Donald Trump or Joe Biden to claim victory. But the moment we will be able to tell you someone has won does seem to be getting much closer. And results are still coming in. The huge number of postal votes cast during this pandemic election, and different states' laws about how to count them, meant this always was going to take longer if the race was tight. Yes, so far, and by a big margin, but that's not what decides who gets to be president. Instead, a candidate has to win the majority in a system called the electoral college, where each state gets a certain number of votes or ""electors"" roughly in proportion to its population. If you win a state, you win all its votes (except Nebraska and Maine, but that's complicated). There are 538 state votes and the person who gets 270 wins the prize. Mr Biden is on 253 electoral college votes to Mr Trump's 214. There are several ways each of them could reach 270. If Mr Biden gets Pennsylvania, that's all he needs - he is over the line. Georgia and any of Nevada, Arizona or North Carolina works for him too. Mr Trump would need Pennsylvania's votes and to win three states out of Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada or Arizona. So how are they doing in these states? Georgia (16 votes):The story here is about how Mr Biden ate into Mr Trump's lead in a solid Republican state as postal votes and tallies from more Democratic counties came in. Mr Biden has taken a very slim lead in the state and there are still votes to be counted, such as military and overseas votes.  But because the margin is so tight, there is going to be a recount. Pennsylvania (20 votes):There are fewer than 115,000 mail ballots left to count,external, and Mr Biden has now taken the lead. As mail ballots in most places tend to go Democratic, analysts are watching to see how wide this lead gets. Nevada (6 votes):Mr Biden has pulled ahead in Nevada. About 150,000 ballots are yet to be counted, many of them from Clark county, which leans Democratic. Arizona (11 votes):Joe Biden has a lead that is narrowing. Many of those votes still to be counted are from Maricopa County, home to 60% of the state's population - and Mr Trump has been catching up a bit as these votes get counted. Donald Trump has done better than expected and Joe Biden has failed to win those battleground states which count votes quickly, but the Democrat is closing the gap in crucial states as votes get counted. How close are we to knowing the winner? Who has lead in states still counting? How Americans are coping with the long wait What happens if there is a tie, and other questions Election results in full Each state has its own laws and systems for counting votes. Individual states are also in charge of the order in which they count different types of votes - for example postal votes are often counted last. So that makes a difference when Republicans tend to vote in person on the day and postal votes tend to skew Democratic. As there were so many postal votes cast during this pandemic election, this is why we have seen such late dramatic shifts in who leads a race. Another thing to be aware of is that different news outlets have different tallies for each candidate dependingon where they get election data from.So some outlets have called Arizona for Mr Biden, but the BBC thinks it's still not decided. Mr Trump has launched some legal challenges, but analysts suggest most of these challengesconcern small numbers of ballots that might not make a difference in the end,with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Supreme Court previously hinted it could revisit the rules about deadlines for accepting postal votes. Poll officials in Michigan - now projected for Biden - work to tally ballots It now looks like polling data ahead of the election didn't tell us the whole story about the American public. Many observers didn't realise the race would be so tight. Robert Cuffe, the BBC's head of statistics, says it's still too early to say whether this election has been a pollster's nightmare. Final national polls showed Mr Biden leading Mr Trump by about eight points. In battleground states Mr Biden also polled in the lead, but by a much slimmer margin. Currently Mr Biden leads Mr Trump in the share of the popular vote by about three percentage points. Some experts suspect there's a part of the American public which won't even participate in polls because they don't trust institutions - they're more likely to vote for Mr Trump. Voter priorities may have also been slightly misjudged. While the coronavirus pandemic has dominated headlines, a survey conducted by Edison Research found that more voters (a third in total) listed the economy as their key issue - it was a core Trump message. Mr Trump's vote also looks a little bit more diverse than many might have assumed. You can read more about the resultshere.

"Joe Biden has been elected president of the United States, after his projected victory in Pennsylvania took him over the winning line. With all states now projected, President-elect Biden has 306 electoral college votes and Donald Trump has 232. A candidate needs 270 or more to win. Mr Biden will become the 46th president in January, pending the outcome of any legal challenges. There is still a recount to come inGeorgia, but Mr Biden has a lead of almost 15,000 votes and the 16 electoral college votes are not enough to overturn his overall victory. Mr Biden's running mate,Kamala Harris, will make history as the first woman vice-president, as well as the first black and the first Asian American vice-president. Click or tap on the map below to get detailed results. For full results click or tap here,external This map shows where either the Republicans (red arrows) or Democrats (blue arrows) have performed better than in 2016. It is far from a consistent picture, with both parties gaining in some areas and losing support in others. Narrow gains for Mr Biden inGeorgia,Arizona,Michigan,Wisconsinand, crucially,Pennsylvania, were enough for him to flip those states and win the presidency. Unfortunately for Mr Trump, his gains were concentrated in states he already won last time around - for example strongholds such asIdaho,Utah,ArkansasandTennessee. US election results in maps and charts With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Mr Biden has been projected to overturn Mr Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. A strengthening of support in some areas where the Democrats also did well in 2016 - particularly around Philadelphia in the south east corner - has been enough to generate this result. As well as Pennsylvania, Mr Biden also managed to flip four other states that Mr Trump won in 2016 -Wisconsin,Michigan,ArizonaandGeorgia. The first three had been Democrat strongholds for decades before favouring Mr Trump over Hillary Clinton four years ago. Arizona has not been won by a Democrat since Bill Clinton's second term 24 years ago, and Georgia not since Mr Clinton's first win in 1992. In the US electoral system, the results in each state have a widely varying impact on the final result, with states that have larger populations given more say than those with smaller populations. The map below represents each state and the District of Columbia as a square, with its area corresponding to the number of votes its representatives will cast in the electoral college that ultimately decides whether Mr Biden or Mr Trump has won the presidency. It shows that both the Republicans and the Democrats have won their share of larger and smaller states, but Mr Biden has now picked up states worth more than the 270 he needed to win the presidency. Mr Trump managed to hold off challenges from Mr Biden in three of the four biggest battleground states -Texas,FloridaandOhio. But the wins in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania - worth 73 electoral college votes altogether - have been enough for Mr Biden to win the presidency. Preliminary figures show the highest turnout since 1900, with 66.4% of eligible voters turning out compared with 60.1% in 2016. As Mr Biden also leads the national popular vote on 50.8% to Mr Trump's 47.4% - a lead of over five million votes - this boost in participation means that the president-elect has already received more votes than any candidate in US electoral history - close to 78 million so far, with the count continuing in some states. Mr Trump has also increased his vote tally compared with 2016 by more than 9 million votes, to over 72 million this year. Despite being projected to lose the election, this figure gives him the second-highest number of votes of any US presidential candidate. Mr Trump has been projected to win the closely-fought state of Florida, with 51% of the vote compared with Mr Biden's 48%. Despite taking what is typically a bellwether state, Mr Trump failed to win a second term in the White House. Exit poll estimates put Mr Trump on a 61% share of the white vote in Florida. Mr Biden appears to have made up ground on Hillary Clinton's performance with this demographic in 2016. However, Mr Trump is also estimated to have gained 12 points among Latino voters, bringing him nearly level with Mr Biden. Here's how the map coloured up, from the first states to be projected on election night, to Pennsylvania on Saturday. This interactive can only be visible with Javascript enabled. Although the Democrats have made a net gain of one seat in the race for the Senate, the Republicans remain ahead, on 50 seats to the Democrats' 48. Both of the Georgia senate races have gone to a run-off after no candidate secured more than 50% of the votes. There will now be another vote, on 5 January 2021, to separate the two top candidates in each race and determine which party controls the legislature's upper chamber. In the House, despite losing five seats the Democrats have now crossed the winning line of 218 and will retain their majority. There are still 13 seats to declare so the exact size of the majority is still to be determined. Exit poll data from across the United States gives a glimpse into voters' priorities and an indication of how different demographic groups cast their ballots. The figures suggest the proportion of total voters who are white has fallen by six percentage points on 2016, while remaining the largest group by ethnicity. The proportion of white voters backing Mr Biden has risen by five points on Hillary Clinton's figure at the last election, but Mr Trump still takes the largest share of this group, the preliminary polling suggests. Meanwhile, Mr Biden appears to have gained support among under 30s and the middle-aged. The exit polls are carried out across the US by Edison Research and are a combination of election day interviews and telephone polling, designed to reach early and absentee voters. Nationally, more than a third of voters said the economy was the most important issue in deciding who to choose as president, with a further 20% naming racial inequality and 17% saying the coronavirus pandemic. However the issues were split along partisan lines with more than four times as many Trump voters saying the economy was the deciding factor, and Biden voters answering racial inequality and the virus. Voters were evenly split on how the US economy was faring, with 48% saying it was in ""excellent or good"" condition and 50% saying it was ""not so good or poor"". Similarly, 50% said that the US was doing ""somewhat or very badly"" at containing the pandemic and 48% thought the country was doing ""somewhat or very well"". The possibility of voter fraud has been raised repeatedly by the Trump campaign but a large majority of voters (87%) told the researchers they were confident that votes in their state would be counted accurately. The exit polls are made up of a national exit poll and 22 state exit polls which are carried out by Edison Research for the National Election Pool (ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC). For the national poll, a total of 15,590 voters who cast ballots on Election Day were interviewed at 115 polling places as they exited the polling places.  This survey also includes 4,919 absentee and/or early voters interviewed by telephone. The data is then weighted to be representative of the population and are adjusted further as votes are counted. All samples are approximations and are subject to a margin of error which will be wider for small sub-groups such as smaller ethnic groups.

"Marks & Spencer sank to the first loss in its 94 years as a publicly-listed company as the coronavirus crisis hit trading. In the six months to 26 September, the retailer made a loss of Â£87.6m, compared with profits of Â£158.8m in the same period last year. But chief executive Steve Rowe said the firm's performance had been ""much more robust than at first seemed possible"". In August M&S announcedit was set to cut 7,000 jobs over three months. Sales for the six-month period across the group slid by 15.8% to Â£4.09bn - largely impacted by lower clothing and home sales. Clothing sales in particular were dented by lockdowns and the desire for more casual clothes, the firm said. Between July and September, clothing sales in its city centre stores, for example, were down by 53%. However, M&S does anticipate that demand for more formal clothes and occasion-wear will return, it said in a statement. Small shops better at surviving virus than big ones Ocado says M&S switchover 'successful' after rocky start Shoppers defy economic gloom in September Catherine Shuttleworth, retail analyst and chief executive at retail marketing agency Savvy, told the BBC: ""Marks and Spencer is committed to the High Street, but that comes at an enormous cost. ""Its 600 stores were closed [during lockdown], they've picked up on online and online sales are stronger than they've ever been. But that in no way covers the amount of sales loss they've covered this year."" ""You've got to change to survive. While Marks was saying it, they weren't necessarily doing it, but it has now changed the way they work even at a simple level."" The group also reported strong growth in its Ocado Retail joint venture, which started delivering M&S food at the start of September. It said the partnership has reported a 47.9% jump in sales, while profitability has also improved. M&S created over 750 new lines including in grocery and homecare to broaden its appeal on the Ocado platform, which previously delivered for Waitrose. M&S was one of the few big food retailers without its own internet-based delivery service, and the tie-up with Ocado had been described as a key moment in the retailer's shift to online. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said that M&S ""is already reaping the rewards of an excellent partnership with Ocado. ""Its food business could benefit from the forthcoming national lockdown [in England] as consumers look for high-quality meals as an alternative to going out. ""This could help it counter the effects of fewer people grabbing a sandwich while nipping out of the office for lunch,"" she said. M&S also said its grocery business had performed ""strongly"" over the half-year, with like-for-like sales rising by 2.7% on the back of substantial growth from its Simply Food stores. Ms Palmer added: ""M&S has an opportunity to step up and sit at the table with the big players in the retail market once more, but to stake its claim, it can't just bring food to the party, it has to dress better and provide the furniture too."" Detractors have often described M&S as the lame duck of UK retail, forever struggling to reinvent itself quickly enough to keep up with changing consumer tastes. Its current management, however, will hope that this set of results will persuade investors that a more apt comparison would be with another bird, the phoenix. Today's loss is the ashes from which the management hopes a new, slimmed-down and digital-savvy M&S will emerge. Steve Rowe talks of the pandemic having forced the company to compress three years' of changes into a single year - a hint, perhaps that the crisis may have come by chance at a good time in his plan to revive the company's fortunes. There are signs that the big bet on a commercial alliance with Ocado is paying off, but the Achilles heel remains weak sales in clothing and general merchandise. M&S shares were up more than 4% in early trading, suggesting that investors may discern the first flaps of the phoenix's wings. The update came as M&S continues to push forward with its transformation strategy. The plans, which saw M&S announce 7,000 job cuts across stores and management in August, will enable the business to emerge from the crisis in a ""stronger, leaner and more focused position"", the firm said in a statement. The half-year results included a Â£92m exceptional cost reflecting these cuts. The group said it would also see further charges of up to Â£120m due to store closures over the next seven years. In a call with journalists, Mr Rowe said: ""My goal remains unchanged - that is to deliver the long-term transformation for M&S, building a brand that is more digital in a world that will never be the same again."" ""We know the challenges we're facing will continue,"" he added, citing the upcoming lockdown in England, but said the firm was in a ""much better position"" as the key Christmas trading period approaches.

"It's been three days since the US election. You might have reasonably expected to have some kind of clue about the results by now. We still cannot say, because not enough votes have been counted for either Donald Trump or Joe Biden to claim victory. But the moment we will be able to tell you someone has won does seem to be getting much closer. And results are still coming in. The huge number of postal votes cast during this pandemic election, and different states' laws about how to count them, meant this always was going to take longer if the race was tight. Yes, so far, and by a big margin, but that's not what decides who gets to be president. Instead, a candidate has to win the majority in a system called the electoral college, where each state gets a certain number of votes or ""electors"" roughly in proportion to its population. If you win a state, you win all its votes (except Nebraska and Maine, but that's complicated). There are 538 state votes and the person who gets 270 wins the prize. Mr Biden is on 253 electoral college votes to Mr Trump's 214. There are several ways each of them could reach 270. If Mr Biden gets Pennsylvania, that's all he needs - he is over the line. Georgia and any of Nevada, Arizona or North Carolina works for him too. Mr Trump would need Pennsylvania's votes and to win three states out of Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada or Arizona. So how are they doing in these states? Georgia (16 votes):The story here is about how Mr Biden ate into Mr Trump's lead in a solid Republican state as postal votes and tallies from more Democratic counties came in. Mr Biden has taken a very slim lead in the state and there are still votes to be counted, such as military and overseas votes.  But because the margin is so tight, there is going to be a recount. Pennsylvania (20 votes):There are fewer than 115,000 mail ballots left to count,external, and Mr Biden has now taken the lead. As mail ballots in most places tend to go Democratic, analysts are watching to see how wide this lead gets. Nevada (6 votes):Mr Biden has pulled ahead in Nevada. About 150,000 ballots are yet to be counted, many of them from Clark county, which leans Democratic. Arizona (11 votes):Joe Biden has a lead that is narrowing. Many of those votes still to be counted are from Maricopa County, home to 60% of the state's population - and Mr Trump has been catching up a bit as these votes get counted. Donald Trump has done better than expected and Joe Biden has failed to win those battleground states which count votes quickly, but the Democrat is closing the gap in crucial states as votes get counted. How close are we to knowing the winner? Who has lead in states still counting? How Americans are coping with the long wait What happens if there is a tie, and other questions Election results in full Each state has its own laws and systems for counting votes. Individual states are also in charge of the order in which they count different types of votes - for example postal votes are often counted last. So that makes a difference when Republicans tend to vote in person on the day and postal votes tend to skew Democratic. As there were so many postal votes cast during this pandemic election, this is why we have seen such late dramatic shifts in who leads a race. Another thing to be aware of is that different news outlets have different tallies for each candidate dependingon where they get election data from.So some outlets have called Arizona for Mr Biden, but the BBC thinks it's still not decided. Mr Trump has launched some legal challenges, but analysts suggest most of these challengesconcern small numbers of ballots that might not make a difference in the end,with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Supreme Court previously hinted it could revisit the rules about deadlines for accepting postal votes. Poll officials in Michigan - now projected for Biden - work to tally ballots It now looks like polling data ahead of the election didn't tell us the whole story about the American public. Many observers didn't realise the race would be so tight. Robert Cuffe, the BBC's head of statistics, says it's still too early to say whether this election has been a pollster's nightmare. Final national polls showed Mr Biden leading Mr Trump by about eight points. In battleground states Mr Biden also polled in the lead, but by a much slimmer margin. Currently Mr Biden leads Mr Trump in the share of the popular vote by about three percentage points. Some experts suspect there's a part of the American public which won't even participate in polls because they don't trust institutions - they're more likely to vote for Mr Trump. Voter priorities may have also been slightly misjudged. While the coronavirus pandemic has dominated headlines, a survey conducted by Edison Research found that more voters (a third in total) listed the economy as their key issue - it was a core Trump message. Mr Trump's vote also looks a little bit more diverse than many might have assumed. You can read more about the resultshere.

"It started off cordially. As Americans went to the polls, we put 12 Biden voters and 13 Trump voters in a group chat for a virtual watch party. The Democrats (D), Republicans (R) and Independents (I) all agreed that this election campaign has been ""the race that never ends"". But then the results started to come in, and tensions flared. Indiana goes to Trump Within minutes of the first polls closing, Indiana was called for President Donald Trump. Momentum builds among Republicans The text group started buzzing when Mr Trump took the lead in Florida. But not everyone shared the happiness. Eyes turn to states in the upper Midwest As the polls closed in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin - states which Mr Trump took in 2016 - the races were all too close to call. Andrew, an independent voter from Michigan who was undecided until the last minute and ultimately cast a vote for Biden, said he thought the president would lose in there. Trump momentum sends Democrats to bed Then a ""red wave"" of projections suggested wins for Republicans across the southern US. Republicans in the chat shared photos of their watch parties, including one voter, Eliana, who said she was at a party indoors with 500 people. Gabriel (R - New York), Eliana (R - Florida) and Taylor (R - Texas) attend election night watch parties. The conversation that followed a few of the networks projecting Florida for Trump sent some weary and frustrated Democrats to bed. Biden speaks, Trump tweets The two candidates then told supporters that the fight would go on into Wednesday. Just after midnight on the east coast, Joe Biden took to the stage in his home state of Delaware. And when the president tweeted, most folks were already asleep. But of those who were still awake, Republicans supported him and, once again, Democrats called him a liar. Jim ended the night by saying what everyone else was feeling.

"The clip's caption promoted a ""today only"" offer for hair-styling products A social media influencer has become the first person to be reprimanded by the UK's advertising watchdog over a TikTok post. Theruling centred on a video published,externalby Emily Canham that promoted products made by the hair-styling brand GHD. The regulator said it should have featured an #ad hashtag or similar label. Until now, the body has focused on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube, as well as traditional media. ""This may be our first ruling on a TikTok post but brands, advertisers and influencers should be fully aware that the ad rules apply to them across online and in social media,"" a spokesman for the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) told the BBC. ""Our rules place an emphasis on protecting children and, where an audience/followers of an influencer or celebrity are predominantly young people, particular care has to be taken to ensure they are not misled."" Ms Canham has nearly 700,000 followers on TikTok's video-sharing platform. She has also been profiled by several newspapers and magazines, both because of her marketing skills and her relationship with Busted band member James Bourne. Ms Canham's post went live on 14 June. It featured a caption saying users could get a discount on GHD's goods if they entered her name as a promo code on its website. The 23-year-old Londoner was under contract to the company at the time to post videos about it across a range of social media, including TikTok. Emily Canham has nearly 700,000 followers on TikTok and more than a million on YouTube GHD said this specific post had been created without its oversight or approval. And Ms Canham's agent added that the influencer had not been paid or received a commission for promoting the code in this case. Even so, the ASA said that because the clip featured the same code Ms Canham was being paid to promote at the time elsewhere and was also ""linked to the agreement"" she had signed with the firm, it should have been labelled. Ms Canham has since deleted the video, but has been instructed by the ASA to ensure her future posts feature an advertising identifier ""clearly and prominently displayed"".

"People gather to watch the results in Times Square, New York Americans went to the polls on 3 November to elect the next US president. Republican President Donald Trump is up against Democratic challenger Joe Biden. About 100 millions voters had cast their ballots early. By the early hours of the morning both Mr Biden and Mr Trump told their supporters they were on course to win. The final result may take some time to emerge. Donald Trump addresses his supporters in the White House's East Room where he says he is winning and - with millions of legitimate ballots left to count - declares victory. In the early hours Biden, accompanied by his wife Jill, speaks to supporters in Wilmington, Delaware. He says: ""We knew this was going to go long, but who knew we would go into maybe tomorrow morning, maybe even longer!"" Here are pictures from the election day and a night of results. With a tight race in key states, the candidates need 270 electoral college votes to secure the presidency. Donald Trump, 74, is seeking to avoid becoming the first incumbent president to lose a re-election fight since George HW Bush in 1992. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump visits his campaign headquarters in Arlington, Virginia Joe Biden visits The Warehouse, a support organisation for teenagers, on election day in Wilmington, Delaware A voter heads to a polling station in Austin, Texas With a rise in gun sales in the run-up to election day following a bitter campaign, there were fears of violence and disruption on Tuesday. But there have been only a few reported incidents of run-ins at polling stations or in the streets. Voters cast their ballots at the Cross Insurance Center polling location in Bangor, Maine In Chicago, a man told police that a group of people attacked his car with baseball bats near a polling station, the New York Times reports. And in Charlotte, North Carolina, an armed man wearing a Trump hat was arrested after he reportedly intimidated people at a rally. Voters deliver their sealed mail-in ballots in green envelopes at David Crockett Elementary School in Phoenix, Arizona Artist Dababy shows off his shoes at a polling location in Charlotte, North Carolina Overall, most Americans went out to vote peacefully - and of course millions stayed home after voting early. The highest turnout in more than a century is expected. A voter fills out his ballot in Vancouver, Washington The FBI is investigating a series of automated calls spreading misinformation.

"The clip's caption promoted a ""today only"" offer for hair-styling products A social media influencer has become the first person to be reprimanded by the UK's advertising watchdog over a TikTok post. Theruling centred on a video published,externalby Emily Canham that promoted products made by the hair-styling brand GHD. The regulator said it should have featured an #ad hashtag or similar label. Until now, the body has focused on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube, as well as traditional media. ""This may be our first ruling on a TikTok post but brands, advertisers and influencers should be fully aware that the ad rules apply to them across online and in social media,"" a spokesman for the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) told the BBC. ""Our rules place an emphasis on protecting children and, where an audience/followers of an influencer or celebrity are predominantly young people, particular care has to be taken to ensure they are not misled."" Ms Canham has nearly 700,000 followers on TikTok's video-sharing platform. She has also been profiled by several newspapers and magazines, both because of her marketing skills and her relationship with Busted band member James Bourne. Ms Canham's post went live on 14 June. It featured a caption saying users could get a discount on GHD's goods if they entered her name as a promo code on its website. The 23-year-old Londoner was under contract to the company at the time to post videos about it across a range of social media, including TikTok. Emily Canham has nearly 700,000 followers on TikTok and more than a million on YouTube GHD said this specific post had been created without its oversight or approval. And Ms Canham's agent added that the influencer had not been paid or received a commission for promoting the code in this case. Even so, the ASA said that because the clip featured the same code Ms Canham was being paid to promote at the time elsewhere and was also ""linked to the agreement"" she had signed with the firm, it should have been labelled. Ms Canham has since deleted the video, but has been instructed by the ASA to ensure her future posts feature an advertising identifier ""clearly and prominently displayed"".

"It started off cordially. As Americans went to the polls, we put 12 Biden voters and 13 Trump voters in a group chat for a virtual watch party. The Democrats (D), Republicans (R) and Independents (I) all agreed that this election campaign has been ""the race that never ends"". But then the results started to come in, and tensions flared. Indiana goes to Trump Within minutes of the first polls closing, Indiana was called for President Donald Trump. Momentum builds among Republicans The text group started buzzing when Mr Trump took the lead in Florida. But not everyone shared the happiness. Eyes turn to states in the upper Midwest As the polls closed in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin - states which Mr Trump took in 2016 - the races were all too close to call. Andrew, an independent voter from Michigan who was undecided until the last minute and ultimately cast a vote for Biden, said he thought the president would lose in there. Trump momentum sends Democrats to bed Then a ""red wave"" of projections suggested wins for Republicans across the southern US. Republicans in the chat shared photos of their watch parties, including one voter, Eliana, who said she was at a party indoors with 500 people. Gabriel (R - New York), Eliana (R - Florida) and Taylor (R - Texas) attend election night watch parties. The conversation that followed a few of the networks projecting Florida for Trump sent some weary and frustrated Democrats to bed. Biden speaks, Trump tweets The two candidates then told supporters that the fight would go on into Wednesday. Just after midnight on the east coast, Joe Biden took to the stage in his home state of Delaware. And when the president tweeted, most folks were already asleep. But of those who were still awake, Republicans supported him and, once again, Democrats called him a liar. Jim ended the night by saying what everyone else was feeling.

"It's been three days since the US election. You might have reasonably expected to have some kind of clue about the results by now. We still cannot say, because not enough votes have been counted for either Donald Trump or Joe Biden to claim victory. But the moment we will be able to tell you someone has won does seem to be getting much closer. And results are still coming in. The huge number of postal votes cast during this pandemic election, and different states' laws about how to count them, meant this always was going to take longer if the race was tight. Yes, so far, and by a big margin, but that's not what decides who gets to be president. Instead, a candidate has to win the majority in a system called the electoral college, where each state gets a certain number of votes or ""electors"" roughly in proportion to its population. If you win a state, you win all its votes (except Nebraska and Maine, but that's complicated). There are 538 state votes and the person who gets 270 wins the prize. Mr Biden is on 253 electoral college votes to Mr Trump's 214. There are several ways each of them could reach 270. If Mr Biden gets Pennsylvania, that's all he needs - he is over the line. Georgia and any of Nevada, Arizona or North Carolina works for him too. Mr Trump would need Pennsylvania's votes and to win three states out of Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada or Arizona. So how are they doing in these states? Georgia (16 votes):The story here is about how Mr Biden ate into Mr Trump's lead in a solid Republican state as postal votes and tallies from more Democratic counties came in. Mr Biden has taken a very slim lead in the state and there are still votes to be counted, such as military and overseas votes.  But because the margin is so tight, there is going to be a recount. Pennsylvania (20 votes):There are fewer than 115,000 mail ballots left to count,external, and Mr Biden has now taken the lead. As mail ballots in most places tend to go Democratic, analysts are watching to see how wide this lead gets. Nevada (6 votes):Mr Biden has pulled ahead in Nevada. About 150,000 ballots are yet to be counted, many of them from Clark county, which leans Democratic. Arizona (11 votes):Joe Biden has a lead that is narrowing. Many of those votes still to be counted are from Maricopa County, home to 60% of the state's population - and Mr Trump has been catching up a bit as these votes get counted. Donald Trump has done better than expected and Joe Biden has failed to win those battleground states which count votes quickly, but the Democrat is closing the gap in crucial states as votes get counted. How close are we to knowing the winner? Who has lead in states still counting? How Americans are coping with the long wait What happens if there is a tie, and other questions Election results in full Each state has its own laws and systems for counting votes. Individual states are also in charge of the order in which they count different types of votes - for example postal votes are often counted last. So that makes a difference when Republicans tend to vote in person on the day and postal votes tend to skew Democratic. As there were so many postal votes cast during this pandemic election, this is why we have seen such late dramatic shifts in who leads a race. Another thing to be aware of is that different news outlets have different tallies for each candidate dependingon where they get election data from.So some outlets have called Arizona for Mr Biden, but the BBC thinks it's still not decided. Mr Trump has launched some legal challenges, but analysts suggest most of these challengesconcern small numbers of ballots that might not make a difference in the end,with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Supreme Court previously hinted it could revisit the rules about deadlines for accepting postal votes. Poll officials in Michigan - now projected for Biden - work to tally ballots It now looks like polling data ahead of the election didn't tell us the whole story about the American public. Many observers didn't realise the race would be so tight. Robert Cuffe, the BBC's head of statistics, says it's still too early to say whether this election has been a pollster's nightmare. Final national polls showed Mr Biden leading Mr Trump by about eight points. In battleground states Mr Biden also polled in the lead, but by a much slimmer margin. Currently Mr Biden leads Mr Trump in the share of the popular vote by about three percentage points. Some experts suspect there's a part of the American public which won't even participate in polls because they don't trust institutions - they're more likely to vote for Mr Trump. Voter priorities may have also been slightly misjudged. While the coronavirus pandemic has dominated headlines, a survey conducted by Edison Research found that more voters (a third in total) listed the economy as their key issue - it was a core Trump message. Mr Trump's vote also looks a little bit more diverse than many might have assumed. You can read more about the resultshere.

"Small retailers have suffered fewer closures than big firms Independent shops have been ""more agile"" and better at surviving Covid-19 than chain stores, data indicates. Small independent firms on the High Street suffered a net decline of 1,833 stores in the first half of 2020, according to research by the Local Data Company (LDC) and accountancy firm PwC. That was less than a third ofthe 6,001 chain stores lost, the LDC said. However, the two sectors together saw the biggest decline seen in the first half of a year since its records began. Lucy Stainton, head of retail and strategic partnerships at the LDC, said it had been ""an immensely challenging few months for the retail and hospitality sector"". She said the independent market had fared better as those businesses had been ""more agile, bringing in new product lines and offering food deliveries"". They also had a smaller cost base to cover during periods of little or no trade and had been able to take advantage of government support schemes. ""However, as we continue through the year with various local lockdowns and restrictions, life will not get any easier for operators,"" she added. ""These figures mark only the first phase in the impact of the pandemic on the retail economy this year, with 20% of the market still temporarily shut and with more months of difficult trading conditions ahead."" Coronavirus drives shop closures to new record During the period surveyed, there were 20,019 closures of independent shops and 18,186 openings. That compares with 11,120 chain-store closures and 5,119 openings. Put together, that gives 31,139 closures and a net decrease of 7,834 shops. In percentage terms, the gap between big and small retailers is even greater, since 64% of the retail and leisure market is comprised of independent businesses, according to the LDC. That means independent businesses declined by 0.54%, compared with 2.77% for the chain units. The LDC and PwC have been analysing the changes in the top 500 shopping locations for the past decade. The LDC said its latest surveys covered the January-to-August period, to compensate for a short time during lockdown when its researchers were unable to work. However, it said that it had surveyed the same number of units as in a normal first-half period and that its figures were comparable to those of previous years.

"Joe Biden has been elected president of the United States, after his projected victory in Pennsylvania took him over the winning line. With all states now projected, President-elect Biden has 306 electoral college votes and Donald Trump has 232. A candidate needs 270 or more to win. Mr Biden will become the 46th president in January, pending the outcome of any legal challenges. There is still a recount to come inGeorgia, but Mr Biden has a lead of almost 15,000 votes and the 16 electoral college votes are not enough to overturn his overall victory. Mr Biden's running mate,Kamala Harris, will make history as the first woman vice-president, as well as the first black and the first Asian American vice-president. Click or tap on the map below to get detailed results. For full results click or tap here,external This map shows where either the Republicans (red arrows) or Democrats (blue arrows) have performed better than in 2016. It is far from a consistent picture, with both parties gaining in some areas and losing support in others. Narrow gains for Mr Biden inGeorgia,Arizona,Michigan,Wisconsinand, crucially,Pennsylvania, were enough for him to flip those states and win the presidency. Unfortunately for Mr Trump, his gains were concentrated in states he already won last time around - for example strongholds such asIdaho,Utah,ArkansasandTennessee. US election results in maps and charts With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Mr Biden has been projected to overturn Mr Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. A strengthening of support in some areas where the Democrats also did well in 2016 - particularly around Philadelphia in the south east corner - has been enough to generate this result. As well as Pennsylvania, Mr Biden also managed to flip four other states that Mr Trump won in 2016 -Wisconsin,Michigan,ArizonaandGeorgia. The first three had been Democrat strongholds for decades before favouring Mr Trump over Hillary Clinton four years ago. Arizona has not been won by a Democrat since Bill Clinton's second term 24 years ago, and Georgia not since Mr Clinton's first win in 1992. In the US electoral system, the results in each state have a widely varying impact on the final result, with states that have larger populations given more say than those with smaller populations. The map below represents each state and the District of Columbia as a square, with its area corresponding to the number of votes its representatives will cast in the electoral college that ultimately decides whether Mr Biden or Mr Trump has won the presidency. It shows that both the Republicans and the Democrats have won their share of larger and smaller states, but Mr Biden has now picked up states worth more than the 270 he needed to win the presidency. Mr Trump managed to hold off challenges from Mr Biden in three of the four biggest battleground states -Texas,FloridaandOhio. But the wins in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania - worth 73 electoral college votes altogether - have been enough for Mr Biden to win the presidency. Preliminary figures show the highest turnout since 1900, with 66.4% of eligible voters turning out compared with 60.1% in 2016. As Mr Biden also leads the national popular vote on 50.8% to Mr Trump's 47.4% - a lead of over five million votes - this boost in participation means that the president-elect has already received more votes than any candidate in US electoral history - close to 78 million so far, with the count continuing in some states. Mr Trump has also increased his vote tally compared with 2016 by more than 9 million votes, to over 72 million this year. Despite being projected to lose the election, this figure gives him the second-highest number of votes of any US presidential candidate. Mr Trump has been projected to win the closely-fought state of Florida, with 51% of the vote compared with Mr Biden's 48%. Despite taking what is typically a bellwether state, Mr Trump failed to win a second term in the White House. Exit poll estimates put Mr Trump on a 61% share of the white vote in Florida. Mr Biden appears to have made up ground on Hillary Clinton's performance with this demographic in 2016. However, Mr Trump is also estimated to have gained 12 points among Latino voters, bringing him nearly level with Mr Biden. Here's how the map coloured up, from the first states to be projected on election night, to Pennsylvania on Saturday. This interactive can only be visible with Javascript enabled. Although the Democrats have made a net gain of one seat in the race for the Senate, the Republicans remain ahead, on 50 seats to the Democrats' 48. Both of the Georgia senate races have gone to a run-off after no candidate secured more than 50% of the votes. There will now be another vote, on 5 January 2021, to separate the two top candidates in each race and determine which party controls the legislature's upper chamber. In the House, despite losing five seats the Democrats have now crossed the winning line of 218 and will retain their majority. There are still 13 seats to declare so the exact size of the majority is still to be determined. Exit poll data from across the United States gives a glimpse into voters' priorities and an indication of how different demographic groups cast their ballots. The figures suggest the proportion of total voters who are white has fallen by six percentage points on 2016, while remaining the largest group by ethnicity. The proportion of white voters backing Mr Biden has risen by five points on Hillary Clinton's figure at the last election, but Mr Trump still takes the largest share of this group, the preliminary polling suggests. Meanwhile, Mr Biden appears to have gained support among under 30s and the middle-aged. The exit polls are carried out across the US by Edison Research and are a combination of election day interviews and telephone polling, designed to reach early and absentee voters. Nationally, more than a third of voters said the economy was the most important issue in deciding who to choose as president, with a further 20% naming racial inequality and 17% saying the coronavirus pandemic. However the issues were split along partisan lines with more than four times as many Trump voters saying the economy was the deciding factor, and Biden voters answering racial inequality and the virus. Voters were evenly split on how the US economy was faring, with 48% saying it was in ""excellent or good"" condition and 50% saying it was ""not so good or poor"". Similarly, 50% said that the US was doing ""somewhat or very badly"" at containing the pandemic and 48% thought the country was doing ""somewhat or very well"". The possibility of voter fraud has been raised repeatedly by the Trump campaign but a large majority of voters (87%) told the researchers they were confident that votes in their state would be counted accurately. The exit polls are made up of a national exit poll and 22 state exit polls which are carried out by Edison Research for the National Election Pool (ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC). For the national poll, a total of 15,590 voters who cast ballots on Election Day were interviewed at 115 polling places as they exited the polling places.  This survey also includes 4,919 absentee and/or early voters interviewed by telephone. The data is then weighted to be representative of the population and are adjusted further as votes are counted. All samples are approximations and are subject to a margin of error which will be wider for small sub-groups such as smaller ethnic groups.

"MPs will vote later on the plan for a four-week lockdown in England. The restrictions, which include the closure of pubs, restaurants gyms and non-essential shops, will come into force after midnight if approved. It comes as the head of NHS England warned there are 11,000 coronavirus patients in hospital in England - up from 2,000 at the start of October. Sir Simon Stevens also said the NHS would be ""geared up"" to deliver a potential vaccine before Christmas. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told business leaders the lockdown, which is due to end on 2 December, will not be extended beyond that date. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Sir Simon said there had been a ""very substantial"" increase in ""desperately sick patients in hospitals"" in October. He said: ""So, put another way, we've got 22 hospitals' worth of coronavirus patients across England. ""And indeed, even since Saturday, when the prime minister gave his press conference, we filled another two hospitals full of severely ill coronavirus patients."" 'Destructive' rules only current option - Whitty What are the new lockdown rules for England? City-wide Covid testing to be piloted in Liverpool A number of Conservative MPs have criticised the nationwide lockdown. But Labour's support for the new measures mean they are highly likely to be approved, even if there is a rebellion from Tory backbenchers. Sir Simon said the actions taken by Parliament would mean the health service should be able to avoid postponing routine operations. He also said the NHS would be writing to GP practices this week to get them prepared to deliver a vaccine by Christmas, if one becomes available. Sir Simon said: ""There are over 200 vaccines in development and we believe that we should hopefully get one or more of those available from the first part of next year. ""In anticipation of that, we're also gearing the NHS up to be ready to make a start on administering Covid vaccines before Christmas, if they become available."" Sir Simon later told a briefing the NHS's ""central expectation"" was that a vaccine would be possible by the start of next year. He said: ""The bulk of this is likely to be the other side of Christmas, but we want to be ready in the event that those optimistic signs you've been hearing about come to pass. "" And he suggested that all patient-facing NHS staff would soon be given routine testing, regardless of symptoms. Meg and Matt, pictured with their daughter, got married this week after twice moving the date Meanwhile, Mr Johnson apologised to businesses for the ""nightmare"" Covid situation. In a pre-recorded speech to the Confederation of British Industry's annual conference, the prime minister said the restrictions went ""against every free market instinct I possess"". ""And, believe me, we will end these autumn measures on 2 December when they expire,"" he added. A number of shops have been extending their opening hours ahead of the lockdown Ahead of the expected new restrictions, a number of retailers and other businesses areextending their opening hoursto meet a surge in demand. From Thursday, non-essential retailers and other businesses including hairdressers will be required to close until the lockdown is lifted.

Andupdated guidance has been published for those deemed to be extremely vulnerable,external, including advice that people should not attend work if they cannot do it from home. The extremely vulnerable group has been expanded to also include adults with Down's Syndrome. The advice also says that most children originally on the shielded patient list no longer need to be because of the very low risk of them becoming sick from coronavirus, and can therefore attend school. Labourfirst called for a short lockdown or ""circuit-breaker"" in England last monthand have criticised the government for not acting quickly or decisively enough. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said that Labour's support will be enough to deter some Tories who have criticised the measures from rebelling, because they would see it as a ""senseless sacrifice"". ""A relatively small number, however, will still vote against their own government,"" our correspondent said. The BBC has been told that former chief whip Mark Harper, who has openly criticised NHS Test and Trace, is expected to be among them. A very senior Tory privately described the handling of the pandemic as a farce. Others have been pushing for an economic assessment of the lockdown to be published, and several MPs questioned the data informing the government's decisions. On Tuesday, Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, defended lockdowns, telling MPsthey were the only practical option to stem the spread of Covid-19until a vaccine and better drugs become available. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty says the three-tier system of restrictions has âslowed things down"". Among the Conservative MPs to criticise the nationwide lockdown during a parliamentary debate on Tuesday was Richard Drax, who said they were ""destructive, divisive, and don't work"". ""They simply delay the inevitable - the re-emergence of the virus when lockdown ends, as has been shown,"" he said. ""Have we over-reacted? Yes, I think we have. A draconian, onerous and invasive set of rules and regulations now govern our very existence."" Meanwhile, Commons Health Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt said it would be ""quite unforgivable"" if the UK this winter saw similar levels of Covid transmission in hospitals as experienced during the first coronavirus wave. Speaking to Today, he called for more routine testing of NHS staff to be carried out. PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages?

"McDonald's said the store will create more than 65 jobs in the community England's only McDonald's-free county is no more, as a branch of the fast food chain has opened. Rutland, in the East Midlands, had escaped the lure of the golden arches butplans to build a diner and drive-thru were approved in January. The restaurant, based on the outskirts of Oakham, will move to a drive-thru only service on Thursday as the country goes into a second lockdown. McDonald's said the store will create more than 65 jobs in the community. Before Rutland County Council approved the plan for the fast food chain, there was some resistance among residents. County to get first McDonald's as plan is approved England's only county without a McDonald's Among the 55 objections made to the authority, one person wrote: ""I'm proud Rutland is the only county not to have a McDonald's."" Several others expressed concerns about the impact a McDonald's would have on smaller, independent, businesses in Oakham. Oakham is a market town with prestigious schools and traditional buildings But landlady of the Crown Tavern, Lindsay Taylor, said once lockdown had lifted, it ""could bring people to Oakham and help shops on the high street"". ""At the end of the day people are worried about littering and that sort of stuff, but that's not McDonald's fault,"" she said. ""People think we live in a posh area, as it's Rutland, but there's a split."" Franchise owner Glyn Pashley, who operates the new restaurant, said he was ""delighted to be opening in Oakham"" and holding the mantle of ""the first [McDonald's] restaurant in Rutland"". Oakham's mayor David Romney officially opened the restaurant at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. He said: ""It was getting very busy when I left, which was nice to see. There were no planning grounds for this not to go ahead and I think, in terms of the employment and visitors it will provide, it will be a win-win situation for the town."" Paul Stainton saw up to 30 cars in the drive-thru on the morning McDonald's opened in Rutland Paul Stainton, who lives in Stretton, Rutland, drove past the new McDonald's earlier said it was ""very busy"". ""I'd say there were probably 25 to 30 cars in the drive-thru, the restaurant was busy, there were people sat outside in the sunshine - it looks like it's got off to a pretty good start,"" he said. Mr Stainton didn't have any issues with the restaurant being built in his local area and said it looks ""quite swanky"". ""I think it's a balancing act between the tradition of Rutland and also the fact that people need jobs. ""To be fair, it makes a scruffy little area of Rutland look quite nice,"" he said. Some of those opposing the new McDonald's had suggested using the space for something ""more healthy"" One of those that is unlikely to join the drive-thru queue is Charlie Pallett, also known as the Rutland Blogger. She said the absence of a McDonald's in the county was a ""quirk"" that had now gone. ""We've got one everywhere else around us within a 10 to 15-minute drive so I don't think we need it,"" she said. She supported the idea of using the space for something ""more healthy"". ""There were quite a lot of people that would have liked to have seen something more active there for children could do - a trampoline park or something like that,"" she said. ""Obviously, now with Covid I don't know if that would have been able to happen or not."" However, Ms Pallett said she could not dispute the benefit of the extra jobs in the area. ""That's fantastic, especially during the circumstances at the moment,"" she said. Rutland lies between Leicestershire and Lincolnshire and has a population of 39,500 The county's Latin motto, Multum in Parvo, means ""much in little"" The average house price is Â£327,000 - almost Â£100,000 above the national average, according to the Land Registry It has returned Conservative MPs to Parliament with comfortable majorities since the seat was created in 1983.

"This video can not be played Eyewitness Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister talks about the 2 November Vienna attack Austrian police have carried out a series of raids and made 14 arrests after a gunman murdered four people in the heart of Vienna on Monday. The man, described as a 20-year-old Islamist terrorist who had been freed from jail last December, was shot dead by police as he fired on passers-by. Security has been tight in the Austrian capital as police launched a manhunt for any further attackers. But authorities now believe the gunman may have acted alone. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the four who died were an elderly woman, an elderly man, a young man and a waitress. Another 22 people were wounded. One of the women who died was German, Germany's foreign minister said. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said there was no indication that a second assailant had been involved, though that could no be ruled out. Police were still assessing some 20,000 mobile phone videos of what happened. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed in a video on its online propaganda channel that it was behind the attacks, without providing any evidence. Security remained high in Vienna as authorities suggested the attacker may have acted alone The attacks began at 20:00 (19:00 GMT) on Monday, opposite the main synagogue in a pedestrian alley called Seitenstettengasse, and continued until the gunman was shot dead at 20:09. Police identified a total of six crime scenes in the area. It was clearly an attack driven by ""hatred of our way of life, our democracy"", Chancellor Kurz said. Nine minutes of murder in Vienna: What we know Three days of national mourning have begun, with flags flying at half mast. Children - those in Vienna were kept at home for safety on Tuesday - will observe a minute's silence at school on Wednesday. The UK raised its terrorism alert levelto ""severe"", from ""substantial"", meaning an attack is highly likely, but no specific intelligence points to one. It has also emerged that a police officer who was shot and wounded by the gunman was taken to safety by two men of Turkish descent. ""I took his legs, he took his shoulders, the police were there too of course and helped, and we quickly got him to the ambulance,"" Mikail Ãzen, a personal trainer and mixed martial arts fighter, told journalists. Mr Nehammer praised them, saying ""more than ever: if people think that they can divide our society with violence, terror and fear it's important to stand together"". 'Heroes' praised for helping Vienna attack victims He said 14 people linked to the gunman had been arrested in the Vienna area, the town of St PÃ¶lten and the city of Linz. Two Swiss citizens - men aged 18 and 24 - were also arrested in Winterthur near Zurich, suspected of links to the gunman. This video can not be played ""This was one of the scariest moments in my life"" Earlier, Mr Nehammer described the gunman as an ""Islamist terrorist"" named Kujtim Fejzulai, who had been jailed for 22 months in April 2019 for trying to travel to Syria to join IS jihadists. He was released early in December under more lenient terms for young adults, after convincing the authorities that he no longer held extremist Islamist views, Mr Nehammer said. Originally from North Macedonia, he had both Austrian and Macedonian citizenship. He had posted a photo on a social media, showing himself with weapons, before the attack, the minister said. Police searched his home and seized video material. As well as being heavily armed, he was wearing a fake explosive belt, police said. Mr Nehammer said the gunman opened fire with a shortened Kalashnikov assault rifle, but was also armed with a machete and a pistol. In pictures: Scene of gun attack in Vienna Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat The attack came hours before Austria imposed new national restrictions to try to stem rising cases of coronavirus. Many people were enjoying having a drink or eating out before a midnight curfew. Elsewhere in Europe, France has suffered a spate of Islamist militant attacks recently, involving ""lone wolf"" jihadists. The gunman had posted a photo showing himself with weapons before the attack, the interior minister said Last month French history teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded outside a school in a suburb of Paris by a Chechen youth, who was then shot dead by police. As the French government launched new measures to tackle militant Islam, a Tunisian man fatally stabbed three people in a cathedral in Nice. The worst IS attack in Europe in recent years was in November 2015, when gunmen killed 130 people in Paris.
