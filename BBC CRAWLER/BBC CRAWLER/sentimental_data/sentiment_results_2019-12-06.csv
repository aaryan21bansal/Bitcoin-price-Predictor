"Joseph McCann was found guilty of 37 offences against 11 victims A man who carried out a string of sex attacks on 11 women and children across England over two weeks has been found guilty of 37 offences. Joseph McCann's victims were aged between 11 and 71 and included three women who were abducted off the street at knifepoint and repeatedly raped. The 34-year-old also tricked his way into a woman's home before tying her up and molesting her son and daughter. McCann, of Harrow, was found guilty of offences including rape and kidnap. The convicted burglar had been released from prison following a probation error in February before he embarked on a cocaine and vodka-fuelled rampage. McCann's ""spree of sex attacks"" started in Watford before moving to London, Greater Manchester and Cheshire over two weeks in April and May. The failures that let Joseph McCann out of prison 'I saw net close in on serial rapist' Hundreds of officers from five forces were deployed in the manhunt before he was finally caught while hiding in a tree. Det Ch Insp Katherine Goodwin, who led the investigation, described him as ""one of the most dangerous sex offenders the country has ever seen"". Jo Farrar, chief executive of HM Prisons and Probation Service, ""apologised unreservedly"" for ""failings"" which led to McCann being released early, adding that ""strong and immediate action"" had been taken against those involved. It can now be reported that four men and two women have been arrested on suspicion of assisting McCann while he was on the run from police following the initial attacks in London. They have been released under investigation. This video can not be played Joseph McCann arrested up a tree in Cheshire On 21 April, McCann grabbed a 21-year-old woman at knifepoint as she walked home from a nightclub in Watford. She was bundled into a car and taken to a house where she was raped until being released later that morning. Four days later, a 25-year-old woman was abducted as she walked home in Walthamstow, east London, just after midnight. She was driven off in a car then repeatedly raped in a number of locations over 14 hours, including outside a school where McCann told her he ""wanted to make her rape a child"". Later the same day, and while still holding the woman prisoner, he snatched a 21-year-old woman in Edgware, north London, as she walked along the street with her sister. She suffered a similar fate to the 25-year-old woman. The pair finally managed to escape when McCann drove to Watford, where he had booked a hotel room, and one of them hit him over the head with a vodka bottle before they fled to get help. McCann was filmed on CCTV at a Watford hotel where he had booked a room for two nights In the early hours of 5 May, McCann tricked his way into the home of a woman he had met in a bar in Greater Manchester. Once inside, he tied her to a bed and molested her 11-year-old son and 17-year-old daughter, who he told ""you are going to Europe tomorrow, you are mine"". The girl, who said she feared becoming a ""sex slave"", managed to escape by jumping naked from a window and alerted police. At about 13:30 the same day, he pounced on a 71-year-old woman while she was loading shopping into her car outside a supermarket and abducted and raped her. Three hours later he also abducted and assaulted a 13-year-old girl in the same car before both managed to get away at Knutsford service station. This video can not be played Footage shows dramatic Joseph McCann police chase At about 18:30 on 5 May, McCann abducted two 14-year-old girls after threatening to ""chop them up with a machete"". He was filmed at a garage buying condoms but was spotted by a police patrol who pursued him while the girls were inside the car. After crashing into a Mercedes, he fled on foot, then caught a taxi. The car was stopped at a police road block but he fled across a field and was finally caught in the early hours of 6 May. The 12 jurors decided the fate of Joseph McCann without ever seeing him in the dock.  Only once did he leave his prison cell for the Old Bailey - and that was to answer questions from the judge when the jury wasn't there. McCann opted out of court proceedings from the moment he was charged in May, refusing to appear before chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot. Instead, in an unprecedented move, she travelled to Belmarsh Prison and convened the hearing there. Before and during the trial, hours were wasted waiting for updates about McCann, with barristers and the judge in almost daily discussions about whether he would turn up and why he had not. Letters were sent to his cell and prison officers were called to give evidence by videolink to confirm he had received them. At one stage, McCann requested a four-week adjournment because he hadn't had enough sleep. Even towards the end, with the prosecution case nearly completed, the jury was kept waiting while McCann weighed up whether he was going to go in the witness box. There were concerns about his health - he didn't eat for days and threatened suicide - but the court's main preoccupation was ensuring he had a fair trial and understood the process even though he chose to be absent from it. However, in the face of overwhelming evidence, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that McCann was playing the system because that was the only option left open to him. Scotland Yard believe McCann used contacts across the country to evade justice as he moved across five police force areas. However, it has been revealed police forces involved in the hunt for McCann failed to share information, meaning he was not identified earlier. On his arrest, McCann even told officers: ""If you had caught me for the first two, the rest of this wouldn't have happened."" Hertfordshire Constabulary identified him the day after the first attack in Watford and added his name to the police national computer. But the Met did not identify McCann as being involved in the two London attacks until 28 April after a call from a member of the public, despite them liaising with their Hertfordshire counterparts on 25 April. McCann was filmed at a McDonalds drive-thru while one of his victims was in the car McCann fled on foot after crashing a car into a Mercedes McCann, who is facing a life sentence, is due to be sentenced on Monday. After the verdicts were reached, the jury sent a note to the judge saying they wished to acknowledge the bravery of the victims and the hard work of the police forces involved. The 34-year-old never appeared in court during the trial but was convicted of: Ten counts of false imprisonment Seven counts of rape One count of rape of a child Two counts of causing or inciting a person to engage in sexual activity without consent Seven counts of kidnap One count of attempted kidnap Three counts of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity Three counts of assault by penetration One count of sexual assault Two counts of committing a sexual offence with intent The failures that let Joseph McCann out of prison Rape accused 'threatened to chop up girls' Boys 'tried to fight off' alleged serial rapist Rape-accused 'kidnapped woman, 71, outside shop' Rape-accused's victim' feared being sex slave' Rape-accused 'caught on CCTV' at hotel Vodka bottle used 'to end 14-hour rape ordeal' Alleged rapist 'told victim to call him daddy' Man embarked on 'series of depraved sex attacks' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Police block pro-Palestine protest from gathering close to London synagogue Best Valentineâs Day gifts for her 2025 Tough test as Town resume chase for title Which parts of Southwark saw the most crime in 2024?

"A UK diplomat in charge of Brexit at the British embassy in the US has quit. In her resignation letter,seen by US broadcaster CNN,external, Alexandra Hall Hall said she could no longer ""peddle half-truths"" on behalf of political leaders she did not ""trust"". She said she has become ""dismayed"" by the reluctance of politicians to ""honestly"" address the ""challenges and trade-offs"" involved in leaving the EU. The Foreign Office said it would not comment on details of her resignation. However, it did confirm Ms Hall Hall had resigned as UK Brexit Counsellor at the British embassy in Washington - a post which involves explaining the UK Brexit policy to US lawmakers and policymakers. In her letter, dated 3 December, she wrote: ""I have been increasingly dismayed by the way in which our political leaders have tried to deliver Brexit, with reluctance to address honestly, even with our own citizens, the challenges and trade-offs which Brexit involves."" She also criticised the use of ""misleading or disingenuous arguments"" and ""some behaviour towards our institutions"" by politicians, adding that ""were it happening in another country, we would almost certainly as diplomats have received instructions to register our concern"". Ms Hall Hall added: ""It makes our job to promote democracy and the rule of law that much harder, if we are not seen to be upholding these core values at home."" BBC diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams described her letter as ""stunningly blunt"". Ms Hall Hall, who is a former ambassador to Georgia and has worked in the diplomatic service for 33 years, did not name any specific politicians in the letter, but took aim at the current Conservative government. She wrote: ""I am also at a stage in life where I would prefer to do something more rewarding with my time, than peddle half-truths on behalf of a government I do not trust."" When the BBC put Ms Hall Hall's comments to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Friday evening, he said: ""I'm not going to talk about employment issues in the civil service."" Diplomats are supposed to be politically neutral and Ms Hall Hall stressed her decision to resign was not tied to her personal views on leaving the EU. ""I took this position with a sincere commitment, indeed passion, to do my part, to the very best of my abilities, to help achieve a successful outcome on Brexit,"" she wrote, but added her position had become ""unbearable personally and untenable professionally"". With a week to go until the UK heads to the polls, Ms Hall Hall insisted she had stood down before the election to avoid her resignation being portrayed as a reaction to its outcome. CNN reported,externalthat she had also filed a formal complaint about being asked to convey overtly partisan language on Brexit. Ms Hall Hall suggested her role as a diplomat had been diverted to convey messages that were ""neither fully honest nor politically impartial.""

"This video can not be played M&D's Tsunami rollercoaster had passed its annual safety check just weeks before Ten victims of the M&D's rollercoaster crash in 2016 have secured Â£1.2m in damages. Seven children were among the people injured in the crash at the theme park in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. It happened after five gondolas on the Tsunami inverted rollercoaster detached from their rails at a bend and fell to the ground. The 10 victims have now successfully sued theme park bosses over physical or psychiatric injuries. M&D's owners have already been fined Â£65,000over health and safety breaches. The company pleaded guilty to charges relating to the Health and Safety at Work Act at Hamilton Sheriff Court in March this year. M&D's Motherwell theme park fined Â£65,000 over Tsunami ride crash HSE completes probe into M&Ds rollercoaster crash M&D's rollercoaster crash: Safety inspector banned Lawyers for the victims said the lives of some of them had been ""permanently and irreversibly affected"". Two boys, aged 11 and 12, suffered serious injuries in the crash David Nellaney, of Digby Brown Solicitors in Glasgow, said it had been proved that the accident would not have happened if the rollercoaster had been properly inspected and maintained by M&D's bosses. He added: ""The failure to do so has had a dramatic and lasting impact on the victims and their families. ""These victims had their lives changed through no fault of their own and while no amount of compensation can undo their pain, it may at least contribute to improving their future."" Two boys, aged 11 and 12, suffered serious injuries - including chest and limb damage - in the incident. Four other boys, a 14-year-old girl and a man and a woman, both aged 19, were also treated in hospital. Craig Chalmers' son was the youngest victim Craig Chalmers' son Ben was the youngest victim and suffered two punctured lungs, a triple pelvic fracture, bruised spleen, bruised kidney and broken femur. The schoolboy also had to be resuscitated twice and spent six days in an induced coma at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. Mr Chalmers told BBC Scotland the settlement offered some closure but said he still had concerns about the park. He said: ""They said they have made changes to improve health and safety. ""Why did they not make it pre-accident? They had numerous near misses, shall we say. ""If they had acted on them could they have prevented the accident? I think 100%."" A police cordon was put in place following the crash The Tsunami, which travelled at up to 40mph through corkscrew turns and loops, never reopened and it was finally dismantled in February 2017. An inspectoran inspector who passed the ride as safe 16 days before the accident was subsequently banned. The theme park was shut for investigations but a partial reopening was sanctioned four days after the accident. It was fully reopened to the public just over three weeks later. M&D Leisure later pleaded guilty to failing to ensure that the rollercoaster was maintained, in efficient working order and in good repair. A health and safety investigation revealed weld repairs on axles of the passenger cars were inadequate, leading to the failure of the axle suspension on the five-car train.

"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn go head-to-head in a live TV debate One questioner referred to criticism of both men from former PMs Sir John Major and Tony Blair Mr Corbyn said a Labour government would negotiate a Brexit deal within three months Mr Johnson said there was ""ample time"" to build a free trade partnership with the EU after leaving The NHS featured too, with Mr Corbyn describing it ""at breaking point"" Mr Johnson said charges the NHS was to be part of a US trade deal was ""Bermuda Triangle stuff"" In his closing statement, Mr Corbyn said he would be as ambitious as the Labour government who created the NHS Mr Johnson's closing statement said his Tory government would ""get Brexit done"" The UK goes to the polls next Thursday Victoria King, Emma Harrison, Alex Therrien, Hazel Shearing, Joseph Lee and Gary Rose What happened today? We're wrapping things up for the evening, so here's a brief catch-up on the main events of today:  Thank you so much for joining us - back again tomorrow... BBC online reporter signs off... Jennifer ScottBBC News A few of the late night
programmes are still at it - tune intoBBC Newsnightright now for Kirsty Wark
from, well, behind me... But overall, the
spinning is slowing down as the buzz of the debate wears
off. The feeling in the room - and even the acceptance from some of the party teams away from the cameras - is it was
another draw between the leaders. And as many of our
correspondents have said, there was no killer moment that is likely to change the election campaign. But these debates give
voters a chance to see their next prime minister in action and have their
policies scrutinised, and that is what we came for. Good night from
Maidstone! As our debate coverage begins to draw to a close, the parties are throwing forward already to the next day of campaigning. Labour is first out of the traps with another new policy pledge. It says it wants to electrify all UK buses by 2030. The Tories argue Labour would ""scrap vital new roads"". Read more. Another Conservative voice from the spin room and another endorsement for Boris Johnson. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the debate showed ""clear leadership"" from his boss ""versus lack of leadership from Jeremy Corbyn"". He tells reporters Mr Johnson's clarity of on Brexit has been going down well on the doorsteps. ""I've now been to 114 campaign visits and I can tell you that getting Brexit done so we can move on and deal with all the other things that matter to this country is a message that resonates from Penzance to Middlesbrough."" By Chris Bell BBC Trending It did not escape the notice of those watching at home that the prime minister was keen to repeat one phrase in particular. âGet Brexit doneâ was one of the top trending phrases on
Twitter, with nearly 50,000 tweets in about an hour - second only to #BBCLeadersDebate. It was clear from Mr Johnsonâs Twitter activity today that
this was his plan. No fewer than 13 tweets or retweets from his Twitter account
sent before the debate referenced the phrase. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You might think Mr Johnson would be pleased to see his campaign slogan trending. But the actual messages tell a different story. The overwhelming tone of the most popular âGet Brexit doneâ tweets was not at all sympathetic to the prime minister. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The general left-leaning bias of Twitter users makes this far from a representative sample. But most of the most widely-shared posts using the Conservative catchphrase were groaning rather than cheering along. Danny ShawBBC Home Affairs Correspondent Talking about London Bridge attacker Usman Khan during the debate, Boris Johnson said there was ""no parole or probation involved in this"" - but probation officers were in charge of his supervision upon release. Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile. said the probation system was ""privatised by this government"". Supervision of low and medium-risk offenders was outsourced, but it's the state that monitors high-risk offenders including Khan. Privatisation has been heavily criticised and earlier this year the government announced plans to reverse the changes. If you missed the debate or want to go over the party leaders' answers again, we've got a couple of options. You can listen to the audio from BBC Radio 5 Liveover at BBC Sounds. Or you can watch the leaders go head to headon BBC iPlayer. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor I think tonight we basically saw the two main rivals on their best behaviour. And they were really trying to appeal to their
core voters, those people who have already made up their minds. It didnât feel to me like there was a big game-changing
moment where either Boris Johnson dropped the ball or Jeremy Corbyn managed to
land a new goal in the back of the net. If we think about the broad context, this campaign has only
six days to go. Look at the polls with a pinch of salt, but the Tories are
ahead consistently and Labour are consistently trailing them. Therefore, tonight it was Boris Johnson's side that were deeply
nervous things would go wrong. For Jeremy Corbyn this was one of his last big chances to really cause an upset and I donât think we saw a sign of anything like that. But core voters on both sides will have watched their
man out there and ended up more sure of the decision they had already made. BBC Radio 5 Live Stephen Nolan puts it to Labour's Shami Chakrabarti that Boris Johnson damaged Jeremy Corbyn by drawing out from him that he doesn't have a clear position on Brexit. ""Obviously I disagree with that leading question,"" Baroness Chakrabarti says. ""I think we have a very grown up position and are offering a different style of leadership to that offered by Boris Johnson. ""He would 'get Brexit done', a crash-out Brexit that would cost us jobs and services, and he will cosy up to Donald Trump and that will have huge consequences in particular for the NHS.

Jennifer ScottBBC News Well, we said Labour's Barry Gardiner was off to ""engage"" with Conservative Matt Hancock - he did and it turned into another argument After a loud attack from the Labour shadow minister, accusing the health secretary of dividing the country, there are eye rolls and arm crosses from the Tory as he asks for Labour's Brexit position. The crowds gathered again to watch the spat. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check People who liked Jeremy Corbyn will have liked some of things he said about the Conservatives. Those who like Boris Johnson would have thought, ""yeah we do need to get Brexit done"". It was notable, though, that Mr Johnson appeared reluctant to attack Mr Corbyn too much. It felt like he was playing it fairly safe and perhaps feeling that he didn't really need to go on the attack to achieve all that much. Once or twice the leaders basically said ""here's a number, but I'm just going to explain how that breaks down"" - sort of pointing out some of the facts that we and others have been saying during the campaign. Jeremy Corbyn said there were four million children in the country living in poverty. It's really hard to measure poverty. It's true that their are four million children, roughly, living in low income houses - but it's not quite the same thing. Boris Johnson once again talked about 40 hospitals, but he did explain the figures a bit more this time. However, he said there are going to be 20,000 more police on the streets, without saying ""we've cut 20,000 since the Conservatives first came into government in 2010"". So a few things you could quibble with in terms of the way you present the statistics, but I thought there were no massive whoppers. BBC Radio 5 Live Chris Curtis, political research manager at YouGov, tells BBC Radio 5 live that the Conservatives will likely be happy tonight, given the results of the snap poll. He says: ""The result was 52% for Boris Johnson  and 48% for Jeremy Corbyn. It is basically the same result as we saw last time round. ""With six days to go I think Jeremy Corbyn needed a bigger win tonight. ""Given that the Conservatives went into this evening with a fairly comfortable nine-point lead in the opinion polls I think what Labour were hoping for was that a good performance from Jeremy Corbyn would help close that gap in the coming days."" BBC online reporter witnesses the battle... Jennifer ScottBBC News As the leaders gave
their closing speeches, the spin room noise level began to rise - and as soon as it
was a wrap, the scurrying began. The desks for
journalists are laid out like tight little warrens, and every reporter,
politician and spinner is navigating their way through, hoping not to trip up
and cause a different kind of headline. We now have big names
from both Labour and the Tories who want to be in front of the camera and sell
their guy as the top dog. The first (and loudest)
row was between Labour's shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, and Foreign
Secretary Dominic Raab over Brexit. All the crews gathered
around the face-off, as one shouted and another rolled their eyes. It's worth
watching our coverage on the BBC News channel for the full glory. The next was Tory Nicky
Morgan and Labour's Baroness Chakrabati, who, while friendly off camera, laid into each
other on air. It was quite a moment to
watch, as the two women spoke over each other to accuse the other of interrupting... But that is the nature
of a spin room. You want to be first, fast and furious, fighting for your
candidate, and telling voters who won what they just watched. And it isn't over yet.
We have spotted some more people heading in. Excuse us while we go
and see what Mr Gardiner has to say to Health Secretary Matt
Hancock... Another voice in the spin room - the SNP's Stewart Hosie says Mr Corbyn âhas accepted the principleâ
of holding another Scottish referendum. What Mr Corbyn has actually said is that there wouldn't be one in the early years - at least the first two - of a Labour government. He wants to make his priority directing massive investment into Scotland instead. But Mr Hosie says ""we canât turn democracy off"" when opinions change, and it is ""perfectly sensible"" to hold another Scottish independence referendum. When challenged on his own party's spending plans, Mr Hosie says: âThe entire
basis of the SNP planâ¦ is not to lead to austerity.â Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake is challenged over polls that appear to show his party is not doing well. ""There is a question mark over Jeremy Corbyn,"" Mr
Brake says. He says in the ""very hard fought"" seats ""there is
the prospect on election night we will take seats from the Conservatives."" ""A good result for us is ensuring Boris Johnson does not
have a majority,"" he says. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent on BBC Radio 5 live I wonder if they didn't want to be seen to be shouting over each other? There were lots of exchanges, it was almost like a friendly chat - very polite. The polls suggest the Tories are fairly comfortably ahead of Labour, so for Boris Johnson, steady as she goes, no clear winner, fairly steady debate is probably a better thing than it is for Jeremy Corbyn. I think he will have wanted to make up some numbers tonight - and indeed he may well do that, but I'm not sure there was a moment that changes the dial and Labour will have been hoping for that.

General election policy guide The audience will be selected by the Question Time production team to reflect how people of all ages in the country have voted. People apply online or by phone and will be asked about their past voting patterns and future voting intentions, whether they're members of political parties, and how they voted in the EU referendum. The BBC aims to represent audiences across the UK during its election coverage, so while the audience will probably be broadly local to the venue, to ensure there are sufficient supporters of all the parties some will have travelled further. You can read more about the BBC's election debateshere, and the BBC's election guidelineshere. The production team will ask audience members to submit questions and then choose the best and most representative of these - they'll ensure there is a range of political opinions among the questioners. The first time the panel hears each question is when the audience member asks it. Throughout the programme, audience members are also given the opportunity to ask further spontaneous questions to the panel, or, of course, to make their own comments.

"TV election debates are still a bit of a novelty in the UK. Each time an election is called, there's the question of whether any will take place, how they will be organised and who will take part. Broadcasters are still experimenting - this time putting on two-way debates, seven-way debates, a climate change debate and a special youth audience debate, among other permutations. So is there room for improvement? And, if so, what might that look and sound like? Here are some expert suggestions. Then Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Ukip leader Paul Nuttall took part in the 2017 debates No-one likes it when leaders interrupt and talk over each other. It puts the focus on confrontation rather than discussion and does little to showcase anyone's qualities as a potential prime minister. As US academic Bryan Van Norden puts it,writing for the Hipporeads website,external, ""There is absolutely no professional or political context in which elegantly interrupting others or being interrupted by others is a useful skill."" He suggests simply switching off leaders' microphones when it's not their turn to speak. As soon as each person has finished talking, off it goes and the next one turns on. Knowing they will go silent could also stop them ""filibustering"", or trying to run down the clock by refusing to stop talking. How to watch the BBC's prime ministerial debate on Friday Tony Benn and Roy Jenkins debated each other in 1975, with David Dimbleby moderating UK televised debates tend to feature glitzy sets, rows of podiums and heavy intervention from moderators. They are also often quite short by international standards. Time can therefore be tight and the result heavy on soundbites and low on substance. It wasn't always like this. One of the UK's earliest televised political debates was between rival Labour frontbenchers Roy Jenkins and Tony Benn during the 1975 European referendum campaign. They debated the single issue for 50 minutes, with no studio audience, no fancy set and very little intervention. Its often viewed now as a model of ""proper"" debate - two intellectual heavyweights tussling with serious issues, listening to each other's points and responding reasonably. The French presidential debates have run on a similar no-frills model since the 1970s. Candidates sit across a table and there's no studio audience. The most recent, between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, lasted two-and-a-half hours and drew an audience of 16.5 million. It was brutal, with the pair trading bitter insults, ""but it didn't half make for riveting viewing,"" saidBBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield. ""[A]nd at the end of the day, the debate did its job."" No one who watched was left in any doubt who stood for what. This video can not be played What they're afraid of - a misjudged debate remark haunted Dan Quayle for the rest of his career If we can't trust politicians to get facts right and tell the truth, then having debates at all is pointless. Much effort already goes into fact-checking, with the likes of independent fact-checking charity Full Fact and theBBC's Reality Checkdeploying journalists to scour statistics and consult experts in order to verify politicians' claims. Viewers can get updates online during debates or read the verdicts afterwards. But of course not everyone does this, meaning politicians might not be adequately held to account. So the race is on to speed up fact-checking and put it at the heart of the debates themselves. The BBC News channel already uses on-screen Reality Check ""push-backs"" - or text boxes - during its live debate broadcasts. And Full Fact has started live checking for other broadcasters, such as LBC. But as Will Moy, Full Fact's chief executive, says, ""It's something audiences really want but it's hard to do it fast enough to make it matter."" The game-changer looks likely to be the use of artificial intelligence. Full Fact is developing software that can check facts far faster than humans, training machines to spot claims and trawl for data which can prove them right or wrong, So the day when we see automated fact-checks appearing on TV screens in real time during debates may not be far off. Back in 2010 the UK's first modern TV election debate took place in front of a respectful and hushed studio audience, There was no jeering or cheering and they were banned from clapping. Since then, audiences have become more vocal, with spectators cheering, clapping and even booing. It can feel a bit like Punch and Judy. Dr Nick Anstead, associate professor at the London School of Economics' media and communications department, thinks we should go back to silence - and aim for an audience of genuinely undecided voters. ""It would at the very least remove the distortion of the audiences we now tend to have. It would change the atmosphere in the studio and make it less of a bear pit."" CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external MANIFESTO GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external ""Politicians have yet to connect emotionally with audiences,"" says one expert Debates routinely involve ordinary members of the public - often by asking them to submit questions for politicians to answer. But this could be taken further. Stephen Coleman, professor of political communication at the University of Leeds, suggests asking people to send in video clips about their lives and problems, which could be sprung on the leaders mid-debate. ""What specifically will you do to help this person?"" they could be asked. Or could broadcasters rip up the debate formula altogether and task politicians with convincing a real voter, while the cameras roll? Matthew Flinders, professor of politics at the University of Sheffield would like to see ""not a debate but a conversation with someone picked out from the public, who would sit down and get to know the politician, understand about their life, where they're coming from and how that flows into their their policies and beliefs."" It could make it harder for politicians to wriggle out of questions and expose them to intense scrutiny - but it would also give them the chance to come across as ""normal"". This could be electoral gold dust: ""It's an element that's been missing so far, No politician has really made an emotional connection with voters,"" Prof Flinders says. Since the UK has never settled on rules for debates, broadcasters and politicians must thrash them out each time. This year the Lib Dems and SNP went to the court to challenge ITV's decision not to include Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon in its prime ministerial debate - though the challenge was rejected. Dr Anstead says there are three conflicting dynamics surrounding debates: the politicians, who want to get their messages across and ""will do anything to avoid generating a negative clip that could go viral""; the broadcasters ""who just want to make good TV""; and ""the democratic need to actually inform voters"". Although politicians and broadcasters would dispute this characterisation, the absence of proper rules means the ""first two are dominating at the moment"", says Dr Anstead. Like the US, Canada has an independent commission tasked with organising official election debates. There are clear rules, consistent formulas for deciding who gets to be in which debates and they are the same from year to year. In the UK, Sky News has been pressing for something similar, with its Make Debates Happen campaign. This year its petition received more than 140,000 signatures and was debated in Parliament. The government's response? ""Televised election debates are a matter for political parties.The government has no plans,externalto change electoral law to make the debates mandatory."" Backbencher Term for an MP who is not a minister. They sit behind the front benches in the House of commons. Ballot Another term for vote. Ballot box A sealed box with a slit in the lid. Voters place their ballot papers through the slit into the box. When polls close the boxes are opened and counting begins. Ballot paper Paper containing a list of all candidates standing in a constituency. Voters mark their choice with a cross. By-election An election held between general elections, usually because the sitting MP has died or resigned. Candidate Someone putting themselves up for election. Once Parliament has been dissolved, there are no MPs, only candidates. Canvassing During a campaign, active supporters of a party ask voters who they will vote for and try to drum up support for their own candidates. Close of nominations The deadline for candidates standing to send in the officials forms confirming their place in the election. This is usually __ days before polling day. Coalition When two or more parties govern together, when neither has an overall majority. After the 2010 election, the Conservatives and Lib Dems formed a coalition, which lasted for five years. Confidence and supply A agreement between two political parties where the smaller party agrees to support a larger one without enough MPs to have a majority in parliament. Conservative The Conservative party is Constituency The geographical unit which elects a single MP. There are 650 in the UK. Dead cat In politics, a 'dead cat' strategy is when a dramatic or sensational story is disclosed to divert attention away from something more damaging.  The term comes from the concept of an imaginary dead cat being flung onto a dining table, causing the diners to become distracted by it. Declaration The announcement of the election result in each constituency. Deposit A sum of Â£500 paid by candidates or their parties to be allowed to stand. It is returned if the candidate wins 5% or more of the votes cast. Devolution The delegation of powers to other parliaments within the UK, specifically the Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies. Devolved parliament The Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies are elected by voters in those nations of the UK. They make laws on policy areas controlled by those nations such as health, environment and education. Dissolution of Parliament The act of ending a Parliament before an election. When parliament is dissolved there are no MPs, but the prime minister and other senior ministers remain in their roles. Electoral register / roll A list of everyone in a constituency entitled to vote. Also known as electoral roll. Exit poll An exit poll is a poll of voters leaving a voting station. They are asked how they have voted, and the results are used to forecast what the overall result of the election may be. First past the post Term used to describe the UK's parliamentary election system. It means a candidate only needs to win the most votes in their constituency to win the seat. Gain When a party wins a constituency from another party, it is said to have ""gained"" it from the other. General election Election at which all seats in the House of Commons are contested. Hung parliament If after an election no party has an overall majority, then parliament is said to be ""hung"". The main parties will then try to form a coalition with one or more of the minor parties. Opinion polls have suggested that a hung parliament is a strong possibility after the 2015 general election. Hustings A meeting a which candidates address potential voters. The word comes from an old Norse word meaning ""house of assembly"". Independent A candidate who is not a member of any political party and is standing on their own personal platform. To qualify as an official political party, a party must be registered with the Electoral Commission, the organisation which administers elections in the UK. Landslide The name given to an election which one party wins by a very large margin. Famous landslides in UK elections include Labour's victory in 1945, the Conservative win in 1983 and the election which brought Tony Blair to power in 1997. Left wing A person or party with strong socialist policies or beliefs. Liberal Democrat The name of the party occupying the centre ground of British politics. They were formed from the former Liberal party and Social Democrats, a Labour splinter group, and combine support for traditional liberalism such as religious tolerance and individual freedom, with support for social justice. Majority A majority in Parliament means one side has at least one more vote than all the other parties combined and is therefore more likely to be able to push through any legislative plans. Majority government When one party wins more than half of the seats in the Commons, they can rule alone in a majority government Mandate Politicians say they have a mandate, or authority, to carry out a policy when they have the backing of the electorate. Manifesto A public declaration of a party's ideas and policies, usually printed during the campaign. Once in power, a government is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver. Marginal Seats where the gap between the two or more leading parties is relatively small. Often regarded as less than a 10% margin or requiring a swing (see below) of 5% or less, though very dependent on prevailing political conditions. Minority government A minority government is one that does not have a majority of the seats in Parliament. It means the government is less likely to be able to push through any legislative programme. Boris Johnson has suffered a number of defeats in Parliament over a no-deal Brexit because he does not have a majority. MP Strictly this includes members of the House of Lords, but in practice means only members of the House of Commons. When an election is called Parliament is dissolved and there are no more MPs until it assembles again. Nomination papers A candidate must be nominated on these documents by 10 voters living in the constituency. Opinion poll A survey asking people's opinion on one or more issues. In an election campaign, the key question is usually about which party people will vote for. Opposition The largest party not in government is known as the official opposition. It receives extra parliamentary funding in recognition of its status. Party Election Broadcast Broadcasts made by the parties and transmitted on TV or radio. By agreement with the broadcasters, each party is allowed a certain number according to its election strength and number of candidates fielded. Percentage swing The swing shows how far voter support for a party has changed between elections. It is calculated by comparing the percentage of the vote won in a particular election to the figure obtained in the previous election. Polling day Election day Polling station Place where people go to cast their votes Postal vote People unable to get to a polling station are allowed to vote by post if they apply in advance. Proportional representation (PR) Any voting system where the share of seats represents the share of votes is described as proportional representation. The UK currently has a first past the post system. Prorogation Parliament is usually prorogued, or suspended, ahead of an election or Queen's Speech to allow for preparations. In September 2019 Boris Johnson attempted to prorogue Parliament for five weeks, but the Supreme Court later ruled the prorogation unlawful and MPs returned to Parliament. Psephologist A person who studies voting and voting patterns. Purdah This is the time between the announcement of an election and the final election results. During this period media organisations have to ensure any political reporting is balanced and is not likely to influence the outcome of the election. Recount If a result is close, any candidate may ask for a recount. The process can be repeated several times if necessary until the candidates are satisfied. The returning officer has the final say on whether a recount takes place. Returning officer The official in charge of elections in each of the constituencies. On election night they read out the results for each candidate in alphabetical order by surname. Right wing Someone who is right wing in politics usually supports tradition and authority, as well as capitalism. The Conservative party is regarded as the main centre-right party in the UK. Safe seat A safe seat is a constituency where an MP has a sufficiently large majority to be considered unwinnable by the opposition. Spin room The attempt to place a favourable interpretation on an event so that people or the media will interpret it in that way. Those performing this act are known as spin doctors. Spoiled ballot Any ballot paper that is not marked clearly, eg with more than one box ticked or with writing scrawled across it, is described as a spoiled ballot and does not count towards the result. Tactical voting This is when people vote not for the party they really support, but for another party in order to keep out a more disliked rival. Target seat In theory, any seat that a party contests and held by a rival is one of its targets. In practice, a target seat is one that a party believes it can win and puts a lot of effort into doing so. Turnout Turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot on polling day. Vote of no confidence It is usually the leader of the opposition, currently Jeremy Corby, who calls for a vote of no confidence, in an attempt to topple the government. If more MPs vote for the motion than against it, then the government has 14 days to try to win back the confidence of MPs through another vote â while the opposition parties try to form an alternative government. If nothing is resolved, then a general election is triggered. Westminster The UK Parliament is located in the Palace of Westminster in the centre of London and the term is often used as an alternative to Parliament. Working majority A working majority in Parliament is what a government needs to carry out its legislative programme without risk of defeat. It means the government can rely on at least one more vote than the opposition parties. However, in the current Parliament, the government no longer has a majority and MPs from a range of opposition parties have joined forces to form a parliamentary majority big enough to defeat the government over plans for a no-deal Brexit.

"In lots of ways this is a complicated election. Derbyshire is not the same as Dundee, Birmingham is not the same as Bangor. Westminster sure isn't the same as Widnes - and London, maybe above all else, isn't the same as Linlithgow, Leeds or Ludlow. There are a multitude of contenders as well - not just the traditional parties, but the SNP and Plaid Cymru, the Brexit Party, what remains of the Independent Group for Change, moveable tribes of party defectors and a clutch of independents as well. But as we enter the last seven days of this election, in our first-past-the-post system, whether you believe it is the best or the worst of all worlds, the choice irrevocably, and inevitably perhaps, moves towards the two big teams - the reds and the blues, and the two big, flawed, characters of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. At the start of this campaignwe talked hereabout how, in a strange way, they are an odd couple who share some traits. And on the trail that has been shown, again and again, to be the case. Boris Johnson fascinates some people, who are desperate to shake his hand, eager as children when there are free sweets on offer. But for others he is simply not someone they can trust, who they may even back, but will fill in their ballots wearing kid gloves. As one voter in Cardiff told me last week, she had backed Labour all her life, but then had voted Leave, so will now back Boris Johnson, having flirted with the idea of voting for the Brexit Party. She had this parting shot: ""I hope he's not lying."" Boris Johnson delivers a speech to factory workers in the Midlands None of our campaign journeys have provided scientific evidence of the Conservatives cruising to an enthusiastic majority. Seeing Jeremy Corbyn on the trail, there is no doubting how much the party members who turn up to Labour's organised election events believe in him. They talk of ""the movement"", of big change coming. He is greeted by smaller crowds, perhaps, than in 2017, but by big Labour audiences nonetheless, delighted to see him and sing along to the now-familiar, ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chorus. But Labour candidates talk privately, again and again, of how his perceived unpopularity among many traditional voters is the block to a Labour majority. But the enthusiasm for Boris Johnson, where it exists, is more jaded than during the referendum of 2016. Likewise, the delight at Jeremy Corbyn is dimmed compared with the crowds that we saw greet him in 2017. Jeremy Corbyn at a Labour rally in Birmingham One man today told me, with tears gathering in the corner of his eyes, that he was so cross about this election because he believed that it had to happen because politicians have made such a mess of the last few years, and obviously upset that the choices were limited in his view, to a decision between two men, neither of whom he trusts. As we enter the final week of this campaign though, we will see from the two main protagonists a repetition of their core messages, rather than a grand invitation to inspire. For the Tories that will be - yes, you guessed it - to resolve Brexit, to remove the biggest question mark that's been hanging over British politics for three years now. Not, of course, what the world will look like after the trade deal that could be done with Brussels (or not) - but whether we actually leave or not. And for Labour, it will be punching at the bruises that nearly a decade of a squeeze on public spending has created. There are of course many other issues that might and will raise their heads in the time that's left. It's of course extremely hard to read how the national polls and sentiment on the ground will translate into the final numbers. But - unless something very strange happens in the next seven days - those pretty stable party positions are likely to result in the Conservatives being the biggest party, but not necessarily clearing the hurdle that will see them returning to government with a majority. And unlike the deeply dramatic election and referendum campaigns we have seen in the past few years, perhaps - just whisper it - in the run-up to this particular polling day, nothing has changed.

"TV election debates are still a bit of a novelty in the UK. Each time an election is called, there's the question of whether any will take place, how they will be organised and who will take part. Broadcasters are still experimenting - this time putting on two-way debates, seven-way debates, a climate change debate and a special youth audience debate, among other permutations. So is there room for improvement? And, if so, what might that look and sound like? Here are some expert suggestions. Then Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Ukip leader Paul Nuttall took part in the 2017 debates No-one likes it when leaders interrupt and talk over each other. It puts the focus on confrontation rather than discussion and does little to showcase anyone's qualities as a potential prime minister. As US academic Bryan Van Norden puts it,writing for the Hipporeads website,external, ""There is absolutely no professional or political context in which elegantly interrupting others or being interrupted by others is a useful skill."" He suggests simply switching off leaders' microphones when it's not their turn to speak. As soon as each person has finished talking, off it goes and the next one turns on. Knowing they will go silent could also stop them ""filibustering"", or trying to run down the clock by refusing to stop talking. How to watch the BBC's prime ministerial debate on Friday Tony Benn and Roy Jenkins debated each other in 1975, with David Dimbleby moderating UK televised debates tend to feature glitzy sets, rows of podiums and heavy intervention from moderators. They are also often quite short by international standards. Time can therefore be tight and the result heavy on soundbites and low on substance. It wasn't always like this. One of the UK's earliest televised political debates was between rival Labour frontbenchers Roy Jenkins and Tony Benn during the 1975 European referendum campaign. They debated the single issue for 50 minutes, with no studio audience, no fancy set and very little intervention. Its often viewed now as a model of ""proper"" debate - two intellectual heavyweights tussling with serious issues, listening to each other's points and responding reasonably. The French presidential debates have run on a similar no-frills model since the 1970s. Candidates sit across a table and there's no studio audience. The most recent, between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, lasted two-and-a-half hours and drew an audience of 16.5 million. It was brutal, with the pair trading bitter insults, ""but it didn't half make for riveting viewing,"" saidBBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield. ""[A]nd at the end of the day, the debate did its job."" No one who watched was left in any doubt who stood for what. This video can not be played What they're afraid of - a misjudged debate remark haunted Dan Quayle for the rest of his career If we can't trust politicians to get facts right and tell the truth, then having debates at all is pointless. Much effort already goes into fact-checking, with the likes of independent fact-checking charity Full Fact and theBBC's Reality Checkdeploying journalists to scour statistics and consult experts in order to verify politicians' claims. Viewers can get updates online during debates or read the verdicts afterwards. But of course not everyone does this, meaning politicians might not be adequately held to account. So the race is on to speed up fact-checking and put it at the heart of the debates themselves. The BBC News channel already uses on-screen Reality Check ""push-backs"" - or text boxes - during its live debate broadcasts. And Full Fact has started live checking for other broadcasters, such as LBC. But as Will Moy, Full Fact's chief executive, says, ""It's something audiences really want but it's hard to do it fast enough to make it matter."" The game-changer looks likely to be the use of artificial intelligence. Full Fact is developing software that can check facts far faster than humans, training machines to spot claims and trawl for data which can prove them right or wrong, So the day when we see automated fact-checks appearing on TV screens in real time during debates may not be far off. Back in 2010 the UK's first modern TV election debate took place in front of a respectful and hushed studio audience, There was no jeering or cheering and they were banned from clapping. Since then, audiences have become more vocal, with spectators cheering, clapping and even booing. It can feel a bit like Punch and Judy. Dr Nick Anstead, associate professor at the London School of Economics' media and communications department, thinks we should go back to silence - and aim for an audience of genuinely undecided voters. ""It would at the very least remove the distortion of the audiences we now tend to have. It would change the atmosphere in the studio and make it less of a bear pit."" CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external MANIFESTO GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external ""Politicians have yet to connect emotionally with audiences,"" says one expert Debates routinely involve ordinary members of the public - often by asking them to submit questions for politicians to answer. But this could be taken further. Stephen Coleman, professor of political communication at the University of Leeds, suggests asking people to send in video clips about their lives and problems, which could be sprung on the leaders mid-debate. ""What specifically will you do to help this person?"" they could be asked. Or could broadcasters rip up the debate formula altogether and task politicians with convincing a real voter, while the cameras roll? Matthew Flinders, professor of politics at the University of Sheffield would like to see ""not a debate but a conversation with someone picked out from the public, who would sit down and get to know the politician, understand about their life, where they're coming from and how that flows into their their policies and beliefs."" It could make it harder for politicians to wriggle out of questions and expose them to intense scrutiny - but it would also give them the chance to come across as ""normal"". This could be electoral gold dust: ""It's an element that's been missing so far, No politician has really made an emotional connection with voters,"" Prof Flinders says. Since the UK has never settled on rules for debates, broadcasters and politicians must thrash them out each time. This year the Lib Dems and SNP went to the court to challenge ITV's decision not to include Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon in its prime ministerial debate - though the challenge was rejected. Dr Anstead says there are three conflicting dynamics surrounding debates: the politicians, who want to get their messages across and ""will do anything to avoid generating a negative clip that could go viral""; the broadcasters ""who just want to make good TV""; and ""the democratic need to actually inform voters"". Although politicians and broadcasters would dispute this characterisation, the absence of proper rules means the ""first two are dominating at the moment"", says Dr Anstead. Like the US, Canada has an independent commission tasked with organising official election debates. There are clear rules, consistent formulas for deciding who gets to be in which debates and they are the same from year to year. In the UK, Sky News has been pressing for something similar, with its Make Debates Happen campaign. This year its petition received more than 140,000 signatures and was debated in Parliament. The government's response? ""Televised election debates are a matter for political parties.The government has no plans,externalto change electoral law to make the debates mandatory.""

"This video can not be played 'Sydney's mega fire is getting out of control' A ""mega blaze"" raging across a 60km (37 mile) front north-west of Sydney cannot currently be put out, Australian fire officials have warned. The fire across almost 300,000 hectares (1,150 sq miles) is an hour's drive from the nation's most-populous city. People who cannot defend their property from approaching fires have been told they should leave immediately. Since October, bushfires have killed six people and destroyed more than 700 homes across Australia. The severity of the blazes so early in the fire season has caused alarm, and prompted calls for greater action to tackle climate change. Why Australia's bushfire threat will continue The climate phenomenon linking floods and bushfires How are animals faring in the fires? Victim takes charred home to parliament Fires have also raged across Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. Several fires have combined to form the Gospers Mountain mega blaze, which is more than 283,000 ha in size. At 12:00 local time Saturday (01:00 GMT) 95 fires were burning, with half yet to be contained,the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (NSW RFS) tweeted.,external It said that more than 2,200 firefighters ""were out in the field"".

At one point on Friday, nine fires had been raised to emergency level warnings, although these decreased markedly amid a brief respite in conditions later in the day. The blazes north of Sydney were sending black fumes across the city, causing a rise in medical problems. NSW RFS deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers told national broadcaster ABC: ""We cannot stop these fires, they will just keep burning until conditions ease, and then we'll try to do what we can to contain them."" He said the 60km stretch from Hawkesbury to Singleton was ""just fire that whole way"". Video footage from the Orangeville area showed firefighters running from a wall of fire and the Walkabout Wildlife Park has evacuated hundreds of animals. Fire officials in Ingleburn warned: ""If your property is not prepared for the bushfire season and you're not sure you are able or capable of defending your property if a fire approaches you need to leave straight away."" Firefighters from Canada were briefed in Sydney on Friday and will be deployed across New South Wales over the weekend, to be joined by teams from the US. There was some respite overnight but another dry and windy day is predicted. ""They were able to strengthen a number of containment lines [overnight]... in preparation of some of those challenging conditions we are expecting this afternoon,"" RFS Chief Superintendent Ben Millington told the ABC. But he added: ""We're not out of the woods yet."" A smoky haze has enveloped much of Sydney Tuesday is the next big concern, with temperatures inland of Sydney likely to reach above 40C (104F). Some firefighters have expressed concern that volunteer numbers might not be enough and that there are inadequate water supplies. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said that ""some fires were too big to put out"" while the NSW RFS said late Friday the blazes would only be extinguished ""when we get good rain"". This video can not be played Firefighters flee intense flames in Sydney, in a video shared by them to show the dangers of bushfires Sydney may be blanketed in smoke for weeks, if not months. It hasn't come close to the fatalities of 2009, when nearly 200 people died, but the scale of the damage has been huge. How bad is bushfire smoke for health? Toxic smoke affects golfers at Australian Open More than 1.6 million hectares of land have burned in New South Wales alone. The season has hit earlier than normal and has been exacerbated by drought conditions. RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said: ""There is an absolute lack of moisture in the soil, a lack of moisture in the vegetation... you are seeing fires started very easily and they are spreading extremely quickly, and they are burning ridiculously intensely."" The BOM says thatclimate change has led to an increase in extreme heat events,externaland raised the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. Last week, the bureau noted that NSW had endured its driest spring season on record. It also warned that Australia's coming summer was predicted to bring similar conditions to last year's - the nation's hottest summer on record.

"This video can not be played Greta at UN climate change talks - one year apart Swedish activist Greta Thunberg says young people are ""bringing change"" to the Madrid climate talks and will not be silenced. At a news conference Miss Thunberg said that she hoped the negotiations would yield ""something concrete"" The 16-year-old was mobbed by press and spectators when she visited the conference centre earlier on Friday. She had to be escorted away for her own safety amid shouts of ""leave her alone"" from concerned observers. Having arrived via overnight train from Lisbon to large crowds waiting for her in Madrid, Miss Thunberg was set to join a large demonstration in favour of rapid climate action this evening. Speaking before the gathering she said that the voices of the young would not be drowned out. ""People want everything to continue like now and they are afraid of change,"" she told reporters. ""And change is what we young people are bringing and that is why they want to silence us and that is just a proof that we are having an impact that our voices are being heard that they try so desperately to silence us."" This video can not be played Greta Thunberg was protected by police as she arrived in Madrid Miss Thunberg is due to address the climate negotiations that have been going on in Madrid for the past week. She remains hopeful that they will lead to a positive outcome. ""I sincerely hope that COP25 will lead to something concrete and it will lead to also to an increase in awareness in people in general and that the world leaders and people in power grab the urgency of the climate crisis because right now it  doesn't seem like they are,"" she said. ""We will do everything we can to show that this is something that cannot be ignored, that they cannot just hide away any longer."" Miss Thunberg has arrived in Europe after a voyage across the Atlantic by yacht. Climate summit told of nation's 'fight to death' Greta Thunberg: People underestimate 'angry kids' Massive Attack help create carbon-zero tours Critical year for climate change begins in Madrid The hope among many here is that the scale of the march and her speech to the COP next week will give a big boost to the talks process that seem badly in need of a lift. This COP started with great hope last Monday, with strong words from the UN secretary-general and others,warning that time is running outand that negotiators should be guided by the science. Since then, the urgency has given way to frustration. Little obvious progress is being made on the central question of raising countries' ambitions to cut carbon. Indeed, UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said the issue of increased pledges wasn't even on the agenda for the final outcome of this conference. ""We don't have in the agenda one item that's called 'ambition' and, therefore, it's not like we are expecting to have a specific decision on that."" In the face of several recent scientific reports stating that countries were falling further behind when it came to meeting the Paris agreement targets, this was a little disturbing, to say the least. UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa According to some experts at these talks, extra ambition would be great but equally important would be a firm timetable to deliver their pledges over the next 12 months, ahead of the Glasgow COP this time next year. Right now, that's not certain. ""It would be extremely concerning if the countries here in Madrid did not agree that there is a timeline for next year in coming forward with their commitments,"" said David Waskow from the World Resources Institute. ""That is a key outcome that we have to see here. It is not something that you can keep punting further and further away, this is something that requires immediate action."" Even the Pope is concerned. ""We must seriously ask ourselves if there is the political will to allocate with honesty, responsibility and courage, more human, financial and technological resources to mitigate the negative effects of climate change,"" Pope Francis said in a message to participants here. Much of what happens in Madrid could be governed by what happens in Brussels next week where aEuropean Green Deal,externalis set to be outlined by the incoming EU Commission. ""What the European Union does next week is a critical signal to the rest of the world that will shape the outcome in Madrid,"" said David Waskow. ""What happens in Brussels will resonate in Madrid."" Protestors at the COP showed the continuing influence of coal on the climate Another ongoing issue that is making people upset here is the question of climate justice. Much attention has been focussed on the attempts by poorer countries to finally get some traction around the question of loss and damage, the impacts of climate change from events that just can't be adapted to, such as sea-level rise or storms made more likely by rising temperatures. The hope from many is that here in Madrid, the developing nations would be heard and a mechanism with funding would be set up to deal with loss and damage. Again, there's been very little progress. Of course the question of climate justice is not just between countries but often within countries as well. ""The ones who contributed the most are the ones who feel the impacts the least,"" said Isadora Cardoso from campaign groupGenderCC - women for climate justice,external. ""Even within developed countries the poorest are the most affected whenever there are climate disasters or impacts, but they are not the ones who consume more and contribute the most to the causes of climate change."" There is still time to ensure a strong outcome in Madrid and the arrival of ministers next week will increase the sense of urgency - but right now there's a big disconnect between the size of the task and the willingness of countries to step forward with the pledges and the money needed to deal with the biggest challenge facing Planet Earth.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn reveals ""secret"" government Brexit report Jeremy Corbyn has said a leaked document obtained by Labour shows Boris Johnson is ""misrepresenting"" his Brexit deal and the ""devastating"" impact it will have on Northern Ireland. He called the paper ""hard evidence"" NI would be ""symbolically separated"" from the rest of the UK after Brexit, with customs checks on goods. Mr Johnson has repeatedly said there will be no border in the Irish Sea. He dismissed Labour's claims as ""complete nonsense"". Asked about the document during a campaign visit in Kent, Mr Johnson said he had not seen it but insisted his agreement would offer ""unfettered access"" to the British market for Northern Ireland businesses. The Conservatives said the leaked Treasury document was an ""immediate assessment, not a detailed analysis"". Live: Latest from the campaign trail Johnson and Corbyn set for head-to-head TV clash PM urges Corbyn to reconsider votes for EU citizens It had not been written for ""decision-making purposes"" or been seen by the PM, the chancellor or ""any of the senior officials involved in the negotiations"", the party added. But the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who oppose the agreement, said it had warned Mr Johnson that it would be bad for Northern Ireland and this was ""further evidence"". The row comes as the leaders prepare for the last TV debate of the election on BBC One on Friday at 20:30. Ahead of the encounter, Labour sought to increase the pressure on the prime minister, who hasclaimed his agreement with the EUon the terms of the UK's withdrawal will ""get Brexit done"" by 31 January. Mr Johnson has said the whole of the UK will leave the EU at the same time and that there will be no checks on any goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK. At a press conference in London, Mr Corbyn said the 15-page Treasury document - titled Northern Ireland Protocol: Unfettered Access to the UK Internal Market - disproved this and showed Mr Johnson's claims about his own deal were ""fraudulent"". By John Campbell, the BBC's Northern Ireland business and economics editor The analysis in this leaked document matches that published in a government risk assessment in October. The initial study said the PM's deal could mean a reduction in business investment, consumer spending and trade in Northern Ireland. But this time the language is even blunter and confirms the worst fears of unionists. It concludes that the deal would see ""Northern Ireland symbolically separated from the Union."" And it once again suggests the government has not been straight about the extent of new red tape on trade across the Irish Sea. Page one of the document says ""at a minimum exit summary declarations will be required when goods are exported from NI to GB"". The prime minister has repeatedly said those declarations would not be required. ""What we have here is a confidential report by Johnson's own government, marked official, sensitive, that exposes the falsehoods that Boris Johnson has been putting forward,"" he said. ""This is cold, hard evidence that categorically shows the impact a damaging Brexit deal would have on large parts of our country, 15 pages that paint a damning picture of Johnson's deal on the issue of Northern Ireland in particular."" As well as customs and security checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, he said goods moving the other way would be subject to regulatory and rules of origin checks and potentially tariffs - which would force up prices and be highly ""disruptive"". No checks on goods between NI and GB, says PM NI firms to declare GB-bound goods under new deal ""This drives a coach and horses through Boris Johnson's claim that there will be no border in the Irish Sea."" Before he succeeded Theresa May as prime minister, Mr Johnson told the DUP's annual conference in 2018 that no UK government could agree to any border in the Irish Sea. Mr Corbyn said this showed Mr Johnson's word could not be trusted. But the prime minister said his agreement was superior to his predecessor's as it would give the Stormont Assembly the power to decide whether to remain aligned with the EU after four years. Mr Johnson said the only checks would be on British exports to the Republic of Ireland going via Northern Ireland. BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said this was not correct, as the agreement actually envisaged checks at Northern Irish ports on British goods not formally bound for the Republic, with items ""at risk"" of being transported on there being liable for duties. This Treasury document sets out things that trade experts have been saying pretty clearly, but that the government has refused to accept. Boris Johnson's EU Withdrawal Agreement says customs declarations and documentary and physical checks on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland will be ""highly disruptive to the Northern Ireland economy"". The document notes that 98% of businesses that export to Great Britain are small and medium businesses that are ""likely to struggle"" to bear the cost. None of this is a huge surprise to anyone committed enough to have read the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland carefully, but it is not what the prime minister has been saying about his own deal. Another striking line from the leaked document says the withdrawal agreement ""has the potential to separate Northern Ireland in practice from whole swathes of the UK's internal market"". That is why, in a nutshell, Mr Johnson lost the support of the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, and it was his lack of a working majority in Parliament that led in turn to this. Under the PM's agreement, Northern Ireland will continue to follow many EU rules on food and manufactured goods, while the rest of the UK will not. Northern Ireland will also continue to follow EU customs rules but will remain part of the UK's customs territory. A government risk assessmentpublished in October said it would lead to new administration and checks on goods from west to east. But Mr Johnson has insisted Northern Irish businesses will not be hit with additional paperwork or fees, telling a BBC phone-in during the campaign that ""we will make sure that businesses face no extra costs and no checks for stuff being exported from NI to GB"". The DUP said it would use whatever influence it had in the next Parliament to push for changes to the agreement. ""Despite the prime minister's protestations, the facts are in black and white,"" said spokesman Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. ""We have demonstrated over the last three years that we will stand up and speak up for Northern Ireland to ensure our economy is not decimated by a bad deal."" Mr Corbyn said Labour's promise of another referendum within six months of his winning power would ""end the division"" over Brexit as well as protecting jobs and the peace in Northern Ireland. Under Labour's plans, voters would get to choose between a ""credible"" renegotiated Leave deal, including a customs union with the EU and a close single market relationship, and staying in the EU under current terms. However, Mr Corbyn again declined to say which way he would vote - saying he would not ""take sides"" so he could faithfully carry out the result. In contrast, his chief Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said he would campaign against the new deal Labour negotiated and back remain. Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said: ""Once again, Jeremy Corbyn is brandishing leaked documents that don't back up his wild conspiracy theories."" But Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said the document showed Mr Johnson's Brexit deal ""would be in fact a knockout blow to the economy of Northern Ireland"". SNP foreign affairs spokesman Stephen Gethins said it made it ""clear"" that ""Scotland will take a disproportionate hit from Boris Johnson's disastrous Tory Brexit deal"". Speaking in Dublin, EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said that under Mr Johnson's Brexit deal Northern Ireland would ""remain in the UK customs territory and, at the same time, benefit from access to the single market without tariffs, quotas, checks or controls"". ""EU state aid and VAT rules will continue to apply in Northern Ireland, under the control of the European Court of Justice,"" he added.

"Joseph McCann was found guilty of 37 offences against 11 victims A man who carried out a string of sex attacks on 11 women and children across England over two weeks has been found guilty of 37 offences. Joseph McCann's victims were aged between 11 and 71 and included three women who were abducted off the street at knifepoint and repeatedly raped. The 34-year-old also tricked his way into a woman's home before tying her up and molesting her son and daughter. McCann, of Harrow, was found guilty of offences including rape and kidnap. The convicted burglar had been released from prison following a probation error in February before he embarked on a cocaine and vodka-fuelled rampage. McCann's ""spree of sex attacks"" started in Watford before moving to London, Greater Manchester and Cheshire over two weeks in April and May. The failures that let Joseph McCann out of prison 'I saw net close in on serial rapist' Hundreds of officers from five forces were deployed in the manhunt before he was finally caught while hiding in a tree. Det Ch Insp Katherine Goodwin, who led the investigation, described him as ""one of the most dangerous sex offenders the country has ever seen"". Jo Farrar, chief executive of HM Prisons and Probation Service, ""apologised unreservedly"" for ""failings"" which led to McCann being released early, adding that ""strong and immediate action"" had been taken against those involved. It can now be reported that four men and two women have been arrested on suspicion of assisting McCann while he was on the run from police following the initial attacks in London. They have been released under investigation. This video can not be played Joseph McCann arrested up a tree in Cheshire On 21 April, McCann grabbed a 21-year-old woman at knifepoint as she walked home from a nightclub in Watford. She was bundled into a car and taken to a house where she was raped until being released later that morning. Four days later, a 25-year-old woman was abducted as she walked home in Walthamstow, east London, just after midnight. She was driven off in a car then repeatedly raped in a number of locations over 14 hours, including outside a school where McCann told her he ""wanted to make her rape a child"". Later the same day, and while still holding the woman prisoner, he snatched a 21-year-old woman in Edgware, north London, as she walked along the street with her sister. She suffered a similar fate to the 25-year-old woman. The pair finally managed to escape when McCann drove to Watford, where he had booked a hotel room, and one of them hit him over the head with a vodka bottle before they fled to get help. McCann was filmed on CCTV at a Watford hotel where he had booked a room for two nights In the early hours of 5 May, McCann tricked his way into the home of a woman he had met in a bar in Greater Manchester. Once inside, he tied her to a bed and molested her 11-year-old son and 17-year-old daughter, who he told ""you are going to Europe tomorrow, you are mine"". The girl, who said she feared becoming a ""sex slave"", managed to escape by jumping naked from a window and alerted police. At about 13:30 the same day, he pounced on a 71-year-old woman while she was loading shopping into her car outside a supermarket and abducted and raped her. Three hours later he also abducted and assaulted a 13-year-old girl in the same car before both managed to get away at Knutsford service station. This video can not be played Footage shows dramatic Joseph McCann police chase At about 18:30 on 5 May, McCann abducted two 14-year-old girls after threatening to ""chop them up with a machete"". He was filmed at a garage buying condoms but was spotted by a police patrol who pursued him while the girls were inside the car. After crashing into a Mercedes, he fled on foot, then caught a taxi. The car was stopped at a police road block but he fled across a field and was finally caught in the early hours of 6 May. The 12 jurors decided the fate of Joseph McCann without ever seeing him in the dock.  Only once did he leave his prison cell for the Old Bailey - and that was to answer questions from the judge when the jury wasn't there. McCann opted out of court proceedings from the moment he was charged in May, refusing to appear before chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot. Instead, in an unprecedented move, she travelled to Belmarsh Prison and convened the hearing there. Before and during the trial, hours were wasted waiting for updates about McCann, with barristers and the judge in almost daily discussions about whether he would turn up and why he had not. Letters were sent to his cell and prison officers were called to give evidence by videolink to confirm he had received them. At one stage, McCann requested a four-week adjournment because he hadn't had enough sleep. Even towards the end, with the prosecution case nearly completed, the jury was kept waiting while McCann weighed up whether he was going to go in the witness box. There were concerns about his health - he didn't eat for days and threatened suicide - but the court's main preoccupation was ensuring he had a fair trial and understood the process even though he chose to be absent from it. However, in the face of overwhelming evidence, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that McCann was playing the system because that was the only option left open to him. Scotland Yard believe McCann used contacts across the country to evade justice as he moved across five police force areas. However, it has been revealed police forces involved in the hunt for McCann failed to share information, meaning he was not identified earlier. On his arrest, McCann even told officers: ""If you had caught me for the first two, the rest of this wouldn't have happened."" Hertfordshire Constabulary identified him the day after the first attack in Watford and added his name to the police national computer. But the Met did not identify McCann as being involved in the two London attacks until 28 April after a call from a member of the public, despite them liaising with their Hertfordshire counterparts on 25 April. McCann was filmed at a McDonalds drive-thru while one of his victims was in the car McCann fled on foot after crashing a car into a Mercedes McCann, who is facing a life sentence, is due to be sentenced on Monday. After the verdicts were reached, the jury sent a note to the judge saying they wished to acknowledge the bravery of the victims and the hard work of the police forces involved. The 34-year-old never appeared in court during the trial but was convicted of: Ten counts of false imprisonment Seven counts of rape One count of rape of a child Two counts of causing or inciting a person to engage in sexual activity without consent Seven counts of kidnap One count of attempted kidnap Three counts of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity Three counts of assault by penetration One count of sexual assault Two counts of committing a sexual offence with intent The failures that let Joseph McCann out of prison Rape accused 'threatened to chop up girls' Boys 'tried to fight off' alleged serial rapist Rape-accused 'kidnapped woman, 71, outside shop' Rape-accused's victim' feared being sex slave' Rape-accused 'caught on CCTV' at hotel Vodka bottle used 'to end 14-hour rape ordeal' Alleged rapist 'told victim to call him daddy' Man embarked on 'series of depraved sex attacks' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Police block pro-Palestine protest from gathering close to London synagogue Best Valentineâs Day gifts for her 2025 Tough test as Town resume chase for title Which parts of Southwark saw the most crime in 2024?

"This video can not be played Corbyn vs Johnson: BBC election debate roundup Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over Brexit in the final head-to-head debate before the 12 December election. During the live debate, Mr Corbyn said Labour would bring Brexit ""to an end"" by negotiating a new deal and putting it back to the public in a referendum, alongside a Remain option. Mr Johnson said he had ""a wonderful deal"", and would use it to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January. Other topics covered included the NHS, security and Northern Ireland. Early on in the debate - hosted by Today presenter Nick Robinson - the Labour leader said he would negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the EU within three months before putting it to a final say referendum - alongside Remain - within six months. The prime minister countered by saying he already had a withdrawal agreement in place, and would use it to leave the EU next month if he won a working majority in Parliament. But Nick Robinson challenged Mr Johnson, pointing out that while he had a withdrawal deal in place, he did not have a trade deal with the EU, and so could not rule out a no-deal exit in January 2021. Kuenssberg: No fireworks moment in debate Corbyn and Johnson TV debate fact-checked Five key things in the BBC's Johnson-Corbyn debate Who should I vote for? Election 2019 manifesto guide Coming into the event, Labour and the Conservatives had spent the day arguing over how Mr Johnson's Brexit deal might affect Northern Ireland. Laboursaid a leaked document showedMr Johnson's agreement would have a ""devastating"" impact on Northern Ireland. When the subject arose in the debate, Mr Corbyn said of his rival: ""He spoke at a DUP conference and said there would be no [trade] restrictions [after Brexit] whatsoever, we now know there are restrictions."" But Mr Johnson was met with applause from the audience when he said he found it ""slightly curious"" to be lectured about the union by Mr Corbyn, referring to the Labour leader's past support for those who want to see a united Ireland. This video can not be played Corbyn and Johnson clash over NHS Like Brexit, the NHS has featured heavily in the campaign so far - and Friday's debate was no different. Faith, a student nurse in the audience, asked how each leader would deal with a shortage of NHS nurses. The Conservative leader said a government run by him would ""encourage nurses overseas to come"" to the UK ""by shortening the time for their visa applications"" and by reintroducing bursaries for training. Mr Corbyn described the NHS as at ""breaking point"", adding that, under a Labour government, ""Â£40bn in total would go into the NHS in order to fund it properly"". The Labour leader also repeated one of his main attack lines of the campaign - that a Tory government would allow the NHS to form part of a future trade deal with the US. However, Mr Johnson described that claim as ""Bermuda Triangle stuff"". Responding to the performances of Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""That was utterly woeful. Two uninspiring men, both of them unsuited to be PM."" Meanwhile, Amelia Womack, of the Green Party, told the BBC: ""I find it frustrating, as a younger woman, that we weren't discussing things that are relevant to my generation - whether that's house prices, rental prices, freedom of movement across Europe, or even zero-hour contracts."" Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said the debate felt like a ""shoddy end-of-term pantomime"", and said both men displayed a ""lack of honesty"". She added that, contrary to the claims of Mr Johnson, the ""chaos"" of Brexit ""is going to go on"", even if the UK leaves the EU next month. And the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""Tonight's debate was British politics at its worst. Two leaders offering nothing new, nothing different and neither being honest about the pain Brexit will cause our communities."" The prime minister and Mr Corbyn were also asked about security - an issue that has risen to prominence sincethe London Bridge attack on 29 November. Both candidates were asked by an audience member if they would prioritise the safety of citizens over human rights. Mr Corbyn said the choice was ""not an either/or"". He added the UK could not have security ""on the cheap"", and so Labour would ""back the police up"" with an increase in officer numbers. When it came to his turn, Mr Johnson referred to the London Bridge attack, and said it was ""extraordinary and wrong"" that the attacker was given automatic early release from prison after an earlier terrorism conviction. In a campaign where both parties have sought to repeatedly talk about their key themes, tonight did not diverge radically from the script. Boris Johnson came under pressure on the issue of trust - and whether his Brexit plan would mean checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn was once again pressed on his failure to pick a side on Brexit - and questioned on why Europe would offer Labour a new deal when so many frontbenchers back Remain. Both men landed punches. But none of them were critical. And given that polls suggest the Conservatives are ahead in the polls - that might suit Boris Johnson more than Jeremy Corbyn.

"Sir John Major has urged people to re-elect three MPs who were expelled from the Conservatives for voting against Boris Johnson over Brexit. The ex-Tory PM is backing independent candidates David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton, all running against his party in the general election. Sir John said ""tribal loyalties"" had been loosened by Brexit. But Mr Johnson described the comments as ""very sad"" and ""wrong"", calling his predecessor's views ""outdated"". The Conservatives say they will take the UK out of the EU in January if they win a parliamentary majority. They say this honours the result of the 2016 referendum, in which 52% of people backed Leave. Tories promise Brexit and Budget in first 100 days PM urges Corbyn to reconsider votes for EU citizens LIVE: The latest from the election campaign In September, 21 MPs were expelled from the parliamentary Conservative Partyafter they had voted against the possibility of the prime minister pursuing a no-deal exit from the EU. Later, 10 of the MPs were allowed back. Of the remainder, Mr Gauke, Mr Grieve and Ms Milton are all running as independents in the seats they held at the 2017 general election. In a video message, Sir John, a prominent Remain campaigner, described Brexit as ""the worst foreign policy decision in my lifetime"". He called Mr Gauke, Mr Grieve and Ms Milton ""principled, decent human beings"". He added: ""None of them has left the Conservative Party; the Conservative Party has left them. This video can not be played Boris Johnson ""sad"" at John Major's call to back rebels ""Without such talent on its benches, Parliament will be the poorer, which is why - if I were resident in any one of their constituencies - they would have my vote."" In response, Mr Johnson said he disagreed with his ""illustrious predecessor"". He added: ""I think it's very sad and I think that he is wrong, and I think that he represents a view that is outdated, alas, greatly that I respect him and his record ""And I think that what we need to do now is honour the will of the people and get Brexit done."" Another former prime minister, Labour's Tony Blair, warned that Brexit ""won't be over"" in January. He added that it was ""undemocratic"" to be ""mixing up Brexit with a general election"" . Mr Blair also said: ""Brexit is the substitute of a comforting delusion for the discomforting challenge of a changing world."" Mr Johnson says a Conservative government would be able to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020. Mr Gauke was among those who disputed whether this was possible within the timeline suggested by the prime minister. But Mr Johnson said the UK was in a ""zero-tariff, zero-quota position"" already, which would make the talks easier. Mr Gauke said he was ""delighted"" to have backing from Sir John, who ""represents the best traditions of the Conservative Party"". And Mr Grieve said he had been an ""outstanding PM and Conservative whose moderation and common sense put Mr Johnson to shame"". Speaking on a visit in Hampshire, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said the ex-PM's intervention showed Mr Johnson had taken the Conservative Party ""off to the extreme"". ""This is a party that bears no resemblance to the One Nation Conservatives that many moderate people in this country have appreciated and that's one of the reasons so many of those people are now going to be voting Liberal Democrat,"" she said. Sir John, who was prime minister between 1990 and 1997, is a long-standing critic of the government's Brexit plans. In September, he joineda lawsuit against the suspension of Parliament by Mr Johnson,arguing it was designed to stop MPs being able to prevent a no-deal Brexit on the then deadline of 31 October. The Supreme Court declared the suspension unlawful.

"Plenty of promises have been made by politicians in the election campaign - but what big issues haven't cut through? One of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's favourite slogans, Global Britain, doesn't actually appear in the Conservative manifesto. There have been arguments about potential post-Brexit trade deals with the US. Global issues such as climate change have featured prominently. And international issues were discussed during the Nato summit. But in-depth discussions about the kind of relationship the UK might want with the rest of the EU, if Brexit was to happen, have largely been avoided. Trade talks, both with the EU and other countries around the world, could be a dominant political issue for years to come. But the choices that would have to be made, and the effect they could have on businesses up and down the country, haven't been addressed in any detail. Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? Rolled-over UK free trade deals 'are incomplete' More than 78,000 children in England are now being cared for by local authorities, according to the latest official statistics - a new high. And in the last decade,the number of inquiries carried out because of fears a child is at risk, has increased by 139%, or 120,000.,externalAt the same time, council budgets have been cut. The problems of increasing demand and shrinking finances are well known to politicians from the crisis in adult social care. But the acute difficulties also facing children's services have not been high-profile during the election. The major party manifestos acknowledge the system's need for review and investment, but timescales are less clear. They say: Labour will review the care system and rebuild early intervention The Conservatives will review the care system and improve the Troubled Families programme The Lib Dems will invest in children's centres and increase free childcare The reasons for the pressures are complicated but academics say rising poverty and cuts to services providing early support for problems are factors. Councils have a legal duty to step in if a child needs protecting and many are overspending to do this. It is a growing, unpredictable cost pushing more and more authorities towards a financial precipice. Tragically, it is also a sign many young lives are in turmoil. Children's services 'at breaking point', MPs say Children's mental health services 'postcode lottery' How children's services cuts are affecting one family Universities have been under the cosh over high fees, grade inflation and overpaying their bosses. So the talk has been about curbing their ambitions. But this entirely ducks the urgent need to expand university places, because they are facing a massive demographic bulge. In the past decade the school population has risen by more than 725,000 - and this surge is about to hit universities. The Higher Education Policy Institute suggests another 300,000 university places will be needed in the next decade to keep pace. It would be the equivalent of 12 new universities the size of those in Warwick or Southampton, or 20 the size of the Universities of Hull or Essex. Families with ambitions for their children to go to university are unlikely to accept them being squeezed out. And this could be an opportunity to build entirely new universities to regenerate areas. But, so far, there are no signs of planning for something imminently needed. More students apply to study medicine Oxford University promises 25% of places to disadvantaged Could changes in university funding limit student places? The number of free cash machines is falling and politicians have been clamouring for machine operators and banks to do more over the past couple of years. In their manifestos, Labour says it will ban ATM charges and the SNP says it will fight against ATM closures. Being able to take cash out has become harder in recent years. And, according to consumer group Which?,machines are disappearing fastest in the poorest areas of the country.The UK is certainly moving towards becoming a cashless society but it's a way off giving up physical money altogether. It is not just the elderly who are struggling. Within the past couple of weeks, another IT failure at TSB has shown the hot water people find themselves in when payments are not made and they cannot get hold of cash. Free cash machines vanishing at alarming rate, says Which? Cash or no cash - where do you stand? Battle to save remote cash machines Something almost all the parties have ducked is the nightmare question of how to handle rising seas: which areas of the country to save and which to abandon. Only the Labour Party's manifesto mentions a key phrase, ""managed realignment"", which, in the language of flood planners, is code for drawing a new coastline. As the oceans warm and the ice caps melt, the level of the waters is increasing - only by a few millimetres a year but raising the spectre of having to decide where to invest in coastal defences and where not to. Stretches of the Lincolnshire coast, the Humber estuary, Norfolk, and the west coast of Wales are among the UK's vulnerable areas. The awkward fact is despite all the pledges for boosted spending on flood protection, there is nowhere near enough funding to keep the entire UK shore safe. The Treasury allocates funding in a way that favours urban areas, so cities and towns get new barriers. By and large, villages and farmland lose out and almost certainly will in future. But which politician wants to say that out loud? Listen: The UK villages feeling the impact of climate change Five ways climate change could affect the UK CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external ELECTION EXPLAINED:Explore our explainers pieces No party's manifesto contains the unpopular measures required to fix growing generational inequality. For young people to afford family homes would require not just cheaper mortgages but lower house prices. Those wanting to climb the housing ladder would benefit because, other things being equal, the price of their current place would fall by less than that of the one they were buying. But a policy goal of lower house prices might frighten floating voters. To help the housing crisis, parties have come up with some policies: The Conservatives say they will introduce new long-term fixed rate mortgages Labour says it will deliver a new social housebuilding programme of more than a million homes over a decade The Lib Dems say they will build at least 100,000 homes for social rent each year The Green Party says it will let local councils bring empty houses back into use. Meanwhile, pensioners' incomes (net of housing costs) are now higher than those of people of working age. Why then do working people pay higher taxes for state pensions to rise, despite being on lower incomes than the minority of those who benefit? The answer lies, one suspects, in the grey vote. Cutting universal pensioner benefits or scrapping the triple-lock state pension protection might make fiscal sense. It's absent from the manifestos, one suspects, because lots of pensioners make sure they vote. Under-30s 'spend less than same age group in 2001' Seven reasons it helps to have rich parents It's set to cost Â£9.3bn and is one of the largest and most complex projects ever undertaken by the Home Office. But there is no mention in any manifesto of the Emergency Services Network (ESN), a new communications system for the police, fire and ambulance services in England, Scotland and Wales, which has been beset by delays and overspends. ESN is due to replace the current service, Airwave, in 2022, but the National Audit Office says ""significant risks"" with the project remain and it's unlikely to be delivered on time. There will be huge questions for the incoming home secretary and ministers about whether to persevere with ESN, what the timescale should be if they do and how the programme should be managed - but voters are none the wiser. Emergency services radio system 'Â£3.1bn over budget' Huawei's kit removed from emergency services 4G network The UK has lost the savings habit. An estimated 11 million people do not have Â£100 to fall back on, leaving finances exposed to an unexpected bill. The official savings ratio - the proportion of income after tax people save - has been low in the past three years (6.8% at the last count, compared with up to 14.4% during the 1990s). For those who do still put money aside, the rewards have been pitiful owing to historically low interest rates and the Bank of England pumping more money into the economy, leaving little incentive for banks to offer better rates to savers. All ages are affected - from youngsters to pensioners - and yet, there are no policies to promote saving for a rainy day and none offering a better outlook for committed savers aside from pensions. Some say the state should concentrate on building a stronger economy to bring these rewards. Campaigners would say political parties always have plenty to say about helping those already in debt but little about shoring up finances with savings to prevent those debts building up in the first place. Final day for Help to Buy Isa applications Pension savers 'cash in, but lose out' This can be one of the most visible and upsetting changes to High Streets - often more shocking in towns where begging would until recently have been unknown. People might feel sorry for those begging but also unhappy about a sense of decline and neglect in the communities where they live. None of the parties directly addresses the increased visibility of begging, whether on the streets or on public transport. It is not the same as homelessness or rough sleeping, which are addressed in manifestos. Begging touches on all kinds of sensitive topics - poverty, inequality, addictions, mental-health provision, migration and family breakdown - as well as housing and a sense of towns being left behind. Should there be more interventionist support or more penalties? In their manifestos, Labour, the Lib Dems, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru support scrapping the Vagrancy Act (which allows the police to arrest rough sleepers) to protect the homeless. But what should be the response of the incoming government? Manchester City Council U-turn over Â£100 fines for street beggars Begging could be banned from Birmingham city centre Southampton begging fines removed by council Clarification and update, 6 December, 2019: An earlier version of this article said that children's services were not on the election agenda; that politicians had been quiet on the subject of free ATMs; that ""some MPs"" had supported scrapping the Vagrancy Act.

"This video can not be played 'A responsibility that does not end' - Merkel Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Germany has an unending responsibility to remember the Nazis' war crimes, as she made her first trip while in office to the Auschwitz death camp in Poland. The responsibility was ""part of our national identity"", she said. Her visit comes amid a rise in German anti-Semitism and ahead of the 75th anniversary of the camp's liberation. The Nazi regime murdered an estimated 1.1 million people, the vast majority of them Jewish, at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Horror of Germans targeted in anti-Semitic attack In pictures: Germany Halle gun attack Mrs Merkel was accompanied on her visit by Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and a death camp survivor, 87-year-old Bogdan Stanislaw Bartnikowski. She walked through the notorious ""Arbeit macht frei"" (work sets you free) gates at Auschwitz and then held a minute's silence at the so-called Black Wall, where thousands of prisoners were executed She then moved to the Birkenau site where she gave her speech. Angela Merkel is the third German chancellor to visit the site ""Remembering the crimes... is a responsibility which never ends. It belongs inseparably to our country,"" Mrs Merkel said. ""To be aware of this responsibility is part of our national identity, our self-understanding as an enlightened and free society... a democracy."" Germany continued to have ""deep shame"" for what happened in Auschwitz-Birkenau. ""There are no words to express our sorrow,"" Mrs Merkel said. Mrs Merkel acknowledged the rise of anti-Semitism in her country ""I bow my head before the victims of the Shoah,"" she told the gathered Holocaust survivors. Mrs Merkel also acknowledged the rise of anti-Semitism in her country, saying to combat it ""the history of extermination camps has to be shared"". Mrs Merkel was also accompanied by the president of Germany's Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, and the head of the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma, Romani Rose. Major events are planned for the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops on 27 January. But Mrs Merkel has chosen to go to the site now, and to attend the 10th anniversary ofthe Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation,external, a group that tries to preserve the camp as a memorial and a warning for future generations.

"Workers at insurance market Lloyd's of London have been told to behave during the Christmas party season. Chief executive John Nealtold trade magazine Financial News,externalthat staff have been emailed warning them to be ""particularly careful"". The move by Lloyd's comes after it vowed in September this year to tackle its male-dominated culture. A survey it commissioned found 8% of workers said they had seen sexual harassment in the past 12 months. The centuries-old specialist insurance market, where brokers and insurers meet to do business, commissioned the research after a highly critical reportby Bloomberg Businessweek in March,external. Lloyd's chief John Neal says staff have been told to be ""careful"" It found that female workers had faced inappropriate comments, as well as physical attacks by male colleagues. This followed earlier complaints about excessive alcohol consumption and boorish behaviour during working hours. One in five workers said that they did not believe they had equal opportunities at Lloyd's, regardless of gender. Meanwhile, a quarter said they had observed excessive consumption of alcohol at the marketplace during the past year, while 22% had seen people in the organisation ""turn a blind eye"" to inappropriate behaviour. As part of its plan to encourage a better atmosphere,Lloyd's decided to put posters up in the toilets of pubs near its officein the City of London, urging its staff to report instances of sexual harassment they had witnessed. Thousands of people work at Lloyd's city HQ Lloyd's emphasised that it expected professional behaviour all-year round, not just at Christmas. A spokesman said: ""The message is part of our wider speaking-up campaign in which we have been clear about the standards of behaviour that we expect and our ongoing commitment to cultural change in the market."" The moves by Lloyd's come amid a shift in attitude towards traditionally drink-soaked office parties which can lead to accidents, harassment and lawsuits, as well as excluding teetotallers. Accounting firm BDO will have sober chaperones at its Christmas gatherings, who will be responsible for dealing with emergencies and ensuring workers get home, theFinancial Times reported,external. Lloyd's is not like a traditional insurance firm. It employs about 1,000 staff directly, while about 45,000 work in the market it organises, brokering everything from shipping insurance tocover for space exploration,external. It is unrelated to Lloyds Banking Group, which owns Halifax and Bank of Scotland.

"This video can not be played 'A responsibility that does not end' - Merkel Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Germany has an unending responsibility to remember the Nazis' war crimes, as she made her first trip while in office to the Auschwitz death camp in Poland. The responsibility was ""part of our national identity"", she said. Her visit comes amid a rise in German anti-Semitism and ahead of the 75th anniversary of the camp's liberation. The Nazi regime murdered an estimated 1.1 million people, the vast majority of them Jewish, at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Horror of Germans targeted in anti-Semitic attack In pictures: Germany Halle gun attack Mrs Merkel was accompanied on her visit by Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and a death camp survivor, 87-year-old Bogdan Stanislaw Bartnikowski. She walked through the notorious ""Arbeit macht frei"" (work sets you free) gates at Auschwitz and then held a minute's silence at the so-called Black Wall, where thousands of prisoners were executed She then moved to the Birkenau site where she gave her speech. Angela Merkel is the third German chancellor to visit the site ""Remembering the crimes... is a responsibility which never ends. It belongs inseparably to our country,"" Mrs Merkel said. ""To be aware of this responsibility is part of our national identity, our self-understanding as an enlightened and free society... a democracy."" Germany continued to have ""deep shame"" for what happened in Auschwitz-Birkenau. ""There are no words to express our sorrow,"" Mrs Merkel said. Mrs Merkel acknowledged the rise of anti-Semitism in her country ""I bow my head before the victims of the Shoah,"" she told the gathered Holocaust survivors. Mrs Merkel also acknowledged the rise of anti-Semitism in her country, saying to combat it ""the history of extermination camps has to be shared"". Mrs Merkel was also accompanied by the president of Germany's Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, and the head of the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma, Romani Rose. Major events are planned for the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops on 27 January. But Mrs Merkel has chosen to go to the site now, and to attend the 10th anniversary ofthe Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation,external, a group that tries to preserve the camp as a memorial and a warning for future generations.

"Sir John Major has urged people to re-elect three MPs who were expelled from the Conservatives for voting against Boris Johnson over Brexit. The ex-Tory PM is backing independent candidates David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton, all running against his party in the general election. Sir John said ""tribal loyalties"" had been loosened by Brexit. But Mr Johnson described the comments as ""very sad"" and ""wrong"", calling his predecessor's views ""outdated"". The Conservatives say they will take the UK out of the EU in January if they win a parliamentary majority. They say this honours the result of the 2016 referendum, in which 52% of people backed Leave. Tories promise Brexit and Budget in first 100 days PM urges Corbyn to reconsider votes for EU citizens LIVE: The latest from the election campaign In September, 21 MPs were expelled from the parliamentary Conservative Partyafter they had voted against the possibility of the prime minister pursuing a no-deal exit from the EU. Later, 10 of the MPs were allowed back. Of the remainder, Mr Gauke, Mr Grieve and Ms Milton are all running as independents in the seats they held at the 2017 general election. In a video message, Sir John, a prominent Remain campaigner, described Brexit as ""the worst foreign policy decision in my lifetime"". He called Mr Gauke, Mr Grieve and Ms Milton ""principled, decent human beings"". He added: ""None of them has left the Conservative Party; the Conservative Party has left them. This video can not be played Boris Johnson ""sad"" at John Major's call to back rebels ""Without such talent on its benches, Parliament will be the poorer, which is why - if I were resident in any one of their constituencies - they would have my vote."" In response, Mr Johnson said he disagreed with his ""illustrious predecessor"". He added: ""I think it's very sad and I think that he is wrong, and I think that he represents a view that is outdated, alas, greatly that I respect him and his record ""And I think that what we need to do now is honour the will of the people and get Brexit done."" Another former prime minister, Labour's Tony Blair, warned that Brexit ""won't be over"" in January. He added that it was ""undemocratic"" to be ""mixing up Brexit with a general election"" . Mr Blair also said: ""Brexit is the substitute of a comforting delusion for the discomforting challenge of a changing world."" Mr Johnson says a Conservative government would be able to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020. Mr Gauke was among those who disputed whether this was possible within the timeline suggested by the prime minister. But Mr Johnson said the UK was in a ""zero-tariff, zero-quota position"" already, which would make the talks easier. Mr Gauke said he was ""delighted"" to have backing from Sir John, who ""represents the best traditions of the Conservative Party"". And Mr Grieve said he had been an ""outstanding PM and Conservative whose moderation and common sense put Mr Johnson to shame"". Speaking on a visit in Hampshire, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said the ex-PM's intervention showed Mr Johnson had taken the Conservative Party ""off to the extreme"". ""This is a party that bears no resemblance to the One Nation Conservatives that many moderate people in this country have appreciated and that's one of the reasons so many of those people are now going to be voting Liberal Democrat,"" she said. Sir John, who was prime minister between 1990 and 1997, is a long-standing critic of the government's Brexit plans.

"This video can not be played Corbyn vs Johnson: BBC election debate roundup Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over Brexit in the final head-to-head debate before the 12 December election. During the live debate, Mr Corbyn said Labour would bring Brexit ""to an end"" by negotiating a new deal and putting it back to the public in a referendum, alongside a Remain option. Mr Johnson said he had ""a wonderful deal"", and would use it to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January. Other topics covered included the NHS, security and Northern Ireland. Early on in the debate - hosted by Today presenter Nick Robinson - the Labour leader said he would negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the EU within three months before putting it to a final say referendum - alongside Remain - within six months. The prime minister countered by saying he already had a withdrawal agreement in place, and would use it to leave the EU next month if he won a working majority in Parliament. But Nick Robinson challenged Mr Johnson, pointing out that while he had a withdrawal deal in place, he did not have a trade deal with the EU, and so could not rule out a no-deal exit in January 2021. Kuenssberg: No fireworks moment in debate Corbyn and Johnson TV debate fact-checked Five key things in the BBC's Johnson-Corbyn debate Who should I vote for? Election 2019 manifesto guide Coming into the event, Labour and the Conservatives had spent the day arguing over how Mr Johnson's Brexit deal might affect Northern Ireland. Laboursaid a leaked document showedMr Johnson's agreement would have a ""devastating"" impact on Northern Ireland. When the subject arose in the debate, Mr Corbyn said of his rival: ""He spoke at a DUP conference and said there would be no [trade] restrictions [after Brexit] whatsoever, we now know there are restrictions."" But Mr Johnson was met with applause from the audience when he said he found it ""slightly curious"" to be lectured about the union by Mr Corbyn, referring to the Labour leader's past support for those who want to see a united Ireland. This video can not be played Corbyn and Johnson clash over NHS Like Brexit, the NHS has featured heavily in the campaign so far - and Friday's debate was no different. Faith, a student nurse in the audience, asked how each leader would deal with a shortage of NHS nurses. The Conservative leader said a government run by him would ""encourage nurses overseas to come"" to the UK ""by shortening the time for their visa applications"" and by reintroducing bursaries for training. Mr Corbyn described the NHS as at ""breaking point"", adding that, under a Labour government, ""Â£40bn in total would go into the NHS in order to fund it properly"". The Labour leader also repeated one of his main attack lines of the campaign - that a Tory government would allow the NHS to form part of a future trade deal with the US. However, Mr Johnson described that claim as ""Bermuda Triangle stuff"". Responding to the performances of Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""That was utterly woeful. Two uninspiring men, both of them unsuited to be PM."" Meanwhile, Amelia Womack, of the Green Party, told the BBC: ""I find it frustrating, as a younger woman, that we weren't discussing things that are relevant to my generation - whether that's house prices, rental prices, freedom of movement across Europe, or even zero-hour contracts."" Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said the debate felt like a ""shoddy end-of-term pantomime"", and said both men displayed a ""lack of honesty"". She added that, contrary to the claims of Mr Johnson, the ""chaos"" of Brexit ""is going to go on"", even if the UK leaves the EU next month. And the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""Tonight's debate was British politics at its worst. Two leaders offering nothing new, nothing different and neither being honest about the pain Brexit will cause our communities."" The prime minister and Mr Corbyn were also asked about security - an issue that has risen to prominence sincethe London Bridge attack on 29 November. Both candidates were asked by an audience member if they would prioritise the safety of citizens over human rights. Mr Corbyn said the choice was ""not an either/or"". He added the UK could not have security ""on the cheap"", and so Labour would ""back the police up"" with an increase in officer numbers. When it came to his turn, Mr Johnson referred to the London Bridge attack, and said it was ""extraordinary and wrong"" that the attacker was given automatic early release from prison after an earlier terrorism conviction. In a campaign where both parties have sought to repeatedly talk about their key themes, tonight did not diverge radically from the script. Boris Johnson came under pressure on the issue of trust - and whether his Brexit plan would mean checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn was once again pressed on his failure to pick a side on Brexit - and questioned on why Europe would offer Labour a new deal when so many frontbenchers back Remain. Both men landed punches. But none of them were critical. And given that polls suggest the Conservatives are ahead in the polls - that might suit Boris Johnson more than Jeremy Corbyn.

"This video can not be played Greta at UN climate change talks - one year apart Swedish activist Greta Thunberg says young people are ""bringing change"" to the Madrid climate talks and will not be silenced. At a news conference Miss Thunberg said that she hoped the negotiations would yield ""something concrete"" The 16-year-old was mobbed by press and spectators when she visited the conference centre earlier on Friday. She had to be escorted away for her own safety amid shouts of ""leave her alone"" from concerned observers. Having arrived via overnight train from Lisbon to large crowds waiting for her in Madrid, Miss Thunberg was set to join a large demonstration in favour of rapid climate action this evening. Speaking before the gathering she said that the voices of the young would not be drowned out. ""People want everything to continue like now and they are afraid of change,"" she told reporters. ""And change is what we young people are bringing and that is why they want to silence us and that is just a proof that we are having an impact that our voices are being heard that they try so desperately to silence us.""

She remains hopeful that they will lead to a positive outcome. ""I sincerely hope that COP25 will lead to something concrete and it will lead to also to an increase in awareness in people in general and that the world leaders and people in power grab the urgency of the climate crisis because right now it  doesn't seem like they are,"" she said.

This COP started with great hope last Monday, with strong words from the UN secretary-general and others,warning that time is running outand that negotiators should be guided by the science. Since then, the urgency has given way to frustration. Little obvious progress is being made on the central question of raising countries' ambitions to cut carbon. Indeed, UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said the issue of increased pledges wasn't even on the agenda for the final outcome of this conference. ""We don't have in the agenda one item that's called 'ambition' and, therefore, it's not like we are expecting to have a specific decision on that."" In the face of several recent scientific reports stating that countries were falling further behind when it came to meeting the Paris agreement targets, this was a little disturbing, to say the least. UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa According to some experts at these talks, extra ambition would be great but equally important would be a firm timetable to deliver their pledges over the next 12 months, ahead of the Glasgow COP this time next year. Right now, that's not certain. ""It would be extremely concerning if the countries here in Madrid did not agree that there is a timeline for next year in coming forward with their commitments,"" said David Waskow from the World Resources Institute. ""That is a key outcome that we have to see here. It is not something that you can keep punting further and further away, this is something that requires immediate action."" Even the Pope is concerned. ""We must seriously ask ourselves if there is the political will to allocate with honesty, responsibility and courage, more human, financial and technological resources to mitigate the negative effects of climate change,"" Pope Francis said in a message to participants here. Much of what happens in Madrid could be governed by what happens in Brussels next week where aEuropean Green Deal,externalis set to be outlined by the incoming EU Commission. ""What the European Union does next week is a critical signal to the rest of the world that will shape the outcome in Madrid,"" said David Waskow. ""What happens in Brussels will resonate in Madrid."" Protestors at the COP showed the continuing influence of coal on the climate Another ongoing issue that is making people upset here is the question of climate justice. Much attention has been focussed on the attempts by poorer countries to finally get some traction around the question of loss and damage, the impacts of climate change from events that just can't be adapted to, such as sea-level rise or storms made more likely by rising temperatures. The hope from many is that here in Madrid, the developing nations would be heard and a mechanism with funding would be set up to deal with loss and damage. Again, there's been very little progress. Of course the question of climate justice is not just between countries but often within countries as well. ""The ones who contributed the most are the ones who feel the impacts the least,"" said Isadora Cardoso from campaign groupGenderCC - women for climate justice,external. ""Even within developed countries the poorest are the most affected whenever there are climate disasters or impacts, but they are not the ones who consume more and contribute the most to the causes of climate change."" There is still time to ensure a strong outcome in Madrid and the arrival of ministers next week will increase the sense of urgency - but right now there's a big disconnect between the size of the task and the willingness of countries to step forward with the pledges and the money needed to deal with the biggest challenge facing Planet Earth.

"In lots of ways this is a complicated election. Derbyshire is not the same as Dundee, Birmingham is not the same as Bangor. Westminster sure isn't the same as Widnes - and London, maybe above all else, isn't the same as Linlithgow, Leeds or Ludlow. There are a multitude of contenders as well - not just the traditional parties, but the SNP and Plaid Cymru, the Brexit Party, what remains of the Independent Group for Change, moveable tribes of party defectors and a clutch of independents as well. But as we enter the last seven days of this election, in our first-past-the-post system, whether you believe it is the best or the worst of all worlds, the choice irrevocably, and inevitably perhaps, moves towards the two big teams - the reds and the blues, and the two big, flawed, characters of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. At the start of this campaignwe talked hereabout how, in a strange way, they are an odd couple who share some traits. And on the trail that has been shown, again and again, to be the case. Boris Johnson fascinates some people, who are desperate to shake his hand, eager as children when there are free sweets on offer. But for others he is simply not someone they can trust, who they may even back, but will fill in their ballots wearing kid gloves. As one voter in Cardiff told me last week, she had backed Labour all her life, but then had voted Leave, so will now back Boris Johnson, having flirted with the idea of voting for the Brexit Party. She had this parting shot: ""I hope he's not lying."" Boris Johnson delivers a speech to factory workers in the Midlands None of our campaign journeys have provided scientific evidence of the Conservatives cruising to an enthusiastic majority. Seeing Jeremy Corbyn on the trail, there is no doubting how much the party members who turn up to Labour's organised election events believe in him. They talk of ""the movement"", of big change coming. He is greeted by smaller crowds, perhaps, than in 2017, but by big Labour audiences nonetheless, delighted to see him and sing along to the now-familiar, ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chorus. But Labour candidates talk privately, again and again, of how his perceived unpopularity among many traditional voters is the block to a Labour majority. But the enthusiasm for Boris Johnson, where it exists, is more jaded than during the referendum of 2016. Likewise, the delight at Jeremy Corbyn is dimmed compared with the crowds that we saw greet him in 2017. Jeremy Corbyn at a Labour rally in Birmingham One man today told me, with tears gathering in the corner of his eyes, that he was so cross about this election because he believed that it had to happen because politicians have made such a mess of the last few years, and obviously upset that the choices were limited in his view, to a decision between two men, neither of whom he trusts. As we enter the final week of this campaign though, we will see from the two main protagonists a repetition of their core messages, rather than a grand invitation to inspire. For the Tories that will be - yes, you guessed it - to resolve Brexit, to remove the biggest question mark that's been hanging over British politics for three years now. Not, of course, what the world will look like after the trade deal that could be done with Brussels (or not) - but whether we actually leave or not. And for Labour, it will be punching at the bruises that nearly a decade of a squeeze on public spending has created. There are of course many other issues that might and will raise their heads in the time that's left. It's of course extremely hard to read how the national polls and sentiment on the ground will translate into the final numbers. But - unless something very strange happens in the next seven days - those pretty stable party positions are likely to result in the Conservatives being the biggest party, but not necessarily clearing the hurdle that will see them returning to government with a majority. And unlike the deeply dramatic election and referendum campaigns we have seen in the past few years, perhaps - just whisper it - in the run-up to this particular polling day, nothing has changed.

"The little boy, identified as Michael, was cheered on by his friends as he was formally adopted A five-year-old boy in Michigan has invited his whole kindergarten class to witness his legal adoption - and warmed hearts across the world. The youngster, identified as Michael, formally joined his new family at Kent County court on Thursday. A photo shared by Kent County on Facebook,externalshowed the little boy relaxing in an adult-sized courtroom chair, next to his adoptive parents. Behind them, his classmates happily waved paper hearts on sticks. During the hearing, each child introduced themselves and explained why they had come to celebrate. ""Michael is my best friend,"" said a small boy named Steven. ""My name is Lily and I love Michael,"" a little girl told Judge Patricia Gardner, who wore a necklace of Christmas decorations for the occasion. ""We began the school year as a family,"" Michael's teacher said. ""Family doesn't have to be DNA, because family is support and love."" The group of classmates, teachers and parents broke into cheers and applause as Michael and his parents banged the judge's gavel, completing the process. The little boy with his new family His friends held up love hearts inside the court Thursday was Kent County court's annual Adoption Day, and 37 children were ""lovingly and officially welcomed by their families"", the county wrote on Facebook. ""Sometimes their journeys have been very long.

""His whole kindergarten class and school being here to say 'we love you,' and 'we support you' and 'we'll be here not only today, but in all the years in the future.'""

"This video can not be played M&D's Tsunami rollercoaster had passed its annual safety check just weeks before Ten victims of the M&D's rollercoaster crash in 2016 have secured Â£1.2m in damages. Seven children were among the people injured in the crash at the theme park in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. It happened after five gondolas on the Tsunami inverted rollercoaster detached from their rails at a bend and fell to the ground. The 10 victims have now successfully sued theme park bosses over physical or psychiatric injuries. M&D's owners have already been fined Â£65,000over health and safety breaches. The company pleaded guilty to charges relating to the Health and Safety at Work Act at Hamilton Sheriff Court in March this year. M&D's Motherwell theme park fined Â£65,000 over Tsunami ride crash HSE completes probe into M&Ds rollercoaster crash M&D's rollercoaster crash: Safety inspector banned Lawyers for the victims said the lives of some of them had been ""permanently and irreversibly affected"". Two boys, aged 11 and 12, suffered serious injuries in the crash David Nellaney, of Digby Brown Solicitors in Glasgow, said it had been proved that the accident would not have happened if the rollercoaster had been properly inspected and maintained by M&D's bosses. He added: ""The failure to do so has had a dramatic and lasting impact on the victims and their families. ""These victims had their lives changed through no fault of their own and while no amount of compensation can undo their pain, it may at least contribute to improving their future."" Two boys, aged 11 and 12, suffered serious injuries - including chest and limb damage - in the incident. Four other boys, a 14-year-old girl and a man and a woman, both aged 19, were also treated in hospital. Craig Chalmers' son was the youngest victim Craig Chalmers' son Ben was the youngest victim and suffered two punctured lungs, a triple pelvic fracture, bruised spleen, bruised kidney and broken femur. The schoolboy also had to be resuscitated twice and spent six days in an induced coma at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. Mr Chalmers told BBC Scotland the settlement offered some closure but said he still had concerns about the park. He said: ""They said they have made changes to improve health and safety. ""Why did they not make it pre-accident? They had numerous near misses, shall we say. ""If they had acted on them could they have prevented the accident? I think 100%."" A police cordon was put in place following the crash The Tsunami, which travelled at up to 40mph through corkscrew turns and loops, never reopened and it was finally dismantled in February 2017. An inspectoran inspector who passed the ride as safe 16 days before the accident was subsequently banned. The theme park was shut for investigations but a partial reopening was sanctioned four days after the accident. It was fully reopened to the public just over three weeks later. M&D Leisure later pleaded guilty to failing to ensure that the rollercoaster was maintained, in efficient working order and in good repair. A health and safety investigation revealed weld repairs on axles of the passenger cars were inadequate, leading to the failure of the axle suspension on the five-car train.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn reveals ""secret"" government Brexit report Jeremy Corbyn has said a leaked document obtained by Labour shows Boris Johnson is ""misrepresenting"" his Brexit deal and the ""devastating"" impact it will have on Northern Ireland. He called the paper ""hard evidence"" NI would be ""symbolically separated"" from the rest of the UK after Brexit, with customs checks on goods. Mr Johnson has repeatedly said there will be no border in the Irish Sea. He dismissed Labour's claims as ""complete nonsense"". Asked about the document during a campaign visit in Kent, Mr Johnson said he had not seen it but insisted his agreement would offer ""unfettered access"" to the British market for Northern Ireland businesses. The Conservatives said the leaked Treasury document was an ""immediate assessment, not a detailed analysis"". Live: Latest from the campaign trail Johnson and Corbyn set for head-to-head TV clash PM urges Corbyn to reconsider votes for EU citizens It had not been written for ""decision-making purposes"" or been seen by the PM, the chancellor or ""any of the senior officials involved in the negotiations"", the party added. But the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who oppose the agreement, said it had warned Mr Johnson that it would be bad for Northern Ireland and this was ""further evidence"". The row comes as the leaders prepare for the last TV debate of the election on BBC One on Friday at 20:30. Ahead of the encounter, Labour sought to increase the pressure on the prime minister, who hasclaimed his agreement with the EUon the terms of the UK's withdrawal will ""get Brexit done"" by 31 January. Mr Johnson has said the whole of the UK will leave the EU at the same time and that there will be no checks on any goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK. At a press conference in London, Mr Corbyn said the 15-page Treasury document - titled Northern Ireland Protocol: Unfettered Access to the UK Internal Market - disproved this and showed Mr Johnson's claims about his own deal were ""fraudulent"". By John Campbell, the BBC's Northern Ireland business and economics editor The analysis in this leaked document matches that published in a government risk assessment in October. The initial study said the PM's deal could mean a reduction in business investment, consumer spending and trade in Northern Ireland. But this time the language is even blunter and confirms the worst fears of unionists. It concludes that the deal would see ""Northern Ireland symbolically separated from the Union."" And it once again suggests the government has not been straight about the extent of new red tape on trade across the Irish Sea. Page one of the document says ""at a minimum exit summary declarations will be required when goods are exported from NI to GB"". The prime minister has repeatedly said those declarations would not be required. ""What we have here is a confidential report by Johnson's own government, marked official, sensitive, that exposes the falsehoods that Boris Johnson has been putting forward,"" he said. ""This is cold, hard evidence that categorically shows the impact a damaging Brexit deal would have on large parts of our country, 15 pages that paint a damning picture of Johnson's deal on the issue of Northern Ireland in particular."" As well as customs and security checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, he said goods moving the other way would be subject to regulatory and rules of origin checks and potentially tariffs - which would force up prices and be highly ""disruptive"". No checks on goods between NI and GB, says PM NI firms to declare GB-bound goods under new deal ""This drives a coach and horses through Boris Johnson's claim that there will be no border in the Irish Sea."" Before he succeeded Theresa May as prime minister, Mr Johnson told the DUP's annual conference in 2018 that no UK government could agree to any border in the Irish Sea. Mr Corbyn said this showed Mr Johnson's word could not be trusted. But the prime minister said his agreement was superior to his predecessor's as it would give the Stormont Assembly the power to decide whether to remain aligned with the EU after four years. Mr Johnson said the only checks would be on British exports to the Republic of Ireland going via Northern Ireland. BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said this was not correct, as the agreement actually envisaged checks at Northern Irish ports on British goods not formally bound for the Republic, with items ""at risk"" of being transported on there being liable for duties. This Treasury document sets out things that trade experts have been saying pretty clearly, but that the government has refused to accept. Boris Johnson's EU Withdrawal Agreement says customs declarations and documentary and physical checks on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland will be ""highly disruptive to the Northern Ireland economy"". The document notes that 98% of businesses that export to Great Britain are small and medium businesses that are ""likely to struggle"" to bear the cost. None of this is a huge surprise to anyone committed enough to have read the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland carefully, but it is not what the prime minister has been saying about his own deal. Another striking line from the leaked document says the withdrawal agreement ""has the potential to separate Northern Ireland in practice from whole swathes of the UK's internal market"". That is why, in a nutshell, Mr Johnson lost the support of the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, and it was his lack of a working majority in Parliament that led in turn to this. Under the PM's agreement, Northern Ireland will continue to follow many EU rules on food and manufactured goods, while the rest of the UK will not. Northern Ireland will also continue to follow EU customs rules but will remain part of the UK's customs territory. A government risk assessmentpublished in October said it would lead to new administration and checks on goods from west to east. But Mr Johnson has insisted Northern Irish businesses will not be hit with additional paperwork or fees, telling a BBC phone-in during the campaign that ""we will make sure that businesses face no extra costs and no checks for stuff being exported from NI to GB"". The DUP said it would use whatever influence it had in the next Parliament to push for changes to the agreement. ""Despite the prime minister's protestations, the facts are in black and white,"" said spokesman Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. ""We have demonstrated over the last three years that we will stand up and speak up for Northern Ireland to ensure our economy is not decimated by a bad deal."" Mr Corbyn said Labour's promise of another referendum within six months of his winning power would ""end the division"" over Brexit as well as protecting jobs and the peace in Northern Ireland. Under Labour's plans, voters would get to choose between a ""credible"" renegotiated Leave deal, including a customs union with the EU and a close single market relationship, and staying in the EU under current terms. However, Mr Corbyn again declined to say which way he would vote - saying he would not ""take sides"" so he could faithfully carry out the result. In contrast, his chief Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said he would campaign against the new deal Labour negotiated and back remain. Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said: ""Once again, Jeremy Corbyn is brandishing leaked documents that don't back up his wild conspiracy theories."" But Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said the document showed Mr Johnson's Brexit deal ""would be in fact a knockout blow to the economy of Northern Ireland"". SNP foreign affairs spokesman Stephen Gethins said it made it ""clear"" that ""Scotland will take a disproportionate hit from Boris Johnson's disastrous Tory Brexit deal"". Speaking in Dublin, EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said that under Mr Johnson's Brexit deal Northern Ireland would ""remain in the UK customs territory and, at the same time, benefit from access to the single market without tariffs, quotas, checks or controls"". ""EU state aid and VAT rules will continue to apply in Northern Ireland, under the control of the European Court of Justice,"" he added.

The DUP said it would use whatever influence it had in the next Parliament to push for changes to the agreement. ""Despite the prime minister's protestations, the facts are in black and white,"" said spokesman Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. ""We have demonstrated over the last three years that we will stand up and speak up for Northern Ireland to ensure our economy is not decimated by a bad deal."" Mr Corbyn said Labour's promise of another referendum within six months of his winning power would ""end the division"" over Brexit as well as protecting jobs and the peace in Northern Ireland. Under Labour's plans, voters would get to choose between a ""credible"" renegotiated Leave deal, including a customs union with the EU and a close single market relationship, and staying in the EU under current terms. However, Mr Corbyn again declined to say which way he would vote - saying he would not ""take sides"" so he could faithfully carry out the result. In contrast, his chief Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said he would campaign against the new deal Labour negotiated and back remain. Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said: ""Once again, Jeremy Corbyn is brandishing leaked documents that don't back up his wild conspiracy theories."" But Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said the document showed Mr Johnson's Brexit deal ""would be in fact a knockout blow to the economy of Northern Ireland"". SNP foreign affairs spokesman Stephen Gethins said it made it ""clear"" that ""Scotland will take a disproportionate hit from Boris Johnson's disastrous Tory Brexit deal"". Speaking in Dublin, EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said that under Mr Johnson's Brexit deal Northern Ireland would ""remain in the UK customs territory and, at the same time, benefit from access to the single market without tariffs, quotas, checks or controls"". ""EU state aid and VAT rules will continue to apply in Northern Ireland, under the control of the European Court of Justice,"" he added.

"This video can not be played 'Private investment is bringing down the cost of renewable energy' Nationalising UK energy companies will delay the UK's move towards a zero carbon future, according to the chief executive of Scottish Power, Keith Anderson. He said that investment by the private sector had seen the cost of renewable energy plummet over the last decade and that debates about nationalisation would only serve as a distraction from averting a climate emergency. ""We need to focus on hitting zero carbon by 2050. Anything else is a distraction. ""Having big arguments about who owns what is the worst thing we could do right now. It would slow everything down when what we need to do is speed up."" A Labour spokesman said Mr Anderson's comments were ""hardly surprising"" as they represented ""vested interests"". ""Labour has set out our plans to dramatically expand the rollout of renewable generation - so that we can hit net zero by the 2030s - not 2050,"" he said. ""While generous public subsidies have led to some private sector investment in renewable generation, private ownership of the UK's grid has been a disaster, with shareholder dividends prioritised over investment."" Top energy firms move offshore over Labour plans Labour eyes 'radical' plan for companies Mr Anderson told the BBC: ""We estimate we need to install 4,000 electric car charging points a day between now and 31 December 2050, and if we delay that for a year arguing about ownership that is 1.5 million charging points that won't get installed in time."" Labour says it would increase charging points at a faster rate than the private sector has managed. But Mr Anderson said that competition and innovation had revolutionised his company and the industry. ""If you look back 20 years we were predominantly a coal burning generator. Now, we have shut down all our coal mines, got rid of gas and we are now a 100% renewable energy company. That's what we want us and other companies to deliver."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has described Labour's plans as radical Labour plans to nationalise the big six energy providers and divide their assets, workforce and customers into 14 state-owned regional agencies. It's not just energy. A Labour government would also take water, the Royal Mail and BT's broadband business into public ownership. So how much would this cost? That's a tricky question to answer. Labour say parliament would decide how much to pay the current owners - which of course includes many worker's pension funds - but the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates it would add at least Â£200bn to government debt. However, the government would collect the associated revenue - apart from broadband which it eventually wants to give away for free. Arguments about who is better at delivering key public services and utilities are not new. But the Labour Party manifesto proposes one of the most radical overhauls of how companies are owned and run in decades. The private sector will tell you that the prospect of nationalisation is deterring private investment at a crucial time - while Labour would say only the state has the power to borrow and invest at the scale and pace that's needed. In Scotland, as in most of Europe, the water industry is already nationalised and the SNP wants to extend public ownership of rail, buses and ferries. Prof Andrew Cumbers of Glasgow University says that many breakthroughs in innovation and technology - particularly in renewable energy - have been achieved thanks to state subsidies. ""It sounds radical but it's only what happens in many other countries. The government can borrow much more cheaply than companies. If you leave it all to the private sector, research and development inevitably gets cut to divert profits into shareholder dividends."" Smaller companies - such as Bulb, Ovo and Octopus in energy, and Virgin Media and Talk Talk in broadband - would not face nationalisation. That would leave them competing with the state. Tough if you are giving services like broadband away for free or others at less than market prices. Even Labour describe their own policies as radical. On that at least business would agree.

The machinery in this turbine hall once helped deliver power for up to 750,000 homes. Harworth group said the demolition work was likely to last 27 months. Before work starts on any homes on the power station site, Harworth Group wants to start extracting two million tonnes of sand and gravel from the land. It said it planned to submit an application this month to extend Buildwas quarry and extract 400,000 tonnes a year over a five-year period, starting next year. The company said the sand and gravel extraction wouldn't require blasting and the cleaning would be done on another part of the power station site, before it is sent out. It plans to have the quarry working between 07:00 and 19:00 on weekdays and 07:00 on Saturdays and said when the work is complete it would restore the site, ready for homes to be built there. Harworth said it hoped to transport 75% of the the sand and gravel by rail, to reduce the number of lorries on local roads. Once the power station buildings have been cleared, the owner wantsto see about 1,000 homes built on the 350-acre site,external. Harworth Group, said it also wanted shops and offices, leisure facilities and a school on part of the land.

"Workers at insurance market Lloyd's of London have been told to behave during the Christmas party season. Chief executive John Nealtold trade magazine Financial News,externalthat staff have been emailed warning them to be ""particularly careful"". The move by Lloyd's comes after it vowed in September this year to tackle its male-dominated culture. A survey it commissioned found 8% of workers said they had seen sexual harassment in the past 12 months. The centuries-old specialist insurance market, where brokers and insurers meet to do business, commissioned the research after a highly critical reportby Bloomberg Businessweek in March,external. Lloyd's chief John Neal says staff have been told to be ""careful"" It found that female workers had faced inappropriate comments, as well as physical attacks by male colleagues. This followed earlier complaints about excessive alcohol consumption and boorish behaviour during working hours. One in five workers said that they did not believe they had equal opportunities at Lloyd's, regardless of gender. Meanwhile, a quarter said they had observed excessive consumption of alcohol at the marketplace during the past year, while 22% had seen people in the organisation ""turn a blind eye"" to inappropriate behaviour. As part of its plan to encourage a better atmosphere,Lloyd's decided to put posters up in the toilets of pubs near its officein the City of London, urging its staff to report instances of sexual harassment they had witnessed. Thousands of people work at Lloyd's city HQ Lloyd's emphasised that it expected professional behaviour all-year round, not just at Christmas. A spokesman said: ""The message is part of our wider speaking-up campaign in which we have been clear about the standards of behaviour that we expect and our ongoing commitment to cultural change in the market."" The moves by Lloyd's come amid a shift in attitude towards traditionally drink-soaked office parties which can lead to accidents, harassment and lawsuits, as well as excluding teetotallers. Accounting firm BDO will have sober chaperones at its Christmas gatherings, who will be responsible for dealing with emergencies and ensuring workers get home, theFinancial Times reported,external. Lloyd's is not like a traditional insurance firm. It employs about 1,000 staff directly, while about 45,000 work in the market it organises, brokering everything from shipping insurance tocover for space exploration,external.

"TV election debates are still a bit of a novelty in the UK. Each time an election is called, there's the question of whether any will take place, how they will be organised and who will take part. Broadcasters are still experimenting - this time putting on two-way debates, seven-way debates, a climate change debate and a special youth audience debate, among other permutations. So is there room for improvement? And, if so, what might that look and sound like? Here are some expert suggestions. Then Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Ukip leader Paul Nuttall took part in the 2017 debates No-one likes it when leaders interrupt and talk over each other. It puts the focus on confrontation rather than discussion and does little to showcase anyone's qualities as a potential prime minister. As US academic Bryan Van Norden puts it,writing for the Hipporeads website,external, ""There is absolutely no professional or political context in which elegantly interrupting others or being interrupted by others is a useful skill."" He suggests simply switching off leaders' microphones when it's not their turn to speak. As soon as each person has finished talking, off it goes and the next one turns on. Knowing they will go silent could also stop them ""filibustering"", or trying to run down the clock by refusing to stop talking. How to watch the BBC's prime ministerial debate on Friday Tony Benn and Roy Jenkins debated each other in 1975, with David Dimbleby moderating UK televised debates tend to feature glitzy sets, rows of podiums and heavy intervention from moderators. They are also often quite short by international standards. Time can therefore be tight and the result heavy on soundbites and low on substance. It wasn't always like this. One of the UK's earliest televised political debates was between rival Labour frontbenchers Roy Jenkins and Tony Benn during the 1975 European referendum campaign. They debated the single issue for 50 minutes, with no studio audience, no fancy set and very little intervention. Its often viewed now as a model of ""proper"" debate - two intellectual heavyweights tussling with serious issues, listening to each other's points and responding reasonably. The French presidential debates have run on a similar no-frills model since the 1970s. Candidates sit across a table and there's no studio audience. The most recent, between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, lasted two-and-a-half hours and drew an audience of 16.5 million. It was brutal, with the pair trading bitter insults, ""but it didn't half make for riveting viewing,"" saidBBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield. ""[A]nd at the end of the day, the debate did its job."" No one who watched was left in any doubt who stood for what. This video can not be played What they're afraid of - a misjudged debate remark haunted Dan Quayle for the rest of his career If we can't trust politicians to get facts right and tell the truth, then having debates at all is pointless. Much effort already goes into fact-checking, with the likes of independent fact-checking charity Full Fact and theBBC's Reality Checkdeploying journalists to scour statistics and consult experts in order to verify politicians' claims. Viewers can get updates online during debates or read the verdicts afterwards. But of course not everyone does this, meaning politicians might not be adequately held to account. So the race is on to speed up fact-checking and put it at the heart of the debates themselves. The BBC News channel already uses on-screen Reality Check ""push-backs"" - or text boxes - during its live debate broadcasts. And Full Fact has started live checking for other broadcasters, such as LBC. But as Will Moy, Full Fact's chief executive, says, ""It's something audiences really want but it's hard to do it fast enough to make it matter."" The game-changer looks likely to be the use of artificial intelligence. Full Fact is developing software that can check facts far faster than humans, training machines to spot claims and trawl for data which can prove them right or wrong, So the day when we see automated fact-checks appearing on TV screens in real time during debates may not be far off. Back in 2010 the UK's first modern TV election debate took place in front of a respectful and hushed studio audience, There was no jeering or cheering and they were banned from clapping. Since then, audiences have become more vocal, with spectators cheering, clapping and even booing. It can feel a bit like Punch and Judy. Dr Nick Anstead, associate professor at the London School of Economics' media and communications department, thinks we should go back to silence - and aim for an audience of genuinely undecided voters. ""It would at the very least remove the distortion of the audiences we now tend to have. It would change the atmosphere in the studio and make it less of a bear pit."" CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external MANIFESTO GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external ""Politicians have yet to connect emotionally with audiences,"" says one expert Debates routinely involve ordinary members of the public - often by asking them to submit questions for politicians to answer. But this could be taken further. Stephen Coleman, professor of political communication at the University of Leeds, suggests asking people to send in video clips about their lives and problems, which could be sprung on the leaders mid-debate. ""What specifically will you do to help this person?"" they could be asked. Or could broadcasters rip up the debate formula altogether and task politicians with convincing a real voter, while the cameras roll? Matthew Flinders, professor of politics at the University of Sheffield would like to see ""not a debate but a conversation with someone picked out from the public, who would sit down and get to know the politician, understand about their life, where they're coming from and how that flows into their their policies and beliefs."" It could make it harder for politicians to wriggle out of questions and expose them to intense scrutiny - but it would also give them the chance to come across as ""normal"". This could be electoral gold dust: ""It's an element that's been missing so far, No politician has really made an emotional connection with voters,"" Prof Flinders says. Since the UK has never settled on rules for debates, broadcasters and politicians must thrash them out each time. This year the Lib Dems and SNP went to the court to challenge ITV's decision not to include Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon in its prime ministerial debate - though the challenge was rejected. Dr Anstead says there are three conflicting dynamics surrounding debates: the politicians, who want to get their messages across and ""will do anything to avoid generating a negative clip that could go viral""; the broadcasters ""who just want to make good TV""; and ""the democratic need to actually inform voters"". Although politicians and broadcasters would dispute this characterisation, the absence of proper rules means the ""first two are dominating at the moment"", says Dr Anstead. Like the US, Canada has an independent commission tasked with organising official election debates. There are clear rules, consistent formulas for deciding who gets to be in which debates and they are the same from year to year. In the UK, Sky News has been pressing for something similar, with its Make Debates Happen campaign. This year its petition received more than 140,000 signatures and was debated in Parliament. The government's response? ""Televised election debates are a matter for political parties.The government has no plans,externalto change electoral law to make the debates mandatory."" Backbencher Term for an MP who is not a minister. They sit behind the front benches in the House of commons. Ballot Another term for vote. Ballot box A sealed box with a slit in the lid. Voters place their ballot papers through the slit into the box. When polls close the boxes are opened and counting begins. Ballot paper Paper containing a list of all candidates standing in a constituency. Voters mark their choice with a cross. By-election An election held between general elections, usually because the sitting MP has died or resigned. Candidate Someone putting themselves up for election. Once Parliament has been dissolved, there are no MPs, only candidates. Canvassing During a campaign, active supporters of a party ask voters who they will vote for and try to drum up support for their own candidates. Close of nominations The deadline for candidates standing to send in the officials forms confirming their place in the election. This is usually __ days before polling day. Coalition When two or more parties govern together, when neither has an overall majority. After the 2010 election, the Conservatives and Lib Dems formed a coalition, which lasted for five years. Confidence and supply A agreement between two political parties where the smaller party agrees to support a larger one without enough MPs to have a majority in parliament. Conservative The Conservative party is Constituency The geographical unit which elects a single MP. There are 650 in the UK. Dead cat In politics, a 'dead cat' strategy is when a dramatic or sensational story is disclosed to divert attention away from something more damaging.  The term comes from the concept of an imaginary dead cat being flung onto a dining table, causing the diners to become distracted by it. Declaration The announcement of the election result in each constituency. Deposit A sum of Â£500 paid by candidates or their parties to be allowed to stand. It is returned if the candidate wins 5% or more of the votes cast.

Devolved parliament The Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies are elected by voters in those nations of the UK. They make laws on policy areas controlled by those nations such as health, environment and education. Dissolution of Parliament The act of ending a Parliament before an election. When parliament is dissolved there are no MPs, but the prime minister and other senior ministers remain in their roles. Electoral register / roll A list of everyone in a constituency entitled to vote. Also known as electoral roll. Exit poll An exit poll is a poll of voters leaving a voting station. They are asked how they have voted, and the results are used to forecast what the overall result of the election may be. First past the post Term used to describe the UK's parliamentary election system. It means a candidate only needs to win the most votes in their constituency to win the seat. Gain When a party wins a constituency from another party, it is said to have ""gained"" it from the other. General election Election at which all seats in the House of Commons are contested. Hung parliament If after an election no party has an overall majority, then parliament is said to be ""hung"". The main parties will then try to form a coalition with one or more of the minor parties. Opinion polls have suggested that a hung parliament is a strong possibility after the 2015 general election. Hustings A meeting a which candidates address potential voters. The word comes from an old Norse word meaning ""house of assembly"".

To qualify as an official political party, a party must be registered with the Electoral Commission, the organisation which administers elections in the UK. Landslide The name given to an election which one party wins by a very large margin.

Left wing A person or party with strong socialist policies or beliefs. Liberal Democrat The name of the party occupying the centre ground of British politics. They were formed from the former Liberal party and Social Democrats, a Labour splinter group, and combine support for traditional liberalism such as religious tolerance and individual freedom, with support for social justice. Majority A majority in Parliament means one side has at least one more vote than all the other parties combined and is therefore more likely to be able to push through any legislative plans. Majority government When one party wins more than half of the seats in the Commons, they can rule alone in a majority government Mandate Politicians say they have a mandate, or authority, to carry out a policy when they have the backing of the electorate. Manifesto A public declaration of a party's ideas and policies, usually printed during the campaign. Once in power, a government is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver. Marginal Seats where the gap between the two or more leading parties is relatively small. Often regarded as less than a 10% margin or requiring a swing (see below) of 5% or less, though very dependent on prevailing political conditions. Minority government A minority government is one that does not have a majority of the seats in Parliament. It means the government is less likely to be able to push through any legislative programme. Boris Johnson has suffered a number of defeats in Parliament over a no-deal Brexit because he does not have a majority. MP Strictly this includes members of the House of Lords, but in practice means only members of the House of Commons. When an election is called Parliament is dissolved and there are no more MPs until it assembles again. Nomination papers A candidate must be nominated on these documents by 10 voters living in the constituency. Opinion poll A survey asking people's opinion on one or more issues. In an election campaign, the key question is usually about which party people will vote for. Opposition The largest party not in government is known as the official opposition. It receives extra parliamentary funding in recognition of its status. Party Election Broadcast Broadcasts made by the parties and transmitted on TV or radio. By agreement with the broadcasters, each party is allowed a certain number according to its election strength and number of candidates fielded. Percentage swing The swing shows how far voter support for a party has changed between elections. It is calculated by comparing the percentage of the vote won in a particular election to the figure obtained in the previous election. Polling day Election day Polling station Place where people go to cast their votes Postal vote People unable to get to a polling station are allowed to vote by post if they apply in advance. Proportional representation (PR) Any voting system where the share of seats represents the share of votes is described as proportional representation. The UK currently has a first past the post system. Prorogation Parliament is usually prorogued, or suspended, ahead of an election or Queen's Speech to allow for preparations. In September 2019 Boris Johnson attempted to prorogue Parliament for five weeks, but the Supreme Court later ruled the prorogation unlawful and MPs returned to Parliament. Psephologist A person who studies voting and voting patterns. Purdah This is the time between the announcement of an election and the final election results. During this period media organisations have to ensure any political reporting is balanced and is not likely to influence the outcome of the election. Recount If a result is close, any candidate may ask for a recount. The process can be repeated several times if necessary until the candidates are satisfied. The returning officer has the final say on whether a recount takes place. Returning officer The official in charge of elections in each of the constituencies. On election night they read out the results for each candidate in alphabetical order by surname. Right wing Someone who is right wing in politics usually supports tradition and authority, as well as capitalism. The Conservative party is regarded as the main centre-right party in the UK. Safe seat A safe seat is a constituency where an MP has a sufficiently large majority to be considered unwinnable by the opposition. Spin room The attempt to place a favourable interpretation on an event so that people or the media will interpret it in that way. Those performing this act are known as spin doctors. Spoiled ballot Any ballot paper that is not marked clearly, eg with more than one box ticked or with writing scrawled across it, is described as a spoiled ballot and does not count towards the result. Tactical voting This is when people vote not for the party they really support, but for another party in order to keep out a more disliked rival. Target seat In theory, any seat that a party contests and held by a rival is one of its targets. In practice, a target seat is one that a party believes it can win and puts a lot of effort into doing so. Turnout Turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot on polling day. Vote of no confidence It is usually the leader of the opposition, currently Jeremy Corby, who calls for a vote of no confidence, in an attempt to topple the government. If more MPs vote for the motion than against it, then the government has 14 days to try to win back the confidence of MPs through another vote â while the opposition parties try to form an alternative government. If nothing is resolved, then a general election is triggered. Westminster The UK Parliament is located in the Palace of Westminster in the centre of London and the term is often used as an alternative to Parliament. Working majority A working majority in Parliament is what a government needs to carry out its legislative programme without risk of defeat. It means the government can rely on at least one more vote than the opposition parties. However, in the current Parliament, the government no longer has a majority and MPs from a range of opposition parties have joined forces to form a parliamentary majority big enough to defeat the government over plans for a no-deal Brexit.

"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn go head-to-head in a live TV debate One questioner referred to criticism of both men from former PMs Sir John Major and Tony Blair Mr Corbyn said a Labour government would negotiate a Brexit deal within three months Mr Johnson said there was ""ample time"" to build a free trade partnership with the EU after leaving The NHS featured too, with Mr Corbyn describing it ""at breaking point"" Mr Johnson said charges the NHS was to be part of a US trade deal was ""Bermuda Triangle stuff"" In his closing statement, Mr Corbyn said he would be as ambitious as the Labour government who created the NHS Mr Johnson's closing statement said his Tory government would ""get Brexit done"" The UK goes to the polls next Thursday Victoria King, Emma Harrison, Alex Therrien, Hazel Shearing, Joseph Lee and Gary Rose What happened today? We're wrapping things up for the evening, so here's a brief catch-up on the main events of today:  Thank you so much for joining us - back again tomorrow... BBC online reporter signs off... Jennifer ScottBBC News A few of the late night
programmes are still at it - tune intoBBC Newsnightright now for Kirsty Wark
from, well, behind me... But overall, the
spinning is slowing down as the buzz of the debate wears
off. The feeling in the room - and even the acceptance from some of the party teams away from the cameras - is it was
another draw between the leaders. And as many of our
correspondents have said, there was no killer moment that is likely to change the election campaign. But these debates give
voters a chance to see their next prime minister in action and have their
policies scrutinised, and that is what we came for. Good night from
Maidstone! As our debate coverage begins to draw to a close, the parties are throwing forward already to the next day of campaigning. Labour is first out of the traps with another new policy pledge. It says it wants to electrify all UK buses by 2030. The Tories argue Labour would ""scrap vital new roads"". Read more. Another Conservative voice from the spin room and another endorsement for Boris Johnson. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the debate showed ""clear leadership"" from his boss ""versus lack of leadership from Jeremy Corbyn"". He tells reporters Mr Johnson's clarity of on Brexit has been going down well on the doorsteps. ""I've now been to 114 campaign visits and I can tell you that getting Brexit done so we can move on and deal with all the other things that matter to this country is a message that resonates from Penzance to Middlesbrough."" By Chris Bell BBC Trending It did not escape the notice of those watching at home that the prime minister was keen to repeat one phrase in particular. âGet Brexit doneâ was one of the top trending phrases on
Twitter, with nearly 50,000 tweets in about an hour - second only to #BBCLeadersDebate. It was clear from Mr Johnsonâs Twitter activity today that
this was his plan. No fewer than 13 tweets or retweets from his Twitter account
sent before the debate referenced the phrase. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You might think Mr Johnson would be pleased to see his campaign slogan trending. But the actual messages tell a different story. The overwhelming tone of the most popular âGet Brexit doneâ tweets was not at all sympathetic to the prime minister. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The general left-leaning bias of Twitter users makes this far from a representative sample. But most of the most widely-shared posts using the Conservative catchphrase were groaning rather than cheering along. Danny ShawBBC Home Affairs Correspondent Talking about London Bridge attacker Usman Khan during the debate, Boris Johnson said there was ""no parole or probation involved in this"" - but probation officers were in charge of his supervision upon release. Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile. said the probation system was ""privatised by this government"". Supervision of low and medium-risk offenders was outsourced, but it's the state that monitors high-risk offenders including Khan. Privatisation has been heavily criticised and earlier this year the government announced plans to reverse the changes. If you missed the debate or want to go over the party leaders' answers again, we've got a couple of options. You can listen to the audio from BBC Radio 5 Liveover at BBC Sounds. Or you can watch the leaders go head to headon BBC iPlayer. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor I think tonight we basically saw the two main rivals on their best behaviour. And they were really trying to appeal to their
core voters, those people who have already made up their minds. It didnât feel to me like there was a big game-changing
moment where either Boris Johnson dropped the ball or Jeremy Corbyn managed to
land a new goal in the back of the net. If we think about the broad context, this campaign has only
six days to go. Look at the polls with a pinch of salt, but the Tories are
ahead consistently and Labour are consistently trailing them. Therefore, tonight it was Boris Johnson's side that were deeply
nervous things would go wrong. For Jeremy Corbyn this was one of his last big chances to really cause an upset and I donât think we saw a sign of anything like that. But core voters on both sides will have watched their
man out there and ended up more sure of the decision they had already made. BBC Radio 5 Live Stephen Nolan puts it to Labour's Shami Chakrabarti that Boris Johnson damaged Jeremy Corbyn by drawing out from him that he doesn't have a clear position on Brexit. ""Obviously I disagree with that leading question,"" Baroness Chakrabarti says. ""I think we have a very grown up position and are offering a different style of leadership to that offered by Boris Johnson. ""He would 'get Brexit done', a crash-out Brexit that would cost us jobs and services, and he will cosy up to Donald Trump and that will have huge consequences in particular for the NHS. ""Jeremy Corbyn says that we can bring people together with a deal within three months that is a very soft Brexit that would safeguard our jobs, services, our trade relationships and security relationships with our nearest neighbours and then we would put it back to the people versus remain. ""I don't think that is difficult or complicated."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jennifer ScottBBC News Well, we said Labour's Barry Gardiner was off to ""engage"" with Conservative Matt Hancock - he did and it turned into another argument After a loud attack from the Labour shadow minister, accusing the health secretary of dividing the country, there are eye rolls and arm crosses from the Tory as he asks for Labour's Brexit position. The crowds gathered again to watch the spat. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check People who liked Jeremy Corbyn will have liked some of things he said about the Conservatives. Those who like Boris Johnson would have thought, ""yeah we do need to get Brexit done"". It was notable, though, that Mr Johnson appeared reluctant to attack Mr Corbyn too much. It felt like he was playing it fairly safe and perhaps feeling that he didn't really need to go on the attack to achieve all that much. Once or twice the leaders basically said ""here's a number, but I'm just going to explain how that breaks down"" - sort of pointing out some of the facts that we and others have been saying during the campaign. Jeremy Corbyn said there were four million children in the country living in poverty. It's really hard to measure poverty. It's true that their are four million children, roughly, living in low income houses - but it's not quite the same thing. Boris Johnson once again talked about 40 hospitals, but he did explain the figures a bit more this time. However, he said there are going to be 20,000 more police on the streets, without saying ""we've cut 20,000 since the Conservatives first came into government in 2010"". So a few things you could quibble with in terms of the way you present the statistics, but I thought there were no massive whoppers. BBC Radio 5 Live Chris Curtis, political research manager at YouGov, tells BBC Radio 5 live that the Conservatives will likely be happy tonight, given the results of the snap poll. He says: ""The result was 52% for Boris Johnson  and 48% for Jeremy Corbyn. It is basically the same result as we saw last time round. ""With six days to go I think Jeremy Corbyn needed a bigger win tonight. ""Given that the Conservatives went into this evening with a fairly comfortable nine-point lead in the opinion polls I think what Labour were hoping for was that a good performance from Jeremy Corbyn would help close that gap in the coming days."" BBC online reporter witnesses the battle... Jennifer ScottBBC News As the leaders gave
their closing speeches, the spin room noise level began to rise - and as soon as it
was a wrap, the scurrying began. The desks for
journalists are laid out like tight little warrens, and every reporter,
politician and spinner is navigating their way through, hoping not to trip up
and cause a different kind of headline. We now have big names
from both Labour and the Tories who want to be in front of the camera and sell
their guy as the top dog. The first (and loudest)
row was between Labour's shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, and Foreign
Secretary Dominic Raab over Brexit. All the crews gathered
around the face-off, as one shouted and another rolled their eyes. It's worth
watching our coverage on the BBC News channel for the full glory. The next was Tory Nicky
Morgan and Labour's Baroness Chakrabati, who, while friendly off camera, laid into each
other on air. It was quite a moment to
watch, as the two women spoke over each other to accuse the other of interrupting... But that is the nature
of a spin room. You want to be first, fast and furious, fighting for your
candidate, and telling voters who won what they just watched. And it isn't over yet.
We have spotted some more people heading in. Excuse us while we go
and see what Mr Gardiner has to say to Health Secretary Matt
Hancock... Another voice in the spin room - the SNP's Stewart Hosie says Mr Corbyn âhas accepted the principleâ
of holding another Scottish referendum. What Mr Corbyn has actually said is that there wouldn't be one in the early years - at least the first two - of a Labour government. He wants to make his priority directing massive investment into Scotland instead. But Mr Hosie says ""we canât turn democracy off"" when opinions change, and it is ""perfectly sensible"" to hold another Scottish independence referendum. When challenged on his own party's spending plans, Mr Hosie says: âThe entire
basis of the SNP planâ¦ is not to lead to austerity.â Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake is challenged over polls that appear to show his party is not doing well. ""There is a question mark over Jeremy Corbyn,"" Mr
Brake says. He says in the ""very hard fought"" seats ""there is
the prospect on election night we will take seats from the Conservatives."" ""A good result for us is ensuring Boris Johnson does not
have a majority,"" he says. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent on BBC Radio 5 live I wonder if they didn't want to be seen to be shouting over each other? There were lots of exchanges, it was almost like a friendly chat - very polite. The polls suggest the Tories are fairly comfortably ahead of Labour, so for Boris Johnson, steady as she goes, no clear winner, fairly steady debate is probably a better thing than it is for Jeremy Corbyn. I think he will have wanted to make up some numbers tonight - and indeed he may well do that, but I'm not sure there was a moment that changes the dial and Labour will have been hoping for that.

Brexit Party MEP Alexandra Phillips says the PM is ""repeating the same untruths and half-truths as heâs done since he became leader of the Conservatives"" when it comes to his Brexit deal. ""He said that we could change VAT rates, well, the political declaration [says] we'll have tax harmonisation. He says we'll take back control of our waters - the political declaration again [says] no, we want to still fish in your waters,"" she says. ""He says we'll get Brexit done on 31 January. The point is - if we withdraw under his deal, we have a transition period which could go on for years - possibly three years, possibly more - where we are, in all effect, a full member state still paying the same into the EU, subject to its laws and regulations, but with no democratic representation.""

Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the debate showed ""clear leadership"" from his boss ""versus lack of leadership from Jeremy Corbyn"". He tells reporters Mr Johnson's clarity of on Brexit has been going down well on the doorsteps. ""I've now been to 114 campaign visits and I can tell you that getting Brexit done so we can move on and deal with all the other things that matter to this country is a message that resonates from Penzance to Middlesbrough."" By Chris Bell BBC Trending It did not escape the notice of those watching at home that the prime minister was keen to repeat one phrase in particular. âGet Brexit doneâ was one of the top trending phrases on
Twitter, with nearly 50,000 tweets in about an hour - second only to #BBCLeadersDebate. It was clear from Mr Johnsonâs Twitter activity today that
this was his plan. No fewer than 13 tweets or retweets from his Twitter account
sent before the debate referenced the phrase. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You might think Mr Johnson would be pleased to see his campaign slogan trending. But the actual messages tell a different story. The overwhelming tone of the most popular âGet Brexit doneâ tweets was not at all sympathetic to the prime minister. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The general left-leaning bias of Twitter users makes this far from a representative sample. But most of the most widely-shared posts using the Conservative catchphrase were groaning rather than cheering along. Danny ShawBBC Home Affairs Correspondent Talking about London Bridge attacker Usman Khan during the debate, Boris Johnson said there was ""no parole or probation involved in this"" - but probation officers were in charge of his supervision upon release. Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile. said the probation system was ""privatised by this government"". Supervision of low and medium-risk offenders was outsourced, but it's the state that monitors high-risk offenders including Khan. Privatisation has been heavily criticised and earlier this year the government announced plans to reverse the changes. If you missed the debate or want to go over the party leaders' answers again, we've got a couple of options. You can listen to the audio from BBC Radio 5 Liveover at BBC Sounds. Or you can watch the leaders go head to headon BBC iPlayer. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor I think tonight we basically saw the two main rivals on their best behaviour. And they were really trying to appeal to their
core voters, those people who have already made up their minds. It didnât feel to me like there was a big game-changing
moment where either Boris Johnson dropped the ball or Jeremy Corbyn managed to
land a new goal in the back of the net. If we think about the broad context, this campaign has only
six days to go. Look at the polls with a pinch of salt, but the Tories are
ahead consistently and Labour are consistently trailing them. Therefore, tonight it was Boris Johnson's side that were deeply
nervous things would go wrong. For Jeremy Corbyn this was one of his last big chances to really cause an upset and I donât think we saw a sign of anything like that. But core voters on both sides will have watched their
man out there and ended up more sure of the decision they had already made. BBC Radio 5 Live Stephen Nolan puts it to Labour's Shami Chakrabarti that Boris Johnson damaged Jeremy Corbyn by drawing out from him that he doesn't have a clear position on Brexit. ""Obviously I disagree with that leading question,"" Baroness Chakrabarti says. ""I think we have a very grown up position and are offering a different style of leadership to that offered by Boris Johnson. ""He would 'get Brexit done', a crash-out Brexit that would cost us jobs and services, and he will cosy up to Donald Trump and that will have huge consequences in particular for the NHS. ""Jeremy Corbyn says that we can bring people together with a deal within three months that is a very soft Brexit that would safeguard our jobs, services, our trade relationships and security relationships with our nearest neighbours and then we would put it back to the people versus remain. ""I don't think that is difficult or complicated."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jennifer ScottBBC News Well, we said Labour's Barry Gardiner was off to ""engage"" with Conservative Matt Hancock - he did and it turned into another argument After a loud attack from the Labour shadow minister, accusing the health secretary of dividing the country, there are eye rolls and arm crosses from the Tory as he asks for Labour's Brexit position. The crowds gathered again to watch the spat. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check People who liked Jeremy Corbyn will have liked some of things he said about the Conservatives. Those who like Boris Johnson would have thought, ""yeah we do need to get Brexit done"". It was notable, though, that Mr Johnson appeared reluctant to attack Mr Corbyn too much. It felt like he was playing it fairly safe and perhaps feeling that he didn't really need to go on the attack to achieve all that much. Once or twice the leaders basically said ""here's a number, but I'm just going to explain how that breaks down"" - sort of pointing out some of the facts that we and others have been saying during the campaign. Jeremy Corbyn said there were four million children in the country living in poverty. It's really hard to measure poverty. It's true that their are four million children, roughly, living in low income houses - but it's not quite the same thing. Boris Johnson once again talked about 40 hospitals, but he did explain the figures a bit more this time. However, he said there are going to be 20,000 more police on the streets, without saying ""we've cut 20,000 since the Conservatives first came into government in 2010"". So a few things you could quibble with in terms of the way you present the statistics, but I thought there were no massive whoppers. BBC Radio 5 Live Chris Curtis, political research manager at YouGov, tells BBC Radio 5 live that the Conservatives will likely be happy tonight, given the results of the snap poll. He says: ""The result was 52% for Boris Johnson  and 48% for Jeremy Corbyn. It is basically the same result as we saw last time round. ""With six days to go I think Jeremy Corbyn needed a bigger win tonight. ""Given that the Conservatives went into this evening with a fairly comfortable nine-point lead in the opinion polls I think what Labour were hoping for was that a good performance from Jeremy Corbyn would help close that gap in the coming days."" BBC online reporter witnesses the battle... Jennifer ScottBBC News As the leaders gave
their closing speeches, the spin room noise level began to rise - and as soon as it
was a wrap, the scurrying began. The desks for
journalists are laid out like tight little warrens, and every reporter,
politician and spinner is navigating their way through, hoping not to trip up
and cause a different kind of headline. We now have big names
from both Labour and the Tories who want to be in front of the camera and sell
their guy as the top dog. The first (and loudest)
row was between Labour's shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, and Foreign
Secretary Dominic Raab over Brexit. All the crews gathered
around the face-off, as one shouted and another rolled their eyes. It's worth
watching our coverage on the BBC News channel for the full glory. The next was Tory Nicky
Morgan and Labour's Baroness Chakrabati, who, while friendly off camera, laid into each
other on air. It was quite a moment to
watch, as the two women spoke over each other to accuse the other of interrupting... But that is the nature
of a spin room. You want to be first, fast and furious, fighting for your
candidate, and telling voters who won what they just watched. And it isn't over yet.
We have spotted some more people heading in. Excuse us while we go
and see what Mr Gardiner has to say to Health Secretary Matt
Hancock... Another voice in the spin room - the SNP's Stewart Hosie says Mr Corbyn âhas accepted the principleâ
of holding another Scottish referendum. What Mr Corbyn has actually said is that there wouldn't be one in the early years - at least the first two - of a Labour government. He wants to make his priority directing massive investment into Scotland instead. But Mr Hosie says ""we canât turn democracy off"" when opinions change, and it is ""perfectly sensible"" to hold another Scottish independence referendum. When challenged on his own party's spending plans, Mr Hosie says: âThe entire
basis of the SNP planâ¦ is not to lead to austerity.â Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake is challenged over polls that appear to show his party is not doing well. ""There is a question mark over Jeremy Corbyn,"" Mr
Brake says. He says in the ""very hard fought"" seats ""there is
the prospect on election night we will take seats from the Conservatives."" ""A good result for us is ensuring Boris Johnson does not
have a majority,"" he says. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent on BBC Radio 5 live I wonder if they didn't want to be seen to be shouting over each other? There were lots of exchanges, it was almost like a friendly chat - very polite. The polls suggest the Tories are fairly comfortably ahead of Labour, so for Boris Johnson, steady as she goes, no clear winner, fairly steady debate is probably a better thing than it is for Jeremy Corbyn. I think he will have wanted to make up some numbers tonight - and indeed he may well do that, but I'm not sure there was a moment that changes the dial and Labour will have been hoping for that.

He says we'll take back control of our waters - the political declaration again [says] no, we want to still fish in your waters,"" she says. ""He says we'll get Brexit done on 31 January. The point is - if we withdraw under his deal, we have a transition period which could go on for years - possibly three years, possibly more - where we are, in all effect, a full member state still paying the same into the EU, subject to its laws and regulations, but with no democratic representation.""

"TV election debates are still a bit of a novelty in the UK. Each time an election is called, there's the question of whether any will take place, how they will be organised and who will take part. Broadcasters are still experimenting - this time putting on two-way debates, seven-way debates, a climate change debate and a special youth audience debate, among other permutations. So is there room for improvement? And, if so, what might that look and sound like? Here are some expert suggestions. Then Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Ukip leader Paul Nuttall took part in the 2017 debates No-one likes it when leaders interrupt and talk over each other. It puts the focus on confrontation rather than discussion and does little to showcase anyone's qualities as a potential prime minister. As US academic Bryan Van Norden puts it,writing for the Hipporeads website,external, ""There is absolutely no professional or political context in which elegantly interrupting others or being interrupted by others is a useful skill."" He suggests simply switching off leaders' microphones when it's not their turn to speak. As soon as each person has finished talking, off it goes and the next one turns on. Knowing they will go silent could also stop them ""filibustering"", or trying to run down the clock by refusing to stop talking. How to watch the BBC's prime ministerial debate on Friday Tony Benn and Roy Jenkins debated each other in 1975, with David Dimbleby moderating UK televised debates tend to feature glitzy sets, rows of podiums and heavy intervention from moderators. They are also often quite short by international standards. Time can therefore be tight and the result heavy on soundbites and low on substance. It wasn't always like this. One of the UK's earliest televised political debates was between rival Labour frontbenchers Roy Jenkins and Tony Benn during the 1975 European referendum campaign. They debated the single issue for 50 minutes, with no studio audience, no fancy set and very little intervention. Its often viewed now as a model of ""proper"" debate - two intellectual heavyweights tussling with serious issues, listening to each other's points and responding reasonably. The French presidential debates have run on a similar no-frills model since the 1970s. Candidates sit across a table and there's no studio audience. The most recent, between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, lasted two-and-a-half hours and drew an audience of 16.5 million. It was brutal, with the pair trading bitter insults, ""but it didn't half make for riveting viewing,"" saidBBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield. ""[A]nd at the end of the day, the debate did its job."" No one who watched was left in any doubt who stood for what. This video can not be played What they're afraid of - a misjudged debate remark haunted Dan Quayle for the rest of his career If we can't trust politicians to get facts right and tell the truth, then having debates at all is pointless. Much effort already goes into fact-checking, with the likes of independent fact-checking charity Full Fact and theBBC's Reality Checkdeploying journalists to scour statistics and consult experts in order to verify politicians' claims. Viewers can get updates online during debates or read the verdicts afterwards. But of course not everyone does this, meaning politicians might not be adequately held to account. So the race is on to speed up fact-checking and put it at the heart of the debates themselves. The BBC News channel already uses on-screen Reality Check ""push-backs"" - or text boxes - during its live debate broadcasts. And Full Fact has started live checking for other broadcasters, such as LBC. But as Will Moy, Full Fact's chief executive, says, ""It's something audiences really want but it's hard to do it fast enough to make it matter."" The game-changer looks likely to be the use of artificial intelligence. Full Fact is developing software that can check facts far faster than humans, training machines to spot claims and trawl for data which can prove them right or wrong, So the day when we see automated fact-checks appearing on TV screens in real time during debates may not be far off. Back in 2010 the UK's first modern TV election debate took place in front of a respectful and hushed studio audience, There was no jeering or cheering and they were banned from clapping. Since then, audiences have become more vocal, with spectators cheering, clapping and even booing. It can feel a bit like Punch and Judy. Dr Nick Anstead, associate professor at the London School of Economics' media and communications department, thinks we should go back to silence - and aim for an audience of genuinely undecided voters. ""It would at the very least remove the distortion of the audiences we now tend to have. It would change the atmosphere in the studio and make it less of a bear pit."" CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external MANIFESTO GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external ""Politicians have yet to connect emotionally with audiences,"" says one expert Debates routinely involve ordinary members of the public - often by asking them to submit questions for politicians to answer. But this could be taken further. Stephen Coleman, professor of political communication at the University of Leeds, suggests asking people to send in video clips about their lives and problems, which could be sprung on the leaders mid-debate. ""What specifically will you do to help this person?"" they could be asked. Or could broadcasters rip up the debate formula altogether and task politicians with convincing a real voter, while the cameras roll? Matthew Flinders, professor of politics at the University of Sheffield would like to see ""not a debate but a conversation with someone picked out from the public, who would sit down and get to know the politician, understand about their life, where they're coming from and how that flows into their their policies and beliefs."" It could make it harder for politicians to wriggle out of questions and expose them to intense scrutiny - but it would also give them the chance to come across as ""normal"". This could be electoral gold dust: ""It's an element that's been missing so far, No politician has really made an emotional connection with voters,"" Prof Flinders says. Since the UK has never settled on rules for debates, broadcasters and politicians must thrash them out each time. This year the Lib Dems and SNP went to the court to challenge ITV's decision not to include Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon in its prime ministerial debate - though the challenge was rejected. Dr Anstead says there are three conflicting dynamics surrounding debates: the politicians, who want to get their messages across and ""will do anything to avoid generating a negative clip that could go viral""; the broadcasters ""who just want to make good TV""; and ""the democratic need to actually inform voters"". Although politicians and broadcasters would dispute this characterisation, the absence of proper rules means the ""first two are dominating at the moment"", says Dr Anstead. Like the US, Canada has an independent commission tasked with organising official election debates. There are clear rules, consistent formulas for deciding who gets to be in which debates and they are the same from year to year. In the UK, Sky News has been pressing for something similar, with its Make Debates Happen campaign. This year its petition received more than 140,000 signatures and was debated in Parliament. The government's response? ""Televised election debates are a matter for political parties.The government has no plans,externalto change electoral law to make the debates mandatory."" Backbencher Term for an MP who is not a minister. They sit behind the front benches in the House of commons. Ballot Another term for vote. Ballot box A sealed box with a slit in the lid. Voters place their ballot papers through the slit into the box. When polls close the boxes are opened and counting begins. Ballot paper Paper containing a list of all candidates standing in a constituency. Voters mark their choice with a cross. By-election An election held between general elections, usually because the sitting MP has died or resigned. Candidate Someone putting themselves up for election. Once Parliament has been dissolved, there are no MPs, only candidates. Canvassing During a campaign, active supporters of a party ask voters who they will vote for and try to drum up support for their own candidates. Close of nominations The deadline for candidates standing to send in the officials forms confirming their place in the election. This is usually __ days before polling day. Coalition When two or more parties govern together, when neither has an overall majority. After the 2010 election, the Conservatives and Lib Dems formed a coalition, which lasted for five years. Confidence and supply A agreement between two political parties where the smaller party agrees to support a larger one without enough MPs to have a majority in parliament. Conservative The Conservative party is Constituency The geographical unit which elects a single MP. There are 650 in the UK. Dead cat In politics, a 'dead cat' strategy is when a dramatic or sensational story is disclosed to divert attention away from something more damaging.  The term comes from the concept of an imaginary dead cat being flung onto a dining table, causing the diners to become distracted by it. Declaration The announcement of the election result in each constituency. Deposit A sum of Â£500 paid by candidates or their parties to be allowed to stand. It is returned if the candidate wins 5% or more of the votes cast. Devolution The delegation of powers to other parliaments within the UK, specifically the Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies. Devolved parliament The Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies are elected by voters in those nations of the UK. They make laws on policy areas controlled by those nations such as health, environment and education. Dissolution of Parliament The act of ending a Parliament before an election. When parliament is dissolved there are no MPs, but the prime minister and other senior ministers remain in their roles. Electoral register / roll A list of everyone in a constituency entitled to vote. Also known as electoral roll. Exit poll An exit poll is a poll of voters leaving a voting station. They are asked how they have voted, and the results are used to forecast what the overall result of the election may be. First past the post Term used to describe the UK's parliamentary election system. It means a candidate only needs to win the most votes in their constituency to win the seat. Gain When a party wins a constituency from another party, it is said to have ""gained"" it from the other. General election Election at which all seats in the House of Commons are contested. Hung parliament If after an election no party has an overall majority, then parliament is said to be ""hung"". The main parties will then try to form a coalition with one or more of the minor parties. Opinion polls have suggested that a hung parliament is a strong possibility after the 2015 general election. Hustings A meeting a which candidates address potential voters. The word comes from an old Norse word meaning ""house of assembly"". Independent A candidate who is not a member of any political party and is standing on their own personal platform. To qualify as an official political party, a party must be registered with the Electoral Commission, the organisation which administers elections in the UK. Landslide The name given to an election which one party wins by a very large margin. Famous landslides in UK elections include Labour's victory in 1945, the Conservative win in 1983 and the election which brought Tony Blair to power in 1997. Left wing A person or party with strong socialist policies or beliefs. Liberal Democrat The name of the party occupying the centre ground of British politics. They were formed from the former Liberal party and Social Democrats, a Labour splinter group, and combine support for traditional liberalism such as religious tolerance and individual freedom, with support for social justice. Majority A majority in Parliament means one side has at least one more vote than all the other parties combined and is therefore more likely to be able to push through any legislative plans. Majority government When one party wins more than half of the seats in the Commons, they can rule alone in a majority government Mandate Politicians say they have a mandate, or authority, to carry out a policy when they have the backing of the electorate. Manifesto A public declaration of a party's ideas and policies, usually printed during the campaign. Once in power, a government is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver. Marginal Seats where the gap between the two or more leading parties is relatively small. Often regarded as less than a 10% margin or requiring a swing (see below) of 5% or less, though very dependent on prevailing political conditions. Minority government A minority government is one that does not have a majority of the seats in Parliament. It means the government is less likely to be able to push through any legislative programme. Boris Johnson has suffered a number of defeats in Parliament over a no-deal Brexit because he does not have a majority. MP Strictly this includes members of the House of Lords, but in practice means only members of the House of Commons. When an election is called Parliament is dissolved and there are no more MPs until it assembles again. Nomination papers A candidate must be nominated on these documents by 10 voters living in the constituency. Opinion poll A survey asking people's opinion on one or more issues. In an election campaign, the key question is usually about which party people will vote for. Opposition The largest party not in government is known as the official opposition. It receives extra parliamentary funding in recognition of its status. Party Election Broadcast Broadcasts made by the parties and transmitted on TV or radio. By agreement with the broadcasters, each party is allowed a certain number according to its election strength and number of candidates fielded.

It is calculated by comparing the percentage of the vote won in a particular election to the figure obtained in the previous election. Polling day Election day Polling station Place where people go to cast their votes Postal vote People unable to get to a polling station are allowed to vote by post if they apply in advance. Proportional representation (PR) Any voting system where the share of seats represents the share of votes is described as proportional representation. The UK currently has a first past the post system. Prorogation Parliament is usually prorogued, or suspended, ahead of an election or Queen's Speech to allow for preparations. In September 2019 Boris Johnson attempted to prorogue Parliament for five weeks, but the Supreme Court later ruled the prorogation unlawful and MPs returned to Parliament. Psephologist A person who studies voting and voting patterns. Purdah This is the time between the announcement of an election and the final election results. During this period media organisations have to ensure any political reporting is balanced and is not likely to influence the outcome of the election. Recount If a result is close, any candidate may ask for a recount. The process can be repeated several times if necessary until the candidates are satisfied. The returning officer has the final say on whether a recount takes place. Returning officer The official in charge of elections in each of the constituencies. On election night they read out the results for each candidate in alphabetical order by surname. Right wing Someone who is right wing in politics usually supports tradition and authority, as well as capitalism. The Conservative party is regarded as the main centre-right party in the UK. Safe seat A safe seat is a constituency where an MP has a sufficiently large majority to be considered unwinnable by the opposition. Spin room The attempt to place a favourable interpretation on an event so that people or the media will interpret it in that way. Those performing this act are known as spin doctors. Spoiled ballot Any ballot paper that is not marked clearly, eg with more than one box ticked or with writing scrawled across it, is described as a spoiled ballot and does not count towards the result. Tactical voting This is when people vote not for the party they really support, but for another party in order to keep out a more disliked rival. Target seat In theory, any seat that a party contests and held by a rival is one of its targets. In practice, a target seat is one that a party believes it can win and puts a lot of effort into doing so. Turnout Turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot on polling day. Vote of no confidence It is usually the leader of the opposition, currently Jeremy Corby, who calls for a vote of no confidence, in an attempt to topple the government. If more MPs vote for the motion than against it, then the government has 14 days to try to win back the confidence of MPs through another vote â while the opposition parties try to form an alternative government. If nothing is resolved, then a general election is triggered. Westminster The UK Parliament is located in the Palace of Westminster in the centre of London and the term is often used as an alternative to Parliament. Working majority A working majority in Parliament is what a government needs to carry out its legislative programme without risk of defeat. It means the government can rely on at least one more vote than the opposition parties. However, in the current Parliament, the government no longer has a majority and MPs from a range of opposition parties have joined forces to form a parliamentary majority big enough to defeat the government over plans for a no-deal Brexit.

"This video can not be played 'Private investment is bringing down the cost of renewable energy' Nationalising UK energy companies will delay the UK's move towards a zero carbon future, according to the chief executive of Scottish Power, Keith Anderson. He said that investment by the private sector had seen the cost of renewable energy plummet over the last decade and that debates about nationalisation would only serve as a distraction from averting a climate emergency. ""We need to focus on hitting zero carbon by 2050. Anything else is a distraction. ""Having big arguments about who owns what is the worst thing we could do right now. It would slow everything down when what we need to do is speed up."" A Labour spokesman said Mr Anderson's comments were ""hardly surprising"" as they represented ""vested interests"". ""Labour has set out our plans to dramatically expand the rollout of renewable generation - so that we can hit net zero by the 2030s - not 2050,"" he said. ""While generous public subsidies have led to some private sector investment in renewable generation, private ownership of the UK's grid has been a disaster, with shareholder dividends prioritised over investment."" Top energy firms move offshore over Labour plans Labour eyes 'radical' plan for companies Mr Anderson told the BBC: ""We estimate we need to install 4,000 electric car charging points a day between now and 31 December 2050, and if we delay that for a year arguing about ownership that is 1.5 million charging points that won't get installed in time."" Labour says it would increase charging points at a faster rate than the private sector has managed. But Mr Anderson said that competition and innovation had revolutionised his company and the industry. ""If you look back 20 years we were predominantly a coal burning generator. Now, we have shut down all our coal mines, got rid of gas and we are now a 100% renewable energy company. That's what we want us and other companies to deliver."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has described Labour's plans as radical Labour plans to nationalise the big six energy providers and divide their assets, workforce and customers into 14 state-owned regional agencies. It's not just energy. A Labour government would also take water, the Royal Mail and BT's broadband business into public ownership. So how much would this cost? That's a tricky question to answer. Labour say parliament would decide how much to pay the current owners - which of course includes many worker's pension funds - but the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates it would add at least Â£200bn to government debt. However, the government would collect the associated revenue - apart from broadband which it eventually wants to give away for free. Arguments about who is better at delivering key public services and utilities are not new. But the Labour Party manifesto proposes one of the most radical overhauls of how companies are owned and run in decades. The private sector will tell you that the prospect of nationalisation is deterring private investment at a crucial time - while Labour would say only the state has the power to borrow and invest at the scale and pace that's needed. In Scotland, as in most of Europe, the water industry is already nationalised and the SNP wants to extend public ownership of rail, buses and ferries. Prof Andrew Cumbers of Glasgow University says that many breakthroughs in innovation and technology - particularly in renewable energy - have been achieved thanks to state subsidies. ""It sounds radical but it's only what happens in many other countries. The government can borrow much more cheaply than companies. If you leave it all to the private sector, research and development inevitably gets cut to divert profits into shareholder dividends."" Smaller companies - such as Bulb, Ovo and Octopus in energy, and Virgin Media and Talk Talk in broadband - would not face nationalisation. That would leave them competing with the state. Tough if you are giving services like broadband away for free or others at less than market prices. Even Labour describe their own policies as radical. On that at least business would agree.

"Susan Deacon was a Labour MSP for two terms, and served as health minister Susan Deacon has resigned as chairwoman of Scotland's police watchdog, saying the system is ""fundamentally flawed"". The former Labour MSP was appointed to the Scottish Police Authority in 2017. But in her resignation letter, she said there was ""little more"" she could do to make the governance and accountability of policing work effectively. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon rejected opposition claims the police service was ""in crisis"" and said the SPA would continue to make improvements. Prof Deacon was the third person to chair the SPA since it began work in April 2013 alongside the launch of Scotland's single police service. When she was appointed in 2017, then justice secretary Michael Matheson said she would ""bring a fresh perspective to the governance of Scottish policing"". Prof Deacon said she had worked ""tirelessly"" to ensure the SPA operated effectively, and that public confidence and trust in policing was maintained. ""In truth, however, I have increasingly become convinced that the governance and accountability arrangements for policing in Scotland are fundamentally flawed, in structure, culture and practice, and I conclude that there is little more I can do to make these arrangements work effectively,"" she said. ""I would suggest that the Scottish government thinks afresh about how the police service is scrutinised and held to account and how, or if, a better separation between politics and policing, and indeed between the police service and those who oversee it, can be achieved."" It has not been an easy two years for Susan Deacon as chairwoman of the Scottish Police Authority. She was appointed in December 2017 following turmoil in the authority, which was seen as lacking transparency in its dealings, and was rocked by accusations of bullying surrounding previous chairman Andrew Flanagan. The police service was also in turmoil, with aseries of allegations of gross misconductbeing investigated against the chief constable, Phil Gormley, who resigned in early 2018. The SPA's turbulent beginnings Police complaints system 'should be speeded up' 'Unacceptable' failings at police body Prof Deacon has been credited with making the actions of the authority, whose role is to hold Police Scotland to account, more transparent. But it is her criticism of the way the national force is scrutinised and held to account which will cause concern, particularly her view that current governance and accountability arrangements are fundamentally flawed. It was a view shared by HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland, Gill Imrie, who told Holyrood's justice committee on Tuesday that senior officers at Police Scotland had become ""frustrated"" by the lack of scrutiny. In anearlier report,external, she said there was ""no clear vision, strategy or plan in place"" for the SPA. Policing inevitably is a highly political matter, but Prof Deacon said the government must review the separation between politics and policing, and said she felt there was little more she could do in the role. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon responded to questions about the Scottish Police Authority Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said there had been ""significant improvement across many facets of the police service in Scotland"" during Prof Deacon's time at the SPA. ""As Ms Deacon herself acknowledges, our police service is in a much stronger place now than prior to her appointment,"" he said. At First Minister's Questions, Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the police was ""in crisis once again"" and claimed there was a ""toxic mix of chaos and complacency"". Ms Sturgeon replied: ""The police is not in crisis and I think it does a disservice to police officers around our country who are working so hard to keep us safe to say so."" She said the SPA would continue with the improvements which were being made to governance and accountability. Audit Scotland has criticised the SPA for poor governance and a lack of transparency Scottish Labour said the resignation ""raises serious questions"" about the SPA's ability to oversee Police Scotland, while the Scottish Conservatives described the SPA as ""an organisation in crisis"". The SPA's vice chairman, David Crichton, will lead the SPA until a new appointment is made. He said: ""We believe that the system of governance and accountability for policing in Scotland that was envisaged by the founding legislation is a sound one and can work effectively,"" he added. ""While we respect this personal decision of the chair, our collective focus will be on working together with our dedicated staff team to build on recent progress, deliver the actions and improvements already identified, and redouble the SPA's focus on the issues of greatest importance to policing and the public."" However, the Scottish Police Federation said the resignation was not a surprise. Its chairwoman, Andrea MacDonald, said: ""It has been apparent to the Scottish Police Federation that the authority has not been operating effectively for some time. ""It is nonetheless disappointing that we now see the Scottish Police Authority looking for its fourth chair in six years."" Ms Deacon's predecessorAndrew Flanagan resigned in June 2017 after heavy criticismfrom two Holyrood committees over governance and transparency at the SPA. He said he was quitting to avoid being a ""distraction"" to the new 10-year policing strategy, and that the ""personalised"" debate had ""impacted on me and my family"". The SPA's first chairman, Vic Emery, stepped down in September 2015 after deciding not to seek an extension to his contract. He had been involved in a number of public spats with the first chief constable of the new police service, Sir Stephen House.

"Labour is promising to base a network of small business advisers in Post Office branches if it wins next Thursday's general election.

Lib Dem business spokesman Sam Gyimah said smaller firms have ""made it abundantly clear that any form of Brexit - be it red or blue - will harm their ability to hire staff, make it more difficult to export to our closest partners and ratchet up the cost of doing business"".

"Officials have issued fresh warnings for blazes around Sydney About 100 bushfires are raging in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), with the most severe forming into a ""mega blaze"" north of Sydney. More than 2,000 firefighters are battling bushfires, which escalated in intensity late on Thursday. Footage of one blaze on the southern fringe of the city showed firefighters fleeing as flames surged forward. Australia's largest city has been blanketed by thick smoke all week, causing a rise in medical problems. Since October, bushfires have killed six people and destroyed more than 700 homes across Australia. The severity of the blazes so early in the fire season has caused alarm, and prompted calls for greater action to tackle climate change. This video can not be played Firefighters flee intense flames in Sydney, in a video shared by them to show the dangers of bushfires More than 1.6 million hectares of land in NSW have been burnt already. Fires have also raged across Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. Fires spanned the entire NSW coastline on Friday, with some sparking emergency warnings amid hot and windy conditions. Authorities confirmed three fires had merged into a ""mega blaze"" north of Sydney on Friday, covering more than 300,000 hectares. That blaze is about the size of greater Sydney, officials said. ""We have also seen the fires coming in very close proximity to major population centres,"" said NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian. Allow Twitter content?

Sydney's air quality deteriorated beyond ""hazardous"" levels this week as smoke from the fires again blanketed the city. The front page of the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Friday read:""Sydney chokes as state burns"".,external The smoke haze over the city on Thursday Hospital admissions have risen 25% in the past week said officials, with people reporting asthma and breathing problems. About five million people live in greater Sydney. People have been warned to stay indoors, but the smoke in some areas has also seeped into buildings. How bad is bushfire smoke for health? Toxic smoke affects golfers at Australian Open Early on Friday, the NSW capital ranked number 19 on the Air Visual global rankings of cities with the worst air pollution - putting it ahead of Shanghai and Mumbai. The smoke has also affected towns closer to the fires for weeks. The state government said on Thursday that the air pollution event was ""the longest and most widespread in our records"". Bushfires are common in Australia, but this year's fire season is more intense and has begun earlier than usual - something meteorologists say is exacerbated by climate change. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology says thatclimate change has led to an increase in extreme heat events,externaland raised the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. Last week, the bureau noted that NSW had endured its driest spring season on record. It also warned that Australia's coming summer was predicted to bring similar conditions to last year's - the nation's hottest summer on record. Australia may see 50C days 'in decades' Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' Official figures have shown 2018 and 2017 were Australia's third and fourth-hottest years on record respectively.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has dismissed accusations linking the crisis to his government's policies.

"Uber said it received almost 6,000 reports of sexual assault in the United States in 2017 and 2018. While the number of cases rose in 2018, the rate of incidents dropped by 16%, as the number of journeys was higher. Passengers - as opposed to drivers - accounted for nearly half of those accused of sexual assault. The data was published ina report which Uber said showed its commitment,externalto ""improving safety for Uber and the entire industry"". Uber is facing growing scrutiny around the world, and recentlylost its licence to operate in London. The report showed 5,981 sexual assault incidents were reported out of the 2.3bn US trips over the two-year period. Uber claimed 99.9% of the total journeys were concluded without safety issues. Uber: Will it get its London licence back? 'Uber genuinely was a lifeline' What do drivers think of Uber? Uber saidthe report was the first comprehensive safety review of its ride-hailing business.,external ""Voluntarily publishing a report that discusses these difficult safety issues is not easy,"" said Tony West, chief legal officer at Uber. ""Most companies don't talk about issues like sexual violence because doing so risks inviting negative headlines and public criticism. But we feel it's time for a new approach."" The company told the BBC there were currently no concrete plans to release safety reports for any non-US markets. This is a hugely significant document that for the first time details the extent to which the gig economy puts people in harm's way. Uber described it as a complex project that was two years in the making, with much of that time spent auditing the data to ensure accuracy. It should be noted that, knowing it would provoke grim headlines, the firm opted to release this data voluntarily. The firm has committed to releasing the report every two years. Now that Uber has proven it can produce this data in a digestible form, it must keep doing so at regular intervals and, eventually, for all its markets around the world. That's not an easy undertaking, but the company can afford it. Continual publication of the report would bring focus and urgency: is Uber's record on safety getting better or worse? Why might that be? Are certain regions safer than others? What can we learn from that? Attention must also turn to the other gig economy firms out there. Lyft - which is facing a lawsuit over sexual assault filed just this week - has no excuses now that its bigger rival has acted. Uber said 3,045 sexual assault reports were made in 2018 compared with 2,936 in 2017. Last year, 1.3 billion trips were completed in the US, up from one billion in 2017. The head of the US National Sexual Violence Resource Center, Karen Baker, welcomed the report, saying it ""provides an opportunity to shed light on how this information-sharing emboldens our work for a safer future"". Passenger safety, in particular sexual violence, have been major challenges for Uber and its US rival Lyft, as well as China's Didi. In November,London's transport regulator announced that Uber would not be granted a new licence to operate after repeated safety issues. The firm has appealed against the ruling and continues to operate during the process. Uber loses licence to operate in London Uber: Will it get its London licence back?

"This video can not be played 'A responsibility that does not end' - Merkel Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Germany has an unending responsibility to remember the Nazis' war crimes, as she made her first trip while in office to the Auschwitz death camp in Poland. The responsibility was ""part of our national identity"", she said. Her visit comes amid a rise in German anti-Semitism and ahead of the 75th anniversary of the camp's liberation. The Nazi regime murdered an estimated 1.1 million people, the vast majority of them Jewish, at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Horror of Germans targeted in anti-Semitic attack In pictures: Germany Halle gun attack Mrs Merkel was accompanied on her visit by Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and a death camp survivor, 87-year-old Bogdan Stanislaw Bartnikowski. She walked through the notorious ""Arbeit macht frei"" (work sets you free) gates at Auschwitz and then held a minute's silence at the so-called Black Wall, where thousands of prisoners were executed She then moved to the Birkenau site where she gave her speech. Angela Merkel is the third German chancellor to visit the site ""Remembering the crimes... is a responsibility which never ends. It belongs inseparably to our country,"" Mrs Merkel said. ""To be aware of this responsibility is part of our national identity, our self-understanding as an enlightened and free society... a democracy."" Germany continued to have ""deep shame"" for what happened in Auschwitz-Birkenau. ""There are no words to express our sorrow,"" Mrs Merkel said. Mrs Merkel acknowledged the rise of anti-Semitism in her country ""I bow my head before the victims of the Shoah,"" she told the gathered Holocaust survivors. Mrs Merkel also acknowledged the rise of anti-Semitism in her country, saying to combat it ""the history of extermination camps has to be shared"". Mrs Merkel was also accompanied by the president of Germany's Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, and the head of the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma, Romani Rose. Major events are planned for the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops on 27 January. But Mrs Merkel has chosen to go to the site now, and to attend the 10th anniversary ofthe Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation,external, a group that tries to preserve the camp as a memorial and a warning for future generations. As part of her visit, Germany's federal states announced a â¬60m (Â£51m; $66m) gift to the foundation.

This video can not be played ""What a wonderful thing it is to know that you're alive"" German chancellors have made the trip to Auschwitz before - Helmut Schmidt visited in 1977 and Helmut Kohl in 1989 and 1995. But none has visited since, and this first visit by a chancellor for 24 years is being viewed as highly symbolic. Neither chancellor had to confront a rise in anti-Semitic attacks. Less than two months ago,a 40-year-old woman and 20-year-old man were shot dead outside a synagoguein eastern Germany. A 27-year-old man confessed and admitted havinga far-right, anti-Semitic motivefor the shooting. Official figures showed 1,646 hate crimes against Jews were committed in Germany last year - an increase of 10% on the previous year. Physical attacks against Jews in Germany also rose in the same period, with 62 violent incidents recorded in 2018, up from 37 in 2017. German Jews warned not to wear kippas Germany to fight anti-Semitism in schools Is there a growing far-right threat online?

"This video can not be played Corbyn vs Johnson: BBC election debate roundup Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over Brexit in the final head-to-head debate before the 12 December election. During the live debate, Mr Corbyn said Labour would bring Brexit ""to an end"" by negotiating a new deal and putting it back to the public in a referendum, alongside a Remain option. Mr Johnson said he had ""a wonderful deal"", and would use it to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January. Other topics covered included the NHS, security and Northern Ireland. Early on in the debate - hosted by Today presenter Nick Robinson - the Labour leader said he would negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the EU within three months before putting it to a final say referendum - alongside Remain - within six months. The prime minister countered by saying he already had a withdrawal agreement in place, and would use it to leave the EU next month if he won a working majority in Parliament. But Nick Robinson challenged Mr Johnson, pointing out that while he had a withdrawal deal in place, he did not have a trade deal with the EU, and so could not rule out a no-deal exit in January 2021. Kuenssberg: No fireworks moment in debate Corbyn and Johnson TV debate fact-checked Five key things in the BBC's Johnson-Corbyn debate Who should I vote for? Election 2019 manifesto guide Coming into the event, Labour and the Conservatives had spent the day arguing over how Mr Johnson's Brexit deal might affect Northern Ireland. Laboursaid a leaked document showedMr Johnson's agreement would have a ""devastating"" impact on Northern Ireland. When the subject arose in the debate, Mr Corbyn said of his rival: ""He spoke at a DUP conference and said there would be no [trade] restrictions [after Brexit] whatsoever, we now know there are restrictions."" But Mr Johnson was met with applause from the audience when he said he found it ""slightly curious"" to be lectured about the union by Mr Corbyn, referring to the Labour leader's past support for those who want to see a united Ireland. This video can not be played Corbyn and Johnson clash over NHS Like Brexit, the NHS has featured heavily in the campaign so far - and Friday's debate was no different. Faith, a student nurse in the audience, asked how each leader would deal with a shortage of NHS nurses. The Conservative leader said a government run by him would ""encourage nurses overseas to come"" to the UK ""by shortening the time for their visa applications"" and by reintroducing bursaries for training. Mr Corbyn described the NHS as at ""breaking point"", adding that, under a Labour government, ""Â£40bn in total would go into the NHS in order to fund it properly"". The Labour leader also repeated one of his main attack lines of the campaign - that a Tory government would allow the NHS to form part of a future trade deal with the US. However, Mr Johnson described that claim as ""Bermuda Triangle stuff"". Responding to the performances of Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""That was utterly woeful. Two uninspiring men, both of them unsuited to be PM."" Meanwhile, Amelia Womack, of the Green Party, told the BBC: ""I find it frustrating, as a younger woman, that we weren't discussing things that are relevant to my generation - whether that's house prices, rental prices, freedom of movement across Europe, or even zero-hour contracts."" Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said the debate felt like a ""shoddy end-of-term pantomime"", and said both men displayed a ""lack of honesty"". She added that, contrary to the claims of Mr Johnson, the ""chaos"" of Brexit ""is going to go on"", even if the UK leaves the EU next month. And the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""Tonight's debate was British politics at its worst. Two leaders offering nothing new, nothing different and neither being honest about the pain Brexit will cause our communities."" The prime minister and Mr Corbyn were also asked about security - an issue that has risen to prominence sincethe London Bridge attack on 29 November. Both candidates were asked by an audience member if they would prioritise the safety of citizens over human rights. Mr Corbyn said the choice was ""not an either/or"". He added the UK could not have security ""on the cheap"", and so Labour would ""back the police up"" with an increase in officer numbers. When it came to his turn, Mr Johnson referred to the London Bridge attack, and said it was ""extraordinary and wrong"" that the attacker was given automatic early release from prison after an earlier terrorism conviction. In a campaign where both parties have sought to repeatedly talk about their key themes, tonight did not diverge radically from the script. Boris Johnson came under pressure on the issue of trust - and whether his Brexit plan would mean checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn was once again pressed on his failure to pick a side on Brexit - and questioned on why Europe would offer Labour a new deal when so many frontbenchers back Remain. Both men landed punches. But none of them were critical. And given that polls suggest the Conservatives are ahead in the polls - that might suit Boris Johnson more than Jeremy Corbyn.

"This video can not be played What Andrew Neil wants to ask Boris Johnson The BBC's Andrew Neil has issued a challenge to Boris Johnson to take part in a sit-down interview with him before next week's general election. Mr Johnson is the only leader of a main party not to have faced a half-hour, prime-time BBC One grilling by Mr Neil. The Conservative leader has denied claims he is avoiding scrutiny. But Mr Neil addressed the PM directly at the end of his fourth leader interview at this election, with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage. ""It is not too late. We have an interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say,"" he said, in a monologue. ""The theme running through our questions is trust - and why at so many times in his career, in politics and journalism, critics and sometimes even those close to him have deemed him to be untrustworthy. ""It is, of course, relevant to what he is promising us all now."" In full: Neil's interview challenge to Johnson Mr Johnson has also declined an invitation to be grilled by ITV's Julie Etchingham, as part of her series of leader interviews. Mr Neil said that no broadcaster ""can compel a politician to be interviewed"". But he added: ""Leaders' interviews have been a key part of the BBC's prime-time election coverage for decades. ""We do them, on your behalf, to scrutinise and hold to account those who would govern us. That is democracy. ""We have always proceeded in good faith that the leaders would participate. And in every election they have. All of them. Until this one."" Mr Neil then listed the questions he wanted the prime minister to answer. These include whether he can be trusted to deliver on his promises for the NHS - and keeping the health service ""off the table"" in any post-Brexit trade talks with the US. Mr Neil said he would also ask the PM about his claim that he has always been an opponent of austerity, another ""question of trust"". He ended the monologue by saying: ""The prime minister of our nation will, at times, have to stand up to President Trump, President Putin, President Xi of China. ""So it was surely not expecting too much that he spend half an hour standing up to me."" Andrew Neil grilled Jeremy Corbyn about anti-Semitism and other issues Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage have all faced a grilling by Mr Neil. Inhis interview with Mr Neil, the Labour leader repeatedly declined to apologise to the Jewish community for anti-Semitism in his party, something he has now donein an interview with ITV's This Morning. Jo Swinson apologised for supporting welfare cuts when she was part of the Lib Dem/Conservative coalitionin her Neil interview. Nicola Sturgeonwas pressed about Scottish independence and the EU, and her party's record on the NHS in Scotland, while Nigel Farage wasforced to defend his decisionnot to contest Tory seats. Mr Johnson was quizzed by the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, on why he had not yet agreed to be interviewed by Andrew Neil. He denied avoiding prime-time scrutiny, saying he had done TV debates, interviews and a ""two-hour phone-in"". This video can not be played 'Why are you avoiding being interviewed by Andrew Neil?' Separately, on Thursday evening, The Labour Party complained about BBC bias, in a letter to Director General Tony Hall. Labour's co-campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne highlighted Mr Johnson's failure to be interviewed by Andrew Neil. In his letter, Mr Gwynne claimed the Conservatives were being allowed to ""play"" the corporation, making the BBC effectively ""complicit in giving the Conservative Party an unfair electoral advantage"". He said Labour had agreed Mr Corbyn's interview with Mr Neil based on the ""clear understanding"" that Mr Johnson had agreed the same terms. ""Instead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a platform through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability."" The BBC is expected to respond in writing to the Labour complaint. But a spokesperson said in a statement: ""The BBC will continue to make its own independent editorial decisions, and is committed to reporting the election campaign fairly, impartially and without fear or favour."" In another development, the prime minister's team have confirmed that Mr Johnson will not find time for an interview with ITV before the general election.

A spokesman for ITV said the programme had bid for Mr Johnson when the general election was called. ""They have contacted his press team on repeated occasions with times and dates offered to film an interview,"" the spokesman said. ""Boris Johnson's team have today confirmed he will not be taking part. ""The programme will instead feature a profile of the prime minister using fresh interviews with other contributors and archive footage."" ITV Tonight presenter Julie Etchingham has recorded an interview with Jeremy Corbyn, which was broadcast on Thursday evening. Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""Boris Johnson thinks he's born to rule and doesn't have to face scrutiny. ""He's running scared because every time he is confronted with the impact of nine years of austerity, the cost of living crisis and his plans to sell out our NHS, the more he is exposed."" Liberal Democrat Leader Jo Swinson said: ""Boris Johnson must stop ducking scrutiny. His cowardly behaviour shows why he simply isn't fit to be prime minister."" She said it was ""bad enough"" that her party had been ""excluded"" from the BBC's head-to-head debate between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn, and ""even worse that right now Boris Johnson won't be held properly to account for his lies and extreme Brexit plans"". Mr Johnson will face Mr Corbyn in a prime ministerial debate at 2030 GMT, on BBC One, on Friday.

"In lots of ways this is a complicated election. Derbyshire is not the same as Dundee, Birmingham is not the same as Bangor. Westminster sure isn't the same as Widnes - and London, maybe above all else, isn't the same as Linlithgow, Leeds or Ludlow. There are a multitude of contenders as well - not just the traditional parties, but the SNP and Plaid Cymru, the Brexit Party, what remains of the Independent Group for Change, moveable tribes of party defectors and a clutch of independents as well. But as we enter the last seven days of this election, in our first-past-the-post system, whether you believe it is the best or the worst of all worlds, the choice irrevocably, and inevitably perhaps, moves towards the two big teams - the reds and the blues, and the two big, flawed, characters of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. At the start of this campaignwe talked hereabout how, in a strange way, they are an odd couple who share some traits. And on the trail that has been shown, again and again, to be the case. Boris Johnson fascinates some people, who are desperate to shake his hand, eager as children when there are free sweets on offer. But for others he is simply not someone they can trust, who they may even back, but will fill in their ballots wearing kid gloves. As one voter in Cardiff told me last week, she had backed Labour all her life, but then had voted Leave, so will now back Boris Johnson, having flirted with the idea of voting for the Brexit Party. She had this parting shot: ""I hope he's not lying."" Boris Johnson delivers a speech to factory workers in the Midlands None of our campaign journeys have provided scientific evidence of the Conservatives cruising to an enthusiastic majority. Seeing Jeremy Corbyn on the trail, there is no doubting how much the party members who turn up to Labour's organised election events believe in him. They talk of ""the movement"", of big change coming. He is greeted by smaller crowds, perhaps, than in 2017, but by big Labour audiences nonetheless, delighted to see him and sing along to the now-familiar, ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chorus. But Labour candidates talk privately, again and again, of how his perceived unpopularity among many traditional voters is the block to a Labour majority. But the enthusiasm for Boris Johnson, where it exists, is more jaded than during the referendum of 2016. Likewise, the delight at Jeremy Corbyn is dimmed compared with the crowds that we saw greet him in 2017. Jeremy Corbyn at a Labour rally in Birmingham One man today told me, with tears gathering in the corner of his eyes, that he was so cross about this election because he believed that it had to happen because politicians have made such a mess of the last few years, and obviously upset that the choices were limited in his view, to a decision between two men, neither of whom he trusts. As we enter the final week of this campaign though, we will see from the two main protagonists a repetition of their core messages, rather than a grand invitation to inspire. For the Tories that will be - yes, you guessed it - to resolve Brexit, to remove the biggest question mark that's been hanging over British politics for three years now. Not, of course, what the world will look like after the trade deal that could be done with Brussels (or not) - but whether we actually leave or not. And for Labour, it will be punching at the bruises that nearly a decade of a squeeze on public spending has created. There are of course many other issues that might and will raise their heads in the time that's left. It's of course extremely hard to read how the national polls and sentiment on the ground will translate into the final numbers. But - unless something very strange happens in the next seven days - those pretty stable party positions are likely to result in the Conservatives being the biggest party, but not necessarily clearing the hurdle that will see them returning to government with a majority. And unlike the deeply dramatic election and referendum campaigns we have seen in the past few years, perhaps - just whisper it - in the run-up to this particular polling day, nothing has changed.
