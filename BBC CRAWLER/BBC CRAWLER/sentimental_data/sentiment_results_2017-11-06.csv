"Pastor Frank Pomeroy and his wife Sherri who have lost a daughter Half of the 26 victims of the worst mass shooting in Texas history are children, officials say, as a portrait of a small town Texas church emerges. A pregnant woman's unborn baby was named as the shooting's youngest victim. Another child killed was just one year old. The oldest victim of the attack was a 77-year-old woman. Twenty more were wounded, 10 were in a critical condition. Authorities fear the death toll could rise. Local law enforcement have not released the victim's identities, but the names of some of those gunned down are emerging. According to US media, the gunman's ex-wife's grandmother was among the dead. This video can not be played 'Belle died with her church family,' her mother said The first victim to be named was the 14-year-old daughter of First Baptist Church of Sutherland Spring's pastor, Frank Pomeroy. Pastor Pomeroy, who was away in Oklahoma at the time, told ABC News she was ""one very beautiful, special child"". ""We lost more than Belle yesterday, and one thing that gives me a sliver of encouragement is the fact that Belle was surrounded yesterday by her church family that she loved fiercely,"" her mother Sherri said on Monday. Bryan and Karla Holcombe Eight members of the Holcombe family were among the dead. Bryan Holcombe was serving as the guest pastor in Pastor Pomeroy's absence. An associate pastor at the church who also conducted prison ministry, he was about to lead the congregation in worship when he was shot dead, his parents Joe and Claryce told the Washington Post. Bryan's wife of 25 years, Karla, died too. Their son Marc Daniel Holcombe, 36, died alongside his one-year-old daughter Noah. Another son of Bryan and Karla, John, survived but his eight-month pregnant wife, Crystal Holcombe, was killed. They were expecting their first child together. The unborn child has been included in the death count. The gunman killed three of Crystal's five children by a previous marriage - Emily, Megan and Greg. The two others are said to be in the hospital with their stepfather,according to CNN,external. ""She doesn't even drink, smoke or nothing,"" her brother Nick Uhlig told the Houston Chronicle. ""She just takes care of kids; she raises goats and makes homemade cheese... They don't go out dancing or anything like that. They're real old-fashioned, down-to-earth."" The Holcombe's close family friend was killed with her two children, who were wounded. She reportedly lived with Bryan and Karla and called them Mom and Dad, according to local reports. ""This is a huge loss. Tara was very kind-hearted person, great employee,"" wrote Kevin Koenen, the owner of the Aumont Saloon where Ms McNulty worked. A 13-year-old girl was shot dead, theSan Antonio Express-News,externalreports. Amanda Mosel, 34, said the victim was her goddaughter. Family members confirmed that Lula White, the gunman's ex-wife's grandmother, was also among the dead. White frequently volunteered at the church, according to her Facebook page. Brooke Ward, five, and Emily Garza, seven, were killed, along with their mother Joann Ward. Her son Ryland, also aged five, was seriously injured - but is expected to survive. Nine-year-old Rihanna - the oldest daughter - survived. Ms Ward's friend, Vonda Greek Smith, paid tribute to the mother-of-four on Facebook, saying that she died ""shielding"" her children. ""Little Rihanna (9) was there at the shooting but mommy pushed her down when she saw the shooter open fire, so in her words, 'I didn't get shot because I was hiding, and momma covered Emily, Ryland & Brooke.'"" Haley Krueger, 16 Haley Krueger, 16, was also killed, her mother Charlene Marie Uhl told US media. ""She was a vibrant 16-year-old that loved life,"" Mrs Uhl said, adding that she had hopes to become a nurse. ""She loved babies and always wanted to help."" Haley had arrived at church early on Sunday to prepare breakfast, her mother told People magazine. Richard Rodriguez and his wife of 11 years, Therese Rodriguez, were killed. Richard's daughter told US media that her father and stepmother were active in the church community. She said they often took their grandchildren to church, but did not on the day of the shooting. Robert was a retired high-ranking member of the US air force and had served for 30 years. Their two children are also reportedly on active service. ""This is a huge tragedy, not only for the family, for this small town,"" said Renee Haley, director of Veterans Services for Clare County, Michigan.

"This video can not be played 'Our kids play together,' says a resident whose neighbours are feared dead When a mass shooting happens in a small town like Sutherland Springs, Texas, everyone knows a victim. Pauline Garza was lazy on Sunday morning, and it might have saved her life. She and her 11-year-old daughter were thinking about going to church. She isn't a regular, but her daughter was baptised there. This time, they decided not to. ""Feeling lazy,"" she says, standing on her porch 24 hours later. Soon afterwards, they heard the gunfire. Pauline's neighbours, the Holcombes, were also churchgoers. Pauline thinks they were in church on Sunday morning. She hasn't seen them return. The Holcombes' two dogs lie on the drive, waiting. The gate is still locked; the porch light is still on. The families are close. Pauline's daughter stays over at the Holcombes' place. ""Very nice family,"" says Pauline, 47. ""They're always out in the yard. ""The kids will play with my daughter all the time. Very nice."" When Pauline heard the shots, she thought it was a neighbour working on his house. ""I asked my daughter - 'What was that noise?' She said 'I don't know'. ""We came to the door. I saw my (other) neighbour standing there. You could still hear the shots being fired. ""I never thought it was gunshots. I never did."" And when she found it was gunfire? ""I thought 'How can that happen here?' It's unreal."" Sutherland Springs: The victims Who was Sutherland Springs gunman? America's gun culture in 10 charts The town will recover, says Julius Around 400 people live in Sutherland Springs, a small town in Texas, 30 miles (48km) east of San Antonio. It isn't a wealthy place. There are neat, well-built houses, but there is decay, too. Rusty, abandoned cars inhabit front gardens. Some houses disappear under weeds. The All Coin Laundry, long forgotten, hasn't washed a shirt in 10 years, at least. People work in ""nursing homes, hospitals, the convenience store,"" says Pauline. But - while it isn't wealthy - it is friendly. Neighbours know each other. People say hello. The school bus driver waves at passers-by. In one garden, a sign says: ""Cowboys make good points with spurs and barbed wire."" The next sign says: ""Welcome to Texas."" ""I love it here,"" says Pauline. ""You don't have all that loud stuff like the big cities."" The Holcombe family home Julius Kepper, 53, has lived in Sutherland Springs for seven years. At first, he thought Sunday's gunfire was building work. When he realised it wasn't, he grabbed his gun and ran out of the house. He wasn't the only one. His neighbour, Stephen, had already shot the attacker and given chase. Julius didn't go to church, but he knew ""a bunch of people"" who did. ""Some of the young guys who went would cut my yard,"" he says. ""It's a small community. You can't help but know people."" Julius is drinking a large Coke in the petrol station on the edge of town. Another customer sits at a table, drinking coffee. Behind the counter are rows of Texas caps. The San Antonio Express-News sits on the counter. ""Time for worship turns to horror,"" says the headline. Julius thinks the town will heal, but it will take time. ""For this to happen in a little country town with 300 people, it's inconceivable,"" he says. ""You kind of expect it in big cities. Not here."" Back on her porch, Pauline Garza thinks the shooting means more people will carry guns. ""Even to church,"" she says. ""We would never think out here in the country you would need a gun to protect yourself. Now you're going to have to. ""Now you got crazy people walking around everywhere."" Pauline didn't sleep on Sunday night. The what-ifs were playing through her mind. And, though she and her daughter are safe, their suffering isn't over. ""How do I talk to my daughter about this?"" she asks. ""How can I do that?""

"This video can not be played Warning signs of a potential mass shooter In the course of a short and troubled life, Devin Patrick Kelley,the gunman who killed 26 peopleand wounded 20 more at a Texas church on Sunday, beat his wife and infant stepson, was court martialled, and escaped a mental health clinic. Kelley, who was 26 when he killed himself, moments after the shooting, began military service with the US Air Force in 2010 and served in its logistical readiness department based at Holloman air force base in New Mexico. In 2012, two years into his military career, he came up before a court-martial for the assault on his wife and stepson - the young boy's skull was reportedly fractured - and was sentenced to a year's confinement and demoted in rank. Later that year he escaped from a mental health clinic in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, before being caught, according to a local police report. The report stated that he had attempted to sneak weapons onto the air base and ""carry out death threats"" against his chain of command. America's gun culture in 10 charts In pictures: Texas church shooting Kelley's first wife, Tessa, divorced him during his confinement, according to reports. He was released in 2013 and finally left the military in 2014 with a ""bad conduct"" discharge. He remarried in April 2014 to Danielle Shields. Law enforcement officials described the couple as estranged, the New York Times reported. Police have said that the shooting may have followed an argument between Kelley and Ms Shield's mother, Michelle, who worshipped at the church. Michelle Shields was not present during the shooting, at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, but her mother, Lula White, was killed in the hail of bullets, according to relatives' Facebook posts and interviews with the New York Daily News. Kelley fired many times inside the small church, clad in black tactical style clothing and using a military-style rifle. His victims ranged in age from from 5 to 72, authorities said. According to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Kelley was denied a permit for a gun by the state of Texas and should not have legally been allowed to own a firearm. Mr Abbott said it was important to ascertain how Kelley ""slipped through the crack"" in acquiring an assault rifle, given that he was ""a powder keg waiting to go off"". The killer's fragile mental state was likely worsened by his volatile relationship with his mother-in-law, who had received threatening text messages from him shortly before the shooting. Kelley's now-deleted Facebook page featured a photo of what appeared to be an assault rifle and a Mark Twain quote: ""I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it."" The suspect's LinkedIn page,externallists the causes he cares about, said to include animal welfare, arts and culture, children and civil rights. He describes himself as a ""hard working, dedicated person"" who has a high school diploma and is a ""management consultant"". A series of legal troubles began in 2012 when he was court-martialled and sentenced to a year in military prison for assaulting his wife and child In the same year Tessa Kelley filed court papers to divorce Kelley, with her wish being speedily granted. There were no children listed in the proceedings After his jail term ended in 2014, Kelley was demoted in rank and released from the military with a bad conduct discharge In August 2014 he again appeared in court - this time charged with mistreating, neglecting or being cruel to animals. The case was eventually dismissed Source: Washington Post,external It is not yet clear if Kelley had a specific grudge against the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs Kelley grew up in New Braunfels - about 35 miles (56km) north of Sutherland Springs - in the $1m home of his parents, the New York Times says. It was there that he was accused of assaulting his wife and stepson. He remarried in 2014. After leaving the military, Kelley worked for just over five weeks as a security guard for an amusement park in New Braunfels owned by the Schlitterbahn company. ""His employment was terminated in July,"" the company said in a statement. He was ""a seasonal unarmed night security guard"" Schlitterbahn said, and had passed a criminal background check. Some reports say that he lived for a while in a caravan park in a rural area. At night-timehe could be heard firing weapons, US media report.,external He is described as a loner with a number of minor traffic offences who posted about atheism online after giving up his role as a teacher in summer Bible classes. The latest mass killing has devastated the small community of people in Sutherland Springs Two former girlfriendstold NBC News,externalthat Kelley's behaviour had become ""disturbing - even violent"" after they broke up with him. ""Years after dating me he would try to bribe me to hang out with him,"" Katy Landry told the channel in a Facebook message. ""He ended up assaulting me. He would stalk me by repeatedly calling me - even prank calling me saying really weird stuff."" The small town where everyone knows a victim Another woman, Brittany Adcock, 22,said Kelley pressured her into having sex when she was 13,externaland he was 18. She told NBC he had continued to pester and harass her when she finished with him after two months. US officials say there is no evidence to suggest Kelley was linked to organised terrorists.

"The UK company which owns the PGL children's holidays brand exploited an anti-tax avoidance law to actually save itself tax, the Paradise Papers show. An amendment to rules introduced by the government in 2013 allowed Holidaybreak to legally avoid corporation tax by artificially shifting German profits to the Isle of Man. Holidaybreak says it follows all tax rules and disclosure requirements. The UK Treasury denies its regulations can help multinationals avoid tax. But theEU last month announced it is investigating,externalwhether the amendment to the Controlled Foreign Companies (CFC) rules amount to illegal state aid. David Cameron's coalition government had pledged to work with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and update tax rules to ensure ""these do not allow or encourage multinational enterprises to cut their tax bills by artificially shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions"". TheCFC rules,external, first introduced in 1984, enabled HMRC to impose full corporation tax on foreign subsidiaries of UK companies if they considered them to be shifting profits into tax havens. But the rules were reformed in 2013 and an ""exception"" was added to allow offshore subsidiaries of UK firms financing other group companies abroad to pay a quarter of the full rate. Campaigners including Action Aid have warned it would be open to exploitation and undermine the government's claims to support international efforts against tax avoidance. The Paradise Papers documents held by offshore law firm Appleby and seen by BBC Panorama show how a finance company set up by Holidaybreak could use the CFC change to pay corporation tax in the UK at 5.25% in 2015. Company profits in Germany are taxed at around 30%. By paying the reduced UK rate, Holidaybreak would be able to cut the amount of tax it paid on its German business by more than 1m euros (Â£900,000) a year, calculations suggest. The documents show the tax structure put in place after Cheshire-based Holidaybreak acquired the German budget hotel group Meininger in 2013. Appleby set up Meininger Finance Company Limited in the Isle of Man and it loaned 134.6m euros (Â£110.8m) to the German hotel group. The German company had to pay interest on the loan, which reduced both its profits and the amount of tax it had to pay in Germany. The interest payments went to the Isle of Man. Under the old rules they would have been taxed by the UK government at the full rate of corporation tax, but under the new rules Holidaybreak was allowed to pay just a quarter of the rate. The company would be able to shift between 6 and 7 million euros a year into the Isle of Man, according to the tax advice. Other documents show meetings of the finance company were held in Appleby's office in the island's capital, Douglas, to satisfy the UK tax authorities that the new company was being managed and controlled from the Isle of Man. Holidaybreak became part of Cox & Kings, an India-registered company and one of the world's longest established travel businesses, in 2011. A draft report in the Appleby documents outlines how the new company structure would work In a statement, Holidaybreak said: ""All our business affairs are conducted within the tax regulations and disclosure requirements as set out in the law of the countries we operate in, including the UK where Holidaybreak is headquartered. ""Where appropriate, we seek advice from third party advisers in order to help ensure this compliance with local law and regulations."" Fabio De Masi sat on the European Parliament's Panama Papers committee as an MEP and is now a German MP. He said: ""The Holidaybreak tax structure is exactly the sort of scheme the EU Commission will be looking at. The investigation could lead to the company being asked to pay some of the avoided tax back. ""The UK does have the option of objecting to the EU Commission's investigation through the European Court of Justice. However, this would mean the UK government doesn't want the money back,"" he added. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, the former chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, sees the CFC rule amendment in 2013 as evidence the coalition government ""were constantly introducing new rules to make Britain the tax haven of the world"". She said: ""This was a deliberate change brought in by the government to help global companies do nothing other than avoid paying their fair share of tax."" A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We do not believe these rules are incompatible with EU law but will co-operate with the European Commission's investigation. ""We are clear that all multinationals must pay tax âon any profits they make in the UK, and our rules prevent these profits from being artificially diverted overseas."" In astatement on the Paradise Papers leak, Appleby said,externalit was a law firm which ""advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business. We operate in jurisdictions which are regulated to the highest international standards"". The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with  corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.

On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Prince denied that Charles had spoken out
on the climate-change deals in order to benefit financially. ""The Prince has never chosen to speak out on a topic simply because of a
company that The Duchy may have invested in,"" he said.
 ""In the case of climate change his views are well-known, indeed he has been
warning of the threat of global warming to our environment for over 30 years."" The spokesman added that carbon markets were just one of many strategies

Ryan MorrisonBBC News Online John Shenton, a Jersey tax expert, says the Paradise Papers story could harm the island's reputation. ""There is nothing to suggest anybody has done anything wrong, anybody has done anything illegal or Jersey has done anything wrong,"" he said. ""What you have is a perception - it is hard to change perception - that something isn't right here. ""Reputation matters a lot and it is very difficult if somebody sullies your reputation, it is hard to get it back,"" he added. The Paradise Papers contain 13m documents obtained from law firm Appleby and others. Appleby described it as an ""illegal data breach"" and as a hack. One document revealed Apple registered as a tax resident of Jersey in 2015 after a law change in Ireland. Apple says they didn't transfer any money out of Ireland in 2015. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Westminster party leaders have agreed to introduce a new grievance procedure for staff to deal with misconduct allegations, Theresa May has said. The prime minister said the measures, which will also include face-to-face human resources support, were an ""important step forward"". They were backed by Labour's Jeremy Corbyn following cross-party talks. It comes as several Conservative and Labour MPs are investigated over allegations of sexual misconduct. May calls for 'new culture of respect' Tory rape claims 'ignored by Commons' Growing number of MPs under scrutiny What counts as inappropriate behaviour- The new grievance procedure should be in place next year, said Mrs May, with the new face-to-face support service, an upgrade of an existing complaints hotline, to be introduced by the end of the month. Speaking after the meeting in her parliamentary office, Mrs May said: ""I think if this hasn't happened to you it's difficult to appreciate the impact that being a victim of this sort of behaviour can have, it simply has a lasting impact on people. ""We need to do more to stop these abuses of power and I'm pleased that having convened this meeting of party leaders today we have agreed a way forward,"" she added. Mr Corbyn has called for training for MPs in managing their offices and a new independent body to support staff who suffer mistreatment. In a letter to the prime minister ahead of the meeting, Mr Corbyn said MPs should undergo training after each general election in employment standards. He said a new body should be set up to provide an ""independent route"" to counselling, reporting and representation through complaints procedures, and have powers to recommend reporting of criminal allegations to the police. He said political parties should encourage all staff to join a trade union, as they can provide a ""vital mechanism"" for strengthening effective action and protection from sexual and other harassment and abuse at work. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas, who last week called for MPs to be educated on consent, said any new training programme should come into force immediately, rather than after an election. The SNP Ian Blackford said that although the proposal for a working group came from the prime minister there was ""cross-party consensus"" on the plan. ""This is about a working group that can work on a consensual basis, on a cross-party basis, to make sure we can have standards - first class standards, gold plated standards - that we can be proud of"", he said. But Labour MPs who have led the campaign to crackdown on sexual abuse and harassment said the reforms did not go far enough. Jess Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley, said: ""Find this utterly disappointing. Great a grievance procedure, the victims will be thrilled. What if they don't work in Parliament? ""What about sanctions, what about specialist support from actual professionals who know what they are talking about on sexual violence/harassment."" And Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, added: ""Still much work to do making parliament safe if this only comes into place in a year and only covers MP staff.""

"This video can not be played Emily Hunt said she ""had a lightbulb moment"" that she was drugged A woman seeking what is thought to be the UK's first crowdfunded private rape prosecution says she hopes to lead the way for those ""let down"" by the courts. Emily Hunt from London, claims she was drugged and raped in 2015. Police investigated, but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) felt there was insufficient evidence to proceed with a case. Ms Hunt has hired a barrister who believes there are grounds for a criminal prosecution. Ms Hunt - who has waived her right to anonymity - told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmeon the day of the alleged rape she woke up ""completely naked"" at 22:00 in a hotel room next to a man she had ""never seen"". Her last memory of that day was between 16:00 and 17:00, she said, when she had been having a meal with her father. When she ""finally came to"", she added, she had a ""light-bulb moment"" that she had been drugged. ""I'd never felt like that before. I'd lost five hours of my life and wound up somewhere where I didn't know how I got there."" She said she hid in the bathroom and phoned a friend, who rang the police. With no memory of the encounter Ms Hunt was not aware they had had sex until police informed her they had found used condoms in the hotel room. The man told police they had had sex but insisted it was consensual. Ms Hunt believes it was rape as she would not have been in a state to consent. Police told her the man had also ""filmed her naked and unconscious on the bed"" and carried out a sex act over her body. The police referred her case to the CPS, who upon reviewing CCTV footage and toxicology tests decided there was not enough evidence to proceed. CCTV footage of Ms Hunt and the man showed them kissing and holding hands as they walked to the hotel after leaving a bar. Toxicology tests, taken almost nine hours after her last memory, showed Ms Hunt was at least two times over the drink drive limit, but came back negative for any signs of the date rape drug GHB. Ms Hunt believes the toxicology report was ""flawed"", and that CCTV footage - which she said showed her unable to stand without support - demonstrated how she could not have been in a position to give consent. She estimated the cost of a potential private rape prosecution to be Â£50,000 - a sum she is hoping to crowdfund. ""It is an amazing thing that we as individuals can bring a criminal charge in a case where the system has let us down, that can result in a rapist going to jail,"" she said. The Metropolitan Police said it ""carried out a thorough investigation following [Ms Hunt's] allegations"" and ""will always provide support to anyone who reports a serious sexual offence"". Ms Hunt's complaints over its investigation were ""independently reviewed by the IPCC and not upheld"", it continued. The CPS said ""having looked carefully at all the available evidence, a specialist prosecutor decided there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction in this case"". A further review - conducted at the request of Ms Hunt - ""upheld the original decision"", it added.

"Emile Cilliers told the jury ""someone must have"" tampered with the kit, but denied any involvement An Army sergeant accused of trying to kill his wife by tampering with her parachute told a court she may have been targeted by a stranger. Emile Cilliers, 37, said the idea a ""random killer"" had sabotaged the device was a ""possibility"" as he ""didn't have anything to do with it"". He told jurors: ""I'm not trying to point the finger at anybody, I just want to get to the bottom of this."" Mr Cilliers denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers on 5 April 2015. Ms Cilliers suffered multiple injuries when her hired parachute malfunctioned and the reserve failed as she plummeted 4,000ft to the ground at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire. Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, told Winchester Crown Court the notion of a ""complete stranger"" trying to sabotage a parachute with the ""sudden urge to kill someone"" without knowing their victim was ""ridiculous"". When Mr Cilliers replied it was a ""possibility"", to which Mr Bowes responded: ""It's a possibility a number of asteroids will strike the earth, isn't it?"" The defendant denies tampering with his wife's hire kit in a toilet cubicle at the Army Parachute Association at the airfield camp, allegedly twisting the lines on the main chute and removing parts from the reserve. Army fitness instructor Emile Cilliers denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers in April 2015 Elizabeth Marsh QC, defending, asked the Army fitness instructor about how he came to take the parachute to the toilet with him. ""Why didn't you put it on a rack?"" she said, to which he said he had not paid much attention to the kit as it was ""not something that really bothered me"". The court was told Mr Cilliers accompanied his wife to hospital while she was in a full body brace after the fall, and visited her the next day. The jury earlier heard he had searched the internet for the term ""wet nurses"" - women who breastfeed babies when their mothers are unable. His wife had given birth two months before the fall, the trial heard previously. Asked why he had done so, he could not recall. ""Maybe it was something to do with Princess Charlotte,"" the jury was told. ""It was just a subject of interest. We would often see something on TV and research it."" In response to his defence's questions, he said the jury should not read anything suspicious into the search. The father of six also denies a second attempted murder charge relating to a gas leak at the family home in Amesbury, Wiltshire, and a third charge of damaging a gas valve, recklessly endangering life. He told the court he had investigated the source of the leak with a tool. When asked by Ms Marsh how his blood came to be on a pipe next to the leak, he said: ""I might have cut my hand, I don't remember. ""I can't say exactly how it got there. It could have been from cooking, I could have brushed against it. These are all possibilities."" He denied tampering with the gas valve and rejected the notion he would want to harm his wife or their children. The trial continues.

"More than 130 families left homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire are living in emergency housing, MPs have heard. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said Kensington and Chelsea Council's response in the aftermath of the fire had been ""sluggish and chaotic"". It comes as the Grenfell taskforce produced a report into the fire, which saidthe council ""failed its community"" on 14 June,external. Council leader Elizabeth Campbell said it had ""huge"" amounts of work to do. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Javid said residents had been ""failed by a system that allowed the fire to happen"" and then failed again in the aftermath. He said efforts to rehouse victims had been ""painfully slow"" - with just 26 out of 204 Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk families given permanent accommodation so far. He said 122 households had accepted an offer of temporary or permanent accommodation, and 73 had moved in to new homes. The taskforce said residents were ""hesitating to accept rehousing offers"" because they did not want to lose benefits. Currently, former residents of Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk have their rent, utility bills and council tax suspended for the first 12 months of moving into temporary or permanent accommodation. The council said this created a ""financial cliff edge, which the tenants can avoid by remaining in their emergency accommodation"". Some residents see the rent-free period as wasted on temporary homes, it said. It voted to extend the rent-free period until summer 2019 in a bid to remove ""unintended disincentives"". This video can not be played Marcio and Andreia Gomes tell the story of how they managed to escape the fire The Grenfell taskforce,set up in the aftermath of the fire, has spent nine weeks looking at the recovery process run by the council. ""The report pulls no punches about the fact that there is still significant room for improvement,"" Mr Javid said. It said 320 families altogether - including not only former residents but also those living in Grenfell's vicinity - were still living in hotels. The report, written by housing and local government experts appointed by the government, said the council needed to work more quickly, and cited accounts of ""poor treatment"" towards victims. It said many staff did their best to help but there was a leadership vacuum and a distant council that did not know its residents. The report's authors met survivors, concluding that many victims felt no-one was listening to their concerns. It nevertheless praised Kensington and Chelsea for ""working hard to develop effective support and services to victims and survivors"". Since the fire, many of those at the top of the council have quit, includingleader Nick Paget-Brownandchief executive Nicholas Holgate. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea said it ""entirely"" accepted all the taskforce's recommendations and would offer new homes to ""all those who want to leave"" emergency accommodation by December. Mrs Campbell said the local authority had ""huge amounts of work to do"" and understood the need to change. But the report criticised its lack of urgency, saying: ""As the council tries to do everything at once, it is doing everything too slowly."" It accused council members of lacking a ""firm grasp"" of the true scale of the recovery operation - saying some believed that ""in a few months' time everything shall return to the way it used to be"". It said it was ""disappointing"" that the tower, which is currently a crime scene,had not yet been covered, urging scaffold work to be completed with ""greater haste"". This video can not be played Why did it take so long to get an aerial platform to the tower block? BBC Newsnight investigates It said visible remains of the burnt-out tower ""cast a shadow"" over the entire area. ""Any extended delays will further add to the ongoing trauma that the community is living with,"" the report said. Mr Javid suggested a number of ways the council could improve - including increasing the pace of their work and the need for ""greater empathy and emotional intelligence"" towards victims.

"A best-selling author has recalled 20,000 copies of her new book, which used the term ""mongolism"" to describe Down's syndrome. Celebrity nutritionist Libby Weaver apologised and said she was ""mortified to have caused anyone any distress"". The Australian, who has written several bestselling books, said she had no idea the word was offensive and not correct. The term ""mongolism"" was used until the 1980s. The medical term now used is Down's Syndrome or Trisomy 21. Ms Weaver posted a video message on her website saying that she used the word in her latest book What Am I Supposed to Eat?, thinking it ""was a current medically used word"". ""It has since been brought to my attention it is a word that is used in a derogatory way and I am very, very sorry to have caused anyone any distress through this error, particularly children with Down Syndrome and their families,"" she said. The author, who is based in Australia and New Zealand, added that people who had already bought a copy the book could return it for a refund, local media reported. Teen with Down's syndrome's catwalk debut A world without Down's syndrome? ""The term mongolism is an outdated and offensive term which was used historically to refer to Down syndrome,"" Dr Ellen Skladzien of Down Syndrome Australia told the BBC. ""There has been consensus for many decades that this is not an appropriate term to describe people with Down syndrome,"" she explained. ""I am pleased to see that the book that utilised this inappropriate term has been withdrawn and that the author has apologised."" While most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes, people with Down's have an extra copy of chromosome 21, which means they develop differently and have varying levels of learning disability. Down's was first classified in the 1860s by British physician John Langdon Down, who used the term ""mongoloid"" for it. In recent decades, the term was replaced by Down's syndrome as it was considered derogatory and offensive.

"The firework hit the roof of the house in Haven Baulk Avenue in Littleover A woman has described how she ""lost everything"" when a stray firework set fire to her home and destroyed it. Wendy Bagshaw said the firework sounded like ""an Exocet missile"" hitting the roof. The stress of the fire caused her husband to have an angina attack. Mrs Bagshaw, from Littleover, Derby, said she had already gone through the ""worst year of her life"" and the pair are now temporarily homeless. She expressed frustration at people who recklessly set off fireworks. ""I just can't believe what's happened to my house. It's all gone. I've got nothing,"" she said. ""I've lost everything that I've worked for 40 years for, and it's just so stupid that people don't realise what they're doing. ""If you don't understand what you're doing with fireworks, then don't use them.""

""I can only describe it as an Exocet missile, just came at the house,"" she said. ""It shook the foundations of the house, I felt it shake. My little dogs jumped off my knee and ran outside."" Wendy Bagshaw expressed frustration at people who recklessly set off fireworks She and her husband Ted, who had been in the conservatory with their third dog, went outside to see what had happened. A man driving past shouted to say the roof was on fire, and the couple tried in vain to extinguish it using a hose. The fire damaged the interior of the house, which will be uninhabitable for about six months The fire service put out the fire but the house was severely damaged and many of the couple's possessions were destroyed. The couple are staying at a nearby hotel until they can move into more permanent accommodation. ""The insurance assessors have given us somewhere to stay, but they have told us to find a house as it will be at least six months before ours will be habitable again,"" she said. Mrs Bagshaw lost all her photos of her mother, who died earlier this year. Two aunts and two friends also died this year, she said. Both her husband, who has a heart condition, and her father, who has prostate cancer, are ill. ""It's been the worst year of my life, and now this,"" she said.

"Katanga mine in the DR Congo One of the world's largest firms loaned a businessman previously accused of corruption $45m and asked him to negotiate mining rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo, theParadise Papers,externalreveal. Anglo-Swiss company Glencore made the loan available to Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, a notorious middle man with a close relationship with senior figures in the DR Congo government, in 2009. Mr Gertler was asked to negotiate a new deal for a mining company in which Glencore had a significant stake, which campaigners say cost DR Congo hundreds of millions of dollars. He and Glencore deny any wrongdoing. Glencore agreed to pay Dan Gertler $534m (Â£407m) to buy him out of their shared mining interests in DR Congo in February this year. The new details came to light in the Paradise Papers, a leak of more than 13.4 million documents, many from within Appleby, one of the world's leading offshore law firms. DR Congo has been mired in violence and corruption for decades, leaving more than half of its population living below the poverty line. But the country's vast mineral resources are worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year for those that can access them. This includes Glencore, a huge Anglo-Swiss mining and commodity trading company. By some measures it is the 16th largest company on the planet. For many years Glencore has been involved in mining in DR Congo, in particular the production of copper. The company says it has invested $50bn there. Ten years ago it had an 8.52% stake in a company called Katanga which had the rights to mine copper in the south of the country. In June 2008 Katanga's board, which contained a senior Glencore figure, received some bad news. The DRC government under President Joseph Kabila wanted to renegotiate the terms of its mining licences. Glencore had already invested $150m in Katanga but this could have been wasted if it was unable to mine. The state-owned mining company GÃ©camines wanted $585m (Â£409m) in an ""access premium"" to allow the exploitation of copper and cobalt at the mine. The previous agreement had been for $135m (Â£94.5m). Documents contained within the Paradise Papers show Katanga's board felt the demands of the DRC authorities were ""quite unacceptable"". For the first time, it is possible to see that the directors decided to call for the help of an Israeli businessman called Dan Gertler. ""Dan Gertler, who had a substantial indirect interest in the company, should be given a mandate from the board to negotiate with the DRC authorities,"" Katanga's board minutes from June 2008 show. ""The board... should approach Mr Gertler to see whether he was prepared to act in this way."" Mr Gertler was asked to negotiate an agreement on Katanga's behalf. At around the same time, Glencore agreed to lend a company in the British Virgin Islands called Lora Enterprise $45m (Â£31.5m). Lora Enterprises was controlled by Mr Gertler's family. Glencore then loaned Katanga $265m (Â£185m). This was later converted into shares in the company, allowing Glencore to become its biggest shareholder. The loan to Lora Enterprises allowed Dan Gertler to maintain his stake in the mine. Although Mr Gertler says he did not benefit in any way from the loan. Katanga announced the larger of the loans to the Toronto Stock Exchange in February 2009, but the details around it were sparse until now. The terms of the loan to Mr Gertler's company show that if he failed to deliver a new agreement for the rights within three months, Glencore would have been entitled to demand immediate repayment of the loan. The Paradise Papers documents suggest Mr Gertler was quickly successful. GÃ©camines reduced the access premiums it was asking for from $585m to $140m, which was close to the original agreement, saving Katanga $445m. Pete Jones from anti-corruption campaigners Global Witness said deals similar to the one Glencore was able to strike have had serious consequences for DR Congo. ""For a country that dependent on it natural resource wealth, deals like this which just suck money out of the economy have hugely negative consequences for DR Congo."" Mr Gertler disputes that it was a poor deal for the DRC and says ""GÃ©camines benefitted significantly from the new JVA including Katanga's release of copper and cobalt reserves to GÃ©camines worth $825m."" Glencore told the BBC the $45m loan to Lora Enterprises was made ""on commercial terms and was negotiated at arm's length"". It also said it was repaid in full by 2010. Lawyers for Mr Gertler said it's not unusual for a lender in a mining deal to demand repayment of a loan if a joint venture fails. They went on to say that ""neither Lora Enterprises nor Mr Gertler nor any company or person related to them received the loan funds directly"". Mr Gertler's notoriety in DR Congo goes back almost two decades. In 2001 the UN produced a report that accused him of exchanging weapons and military training in part of a deal to secure a monopoly on diamond mining rights. In 2013, a report by the Africa Progress Panel, led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, suggested Dan Gertler's companies had won mining rights in DR Congo at well below their true value. Lawyers for the Israeli businessman deny the allegations made in the 2001 and 2013 reports. Last year, hedge fund Och-Ziff agreed to pay $412m to settle a case brought by US authorities accusing it of paying bribes in several African countries. Prosecutors described, but did not name, an Israeli businessman who they claimed paid ""together with others, more than $100m in bribes to obtain special access to, and preferential prices for, opportunities in Congo's mining sector"". Dan Gertler denies that he did this. Perhaps most significantly, Mr Gertler was also known to be a close friend of a man called Katumba Mwanke, a key advisor to President Kabila before dying in 2012. Daniel Balint-Kurti from the NGO Global Witness, which has been investigating the relationship between Dan Gertler and Glencore for several years, says the company should have been wary of working with the businessman. ""By hiring someone close to the Congolese president and pumping him with cash and mandating him as their man in negotiations they were running an extremely high risk,"" he said. Dan Gertler's lawyers told the BBC that ""[He] is a respectable businessman who contributes the vast majority of his wealth and time to the needy.""

"This video can not be played Matthew Scully-Hicks made a 999 call two months before Elsie died claiming she fell down stairs A man has been found guilty of murdering his 18-month-old baby just two weeks after formally adopting her. Matthew Scully-Hicks, 31, of Delabole, Cornwall, had denied inflicting catastrophic injuries on Elsie at his Cardiff home four days before she died. He called 999 on 25 May 2016 claiming he had found her unresponsive on the floor but a jury unanimously rejected his claim. A pathologist said her injuries were""very typical""of a shaken baby. Baby Elsie's catalogue of injuries 999 call made four days before Elsie died Killer's 999 call two months before death Scully-Hicks will be sentenced on Tuesday and achild practice review,externalis now expected to take place which will investigate the role of agencies in the case and look at whether lessons can be learned to prevent future tragedies. Pathologist Dr Stephen Leadbetter told the trial Elsie's injuries were consistent with ""shaking impact syndrome"". He said she died after suffering a ""blunt head injury"", which triggered a cardiac arrest and starved her organs of blood. A CT scan showed she hadbleeding on the brainand a post-mortem examination revealed she had also suffered broken ribs, a fractured left femur and a fractured skull. There was alsohaemorrhaging within both of Elsie's retinas- associated with inflicted trauma or injury. In the months before her death, Scully-Hicks had told his husband and a health visitor a bruise on Elsie's face and leg fracture were caused by falls around the house. This video can not be played Scully-Hicks called 999 to say Elsie was not breathing But a doctor who examined Elsie after her death said his account was inconsistent with her injuries. Less than three months before she died Scully-Hicks called 999 and said Elsie hadfallen down the stairsafter a wooden stair gate accidentally opened when she pulled herself up on it. On 25 May, Scully-Hicks was on the phone to the emergency services again. This time he said he had changed Elsie's nappy in the living room, left the room before returning minutes later to find her unresponsive on the floor. He told the court: ""I got closer and called her, there was no response. I got down and gave her a gentle tap and there was no response at all so I picked up the phone and called for an ambulance."" He said he carried out CPR until a police officer arrived and took over and she was rushed to hospital. Elsie died at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff, on 29 May 2016 after doctors determined she could not be saved and her ventilator was switched off. During the trial, the jury was told Scully-Hicks had sent his husband Craig text messages saying he was ""struggling to cope"" and describing Elsie as""Satan in a babygro""and a ""psycho"". Neighbours told the court they heard Scully-Hicks raise his voice andswear at the the baby. The court heard Scully-Hicks who remained emotionless as the jury gave its unanimous verdict, did not suffer from a psychiatric illness or personality disorder. A jury unanimously found Matthew Scully-Hicks guilty of murdering 18-month-old Elsie Prosecutor Paul Lewis QC, said: ""[Scully-Hicks'] actions on the late afternoon of 25 May were the tragic culmination of a course of violent conduct on his part towards a defenceless child - an infant that he should have loved and protected, but whom he instead assaulted, abused, and ultimately murdered."" Following the unanimous verdict, Iwan Jenkins, from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""There were complicating factors in that the only two people who knew what happened in the months leading up to the incident which resulted in her hospitalisation were the defendant and the victim herself."" He said evidence from medical experts had been ""crucial"" to the case, adding the analysis of Elsie's injuries were ""vital to show explanations provided by the defendant were not true and were inconsistent"". He added: ""There are no winners in cases of murder."" A National Adoption Service spokesman said it was a ""tragic and extremely rare case"". Det Ch Insp Stuart Wales, of South Wales Police's major crime investigation team, said Elsie's ""untimely death"" has had a ""devastating effect first and foremost on her family"". ""Elsie's death has also impacted a wider community, including the many professionals involved in her care and the subsequent investigation. I would like to thank all of them, including the many witnesses who assisted the prosecution,"" he said. ""This case represents an extremely rare and distressing set of circumstances. We at South Wales Police continue to respect and value the role that adoption, and those involved, play in our society.""

"This video can not be played Emily Hunt said she ""had a lightbulb moment"" that she was drugged A woman seeking what is thought to be the UK's first crowdfunded private rape prosecution says she hopes to lead the way for those ""let down"" by the courts. Emily Hunt from London, claims she was drugged and raped in 2015. Police investigated, but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) felt there was insufficient evidence to proceed with a case. Ms Hunt has hired a barrister who believes there are grounds for a criminal prosecution. Ms Hunt - who has waived her right to anonymity - told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmeon the day of the alleged rape she woke up ""completely naked"" at 22:00 in a hotel room next to a man she had ""never seen"". Her last memory of that day was between 16:00 and 17:00, she said, when she had been having a meal with her father. When she ""finally came to"", she added, she had a ""light-bulb moment"" that she had been drugged. ""I'd never felt like that before. I'd lost five hours of my life and wound up somewhere where I didn't know how I got there."" She said she hid in the bathroom and phoned a friend, who rang the police. With no memory of the encounter Ms Hunt was not aware they had had sex until police informed her they had found used condoms in the hotel room. The man told police they had had sex but insisted it was consensual. Ms Hunt believes it was rape as she would not have been in a state to consent. Police told her the man had also ""filmed her naked and unconscious on the bed"" and carried out a sex act over her body. The police referred her case to the CPS, who upon reviewing CCTV footage and toxicology tests decided there was not enough evidence to proceed. CCTV footage of Ms Hunt and the man showed them kissing and holding hands as they walked to the hotel after leaving a bar. Toxicology tests, taken almost nine hours after her last memory, showed Ms Hunt was at least two times over the drink drive limit, but came back negative for any signs of the date rape drug GHB. Ms Hunt believes the toxicology report was ""flawed"", and that CCTV footage - which she said showed her unable to stand without support - demonstrated how she could not have been in a position to give consent. She estimated the cost of a potential private rape prosecution to be Â£50,000 - a sum she is hoping to crowdfund. ""It is an amazing thing that we as individuals can bring a criminal charge in a case where the system has let us down, that can result in a rapist going to jail,"" she said. The Metropolitan Police said it ""carried out a thorough investigation following [Ms Hunt's] allegations"" and ""will always provide support to anyone who reports a serious sexual offence"". Ms Hunt's complaints over its investigation were ""independently reviewed by the IPCC and not upheld"", it continued. The CPS said ""having looked carefully at all the available evidence, a specialist prosecutor decided there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction in this case"". A further review - conducted at the request of Ms Hunt - ""upheld the original decision"", it added.

"Emile Cilliers told the jury ""someone must have"" tampered with the kit, but denied any involvement An Army sergeant accused of trying to kill his wife by tampering with her parachute told a court she may have been targeted by a stranger. Emile Cilliers, 37, said the idea a ""random killer"" had sabotaged the device was a ""possibility"" as he ""didn't have anything to do with it"". He told jurors: ""I'm not trying to point the finger at anybody, I just want to get to the bottom of this."" Mr Cilliers denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers on 5 April 2015. Ms Cilliers suffered multiple injuries when her hired parachute malfunctioned and the reserve failed as she plummeted 4,000ft to the ground at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire. Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, told Winchester Crown Court the notion of a ""complete stranger"" trying to sabotage a parachute with the ""sudden urge to kill someone"" without knowing their victim was ""ridiculous"". When Mr Cilliers replied it was a ""possibility"", to which Mr Bowes responded: ""It's a possibility a number of asteroids will strike the earth, isn't it?"" The defendant denies tampering with his wife's hire kit in a toilet cubicle at the Army Parachute Association at the airfield camp, allegedly twisting the lines on the main chute and removing parts from the reserve. Army fitness instructor Emile Cilliers denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers in April 2015 Elizabeth Marsh QC, defending, asked the Army fitness instructor about how he came to take the parachute to the toilet with him. ""Why didn't you put it on a rack?"" she said, to which he said he had not paid much attention to the kit as it was ""not something that really bothered me"". The court was told Mr Cilliers accompanied his wife to hospital while she was in a full body brace after the fall, and visited her the next day. The jury earlier heard he had searched the internet for the term ""wet nurses"" - women who breastfeed babies when their mothers are unable. His wife had given birth two months before the fall, the trial heard previously. Asked why he had done so, he could not recall. ""Maybe it was something to do with Princess Charlotte,"" the jury was told. ""It was just a subject of interest. We would often see something on TV and research it."" In response to his defence's questions, he said the jury should not read anything suspicious into the search. The father of six also denies a second attempted murder charge relating to a gas leak at the family home in Amesbury, Wiltshire, and a third charge of damaging a gas valve, recklessly endangering life. He told the court he had investigated the source of the leak with a tool. When asked by Ms Marsh how his blood came to be on a pipe next to the leak, he said: ""I might have cut my hand, I don't remember. ""I can't say exactly how it got there. It could have been from cooking, I could have brushed against it. These are all possibilities."" He denied tampering with the gas valve and rejected the notion he would want to harm his wife or their children. The trial continues.

"A virtual shower of money accompanies successful payments Facebook has chosen the UK as the first country outside the US to get its Messenger payments service. Later on Monday, local users will be able to send each other money in a message. The service was launched in the US in 2015. The social network says it has been widely used to split restaurant bills, pay babysitters and simply send gifts. It says most users send less than $50 (Â£38). The company says the service is coming to the UK because it has so many ""mobile-savvy consumers"". Facebook is collaborating with all the major banks and credit card firms to launch Messenger payments, which will require both the sender and recipient of money to register their payment cards. But three years ago, UK banks launched their own instant payments service - Paym - which has not made a huge impact on the way we pay. So, why should this be any different? Facebook claims Messenger payments will catch on because ""people are looking for simplicity and emotion"". I'm not sure about the emotion, but the Messenger app is certainly a very simple way to send money, especially compared with Paym where you have to log in to your own bank's app. Smartphones have helped to enable quick and easy contactless payments David Marcus, who runs Messenger, says it is obvious from our messages that we need this. ""More and more people are having conversations on Messenger about paying one another,"" he explains. ""As a result it's a very natural place for you to have the most frictionless and secure way of paying each other."" Facebook is also introducing something called M suggestions, a virtual assistant that recognises when you are talking about payments. It will suggest the new service as a quick and easy solution. We'll see how users enjoy being nudged in this manner. But with millions of Messenger users, who will not need to download a separate app to use the service, Facebook is well placed to become major player in the UK payments scene. That begs the question, how did UK banks let this happen? A spokesman for Paym insisted it was growing, with four million people having registered their mobile phone numbers to use the service. But with just Â£400m of payments in three and a half years, it is still a minnow. What's easier? Cash, or a digital payment? In Sweden, by contrast, Swish - a peer-to-peer payments service in a single app - has taken the country by storm with the majority of adults now ""swishing"" money to each other and small businesses. The UK payments industry decided against a Paym app, believing customers would be more likely to trust their own bank's online operation. But it looks as though the lesson from Sweden - and from Facebook - is that simplicity is vital to building the network effect needed to make a new service take off. But perhaps we should be cautious before allowing Facebook into yet another part of our lives. While the Messenger service is free to use, the business model behind it is all about ""engagement"" - keeping users on the platform for longer so that they can be served more advertising. At a time when there is growing alarm over the extraordinary power the social media giant has to mould the way we see the world, letting it peer into our wallets as well may be a step too far for some.

"Pastor Frank Pomeroy and his wife Sherri who have lost a daughter Half of the 26 victims of the worst mass shooting in Texas history are children, officials say, as a portrait of a small town Texas church emerges. A pregnant woman's unborn baby was named as the shooting's youngest victim. Another child killed was just one year old. The oldest victim of the attack was a 77-year-old woman. Twenty more were wounded, 10 were in a critical condition. Authorities fear the death toll could rise. Local law enforcement have not released the victim's identities, but the names of some of those gunned down are emerging. According to US media, the gunman's ex-wife's grandmother was among the dead. This video can not be played 'Belle died with her church family,' her mother said The first victim to be named was the 14-year-old daughter of First Baptist Church of Sutherland Spring's pastor, Frank Pomeroy. Pastor Pomeroy, who was away in Oklahoma at the time, told ABC News she was ""one very beautiful, special child"". ""We lost more than Belle yesterday, and one thing that gives me a sliver of encouragement is the fact that Belle was surrounded yesterday by her church family that she loved fiercely,"" her mother Sherri said on Monday. Bryan and Karla Holcombe Eight members of the Holcombe family were among the dead. Bryan Holcombe was serving as the guest pastor in Pastor Pomeroy's absence. An associate pastor at the church who also conducted prison ministry, he was about to lead the congregation in worship when he was shot dead, his parents Joe and Claryce told the Washington Post. Bryan's wife of 25 years, Karla, died too. Their son Marc Daniel Holcombe, 36, died alongside his one-year-old daughter Noah. Another son of Bryan and Karla, John, survived but his eight-month pregnant wife, Crystal Holcombe, was killed. They were expecting their first child together. The unborn child has been included in the death count. The gunman killed three of Crystal's five children by a previous marriage - Emily, Megan and Greg. The two others are said to be in the hospital with their stepfather,according to CNN,external. ""She doesn't even drink, smoke or nothing,"" her brother Nick Uhlig told the Houston Chronicle. ""She just takes care of kids; she raises goats and makes homemade cheese... They don't go out dancing or anything like that. They're real old-fashioned, down-to-earth."" The Holcombe's close family friend was killed with her two children, who were wounded. She reportedly lived with Bryan and Karla and called them Mom and Dad, according to local reports. ""This is a huge loss. Tara was very kind-hearted person, great employee,"" wrote Kevin Koenen, the owner of the Aumont Saloon where Ms McNulty worked. A 13-year-old girl was shot dead, theSan Antonio Express-News,externalreports. Amanda Mosel, 34, said the victim was her goddaughter. Family members confirmed that Lula White, the gunman's ex-wife's grandmother, was also among the dead. White frequently volunteered at the church, according to her Facebook page. Brooke Ward, five, and Emily Garza, seven, were killed, along with their mother Joann Ward. Her son Ryland, also aged five, was seriously injured - but is expected to survive. Nine-year-old Rihanna - the oldest daughter - survived. Ms Ward's friend, Vonda Greek Smith, paid tribute to the mother-of-four on Facebook, saying that she died ""shielding"" her children. ""Little Rihanna (9) was there at the shooting but mommy pushed her down when she saw the shooter open fire, so in her words, 'I didn't get shot because I was hiding, and momma covered Emily, Ryland & Brooke.'"" Haley Krueger, 16 Haley Krueger, 16, was also killed, her mother Charlene Marie Uhl told US media. ""She was a vibrant 16-year-old that loved life,"" Mrs Uhl said, adding that she had hopes to become a nurse. ""She loved babies and always wanted to help."" Haley had arrived at church early on Sunday to prepare breakfast, her mother told People magazine. Richard Rodriguez and his wife of 11 years, Therese Rodriguez, were killed. Richard's daughter told US media that her father and stepmother were active in the church community. She said they often took their grandchildren to church, but did not on the day of the shooting. Robert was a retired high-ranking member of the US air force and had served for 30 years. Their two children are also reportedly on active service. ""This is a huge tragedy, not only for the family, for this small town,"" said Renee Haley, director of Veterans Services for Clare County, Michigan.

"Bono, also known as Paul David Hewson, co-founded U2 in 1976 A Lithuanian shopping mall partly owned by U2's Bono is under investigation for potential tax avoidance, following a probe prompted by theParadise Papers,external. The mall allegedly avoided paying 47,000 euros (Â£41,500) in local taxes using an unlawful accounting technique. The company running the mall, in the city of Utena, denies any wrongdoing. The leaked documents show that Bono owned a stake in a Maltese holding company that bought the mall, via a Lithuanian holding company, in 2007. In a statement, the Irish entertainer and anti-poverty campaigner, also known as Paul David Hewson, said he had been ""assured by those running the company that it is fully tax compliant"". He emphasised that he had previously campaigned for more transparency surrounding the ownership of offshore companies, and was in favour of public registries. Earlier, a spokeswoman told reporters at theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externalthat Bono was a ""passive, minority investor"" in the Maltese entity, which was ""voluntarily wound up in 2015"". Live updates of the Paradise Papers leak Mrs Brown's Boys stars 'put Â£2m offshore' All you need to know about the leak Queen's private estate invested offshore In recent years, Bono, one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, has received international recognition for his social justice activism and philanthropy, even receiving an honorary knighthood from the Queen in 2007. In the wake of the Panama Papers leak, the ONE Campaign, a charitable organisation fronted by Bono, repeatedly called for more transparency on the ownership of ""shell companies"" and offshore trusts, and decried the effect of lost tax revenues on developing economies. The mall in Utena at the centre of a tax probe Utena, which has a population of roughly 27,000, is a growing city in north-east Lithuania which has recently attracted tens of millions of dollars in foreign investment, mostly in the manufacturing sector. The 3,700-square-metre Ausra mall, which currently contains 20 food and clothing shops, was built by Eika, one of Lithuania's leading developers, and opened its doors in 2006. In April 2007, Eika announced it had sold the mall to an unnamed ""foreign investor"". The buyer was a Lithuanian company named UAB Nude Estates 2. Records uncovered by the Lithuanian journalist Sarunas Cerniauskas, theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externaland the Guardian show that the company was ultimately part-owned by Bono, via a series of companies in foreign jurisdictions. U2 toured this year to mark the 30th anniversary of their Joshua Tree album Between 2007 and 2012, the Lithuanian firm UAB Nude Estates 2 was owned by a similarly named Maltese company, Nude Estates Malta Ltd. Leaked registry documents reveal that the Maltese company was partly owned by Bono, along with two other businessmen. In 2012 ownership of the Lithuanian company was transferred to another offshore company, named Nude Estates I Ltd, this time in the British Crown dependency of Guernsey. In a written response to questions from the ICIJ, a spokeswoman for Bono, Kathy McKiernan, said the U2 frontman is currently ""a passive, minority investor"" in the Guernsey company, Nude Estates I, and had held a minority stake in Nude Estates Malta, which has since been wound down. ""Malta is a well established holding company jurisdiction within the EU,""  Ms McKiernan added. The Lithuanian company that runs Ausra mall, Nude Estates 2, declared a loss of more than 3 million euros (Â£2.6m) in 2010. According to analysis by tax expert Ruta Bilkstyte, the loss was achieved by a write-down of the company's fixed assets, the largest of which was the mall building itself. The company carried that loss forward until 2016, paying no tax despite posting profits for five of those six years. In a statement sent to news site 15min.lt, the Lithuanian tax office confirmed that Nude Estates 2 had not paid tax on its profits since at least 2011. Ms Bilkstyte, who was not told of Bono's connection to Nude Estates 2, estimated that the company likely avoided paying 47,000 euros in tax to date, and was set to avoid almost 400,000 euros (Â£353,000) more. Lithuanian tax expert Ruta Bilkstyte This, in her view, amounted to a deliberate and ""crude violation"" of the tax code. After 15min.lt reporters brought Nude Estates 2's filings to the attention of the Lithuanian State Tax Inspectorate, the agency said it was launching an investigation into the company. A spokeswoman for the Inspectorate told the BBC it had ""commenced control procedures"", and that such an action was usually undertaken on the ""evaluation of risk of tax breaches"". ""Taxpayers having offshore transactions more often score higher points of risk,"" she added. Sigitas Jautakis, the Lithuanian director of Nude Estates 2, said he was unaware of Bono's connection to the mall and denied his company had engaged in illegal activity. He added that if found to have underpaid tax, the company would make up the shortfall - but cautioned that the authorities ""hadn't carried out any inspections or anything"". ""But they should, first of all, delve deeply into the entire situation,"" he said. Find out more about thewords and phrasesfound in theParadise Papers.

"This video can not be played 'Queen should apologise,' suggests Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn has suggested the Queen, among others, should apologise for using overseas tax havens if they were used to avoid taxation in the UK. The Labour leader was asked at the CBI conference whether the Queen should say sorry for making overseas investments. He said anyone putting money into tax havens for the purposes of avoidance should ""not just apologise for it, recognise what it does to our society"". The BBC has revealed that the Queen's estate has used overseas tax havens. Paradise Papers: All you need to know Latest reaction to the Paradise Papers leak It comes after a leak of confidential papers from Bermuda revealed the secret offshore investments of the rich and famous, including the Queen. Mr Corbyn's spokesman later clarified his comments, saying the Labour leader did not specifically call on the Queen to apologise but thought ""anyone who puts money into a tax haven to avoid paying tax should acknowledge the damage it does to society"". This video can not be played The Queen's private estate invested Â£10m in offshore funds Mr Corbyn called for a full inquiry, public lists of company ownership, and a new tax enforcement unit to tackle tax evasion. On Sunday,BBC Panorama broadcastthe first results of its year-long investigation into theParadise Papers,external, a massive leak of financial documents from Bermuda-based law firm Appleby. The leaks raised questions overtech firm Apple's tax structures, the investments ofConservative Party donor Lord Ashcroft,Everton FC owner Farhad Moshiri,Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton, and offshore investments made on theQueen's behalf by the Duchy of Lancaster. Buckingham Palace has not commented on the revelation that the Duchy of Lancaster, which handles the Queen's private wealth, used offshore investments. A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster said: ""We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate. ""The Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income she receives from the Duchy."" HMRC chief executive Jon Thompson vowed to ""chase down"" anyone trying to hide money offshore and evade tax. He told the Commons Public Accounts Committee that HMRC had asked to see the leaked Paradise Papers in order to ""look at every case of tax evasion very seriously"". Mr Thompson said there were 66 ongoing criminal investigations into thePanama Papers, which in April 2016 exposed tax avoidance and evasion, saying Â£100m could be retrieved. ""That gives you some sense about how long quite complicated tax cases take to bring to some sort of fruition,"" he added. This video can not be played Theresa May: 'UK already acting' on offshore tax havens Theresa May insisted efforts were already under way to obtain revenue from offshore tax vehicles, adding: ""We want people to pay the tax that is due"". At the CBI conference, the prime minister said HMRC had collected Â£160bn by tackling tax avoidance, evasion and non-compliance since 2010. Mrs May's spokesperson said: ""It is important to point out that holding investments offshore is not an automatic sign of wrongdoing, but HMRC has requested to see the papers urgently so it can look into any allegations."" But when asked, Mrs May did not commit to a public inquiry into tax revenue lost through offshore tax avoidance schemes. Among the Paradise Papers documents was evidence that Tory donorLord Ashcroftremained a non-dom and continued to avoid tax despite attempts to make peers pay their full share. Lord Ashcroft has insisted he did not ignore rules in relation to the Punta Gorda offshore trust and said  his tax residency was ""publicly available information"". The leaked documents show that between 2000 and 2010, Lord Ashcroft received payments of around $200m (Â£150m) from his offshore trust in Bermuda. Responding,externalto the programme, Lord Ashcroft wrote: ""At no point has it been suggested directly to me, or through others, that I have taken any inappropriate action."" He also explained why he ran away from a Panorama reporter who approached him for comment, taking refuge in a toilet, saying he was ""determined"" not to ""fall victim to their ambush"". This video can not be played Watch Lord Ashcroft try to avoid Richard Biltonâs questions about his offshore trust The Paradise Papers puts into question the practice of using highly secretive offshore tax havens, which is legal. Bermuda's premier David Burt said the territory has a ""robust regulatory regime"" with the same tax system in place since 1898. He added the UK's tax law allows the use of offshore tax havens. Former Business Secretary, Sir Vince Cable, criticised the government for not clamping down on offshore tax havens trading under the British flag. He said: ""The Paradise Papers suggest that a small number of wealthy individuals have been able, entirely legally, to put their money beyond the reach of the Exchequer.""

"Emile Cilliers told the jury ""someone must have"" tampered with the kit, but denied any involvement An Army sergeant accused of trying to kill his wife by tampering with her parachute told a court she may have been targeted by a stranger. Emile Cilliers, 37, said the idea a ""random killer"" had sabotaged the device was a ""possibility"" as he ""didn't have anything to do with it"". He told jurors: ""I'm not trying to point the finger at anybody, I just want to get to the bottom of this."" Mr Cilliers denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers on 5 April 2015. Ms Cilliers suffered multiple injuries when her hired parachute malfunctioned and the reserve failed as she plummeted 4,000ft to the ground at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire. Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, told Winchester Crown Court the notion of a ""complete stranger"" trying to sabotage a parachute with the ""sudden urge to kill someone"" without knowing their victim was ""ridiculous"". When Mr Cilliers replied it was a ""possibility"", to which Mr Bowes responded: ""It's a possibility a number of asteroids will strike the earth, isn't it?"" The defendant denies tampering with his wife's hire kit in a toilet cubicle at the Army Parachute Association at the airfield camp, allegedly twisting the lines on the main chute and removing parts from the reserve. Army fitness instructor Emile Cilliers denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers in April 2015 Elizabeth Marsh QC, defending, asked the Army fitness instructor about how he came to take the parachute to the toilet with him. ""Why didn't you put it on a rack?"" she said, to which he said he had not paid much attention to the kit as it was ""not something that really bothered me"". The court was told Mr Cilliers accompanied his wife to hospital while she was in a full body brace after the fall, and visited her the next day. The jury earlier heard he had searched the internet for the term ""wet nurses"" - women who breastfeed babies when their mothers are unable. His wife had given birth two months before the fall, the trial heard previously. Asked why he had done so, he could not recall. ""Maybe it was something to do with Princess Charlotte,"" the jury was told. ""It was just a subject of interest. We would often see something on TV and research it."" In response to his defence's questions, he said the jury should not read anything suspicious into the search. The father of six also denies a second attempted murder charge relating to a gas leak at the family home in Amesbury, Wiltshire, and a third charge of damaging a gas valve, recklessly endangering life. He told the court he had investigated the source of the leak with a tool. When asked by Ms Marsh how his blood came to be on a pipe next to the leak, he said: ""I might have cut my hand, I don't remember. ""I can't say exactly how it got there. It could have been from cooking, I could have brushed against it. These are all possibilities."" He denied tampering with the gas valve and rejected the notion he would want to harm his wife or their children. The trial continues.

"Westminster party leaders have agreed to introduce a new grievance procedure for staff to deal with misconduct allegations, Theresa May has said. The prime minister said the measures, which will also include face-to-face human resources support, were an ""important step forward"". They were backed by Labour's Jeremy Corbyn following cross-party talks. It comes as several Conservative and Labour MPs are investigated over allegations of sexual misconduct. May calls for 'new culture of respect' Tory rape claims 'ignored by Commons' Growing number of MPs under scrutiny What counts as inappropriate behaviour- The new grievance procedure should be in place next year, said Mrs May, with the new face-to-face support service, an upgrade of an existing complaints hotline, to be introduced by the end of the month. Speaking after the meeting in her parliamentary office, Mrs May said: ""I think if this hasn't happened to you it's difficult to appreciate the impact that being a victim of this sort of behaviour can have, it simply has a lasting impact on people. ""We need to do more to stop these abuses of power and I'm pleased that having convened this meeting of party leaders today we have agreed a way forward,"" she added. Mr Corbyn has called for training for MPs in managing their offices and a new independent body to support staff who suffer mistreatment. In a letter to the prime minister ahead of the meeting, Mr Corbyn said MPs should undergo training after each general election in employment standards. He said a new body should be set up to provide an ""independent route"" to counselling, reporting and representation through complaints procedures, and have powers to recommend reporting of criminal allegations to the police. He said political parties should encourage all staff to join a trade union, as they can provide a ""vital mechanism"" for strengthening effective action and protection from sexual and other harassment and abuse at work. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas, who last week called for MPs to be educated on consent, said any new training programme should come into force immediately, rather than after an election. The SNP Ian Blackford said that although the proposal for a working group came from the prime minister there was ""cross-party consensus"" on the plan. ""This is about a working group that can work on a consensual basis, on a cross-party basis, to make sure we can have standards - first class standards, gold plated standards - that we can be proud of"", he said. But Labour MPs who have led the campaign to crackdown on sexual abuse and harassment said the reforms did not go far enough. Jess Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley, said: ""Find this utterly disappointing. Great a grievance procedure, the victims will be thrilled. What if they don't work in Parliament? ""What about sanctions, what about specialist support from actual professionals who know what they are talking about on sexual violence/harassment."" And Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, added: ""Still much work to do making parliament safe if this only comes into place in a year and only covers MP staff.""

"Ian Squire was kidnapped in southern Nigeria in October A British aid worker kidnapped last month in southern Nigeria has been killed, while three other hostages have been freed, says the Foreign Office. Ian Squire, an optician, was one of four Britons working for a medical charity in the Niger Delta when taken. Suspected militants stormed the rural communityof Enekorogha on 13 October. UK and Nigerian authorities successfully negotiated the release of Alanna Carson, David Donovan and Shirley Donovan. BBC Lagos correspondent Stephanie Hegarty said there was little detail around Mr Squire's death, but that locals told her the kidnappers were a criminal gang who had been operating in the area for around a year. Our correspondent said: ""This is their first kidnapping of foreigners. They had kidnapped very recently the mother of a local politician, but before that they were just carrying out petty crime. ""We know that a ransom was demanded but we don't know if it was paid."" According to reports, Dr and Mrs Donovan have lived in Nigeria for the past 14 years, running a Christian charity called New Foundations, which gives aid to remote villages in the Niger Delta. Dr and Mrs Donovan (pictured) were released and are now home safely Mr Squire normally ran a practice in Shepperton, Surrey, and locals told the BBC he travelled to Africa every year to carry out charity work. Mr Squire's friend Paul Allan, who ran a neighbouring business, described him as a ""good friend"" and a ""very straight forward, nice, gentle guy"". He described how Mr Squire fundraised in the community for his trips and even collected old glasses to take and reuse. ""I just can't believe what's happened,"" added Mr Allan. ""I find it shocking to believe for someone who has gone out to do good in the community overseas that the action has cost him dearly. It has cost him his life. It is beyond belief. ""It is a sign of this day and age, but he wasn't concerned about that. He just wanted to go out and help people in less fortunate situations than ours."" Ms Carson, a Specsavers optometrist, is now staying with her family in Northern Ireland, according to her employer in Leven, Fife. Relatives of the four said they were ""delighted and relieved"" that Ms Carson and Dr and Mrs Donovan had returned safely. ""Our thoughts are now with the family and friends of Ian as we come to terms with his sad death,"" they said in a statement issued on their behalf. Ms Carson (pictured) was working alongside Mr Squire The Foreign Office currentlyadvises against all but essential travel to much of Delta state,external, saying there is a ""high threat of criminal kidnap"".

"This video can not be played Emily Hunt said she ""had a lightbulb moment"" that she was drugged A woman seeking what is thought to be the UK's first crowdfunded private rape prosecution says she hopes to lead the way for those ""let down"" by the courts. Emily Hunt from London, claims she was drugged and raped in 2015. Police investigated, but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) felt there was insufficient evidence to proceed with a case. Ms Hunt has hired a barrister who believes there are grounds for a criminal prosecution. Ms Hunt - who has waived her right to anonymity - told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmeon the day of the alleged rape she woke up ""completely naked"" at 22:00 in a hotel room next to a man she had ""never seen"". Her last memory of that day was between 16:00 and 17:00, she said, when she had been having a meal with her father. When she ""finally came to"", she added, she had a ""light-bulb moment"" that she had been drugged. ""I'd never felt like that before. I'd lost five hours of my life and wound up somewhere where I didn't know how I got there."" She said she hid in the bathroom and phoned a friend, who rang the police. With no memory of the encounter Ms Hunt was not aware they had had sex until police informed her they had found used condoms in the hotel room. The man told police they had had sex but insisted it was consensual. Ms Hunt believes it was rape as she would not have been in a state to consent. Police told her the man had also ""filmed her naked and unconscious on the bed"" and carried out a sex act over her body. The police referred her case to the CPS, who upon reviewing CCTV footage and toxicology tests decided there was not enough evidence to proceed. CCTV footage of Ms Hunt and the man showed them kissing and holding hands as they walked to the hotel after leaving a bar. Toxicology tests, taken almost nine hours after her last memory, showed Ms Hunt was at least two times over the drink drive limit, but came back negative for any signs of the date rape drug GHB. Ms Hunt believes the toxicology report was ""flawed"", and that CCTV footage - which she said showed her unable to stand without support - demonstrated how she could not have been in a position to give consent. She estimated the cost of a potential private rape prosecution to be Â£50,000 - a sum she is hoping to crowdfund. ""It is an amazing thing that we as individuals can bring a criminal charge in a case where the system has let us down, that can result in a rapist going to jail,"" she said. The Metropolitan Police said it ""carried out a thorough investigation following [Ms Hunt's] allegations"" and ""will always provide support to anyone who reports a serious sexual offence"". Ms Hunt's complaints over its investigation were ""independently reviewed by the IPCC and not upheld"", it continued. The CPS said ""having looked carefully at all the available evidence, a specialist prosecutor decided there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction in this case"". A further review - conducted at the request of Ms Hunt - ""upheld the original decision"", it added.

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran A charity fears a British-Iranian woman held in Iran could have her prison sentence doubled following remarks made by the foreign secretary. Boris Johnson told a Commons committee that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was arrested at Tehran Airport in 2016, was ""teaching people journalism"". The Thomson Reuters Foundation said she was seeing family and urged Mr Johnson to correct his ""serious mistake"". The Foreign Office said the remarks could not justify new charges. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is currently serving a five-year sentence after Iran tried her on charges of trying to overthrow the government. She denies all the allegations against her. Shelost her final appeal in April 2017but has since faced two more charges relating to an accusation of plotting to topple the regime in Tehran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has worked for the Thomson Reuters Foundation and BBC Media Action (the corporation's international development charity), but insisted the 2016 visit was for her daughter to meet her grandparents. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson appeared before MPs last Wednesday Mr Johnson was appearing before MPs on the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 1 November, and criticised Iran over the case before saying: ""When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism as I understand it. ""[Neither] Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her family has been informed about what crime she has actually committed. And that I find extraordinary, incredible."" Husband's plea for Briton held in Iran 'She was punished without crime' Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned to court where the foreign secretary's comments were cited as evidence against her. At this hearing she was accused of engaging in ""propaganda against the regime"". The Iranian judiciary's High Council for Human Rights said Mr Johnson's comments ""shed new light"" on the charity worker and proved Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe ""had visited the country for anything but a holiday"". Monique Villa, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation,called on Mr Johnson,externalto ""immediately correct the serious mistake he made"". Thomson Reuters Foundation says the comments ""can only worsen her sentence"" Ms Villa said there was a ""direct correlation"" between Mr Johnson's comments and the unscheduled court appearance. ""This accusation from Judge Salavati can only worsen her sentence. She is obviously a bargaining chip between the UK government and Iran and this injustice must stop as soon as possible. ""Whatever is at stake should be paid attention to by the UK government."" Labour's Tulip Siddiq, the MP for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's constituency, said she is ""furious"" with Mr Johnson and called on him to ""urgently retract"" his remarks. A Foreign Office spokesman said the remarks ""provide no justifiable basis"" to bring further charges against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. ""While criticising the Iranian case against Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Foreign Secretary sought to explain that even the most extreme set of unproven Iranian allegations against her were insufficient reason for her detention and treatment. ""The UK will continue to do all it can to secure her release on humanitarian grounds and the foreign secretary will be calling the Iranian foreign minister to raise again his serious concerns about the case and ensure his remarks are not misrepresented.""

"Despite losing her job, the 50-year-old says she does not regret ""flipping off"" the motorcade A woman pictured raising her middle finger toward US President Donald Trump's motorcade has reportedly been fired from her job over the photograph. The image went viral after it was taken on 28 October in Virginia, close to a Trump golf resort. Juli Briskman, who was identified as the cyclist in the image, alleges she was fired by employers Akima LLC after she posted it to her online profiles. The company did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Ms Briskman told US media the firm had called her into a meeting a day after she informed their HR department she was the subject of the widely circulated image. She told the Huffington Post news website that executives had told her they classified the image as ""lewd"" or ""obscene"",external, and therefore deemed that it violated their social media policies after she had posted it to her Twitter and Facebook accounts. However Ms Briskman said she had emphasised to management that she had not been in working hours when the photograph was taken and had not mentioned her employers on the social media pages. A year later: Liberals still haunted by Trump win Twitter employee 'deactivated' Trump account on last day Ms Briskman also alleges that a male colleague was allowed to keep his job after deleting a post deemed as offensive in a separate incident. She therefore questions why she was immediately dismissed from her role. The 50-year-old mother-of-two had reportedly been at the government contractor firm for six months working in communications. Motorcade protests are not uncommon: this was taken by press photographer Brendan Smialowski on the same day Despite losing her job, Ms Briskman said she did not regret making the gesture. 'I lost my job over a Facebook post' ""In some ways, I'm doing better than ever,""she told The Huffington Post,external ""I'm angry about where our country is right now. I am appalled. This was an opportunity for me to say something."" The press photographer,Brendan Smialowski, told the AFP website that it was common to see people protesting or making obscene gestures at presidents,externalas they drove by. He said that he had been struck by the ""tenacity"" of Ms Briskman after she made the gesture several times and made attempts to catch up with the motorcade.

"The law change was passed by the Isle of Man's Parliament in Douglas in May 2005 The Isle of Man passed a law that would help tax evaders, documents in the Paradise Papers show. Lawyers promoting a scheme allowing Swiss bank clients to hide their cash offered to help the authorities amend rules in November 2004. The law was changed seven months later, amid an EU clampdown on tax dodging. BBC Panorama has spoken to the man behind the scheme who claims an Isle of Man regulator was aware the new law would help tax evaders. Mark Morris, a tax adviser and leading expert on tax loopholes, told the programme regulators in offshore territories used to regularly help financial institutions in this way. ""I think in those times, it was wrong, and there were regulators helping financial institutions,"" he said. ""But today, this would never be allowed."" Mr Morris devised the scheme to help wealthy clients avoid the European Union Savings Directive (EUSD). TheEUSD was introduced in 2005,externalto stop people from within one part of Europe putting assets in an account in another country without declaring it. Most of the people targeted by EUSD were therefore already evading tax. This video can not be played Swiss-based adviser Mark Morris on how Isle of Man âtax dodge lawâ came about The idea was that EU-based banks and those in other nations including Switzerland would make automatic deductions for tax from interest payments. Mr Morris's scheme was designed to be exempt from the reach of the EUSD. It involved Swiss bank deposits being moved into a redeemable insurance product sold by a new Isle of Man company, Minerva Assurance Ltd. The draft of an agreement with an unnamed bank says of the proposals: ""Policy applications and surrenders are transacted expeditiously.... Confidentiality is maintained, as the individual client is not directly involved."" A slide presentation illustrated how EUSD would be avoided at each stage of the investment The leaked documents outline events in late 2004 when lawyers acting for Mr Morris held talks with the IoM insurance and pensions regulator, David Vick. After it became clear that the new insurance company would not be authorised to operate under existing laws, they appear to have offered to help Mr Vick draft new regulations. A letter they wrote to Mr Vick in November 2004 after their discussions asks him to get in touch ""if you believe it would be helpful for us to provide you with ideas as to how to improve the regulations to more readily accord with our client's proposal"". Mr Vick then emailed them in March 2005 to say a consultation was to take place about proposed changes to the 1986 Insurance Act. He tells the lawyers he would ""be particularly interested in any comments that youâ¦ have in this regard"". On 17 May 2005, amendments were approved by the IoM parliament, known as the Tynwald, and they took effect on 1 June 2005 - exactly a month before the EUSD began. Mr Vick retired from the IoM's Insurance and Pension Authority in 2015. Approached about the events, he declined to answer any questions and referred the BBC to the Isle of Man authorities. This video can not be played David Vick refuses to comment on his role in law change that would have helped tax dodgers The Isle of Man's Chief Minister, Howard Quayle, says the island is a ""responsible jurisdiction"" and complies with international regulations on tax transparency. He said the events surrounding the insurance scheme would be investigated but he did not believe the regulator at the time would have knowingly helped to create a law to facilitate tax evasion. Mr Quayle told Panorama: ""If it had happened I would be incredibly disappointed. Give me the opportunity to look at the evidence first and then we'll take action if it is proven."" 'Many loopholes' Mark Morris said he had acted within the law and described the financial structure he devised as one of ""many loopholes"" available at the time. He said that ""nine times out of 10"" the investors would have been intending to evade tax. In the end, the tax dodge was never used because Mark Morris was unable to recruit enough clients. He said: ""Nobody utilised this plan because there were so many other solutions."" Mr Morris later gave evidence to the German parliament on EUSD and helped the European Commission with reform of the rules.

"This video can not be played Watch Lord Ashcroft try to avoid Richard Biltonâs questions about his offshore trust Lord Ashcroft has denied allegations that he ignored rules around the management of his offshore investments. According to leaked documents, the Tory donor gave assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the Punta Gorda Trust in Bermuda in 2000. The leaked Paradise Papers provoked questions as to whether he sometimes made decisions without consulting trust officials. Such action could see the trust challenged by HMRC. The peer denied controlling the trust. In a statement,external, he said that he has never known the identity of any of the trustees or had any dealings with them. ""At no point has it been suggested directly to me, or through others, that I have taken any inappropriate action. ""No professional trustee has ever resigned because of anything I may have done,"" he added. Panorama approached Lord Ashcroft during last month's Conservative Party conference in Manchester but he declined to answer any questions about the trust. He has described two previous Panorama investigations into his affairs as ""unashamedly one-sided"" and said he had informed BBC director general Tony Hall that he is ""simply not prepared to deal with"" the programme. The 71-year-old former Conservative deputy chairman has given millions of pounds to the party. He fell out with David Cameron in 2010 and later co-authored a controversial unauthorised biography of the then-prime minister but remains involved in UK politics through his polling and publishing interests. Journalist Peter Oborne said Lord Ashcroft has been a ""hugely significant figure"" in the Conservative Party over the last 20 years. He said: ""Lord Ashcroft has been one of the most significant donors to the... party. But it's not just... that he's been a giver of money, he's also been very important organisationally. He's involved himself in the internal politics."" Other documents in the Paradise Papersshow Lord Ashcroft has secretly remained non-domiciledin the UK for tax purposes. Addressing this allegation, he said in his statement: ""My position was made public in a statement which I made in March 2010 and to which a link is provided here. ""Following the change in the law later that year, a change which my statement anticipated, for each of the remaining five years during which I sat in the House of Lords, I was deemed tax resident and domiciled. ""This is all publicly available information and nothing was produced yesterday by the BBC which suggests different."" The structure of a trust involves one entity legally entrusting a second to look after assets for a third, essentially removing ownership for tax purposes. Wealthy people can legally avoid paying tax on assets that they have given to a trust because they can tell the authorities they no longer own or control the assets in them. But for a trust to work as a tax break, decisions about its assets have to be taken independently by the trustees. Despite the warning, Lord Ashcroft appears to have continued to make decisions about the trust's assets. In October 2000, one of the trustees said: ""I would like to emphasize at this point that it is imperative at all times that the trustees are aware of any and all transactions to be entered into prior to transactions occurring. ""To do otherwise, will only serve to undermine the integrity of the trust as the trustees are being advised of actions taken in connection with trust assets, which should be under their control, after the event."" A review of the trust in 2009, discovered that significant payments out had been made that had not been properly recorded. In an internal email, a lawyer representing the trust says: ""There have been very large sums of money involved and I am very concerned that there has been inadequate supervision of both transactions and distributions... to put it bluntly we seem to be told nothing whereas we carry the responsibility of acting as trustee."" Paperwork then appears to have been put in place retrospectively ""to ensure that we have all the relevant trustee and company authorities in place for the transactions which have occured [sic]"". Trust experts say anybody who puts their money into a trust could face a challenge by tax authorities if it was felt rules had been abused. Lord Ashcroft's trust was based in Bermuda This could include a challenge from HM Revenue and Customs if it was to take the view an overseas trust had been controlled from the UK. Nicholas Shaxson, the author of Treasure Islands, an expose of the workings of tax havens, told Panorama: ""On the evidence I have seen, it looks like something that is abusive behaviour and an abusive structure. If the trustees are worried, the trustees are expressing alarm about that, that's a clear red flag."" Prof Brooke Harrington, the author of Capital Without Borders, said: ""It's important that trustees be independent because the whole concept of a trust is that a settlor gives over legal ownership of an asset to the trustee. ""That's why you get these tax benefits and other legal benefits from the trust structure."" Lord Ashcroft's spokesman, Alan Kilkenny, is quoted in the Guardian as saying the peer had never engaged in tax evasion, abusive tax avoidance or tax avoidance using artificial structures.

"This video can not be played Paradise Papers: How to hide your cash offshore TheParadise Papersare a huge leak of financial documents that throw light on the top end of the world of offshore finance. A number of stories are appearing in a week-long expose of how politicians, multinationals, celebrities and high-net-worth individuals use complex structures to protect their cash from higher taxes. As with last year's Panama Papers leak, the documents were obtained by the German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,external, which called in theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),externalto oversee the investigation.BBC Panoramaand theGuardian,externalare among the nearly 100 media groups investigating the papers. The Paradise Papers name was chosen because of the idyllic profiles of many of the offshore jurisdictions whose workings are unveiled, including Bermuda, the HQ of the main company involved,Appleby. It also dovetails nicely with the French term for a tax haven - paradis fiscal. Then again, the Isle of Man plays a big part. The offshore financial affairs of hundreds of politicians, multinationals, celebrities and high-net-worth individuals, some of them household names, have been revealed. The papers also throw light on the legal firms, financial institutions and accountants working in the sector and on the jurisdictions that adopt offshore tax rules to attract money. These are the stories so far: Prince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreementswithout disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting Apple has protected its low-tax regimeby using the Channel Island of Jersey Formula 1 championLewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet, the papers suggest The Queen's private estateinvested about Â£10m offshoreincluding a small amount in the company behind BrightHouse, a chain accused of irresponsible lending One of President Donald Trump's top administration officialskept a financial stake in a firm whose major partners include a Russian companypart-owned by President Vladimir Putin's son-in-law An entrepreneur charged with managing the oil wealth of the struggling African state of Angolawas paid more than $41m in just 20 months A Lithuanian shopping mallpartly owned by U2 star Bonois under investigation for potential tax evasion How three stars of the hit BBC sitcom, Mrs Brown's Boys,diverted more than Â£2m into an offshore tax-avoidance scheme One of the world's largest firmsloaned a businessman previously accused of corruption $45mand asked him to negotiate mining rights in the DR Congo The Isle of Manpassed a law that would help tax evaders, the documents show A key aide of Canada's PM has beenlinked to offshore schemesthat may have cost the nation millions of dollars in taxes, threatening to embarrass Justin Trudeau Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative party deputy chairman and a significant donor,may have broken the rules around how his offshore investments were managed.

You can find our stories on the revelationshere,external. If you have a question about the Paradise Papers you can submit ithere. There are more than 1,400GB of data, containing about 13.4 million documents. Some 6.8 million come from the offshore legal service providerAppleby,externaland corporate services provider Estera. The two operated together under the Appleby name until Estera became independent in 2016. Another six million documents come from corporate registries in some 19 jurisdictions, mostly in the Caribbean. A smaller amount comes from the Singapore-based international trust and corporate services provider,Asiaciti Trust,external.  The leaked data covers seven decades, from 1950 to 2016. A law firm that helps corporations, financial institutions and high-net-worth individuals set up and register companies in offshore jurisdictions. Founded in Bermuda and with a history dating back to the 1890s, it has become one of the largest and best known of about 10 major companies involved in the specialist arena. The leak shows the US dominates Appleby's client register, with more than 31,000 US addresses for clients. There were more than 14,000 UK addresses and 12,000 in Bermuda. Who are Appleby? As with 2016'sPanama Papers, German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung obtained the original material and was the stepping off point for this investigation. In the case of the Panama Papers, the originator of the leaks, named only as John Doe, issued a manifesto a month after the publication date. A simple statement this time says: ""For their protection, SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung does as a general policy not comment on its sources!"" As with the Panama Papers, theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,external, a global network of investigative journalists, was called in to work on the project. Along with the BBC's flagship Panorama programme, there are nearly 100 media partners involved in 67 countries, including theGuardian,externaland theNew York Times,external. The media partners say the investigation is in the public interest because data leaks from the world of offshore have repeatedly exposed wrongdoing. The leaks have led to hundreds of investigations worldwide, resulting in politicians, ministers and even prime ministers being forced from office. The $64m question, or probably more if you are in a tax haven, or offshore financial centre as the industry  prefers to call it. It is indeed thefifth major leak of financial papers in the past four yearsand, yes, last year's Panama Papers were bigger in size - 2.6TB to 1.4TB - but the scale of the information in the Paradise Papers and how it lifts the lid on sophisticated, upper-end offshore dealings, many linked to the UK, is unprecedented. As Gerard Ryle, who oversees member journalists at the ICIJ, says: ""This leak is important because it's the high end of town. People may have dismissed the Mossack Fonseca leaks as they were rogue players who would take any client. Most of the offshore world is not like that at all. Here you have the gold-plated company."" The documents were tougher than the Panama Papers too. Mr Ryle says: ""They came in different formats and it took us a long time to decipher them. There were nice surprises along the way but it was a much more difficult data set."" It's hard to pin down an exact definition. Tax haven is the term usually used in the media and public, whereas the industry would prefer the term offshore financial centre (OFC). It is essentially a financial jurisdiction outside the regulations of your own nation used by companies and individuals to lower their taxes on profits or assets. They are usually secretive and stable. They are also often small islands, many of them UK Crown Dependencies or Overseas Territories, but not exclusively so. Nations such as Switzerland, Ireland and the Netherlands have similar tax reducing mechanisms, while the UK and the US are leading nations providing services that facilitate the use of OFCs.

"This video can not be played Paradise Papers: How Lewis Hamilton got a Â£3.3m VAT refund Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet, according toParadise Papersdocuments. They show a Â£3.3m VAT refund was given after the Bombardier Challenger 605 was imported into the Isle of Man in 2013. It appears a leasing deal set up by advisers was artificial and did not comply with an EU and UK ban on refunds for private use - although he may have been entitled to one for business. Hamilton's lawyers say a tax barrister review found the structure was lawful. They added it was not correct to say no VAT had been paid on any of the arrangements. A statement later issued by the racing driver's representative said: ""As a global sportsman who pays tax in a large number of countries, Lewis relies upon a team of professional advisers who manage his affairs. ""Those advisers have assured Lewis that everything is above board and the matter is now in the hands of his lawyers."" At 06:15 on 21 January 2013, Hamilton touched down at Ronaldsway airport on the Isle of Man in his new jet with his then-pop star girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger to finalise the paperwork with customs. While Hamilton's planned use of the jet was predominantly for business purposes, the BBC's Panorama programme has seen documents which suggest the 32-year-old F1 Mercedes driver intended to make private flights about a third of the time. Hamilton's plane carries the private registration G-LCDH (Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton) Hamilton's social media accounts provide evidence he has used the candy apple red Challenger for holidays and on other personal trips around the world. He has posted a number of photographs of himself on the plane on Instagram - including one showing his bulldogs Roscoe and Coco on board. Allow Instagram content?

""If private usage of the jet is being disguised as business usage of the jet, then what you essentially have is a tax avoidance scheme,"" says Rita De La Feria, professor of tax law at Leeds University. ""You're using it for your own private interests, you're going on holidays, meeting friends. You're supposed to pay the tax on private consumption."" Private jets purchased outside the EU are subject to 20% VAT on importation in order to qualify for free circulation within the bloc. While the Isle of Man is not part of the EU, it is a British Crown Dependency and forms a common area with the UK for VAT purposes. Because of this link, an aircraft imported via the island is granted full access to the EU. To try and get round EU and UK rules banning VAT refunds on aircraft used by private individuals, Hamilton's advisers formed a VAT-registered leasing business on the Isle of Man, the leaked documents held by offshore law firm Appleby suggest. The new company, Stealth (IOM) Limited, leased the jet from Hamilton's British Virgin Islands company, Stealth Aviation Limited, and imported it into the Isle of Man. It was then leased on to a UK jet management company that provided Hamilton with a crew and other services - and which leased it back to Hamilton and his Guernsey company, BRV Limited. Hamilton is described in the documents as the jet's ""ultimate client"". They also suggest he was being kept up to date. In one email sent ahead of the final signing of the charter agreements and the jet's importation into the Isle of Man, an adviser states: ""I would like to email Lewis his agreement this evening and try to reach him on the phone to talk him through it."" Other documents show the hourly rate of the plane's lease was increased from Â£2,000 to Â£5,500 overnight at one stage, so the Isle of Man company turned a profit as a ""commercial"" aircraft leasing business. On the basis of the transactions, Hamilton's advisers were able to claim a 100% VAT refund on the Â£3.3m he was obliged to pay at the point of importation. But the leasing agreements suggest Hamilton was going to be using the plane 80 hours per month, with his company using it for 160 hours. If this estimate had been used for the basis of the VAT refund, under UK and EU VAT rules, only two thirds could have been considered for a refund in relation to business use. The artificiality of the structure raises questions about whether Hamilton should have received a refund at all. Hamilton secured his fourth F1 title at last month's Mexico Grand Prix Lawyers acting for Hamilton said the driver has a ""set of professionals in place who run most aspects of his business operations and that no subterfuge or improper levels of secrecy had been put in place"". In a statement, they said Stealth (IOM) Limited was formed to run a leasing business and hire the aircraft on a long-term basis at a commercial rate. They added that the company made all necessary disclosures to Isle of Man officials, who approved the approach. The lawyers said that reducing taxes was not the motive, but even if it had been, it is lawful to lease rather than buy in order to reduce VAT. There are 50 schemes like Hamilton's in the Paradise Papers. The documents show that Appleby on the Isle of Man has imported luxury jets worth Â£1.25bn. In total, the island has handed out more than Â£790m in VAT refunds to jet leasing companies, involving more than 230 planes. In light of the Paradise Papers revelations, theIsle of Man government has invited the UK Treasury to conduct an assessment,externalof the practice of importing aircraft into the EU through the island.

The Isle of Man says since 2011 more than 30 assessments for under-declared or over-claimed VAT against businesses in the aircraft leasing sector, with a value of about Â£4.7m, have been raised. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn last weekcalled on the Prime MinisterTheresa May to launch an investigation into VAT avoidance allegations linked with business jets in the Isle of Man. In astatement on the Paradise Papers leak, Appleby said,externalit was a law firm which ""advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business.

"The international development secretary held 12 unofficial meetings in Israel Priti Patel has apologised for holding a series of undisclosed meetings with senior Israeli officials during a private holiday over the summer. The international development secretary met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior figures without ""following the usual procedures"". Ms Patel apologised,externalfor not informing the Foreign Office and suggesting Boris Johnson knew in advance of the visit. Labour said the ""shocking"" admission warranted a Cabinet Office inquiry. Kuenssberg: A bad day at the office for Theresa May Downing Street said it welcomed Ms Patel's ""clarification"" and that at a meeting with Theresa May earlier, the prime minister had ""reminded her of the obligations which exist under the ministerial code"". No 10 said it had not been aware of Ms Patel's meeting with Mr Netanyahu until Friday but insisted that Mrs May still had confidence in the minister. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said there were clear rules about what ministers could and could not do and ""in normal circumstances"" Ms Patel would be in ""serious trouble"". But he said the fragility of Mrs May's government and the fact that the PM would not want to lose another cabinet minister after Sir Michael Fallon's recent resignation could help her. The BBC revealed on Friday that Ms Patel held a number of undisclosed meetings with business and political figures during a family holiday in August, including Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party and Jean Judes, executive director of disability charity BIS. No diplomats were present at the meetings, at which the minister was accompanied by an influential pro-Israeli Conservative peer and campaigner Lord Polak. Ms Patel, who is a long-standing supporter of Israel and a former vice-chairman of Conservative Friends of Israel defended her actions, saying she had paid for the holiday herself and while in Israel had taken the opportunity to meet ""people and organisations"" for the purpose of building links between the two countries. She also told the Guardian,externalthat ""Boris [Johnson] knew about the visit, the point is that the Foreign Office did know about this"". Suggesting that the reaction to her visit had been ""extraordinary"", she added that it was ""for the Foreign Office to go away and explain themselves"". But in a statement ""clarifying her position"", Ms Patel said she had in fact attended 12 meetings, not just the handful previously reported, and that her earlier comments may have ""implied"" otherwise. Among meetings that were not previously reported, she said that she had met Mr Netanyahu to discuss his forthcoming visit to the UK as well as the Israeli ""domestic political scene"" and UK-Israeli collaboration. Ms Patel discussed Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the UK She said she had also met other senior figures in the Israeli government, including security minister Gilad Erdan and foreign ministry official Yuval Rotem. Ms Patel has also set the record straight about when the government was informed about the trip. While the Foreign Office was aware of the visit ""while it was under way"", she said she was wrong to have given the impression that the department and Mr Johnson knew about it in advance. She said she ""regretted the lack of precision in the wording"" of her previous statement about the trip. ""This summer I travelled to Israel, on a family holiday paid for myself,"" she said in a statement. ""While away I had the opportunity to meet a number of people and organisations...In hindsight, I can see how my enthusiasm to engage in this way could be mis-read, and how meetings were set up and reported in a way which did not accord with the usual procedures. I am sorry for this and I apologise for it. ""My first and only aim as the Secretary of State for International Development is to put the interests of British taxpayers and the world's poor at the front of our development work."" In her statement, Ms Patel also said the Foreign Office was clear that the UK's interests were ""not damaged or affected"" by her actions. Labour has called for an inquiry into whether Ms Patel broke the ministerial code or the rules on lobbying. ""Not only does it look like she has broken the ministerial code, she has now been caught misleading the British public,"" shadow international development secretary Kate Osamor said. ""If she does not now resign, then Theresa May must immediately refer the issue to the Cabinet Office for a full investigation."" Downing Street said the ministerial code was ""not explicit"" in this area and Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heyward had been asked to see if it could be made clearer.

"Globally, temperatures in 2017 look set to be the third highest on record The year 2017 is ""very likely"" to be in the top three warmest years on record, according to provisional figures from the World Meteorological Organization. The WMO says it will likely be the hottest year in the absence of the El NiÃ±o phenomenon. The scientists argue that the long-term trend of warming driven by human activities continues unabated. They say many of the ""extraordinary"" weather events seen this year bear the hallmarks of climate change. On the opening day of this year's key UN climate talks, researchers from the WMO have presented their annual State of the Global Climate report. It follows hot on the heels of their greenhouse gases study from last week which found that concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were the highest on record. Record surge in atmospheric CO2 in 2016 UN: Emissions gap is 'alarmingly high' What is climate change? While the new study only covers January to September, the WMO says the average global temperature was 1.1C above the pre-industrial figure. This is getting dangerously close to the 1.5 degrees threshold that many island states feel temperatures must be kept under to ensure their survival. The analysis suggests that 2017 is likely to come in 0.47C warmer than the 1981-2010 average. This is slightly down on 2016 when the El NiÃ±o weather phenomenon saw temperatures that were 0.56C above the average. According to the WMO, this year vies with 2015 to be the second or third warmest mark yet recorded. This video can not be played Aerial footage of the aftermath in Dominica ""The past three years have all been in the top three years in terms of temperature records. This is part of a long-term warming trend,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. ""We have witnessed extraordinary weather, including temperatures topping 50C in Asia, record-breaking hurricanes in rapid succession in the Caribbean and Atlantic, (and) reaching as far as Ireland, devastating monsoon flooding affecting many millions of people and a relentless drought in East Africa. ""Many of these events - and detailed scientific studies will determine exactly how many - bear the tell-tale sign of climate change caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities,"" he said. The Caribbean island of Saint-Barthelemy after it was hit by Hurricane Irma Scientists will have to do attribution studies to clearly link specific events from 2017 to rising temperatures. But they believe the fingerprints of climate change are to be seen in events such as tropical cyclones, where the warmer seas can transfer more heat to the gathering storms and increased sea levels can make flooding more damaging. The Accumulated Cyclone Energy Index, which measures the intensity and duration of these events, showed its highest ever monthly values in September this year. It was also the first time that two Category 4 hurricanes made landfall in the same year in the US. Hurricane Irma was a Category 5 storm for the longest period on record. Rain gauges in Nederland, Texas, recorded 1,539mm, the largest ever recorded for a single event in the mainland US. Scientists say that extreme heat and drought contributed to many destructive wildfires such as this one in California There were also significant flooding events with large loss of life in Sierra Leone, in Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Peru among many others. In contrast, droughts and heatwaves affected many parts of Africa and South America. In Somalia, more than half of cropland was impacted with herds reduced by 40-60%. More than 11 million people are experiencing severe food insecurity in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. ""This year saw a multitude of damaging weather extremes which is not uncommon but many of these events were made more severe by the sustained warming influence of increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas levels due to human activities,"" said Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading, UK. This video can not be played WATCH: Hurricane Hunters fly over eye of storm to help forecasters ""An increased severity of weather extremes is expected in the decades ahead as Earth continues to heat up and it is only with the substantive cuts in greenhouse gas emissions required by the Paris climate agreement that we can avert much more potent and widespread damage to our societies and the ecosystems upon which they depend."" With UN talks on climate change now underway here in Bonn, the report is likely to reinforce a sense of urgency among many delegates. ""These findings underline the rising risks to people, economies and the very fabric of life on Earth if we fail to get on track with the aims and ambitions of the Paris Agreement,"" said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of UN Climate Change, which is hosting the Bonn conference.

""We need to do more to stop these abuses of power and I'm pleased that having convened this meeting of party leaders today we have agreed a way forward,"" she added. Mr Corbyn has called for training for MPs in managing their offices and a new independent body to support staff who suffer mistreatment. In a letter to the prime minister ahead of the meeting, Mr Corbyn said MPs should undergo training after each general election in employment standards. He said a new body should be set up to provide an ""independent route"" to counselling, reporting and representation through complaints procedures, and have powers to recommend reporting of criminal allegations to the police. He said political parties should encourage all staff to join a trade union, as they can provide a ""vital mechanism"" for strengthening effective action and protection from sexual and other harassment and abuse at work.

"This video can not be played May: Allegations must be properly investigated Theresa May has called for a ""new culture of respect"" ahead of a meeting with other party leaders to discuss the Westminster sexual misconduct scandal. The PM said in a speech to the CBI that people should know their complaints will be investigated properly. It comes as several Conservative and Labour MPs are investigated over claims of sexual misconduct. On Sunday Conservative MP Chris Pincher stepped down as a government whip after allegations about his behaviour. Mr Pincher has also referred himself to police and the Conservative Party's complaints procedure following newspaper reports of allegations about his conduct in 2001 made by a party activist. It follows the resignation of Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary following complaints about his behaviour and amid a Cabinet Office inquiry into the conduct of First Secretary of State Damian Green. Chris Pincher is the MP for Tamworth in Staffordshire Dover MP Charlie Elphicke, who denies wrongdoing, has been suspended from the party after ""serious allegations"" against him were referred to the police and three other Conservative MPs who deny wrongdoing - Stephen Crabb, Dan Poulter and Daniel Kawczynski - have been referred to the party's disciplinary committee after media allegations about their conduct. Labour has also suspended an MP - Kelvin Hopkins, who denies claims he made inappropriate physical contact with a Labour activist in 2004 - and is investigating a formal complaint made against Clive Lewis, who denies groping a woman. The party has also launched an independent investigation after Labour activist Bex Bailey said she had been raped at a party event in 2011 and discouraged by a senior official from reporting the attack. In a speech at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference Mrs May said: ""We need to establish a new culture of respect at the centre of our public life. ""One in which everyone can feel confident that they are working in a safe and secure environment, where complaints can be brought forward without prejudice and victims know that these complaints will be investigated properly. ""Political parties have not always got this right in the past. But I am determined to get it right for the future."" Tory rape claims 'ignored by Commons' Growing number of MPs under scrutiny What counts as inappropriate behaviour- She is due to meet other party leaders later to discuss setting up an independent grievance procedure for Parliament. ""Those working for Members of Parliament should not have to navigate different party systems depending on their employer's political affiliation,"" the prime minister told the CBI. ""What has been revealed over the last few weeks has been deeply troubling - and has understandably led to significant public unease. ""Women and men should be able to work free from the threat or fear of harassment, bullying or intimidation. ""But for too long the powerful have been able to abuse their power, and their victims have not felt able to speak out."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the CBI conference that everyone, including businesses, ""have a duty to act, and act now"" over sexual harassment. He said: ""Such abuse, sexism and misogyny is, sadly, very far from being confined to Hollywood and the corridors of power, but is also widespread in our schools and universities, in our businesses and workplaces, in our newspapers and on our TV screens. It is all around us. ""That must change and business has an essential role to play. All of you need to look hard at yourselves, as we in the Labour Party are doing ourselves, to see how your processes and procedures can be improved. How it can be made easier for women to speak out and for victims to get the support they have a right to expect."" Meanwhile, Mr Green, Mrs May's most senior minister, is to be interviewed as part of the Cabinet Office investigation into his conduct. The inquiry was triggered after Kate Maltby, who is three decades younger than him, claimed he ""fleetingly"" touched her knee during a meeting in a Waterloo pub in 2015, and a year later sent her a ""suggestive"" text message after she was pictured wearing a corset in the newspaper. Damian Green said the allegations were from a ""tainted and untrustworthy source"" Mr Green said any allegation that he made sexual advances to Ms Maltby was ""untrue (and) deeply hurtful"". The inquiry was broadened after the Sunday Times reported that a statement prepared by ex-Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick alleged pornography was discovered by officers searching Mr Green's parliamentary office following a spate of leaks of Home Office information in 2008. Mr Green said the claims were ""completely untrue"" and ""political smears"".

Houlihan told the Irish Times,externalhe had joined the scheme after receiving professional advice without fully understanding it. Roy Lyness, who put the stars in touch with the advisers behind the set-up, was the accountant behind the similartax avoidance scheme used by comedian Jimmy Carr.

The revelation in 2012 that Carr had used a Jersey-based tax shelter attracted criticism from then-Prime Minister David Cameron. It led to the comedian saying he had made ""a terrible error of judgement"". The leaked documents held by offshore law firm Appleby show how the three Mrs Brown's Boys stars put their fees from a production company owned by Brendan O'Carroll, the creator and star of the show and real-life father of Fiona Delany, in companies they controlled in Mauritius. Where to find the world's missing $10tn Mr O'Carroll said neither he nor his companies have been involved in a tax avoidance scheme or structure and the actors' wages were paid into a UK company bank account. Mr O'Carroll's production company is registered at accountant Mr Lyness's office in Oldbury in the West Midlands. Mr Lyness said he was ""bound by client confidentiality as well as duties under the Data Protection Act not to divulge confidential information concerning my clients' financial affairs"". Mr O'Carroll plays Irish matriarch Agnes Brown in Mrs Brown's Boys. Patrick Houlihan is one of the boys - Dermot.  Fiona Delany stars as Mr Houlihan's nurse wife Maria, and her real-life husband, Mr Delany, stars as Trevor Brown, the youngest son. The show's creator, Brendan O'Carroll, stressed he had never been involved in a tax avoidance scheme or structure The sitcom started life as a radio show on RTE 2FM in the Irish Republic and became a worldwide hit after being turned into a TV series by the BBC and RTE in 2011. There is also a successful stage show which tours the world. A film, Mrs Brown's Boys D'Movie, came out in 2014, and the show's Christmas specials are among the UK's top-viewed festive programmes. The Paradise Papers documents suggest the actors' fees from their work connected to Mrs Brown's Boys was sent offshore to avoid income tax and national insurance. The leaked documents show the trail of money being transferred to the actors via Mauritius They show: Brendan O'Carroll's production company pays a UK-based company for the actors' work the UK company transfers the money to a trust set up in Mauritius by Appleby the actors were self-employed contractors for the trust, which took a 12.5% cut of their fees, before transferring the money into three companies in Mauritius the actors each had effective control over the companies they took on the role of  investment advisers, ""recommending"" their earnings be sent back to their personal bank accounts in the form of loans the loans had been structured to avoid triggering rules brought in by the UK government to prevent similar schemes from operating - with the money paid into the accounts through a third party. Documents for the 2014-15 financial year show Martin Delany's offshore company received Â£448,095 and Fiona Delany's received Â£448,168. No figures are available for Paddy Houlihan, as his company's accounts for that period are not in the data. But a spreadsheet for the next financial year shows in December 2015 Mr Houlihan's company had assets of Â£696,349, Fiona Delany's Â£715,122, and Martin Delany's Â£725,030. Inofficial guidance,externalissued in 2016, HMRC said it would investigate and challenge such practices. ""Scheme promoters will tell you that the payment is non-taxable because it's a loan, and doesn't count as income,"" it said. ""In reality, you don't pay the loan back, so it's no different to normal income and is taxable. ""So if you're using one of these schemes and being paid this way you're highly likely to be avoiding tax."" Comedian Jimmy Carr's use of a tax avoidance scheme came to light in 2012 HMRC has the power to send people using these sorts of schemes ""accelerated payment notices"" - which require them to repay the tax immediately, while their case is investigated. Told of the type of scheme being used by the Mrs Brown's Boys stars, MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said: ""If it's not outside the actual rules it's certainly... way outside the spirit of the rules."" She added: ""A decade ago perhaps it wasn't so much in the public domain, but now I don't think anybody with any sense would be just taking the advice of a tax adviser without asking certain questions... That's just common sense... these people ought to look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves whether it's really fair what they're doing."" In astatement on the Paradise Papers leak, Appleby said,externalit was a law firm which ""advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business.

"This video can not be played Paradise Papers: Appleâs secret tax bolthole revealed The world's most profitable firm has a secretive new structure that would enable it to continue avoiding billions in taxes, the Paradise Papers show. They reveal how Apple sidestepped a 2013 crackdown on its controversial Irish tax practices by actively shopping around for a tax haven. It then moved the firm holding most of its untaxed offshore cash, now $252bn, to the Channel Island of Jersey. Apple said the new structure had not lowered its taxes. It said it remained the world's largest taxpayer, paying about $35bn (Â£26bn) in corporation tax over the past three years, that it had followed the law and its changes ""did not reduce our tax payments in any country"". In a further statement,externalthe company stressed that no operations or investments had been moved from Ireland. TheParadise Papers,externalis the name for a huge leak of financial documents that is throwing light on the world of offshore finance. Follow all the latest updates Lewis Hamilton 'dodged' VAT on jet Questions over African mining deal Mrs Brown's Boys stars 'put money offshore' Up until 2014, the tech company had been exploiting a loophole in tax laws in the US and the Republic of Ireland known as the ""double Irish"". This allowed Apple to funnel all its sales outside of the Americas - currently about 55% of its revenue - through Irish subsidiaries that were effectively stateless for taxation purposes, and so incurred hardly any tax. Instead of paying Irish corporation tax of 12.5%, or the US rate of 35%, Apple's avoidance structure helped it reduce its tax rate on profits outside of the US to the extent that its foreign tax payments rarely amounted to more than 5% of its foreign profits, and in some years dipped below 2%. The European Commission calculated the rate of tax for one of Apple's Irish companies for one year had been just 0.005%. This video can not be played Apple CEO Tim Cook: ""We pay all the taxes we owe. Every single dollar"" Apple came under pressure in 2013 in the US Senate, when CEO Tim Cook was forced to defend its tax system. Angry that the US was missing out on a huge amount of tax, then-Senator Carl Levin told him: ""You shifted that golden goose to Ireland. You shifted it to three companies that do not pay taxes in Ireland. These are the crown jewels of Apple Inc. Folks, it's not right."" Mr Cook responded defiantly: ""We pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar. We do not depend on tax gimmicks... We do not stash money on some Caribbean island."" After the EU announced in 2013 that it was investigating Apple's Irish arrangement, the Irish government decided that firms incorporated there could no longer be stateless for tax purposes. This video can not be played Panorama's Richard Bilton tries to speak to Appleby about Apple in Jersey In order to keep its tax rates low, Apple needed to find an offshore financial centre that would serve as the tax residency for its Irish subsidiaries. In March 2014, Apple's legal advisers sent a questionnaire to Appleby, a leading offshore finance law firm and source of much of the Paradise Papers leak. It asked what benefits different offshore jurisdictions - the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Mauritius, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey - could offer Apple. The document asked key questions such as was it possible to ""obtain an official assurance of tax exemption"" and could it be confirmed that an Irish company might ""conduct management activitiesâ¦ without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction"". They also asked whether a change of government was likely, what information would be visible to the public and how easy it would be to exit the jurisdiction. Leaked emails also make it clear that Apple wanted to keep the move secret. One email sent between senior partners at Appleby says: ""For those of you who are not aware, Apple [officials] are extremely sensitive concerning publicity. They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know."" Apple chose Jersey, a UK Crown dependency that makes its own tax laws and which has a 0% corporate tax rate for foreign companies. Paradise Papers documents show Apple's two key Irish subsidiaries, Apple Operations International (AOI), believed to hold most of Apple's massive $252bn overseas cash hoard, and Apple Sales International (ASI), were managed from Appleby's office in Jersey from the start of 2015 until early 2016. This would have enabled Apple to continue avoiding billions in tax around the world. Paradise Papers: All you need to know Apple's 2017 accounts showed they made $44.7bn outside the US and paid just $1.65bn in taxes to foreign governments, a rate of around 3.7%. That is less than a sixth of the average rate of corporation tax in the world. In August 2016, after a three-year investigation,the European Commission finds that Ireland gave an illegal tax benefit to Apple,external. The EC says Apple must repay Ireland taxes for the period within its remit of investigation, 2003-2013, a total of â¬13bn (Â£11.6bn) plus interest of â¬1bn. Ireland and Applelaunch an appeal. Apple's Tim Cook calls the EC ruling ""total political crap"", with ""no reason for it in fact or in law"". Ireland says the EU is encroaching on sovereign taxation. It fears multinationals will go elsewhere. Ireland agrees to collect the â¬13bn, to be held in a managed escrow account pending the appeal verdict. In October 2017, the EU says it will take Ireland to court as it has not yet collected the money. Ireland says it is complicated and it needs time. Tim Cook's claims examined When the ""double-Irish"" loophole was shut down, Ireland also created new tax regulations that companies like Apple could take advantage of. One of the companies that Apple moved to Jersey, ASI, had rights to some of Apple Inc's hugely valuable intellectual property. If ASI sold the intellectual property back to an Irish company, the Irish company would be able to offset the enormous cost against any future profits. And since the IP holder, ASI, was registered in Jersey, the profits of the sale would not be taxed. It appears Apple has done just that. There was an extraordinary 26% spike in Ireland's GDP in 2015which media reports,externalput down to intellectual property assets moving into Ireland. Intangible assets rose a massive â¬250bn in Ireland that year. Ireland's department of finance denied that the new regulations had been brought in to benefit multinationals. It said Ireland was ""not unique in allowing companies to claim capital allowances on intangible assets"" and had followed ""the international norm"". This video can not be played Investigative journalist Richard Brooks on Appleâs questionnaire and the Isle of Manâs response to it Apple declined to answer questions about its two subsidiaries moving their tax residency to Jersey. It also declined to comment when asked whether one of those companies had helped create a huge tax write-off by selling intellectual property. Apple said: ""When Ireland changed its tax laws in 2015, we complied by changing the residency of our Irish subsidiaries and we informed Ireland, the European Commission and the United States. ""The changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country. In fact, our payments to Ireland increased significantly and over the last three years we've paid $1.5bn in tax there.""

"The leaks show about Â£10m of the Queen's private money was invested offshore A huge new leak of financial documents has revealed how the powerful and ultra-wealthy, including the Queen's private estate, secretly invest vast amounts of cash in offshore tax havens. Donald Trump's commerce secretary is shown to have a stake in a firm dealing with Russians sanctioned by the US. The leak, dubbed theParadise Papers, contains 13.4m documents, mostly from one leading firm in offshore finance. BBC Panorama is part of nearly 100 media groups investigating the papers. Follow live updates As with last year's Panama Papers leak, the documents were obtained by the German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,external, which called in theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,external(ICIJ) to oversee the investigation. TheGuardian,externalis also among the organisations investigating the documents. Sunday's revelations form only a small part of a week of disclosures that will expose the tax and financial affairs of some of the hundreds of people and companies named in the data, some with strong UK connections. Many of the stories focus on how politicians, multinationals, celebrities and high-net-worth individuals use complex structures of trusts, foundations and shell companies to protect their cash from tax officials or hide their dealings behind a veil of secrecy. This video can not be played Paradise Papers: How to hide your cash offshore The vast majority of the transactions involve no legal wrongdoing. Other key stories released on Sunday were: A key aide of Canada's PM has been linked to offshore schemes that may have cost the nation millions of dollars in taxes, threatening to embarrass Justin Trudeau, who has campaigned to shut tax havens.Read the full story here Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative party deputy chairman and a significant donor, may have ignored rules around how his offshore investments were managed.Read the full story hereOther papers suggest he retained his non-dom status while in the House of Lords, despite reports he had become a permanent tax resident in the UK.Read the full story here How questions were raised about the funding of a major shareholding in Everton FC.Read the full story here An oligarch with close links to the Kremlin, Alisher Usmanov, may have secretly taken ownership of a company responsible for anti-money laundering checks on Russian cash.Read the full story here The other media partners may be covering different stories affecting their regions. The Paradise Papers show that about Â£10m ($13m) of the Queen's private money was invested offshore. It was put into funds in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda by the Duchy of Lancaster, which provides the Queen with an income and handles investments for her Â£500m private estate. There is nothing illegal in the investments and no suggestion that the Queen is avoiding tax, but questions may be asked about whether the monarch should be investing offshore. There were small investments in the rent-to-buy retailer BrightHouse, which has been accused of exploiting the poor, and the Threshers chain of off-licences, which later went bust owing Â£17.5m in tax and costing almost 6,000 people their jobs. The Queen's private estate had a very small investment in the retailer BrightHouse The Duchy said it was not involved in decisions made by funds and there is no suggestion the Queen had any knowledge of the specific investments made on her behalf. The Duchy has in the past said it gives ""ongoing consideration regarding any of its acts or omissions that could adversely impact the reputation"" of the Queen, who it says takes ""a keen interest"" in the estate. The BBC's royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell says it is extraordinary and puzzling that the Queen's advisers could have felt that it was appropriate - for somebody whose reputation is based so much on setting a good example - to invest in these offshore funds. Questions will now be being asked inside Buckingham Palace about how that decision was made, he added. Read the full story here Wilbur Ross helped stave off bankruptcy for Donald Trump in the 1990s and was later appointed commerce secretary in Mr Trump's administration. The documents reveal Mr Ross has retained an interest in a shipping company which earns millions of dollars a year transporting oil and gas for a Russian energy firm whose shareholders include Vladimir Putin's son-in-law and two men subject to US sanctions. It will again raise questions about the Russian connections of Donald Trump's team. His presidency has been dogged by allegations that Russians colluded to try to influence the outcome of last year's US election. He has called the allegations ""fake news"". Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal has called for an investigation,telling NBC News that Mr Ross had given Congress the impression,externalhe no longer held shares in the shipping company. ""Our committee was misled, the American people were misled by the concealment of those companies."" Read the full story here Opposition politicians have said thegovernment must stop ""dragging its feet""and curb the use of offshore tax havens, and Labour Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has called for a public inquiry. But at the CBI conference on Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May did not commit to a public inquiry. She also did not directly answer when asked whether she would insist on British overseas territories publishing a list of who owns companies and trusts registered in crown dependencies. She said the UK government was working with its dependences ""to ensure we're seeing greater transparency."" Most of the data comes from a company called Appleby, a Bermuda-founded legal services provider at the top end of the offshore industry, helping clients set up in overseas jurisdictions with low or zero tax rates. Its documents, and others mainly from corporate registries in Caribbean jurisdictions, were obtained by SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung. It has not revealed the source. The media partners say the investigation is in the public interest because data leaks from the world of offshore have repeatedly exposed wrongdoing. In response to the leaks, Appleby said it was ""satisfied that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, either on the part of ourselves or our clients"", adding: ""We do not tolerate illegal behaviour.""Read the Appleby story here Essentially it's about a place outside of your own nation's regulations to which companies or individuals can reroute money, assets or profits to take advantage of lower taxes. These jurisdictions are known as tax havens to the layman, or the more stately offshore financial centres (OFCs) to the industry. They are generally stable, secretive and reliable, often small islands but not exclusively so, and can vary on how rigorously they carry out checks on wrongdoing. The UK is a big player here, not simply because so many of its overseas territories and Crown dependencies are OFCs, but many of the lawyers, accountants and bankers working in the offshore industry are in the City of London. It's also about the mega-rich. Brooke Harrington, author of Capital Without Borders: Wealth Managers and the One Percent, says offshore finance is not for the 1% but the .001%. Assets of around $500,000 (Â£380,000) would just not meet the offshore fees the schemes would need, she says. Are we taming offshore? Well, it is a lot of cash. The Boston Consulting Group says $10tn is held offshore. That's about the equivalent of the gross domestic products of the UK, Japan and France - combined. It may also be a conservative estimate. This video can not be played Labour MP Meg Hillier: âIf offshore wasnât secret then this stuff couldnât happenâ Critics of offshore say it is mainly about secrecy - which opens the door to wrongdoing - and inequality. They also say the action of governments to curb it has often been slow and ineffective. Brooke Harrington says if the rich are avoiding tax, the poor pick up the bill: ""There's a minimal amount the governments need to function and they recoup what they lose from the rich and from corporations by taking it out of our hides."" Meg Hillier, UK Labour MP and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, told Panorama: ""We need to see what's going offshore; if offshore was not secret then some of this stuff just couldn't happen... we need transparency and we need sunlight shone on this."" Your guide to a history of financial leaks The offshore financial centres say that if they did not exist, there would be no constraint on taxes governments might levy. They say they do not sit on hoards of cash, but act as agents that help pump money around the globe. This video can not be played Ex-Bermuda Finance Minister defends tax practices Bob Richards, who was Bermuda's finance minister when Panorama interviewed him for its programme, said it was not up to him to collect other nations' taxes and that they should sort themselves out. Both he and Howard Quayle, the chief minister for the Isle of Man, who was also interviewed for Panorama and whose Crown dependency plays a big part in the leaks, denied their jurisdictions could even be considered tax havens as they were well regulated and fully conformed to international financial reporting rules.

"Lord Ashcroft remained a non-dom, and continued to avoid tax despite attempts by Parliament to make peers pay their full share, leaked documents reveal. The peer was domiciled for tax purposes in Belize at a time when it was widely believed he had given up the status, the Paradise Papers show. While ordinary Britons have to pay tax on everything they earn, non-doms are only taxed on their UK income. Lord Ashcroft, who donated millions to the Tories, said he would not comment. He said it was because of the way he had been treated by BBC Panorama in the past. But his spokesman, Alan Kilkenny, is quoted in the Guardian newspaper as saying the peer had never engaged in tax evasion, abusive tax avoidance or tax avoidance using artificial structures. When questions were raised about the peer's non-dom status in 2010, he denied any ""impropriety or wrongdoing"". A former party treasurer and deputy chairman, Lord Ashcroft fell out with David Cameron in 2010 and later co-authored a controversial unauthorised biography of the then prime minister. But the 71-year-old remains involved in UK politics through his polling and publishing interests andlast year said he would start donating ""smaller sums""to the party again. Ashcroft 'ignored rules' on offshore trust Parliament tried to force the controversial peer to pay full British tax when he entered the House of Lords in 2000. Lord Ashcroft  promised to become a permanent resident in the UK - a change that would have meant giving up his status as a UK resident whose permanent home, or domicile, is outside of the country. The then leader of the Conservative Party William Hague told Parliament that becoming a peer would ""cost him [Lord Ashcroft] and benefit the Treasury tens of millions of pounds a year in tax"". This video can not be played Watch Lord Ashcroft try to avoid Richard Biltonâs questions about his offshore trust The tax was never paid because Lord Ashcroft, who was once Belize's ambassador to the United Nations and maintains links to the central American country, persuaded officials that he should be allowed to become a long term resident of the UK rather than a permanent one. A distinction that allowed him to retain his non-dom status. The leaked documents show that between 2000 and 2010, Lord Ashcroft received payments of around $200m (Â£150m) from his offshore trust in the Bermuda. The Tory Peer continued to sit in the House of Lords and as a non-dom he did not have to pay tax on these payments. Lord Ashcroft's admission in 2010 that he was still a non-dom led to a major political controversy and the introduction of legislation designed to force anybody who sits in Parliament to pay full British tax. After Lord Ashcroft told the BBC in May 2010 he was going to become ""a fully taxed person in Britain"",  it was widely reported he had given up his non-dom status. TheConservative Party also gave such an indication,externalon 7 July that same year. However, documents seen by the BBC's Panorama, reveal ""his true domicile is Belize"". The new law, theConstitutional Reform and Governance Act,external,  had not specified that non-dom MPs and peers would have to give up the status - only that they be ""treated as domiciled in the UK"" by the tax authorities. It meant Lord Ashcroft had to pay full British tax while he sat in Parliament, but as soon as he resigned from the House of Lords in March 2015 he was also a non-dom again in the eyes of UK revenue inspectors. The Paradise Papers suggest Lord Ashcroft worked around the new law to continue avoiding tax on his worldwide income between 2010 and 2015. On the 31 March 2010, the day before the new law came into effect, Lord Ashcroft's offshore trust bought shares worth Â£33.9m from one of his companies. His advisers note that the deal has ""capital gains tax implications"" but they point out he is ""not domiciled in the UK at the moment"". If the deal had happened the following day, he would have been treated differently and could have been liable for capital gains tax. Lord Ashcroft with William Hague and Ffion Hague in 2006 While he was sitting in the Lords as a full British taxpayer between 2010 and 2015, Lord Ashcroft appears to have stopped taking payments from his offshore trust. One of his advisers notes ""that there is no applicable tax as there is no distributable income"". The accounts for the trust show Lord Ashcroft didn't receive any payments in 2011, 2012 or 2013. The accounts for 2014 and 2015 were not in the leaked documents. Lord Ashcroft announced his resignation,externalfrom the House of Lords in March 2015. A week later, he sold shares worth Â£11.2m. If he had still been sitting in Parliament, he would have been liable for capital gains tax on any profits from the sale. But Lord Ashcroft was being treated as a non-dom again and could legally avoid the tax. Journalist Peter Oborne says Lord Ashcroft's non-dom status was a ""huge issue"" at the time he started to sit in the Lords and there was ""fresh controversy"" when the Tories entered power in 2010. The revelations in the Paradise Papers could cause a ""major political explosion,"" he said.  ""The Labour Party... will turn it into a first class political row. It will raise huge questions about not just the Conservatives [but] also the House of Lords."" The Conservative Party did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.

"This video can not be played US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross: 'There is nothing whatsoever improper' Donald Trump's commerce secretary says there is ""nothing improper"" about his business links to Russian figures who are currently under US sanctions. Wilbur Ross was accused of misleading senators after leaked documents showed his interests in a firm in which some shareholders have ties to the Kremlin. He told the BBC that the US had not sanctioned the company, Sibur, so ""there's nothing wrong with that"". Mr Ross also denied he had failed to disclose the information. Earlier, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthalcalled the revelations of the Kremlin links ""inexcusable"",external. They come as part of a huge leak of financial documents, dubbed the Paradise Papers, revealing how the powerful and ultra-wealthy, including the Queen's private estate, secretly invest vast amounts of cash in offshore tax havens. Tax haven secrets of ultra-rich exposed Are we taming offshore finance? Tax revelations hit Trudeau fundraiser The leaks show he has investments in shipping firm Navigator Holdings, which earns millions a year transporting oil and gas for Sibur. Two major Sibur shareholders have been sanctioned by the US: Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko, who has at least 12 companies connected to him The Russian natural gas company, Novatek, belonging to Leonid Mikhelson Another key Sibur shareholder is President Vladimir Putin's son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov, who holds a 3.9% stake in the firm. While he is not subject to sanctions, his father, Nikolai, is. Mr Ross has not disputed the revelations, telling the BBC: ""There's nothing whatsoever improper about Navigator having a relationship with Sibur."" ""If our government decided to sanction them, that would be a different story,"" he continued. He said he had disclosed the business links to the office of government ethics, and denied misleading the confirmation hearing committee when he took office. He said he had never met any of the figures concerned. The US imposed some sanctions after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Others were imposed last year for alleged interference in the US presidential election. The commerce department earlier said Mr Ross had ""been generally supportive of the administration's sanctions of Russian and other entities"". Prior to being confirmed in office as commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross did not reveal to Congress the full details of his company holdings. According to the leaks, he retains a financial interest in Navigator Holdings via a number of companies in the Cayman Islands, some of which he did disclose at the time of his confirmation. However, under the disclosure rules he did not have to declare his interest in Navigator Holdings. This video can not be played Ex-US sanctions policy co-ordinator Daniel Fried says it would be a mistake for any US official to do business with Sibur But questions will be raised about Mr Ross's potential conflicts of interest and whether his ties undermine US sanctions against Russia. ""Our committee was misled, the American people were misled by the concealment of those companies,""Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told NBC News,externalafter the revelations came to light. Mr Blumenthal has called for an investigation into the treasury secretary's links to President Putin's son-in-law. The leaks come as an investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian connections to Donald Trump's 2016 campaign team continues. Mr Trump's presidency has been dogged by allegations that Russians colluded to try to influence the outcome of the election. He has called the allegations ""fake news"". They have known each other for more than a quarter of a century. Mr Ross played a key part in a pre-packaged bankruptcy deal - an agreement between a company and its creditors - for Mr Trump's Atlantic City casino, the Taj Mahal, in the 1990s. Donald Trump at the Taj Mahal casino in 1990 He stepped in to represent the angry bondholders but liked Donald Trump's style. Mr Ross, according to Trump biographer David Cay Johnston, was the key negotiator preventing Donald Trump from ""being swept into the dustbin of history because he saw the value in the Trump name"". ""If it hadn't been for Wilbur Ross, Donald Trump would not be in the White House."" WL Ross & Co, which was founded by Wilbur Ross, appears to have maintained a close relationship with the shipping company. On the night that he was nominated as commerce secretary, Mr Ross was congratulated on his promotion by the senior management of Navigator Holdings at a New York restaurant,Bloomberg reports,external. Mr Ross reportedly told the CEO of Navigator: ""Your interest is aligned to mine. The US economy will grow, and Navigator will be a beneficiary.""

"Globally, temperatures in 2017 look set to be the third highest on record The year 2017 is ""very likely"" to be in the top three warmest years on record, according to provisional figures from the World Meteorological Organization. The WMO says it will likely be the hottest year in the absence of the El NiÃ±o phenomenon. The scientists argue that the long-term trend of warming driven by human activities continues unabated. They say many of the ""extraordinary"" weather events seen this year bear the hallmarks of climate change. On the opening day of this year's key UN climate talks, researchers from the WMO have presented their annual State of the Global Climate report. It follows hot on the heels of their greenhouse gases study from last week which found that concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were the highest on record. Record surge in atmospheric CO2 in 2016 UN: Emissions gap is 'alarmingly high' What is climate change? While the new study only covers January to September, the WMO says the average global temperature was 1.1C above the pre-industrial figure. This is getting dangerously close to the 1.5 degrees threshold that many island states feel temperatures must be kept under to ensure their survival. The analysis suggests that 2017 is likely to come in 0.47C warmer than the 1981-2010 average. This is slightly down on 2016 when the El NiÃ±o weather phenomenon saw temperatures that were 0.56C above the average. According to the WMO, this year vies with 2015 to be the second or third warmest mark yet recorded. This video can not be played Aerial footage of the aftermath in Dominica ""The past three years have all been in the top three years in terms of temperature records. This is part of a long-term warming trend,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. ""We have witnessed extraordinary weather, including temperatures topping 50C in Asia, record-breaking hurricanes in rapid succession in the Caribbean and Atlantic, (and) reaching as far as Ireland, devastating monsoon flooding affecting many millions of people and a relentless drought in East Africa. ""Many of these events - and detailed scientific studies will determine exactly how many - bear the tell-tale sign of climate change caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities,"" he said. The Caribbean island of Saint-Barthelemy after it was hit by Hurricane Irma Scientists will have to do attribution studies to clearly link specific events from 2017 to rising temperatures. But they believe the fingerprints of climate change are to be seen in events such as tropical cyclones, where the warmer seas can transfer more heat to the gathering storms and increased sea levels can make flooding more damaging. The Accumulated Cyclone Energy Index, which measures the intensity and duration of these events, showed its highest ever monthly values in September this year. It was also the first time that two Category 4 hurricanes made landfall in the same year in the US. Hurricane Irma was a Category 5 storm for the longest period on record. Rain gauges in Nederland, Texas, recorded 1,539mm, the largest ever recorded for a single event in the mainland US. Scientists say that extreme heat and drought contributed to many destructive wildfires such as this one in California There were also significant flooding events with large loss of life in Sierra Leone, in Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Peru among many others. In contrast, droughts and heatwaves affected many parts of Africa and South America. In Somalia, more than half of cropland was impacted with herds reduced by 40-60%. More than 11 million people are experiencing severe food insecurity in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. ""This year saw a multitude of damaging weather extremes which is not uncommon but many of these events were made more severe by the sustained warming influence of increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas levels due to human activities,"" said Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading, UK. This video can not be played WATCH: Hurricane Hunters fly over eye of storm to help forecasters ""An increased severity of weather extremes is expected in the decades ahead as Earth continues to heat up and it is only with the substantive cuts in greenhouse gas emissions required by the Paris climate agreement that we can avert much more potent and widespread damage to our societies and the ecosystems upon which they depend."" With UN talks on climate change now underway here in Bonn, the report is likely to reinforce a sense of urgency among many delegates. ""These findings underline the rising risks to people, economies and the very fabric of life on Earth if we fail to get on track with the aims and ambitions of the Paris Agreement,"" said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of UN Climate Change, which is hosting the Bonn conference.

"This video can not be played Witnesses Phil and Kim Dick say they shouted for paramedics Many of the most seriously injured victims of the Manchester Arena attack did not get expert medical help for more than an hour, witnesses have said. Twenty-two people were killed and 512 injured by suicide bomber Salman Abediat an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. Only three paramedics ever entered the cordoned-off foyer area at the centre of the blast, in line with the major incident plan, the BBC has been told. Injured people inside were later taken to medical staff gathered outside by members of the public and police. Phil and Kim Dick, from Bradford, were in the arena foyer at the time of the explosion, waiting for their daughter and granddaughter to come out of the concert. They told BBC Inside Out a young victim with ""horrific"" injuries collapsed in front of them. Manchester attack: Who were the victims? Who carried out the attack? Mrs Dick said she sat with the girl, who survived, for more than an hour. ""She could hardly walk,"" she said. ""She was stumbling, bleeding from her arm and her mouth and her leg, and her hair was burnt. ""I just kept shouting: 'We need paramedics now'. And they [armed police] just said: 'We're just making sure there are no more bombs'."" Phil and Kim Dick were waiting to collect their daughter and granddaughter at the time of the explosion ""There was just too much for just three paramedics to deal with,"" Mr Dick added. ""The longer it went on the more silent it became. It was really eerie and people who I had seen a little earlier, who were severely injured, were now dead."" Mr Dick said he believed a decision was made ""about an hour and 10 minutes after the explosion that the medical staff weren't coming up to the foyer but were going to evacuate all the casualties"". While we have been able to piece together much of what happened on that terrible night, several key questions remain unanswered: Why did only three paramedics make it into the foyer to treat the seriously injured? One of them has told the BBC that police were worried about a second bomb. Did police prevent more from entering this so-called ""hot zone""? Or was this call made by ambulance chiefs? Similarly, why did it take an hour and 47 minutes after the explosion for fire officers to deploy at all? It's thought fire chiefs made that call. Ultimately those in the unenviable position of being in command on the night had a terrible dilemma on their hands. Did they deploy their staff - thereby potentially exposing them to the risk of being caught up in a second blast or facing marauding terrorists - to try to save the critically injured? Eight days after the bomb, Chief Constable Ian Hopkins told BBC Radio Manchester his force had been on the scene ""within seconds"" and one of its roles had been to co-ordinate the emergency services' response. He said his force had contacted North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) within three minutes of the incident being declared and the ambulance service had followed its major incident plan. Both the fire and ambulance services initially went to a rendezvous point as per standard practice, he said. Mr Hopkins added: ""The ambulance service were called forward and, at this stage, I am unsure as to why the fire service were delayed so long."" The BBC has ascertained one paramedic was already inside the inner cordon by the time it was established, and that two specially trained paramedics joined him. Thereafter no other paramedics entered the foyer, which was known as the ""hot zone"". In a statement, NWAS said that despite the ""clear risk"", the decision was made to allow three staff into the foyer. ""Their job was to triage the injured and work with police to move people to a place close by where they could be treated safely - and where 25 paramedics were waiting, in accordance with our major incident plan. ""Within an hour all critical patients had been moved and were being treated by 50 paramedics. Some people had already been taken to hospital. Within four hours, all the injured that required hospital care had been transferred. ""This is the clinical model used in all major incidents. ""The Kerslake inquiry will fully review the processes that we used and we welcome any findings or lessons learnt that may be provided as a result but we are confident in our response which followed implementation of our major incident plan."" In total, 56 ambulances and seven rapid response vehicles were deployed to the incident, NWAS added. Abedi detonated his home-made device, packed full of nuts and bolts so as to maximise casualties, at 22:31 BST. BBC Inside Out has also learned that Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) did not deploy crews to the arena until one hour and 47 minutes later, at 00:18. A serving GMFRS firefighter, who wants to remain anonymous, told the BBC that the paramedics were asking where the fire service was. ""People were dying, why weren't we there? We were just helpless. ""I don't want the public to think that we didn't want to go or were scared to go, we were held back by the senior management. ""There were homeless people helping, members of the public helping. I'm a paid public servant and I wanted to help, I just wasn't allowed to help. ""The hairs are standing up on the back of my neck because it's embarrassing that we weren't allowed to go."" Another firefighter, who also did not want to be named, told the BBC: ""There were rumours that some people wanted to self-deploy because they were watching ambulances drive past their fire station and they were wondering why they hadn't been tasked to the event."" An anonymous firefighter said there were rumours people ""wanted to self-deploy"" GMFRS said it had conducted a ""debrief"" of its response to the deadliest terror attack in the UK since thebombing of the London transport network on 7 July 2005. But it said it would be inappropriate to comment further,given the fact it was co-operating with an ongoing review by Lord Kerslake into the Manchester attack, commissioned by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. The BBC asked all 49 fire brigades in the UK whether their firefighters were covered by their service's insurance in the event of injury or death while attending a terrorist attack. Merseyside was the only fire service to confirm explicitly it has insurance in place for its officers to respond to terrorist attacks. In a statement on Sunday, GMFRS said its employers' liability insurance covers firefighters attending such incidents. Lord Kerslake's interim report is due to be published in early 2018. The BBC has been told the deadline for submissions to the inquiry is to be extended to 24 November. You can find out more on this story by watching BBC Inside Out in the North West and Yorkshire & Lincolnshire regions of England from 19:30 GMT on Monday 6 November.

"Data shows gun ownership in the US has grown over the last several years Gun violence is a fixture in American life - but the issue is a highly political one, pitting gun control advocates against people who are fiercely protective of their right to bear arms. We've looked into some of the numbers behind firearms in the US. There have been more than 488 mass shootings across the US so far in 2024,according to the Gun Violence Archive,external, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are injured or killed. Their figures include shootings that happen in homes and in public places. For each of the last four years there have been more than 600 mass shootings - almost two a day on average. He counts US shootings. He no longer remembers names The deadliest such attack, in Las Vegas in 2017, killed more than 50 people and left 500 wounded. The vast majority of mass shootings, however, leave fewer than 10 people dead. 48,830 people died from gun-related injuries in the US during 2021, according to data fromthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),external. That was nearly an 8% increase from 2020, which was a record-breaking year for firearm deaths. While mass shootings and gun murders (homicides) generally garner much media attention, more than half of the total in 2021 were suicides. That year, more than 20,000 of the deaths were homicides,according to the CDC,external. Data shows more than 50 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries. While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, the latest figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based research project - estimated that there were 390 million guns in circulation in the US in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. Data from the US has suggested that gun ownership has grown significantly in recent years. A study, published bythe Annals of Internal Medicine in 2021,external, found that 7.5 million US adults became new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021. That, in turn, exposed 11 million people to firearms in their homes, including 5 million children. About half of new gun owners in that time period were women, while 40% were either black or Hispanic. A majority of Americans are in favour of gun control. 57% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun lawsaccording to polling by Gallup,externalin November 2022. 32% said the laws should remain the same, while 10% of people surveyed said they should be ""made less strict"". The issue is extremely divisive, falling largely along party lines. ""Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws,""another Gallup study noted,externalin 2021, with nearly 91% in favour of stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans, on the other hand, agreed with the same statement, along with 45% of Independent voters. Some states have taken steps to ban or strictly regulate ownership of assault weapons. Laws vary by state but California, for example, has banned ownership of assault weapons with limited exceptions. Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restrictions governing the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill or on ""watch"" lists. Despite years of financial woes and internal strife, the National Rifle Association (NRA) remains the most powerful gun lobby in the United States, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy. Over the last several election cycles, it, and other organisations, have consistently spent more on pro-gun rights messaging than their rivals in the gun control lobby. A number of states have also gone as far as to largely eliminate restrictions on who can carry a gun. In June 2021, for example, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a ""permitless carry bill"" that allows the state's residents to carry handguns without a licence or training. Similarly, in 2022, Georgia became the 25th in the nation to eliminate the need for a permit to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The law means any citizen of that state has the right to carry a firearm without a licence or a permit. The law was backed by the NRA, and leaders within the organisation called the move ""a monumental moment for the Second Amendment"". He counts US shootings.

Mr Trump's presidency has been dogged by allegations that Russians colluded to try to influence the outcome of the election. He has called the allegations ""fake news"". They have known each other for more than a quarter of a century.

"Like the Cheshire Cat, it's hard to tame something that keeps disappearing and reappearing The offshore finance industry puts trillions of dollars worldwide beyond the taxman's reach. Bringing it to heel is like taming a cat; not just a normal moggy - a thankless task in itself - but a Cheshire Cat: nebulous, hard to pin down, disappearing and reappearing when it likes. No-one can actually agree on what a tax haven is. Or even on the name: one person's tax haven is another's ""offshore financial centre"".  No-one can agree on how many there are. Nor on exactly how much money is stashed offshore. No statistics are fully reliable. And this suits those who operate in offshore finance, from the owner of the wealth to the lawyer or accountant middlemen who manage the funds, to the often sun-kissed beaches of the jurisdictions where they are secluded or pass through. The industry's key word is privacy. Or secrecy - a word it doesn't like so much. One adage cited by the taxation author and expert Nicholas Shaxson sums it up: ""Those who know don't talk. And those who talk don't know."" But do we really not know how much is stashed offshore? A report this September,  co-authored by the economist Gabriel Zucman, estimatesabout 10% of global GDP - the way we measure the size of the world's economy - is held offshore, about $7.8tn (Â£6tn),external. The Boston Consulting Group reported it last year at about $10tn. If you are thinking, wow, that's bigger than Japan's economy, you'd be right. But if you want a real wow, try $36tn - the estimate offered by James Henry, author of the book Blood Bankers. That's twice as big as the US economy. But no-one really knows. And here's another wow. Remember the slogan ""we are the 99%"" coined by the Occupy movement to lambast the top 1% of the population for their disproportionate share of wealth? Well, the Zucman report says 80% of all offshore cash is owned by 0.1% of the richest households, with 50% held by the top 0.01%. So if you read this and are thinking, if you can't beat them... quite frankly, it's unlikely you will ever join them. The management fees for the ordinary person will probably far outstrip the gains. As Nicholas Shaxson told BBC Panorama: ""At the very lowest end you'll have the middle classes doing little bits and pieces. But the large majority of what's going on, this is a game for rich people."" Surely we know some of how this works? The systems have a ring of familiarity - double taxation; tax inversion; trusts; shell companies etc. It's just we don't usually know who's in the schemes and what they are getting out of them. The basic essence is rerouting money in one location where you don't like the taxation rules to another location - one that is stable and reliable - where there aren't as many, or any. For example, if you want to protect your assets to stave off creditors, stick them in an offshore shell company. Hey presto, much harder to get at. Want to hide ownership of a property? Put it in a trust. This is not illegal. There are many other schemes, legal, illegal and sometimes ethically debatable. But even within these categories there are many variables on what actually constitutes The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. After all, in the film with that name the ugly arguably wasn't as bad as the bad, and the good was hardly perfect. True to their Cheshire Cat-like origins, offshore financial centres (OFCs) do not always appear where one might expect them. That's because offshore, sorry to confuse you, is also onshore. This makes it impossible to pin down the global number of OFCs. It could be 50, 70 or more and new ones come and go. The US and UK are arguably two of the biggest OFCs. For example, setting up shell firms is easy in some US states, like Delaware. And it's widely known that the City of London acts as the facilitating hub for Crown dependencies and overseas territories that channel trillions of offshore dollars. The smaller, often island, nations are what Nicholas Shaxson calls ""captured states"". This video can not be played Investigative journalist Nicholas Shaxson on why tax havens are âlike captured statesâ He told Panorama: ""These places don't have a very deep pool of experienced people. They're just people who say, well we trust the accountants, we trust the lawyers to tell us what's best for our island and we'll do it."" So how does offshore defend itself? Well, the jurisdictions say it's wrong to think there are banks in OFCs sitting on pots of gold - the money is simply being reinvested by companies - and that if there were no OFCs there would be no constraint on the tax rates governments might levy. OFCs, they say, simply pump cash around the globe and the new transparency rules put in place over the past decade have severely limited tax evasion. It's certainly wrong to lump all the OFCs together. Some are better regulated than others. Down at the murkier end,dealings in Panama were exposed by leaks last year. But Bermuda's Bob Richards offered a stout defence of its financial services in an interview with Panorama carried out while he was still finance minister, citing a taxation system that had been in place for more than 100 years and adding that if other nations were losing out on tax they should sort their own systems out. Bermuda, he says, has fully signed up to an international agreement that allows for the automatic transfer of tax information within governments and such a jurisdiction ""cannot be a tax haven"". And Appleby, the financial services firm involved in these latest leaks, made the case for OFCs back in 2009, in the wake of the global crash. This video can not be played Ex-Bermuda Finance Minister defends tax practices It said there was ""no evidence OFCs played any role in the economic crisis"",external,  OFCs were ""neither the source of - nor the destination for - criminal proceeds"" and that OFCs ""protect people victimised by crime, corruption, or persecution by shielding them from venal governments"". Of the latest leaks, the company said: ""Many of the questions raise matters where - on any view - there is plainly no conceivable wrongdoing on the part of Appleby whatsoever."" OFCs say there are no secrets, just privacy. But Gerard Ryle, of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which oversaw this huge leak of financial documents, known as theParadise Papers, dismisses this. ""The only product that the offshore world sells is secrecy and when you take away secrecy they don't have a product anymore,"" he told the BBC. ""Where you have secrecy, you have the potential for wrongdoing."" Whatever term you prefer, the elusive nature of offshore makes it hard to root out wrongdoing. You could start an investigation into one firm or individual and be shuttled around from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, company to company, turning up a whole tranche of names on documents that are linked to no real owner, sometimes no real person, and lead absolutely nowhere. You're probably also thinking, we've now had an awful lot of these financial leaks, haven't they changed anything? Spin backwards to April 2016. The Panama Papers have just come out. Iceland's PM Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson has resigned after the leaks showed he owned an offshore company with his wife. Thousands are demonstrating in Reykjavik to vent anger at their politicians. Some estimates put the protest numbers at 6% of the whole Icelandic population. That's like if 19 million people turned up to a protest in the US today. But then travel over to Elektrostal, two hours east of Moscow.Resident Nadezhda is haranguing BBC reporter Steve Rosenberg.""All these 'investigations' are a waste of time and money. We know what you're up to. They're trying to rub Putin's face in the dirt,"" she says. It kind of depends on where you are. Ragnar Hansson at the Iceland protest In the West, at least, people are questioning what high-net-worth individuals and multinationals can get away with. Is it right that they can use loopholes to keep more of their cash? Or should it go to governments to spend on their people? To be fair, governments have been tracking stashed cash since the 2008 global meltdown, independent of any financial leaks, although their talk has usually been tougher than their action. Secrecy is now harder to achieve, transparency is greater. So-calledcountry-by-country reporting, requiring multinationals to break down how they operate in different nations,external, has widened and public registries of companies have increased. Even Russia brought in a law requiring the disclosure of offshore assets. The result?Since the law came in three years ago, dozens of the super-rich have given up Russian residency to avoid it.,external There are also OFC blacklists mooted but, as Nicholas Shaxson says, the big players will make sure their operations are not on it and it will weed out only the minnows. The offshore firms will ""recalibrate"", he says. ""When legislation changes, you will have this ecosystem kind of readjusting and the money will shift to other places."" And wealth holders will readjust too. Pump cash into diamonds and artworks maybe? Or just go and actually live somewhere that charges low tax. What makes this a vicious circle is that many governments are fully prepared to sanction offshore finance. Indeed, many people in government use it, as these leaks show. And there is one thing we do know. If the super wealthy don't pay the taxes, the money has to come from everyone else. Which to many may sound a bit mad, but as the Cheshire Cat says: ""We're all mad here"".

"A best-selling author has recalled 20,000 copies of her new book, which used the term ""mongolism"" to describe Down's syndrome. Celebrity nutritionist Libby Weaver apologised and said she was ""mortified to have caused anyone any distress"". The Australian, who has written several bestselling books, said she had no idea the word was offensive and not correct. The term ""mongolism"" was used until the 1980s. The medical term now used is Down's Syndrome or Trisomy 21. Ms Weaver posted a video message on her website saying that she used the word in her latest book What Am I Supposed to Eat?, thinking it ""was a current medically used word"". ""It has since been brought to my attention it is a word that is used in a derogatory way and I am very, very sorry to have caused anyone any distress through this error, particularly children with Down Syndrome and their families,"" she said. The author, who is based in Australia and New Zealand, added that people who had already bought a copy the book could return it for a refund, local media reported. Teen with Down's syndrome's catwalk debut A world without Down's syndrome? ""The term mongolism is an outdated and offensive term which was used historically to refer to Down syndrome,"" Dr Ellen Skladzien of Down Syndrome Australia told the BBC. ""There has been consensus for many decades that this is not an appropriate term to describe people with Down syndrome,"" she explained. ""I am pleased to see that the book that utilised this inappropriate term has been withdrawn and that the author has apologised."" While most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes, people with Down's have an extra copy of chromosome 21, which means they develop differently and have varying levels of learning disability. Down's was first classified in the 1860s by British physician John Langdon Down, who used the term ""mongoloid"" for it. In recent decades, the term was replaced by Down's syndrome as it was considered derogatory and offensive.

"The area from Oxford Circus to near Selfridges could become traffic-free Large parts of London's Oxford Street could be pedestrianised by December 2018, under plans put forward by London Mayor Sadiq Khan. About half a mile of the street from Oxford Circus to Orchard Street could become a ""traffic-free pedestrian boulevard"", the mayor said. He said he hoped it would coincide with the arrival of theElizabeth Linein central London in December next year. More than four million people visit Oxford Street each week. All east-west traffic will be stopped but some north-south routes will be maintained, according to the plans. Older cars may have to pay extra London 'air pollution charge' London's Oxford Street bus routes cut by 40% Oxford Street to be pedestrianised by 2020 Some north-south traffic will be allowed Other proposals include: Raising the roads to pavement level to improve accessibility An 800m-long work of public art could be commissioned New and extended taxi ranks would be created close to Oxford Street Taxis would also still be able to cross Oxford Street at Duke Street, Stratford Place, Vere Street and Harewood Place Plans to transform the area east of Oxford Circus will be consulted on next spring A 800m-long work of public art could be commissioned for the length of the former road Cyclists would not be able to ride in the pedestrianised area but Transport for London said it would consult on plans to create ""new high-quality cycle routes"" to the north and south of Oxford Street. Mr Khan said: ""Oxford Street is world famous with millions of visitors every year, and in just over a year the iconic part of the street west of Oxford Circus could be transformed into a traffic-free pedestrian boulevard. ""Alongside the arrival of the Elizabeth Line, the Oxford Street area will be truly transformed over the coming years."" Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the New West End Company, said: ""After years of campaigning, it's excellent news finally to see commitment from our politicians to a game-changing transformation of Oxford Street."" Richard Massett, chairman of the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association said: ""The LTDA is disappointed by the proposals for Oxford Street that were presented today. ""A 24 hour vehicle ban presents a major threat to the West End as a whole. Forcing traffic onto neighbouring streets will merely shift congestion and pollution, all the while making it far harder to visit London's premier retail destination.""

"This video can not be played 'Queen should apologise,' suggests Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn has suggested the Queen, among others, should apologise for using overseas tax havens if they were used to avoid taxation in the UK. The Labour leader was asked at the CBI conference whether the Queen should say sorry for making overseas investments. He said anyone putting money into tax havens for the purposes of avoidance should ""not just apologise for it, recognise what it does to our society"". The BBC has revealed that the Queen's estate has used overseas tax havens. Paradise Papers: All you need to know Latest reaction to the Paradise Papers leak It comes after a leak of confidential papers from Bermuda revealed the secret offshore investments of the rich and famous, including the Queen. Mr Corbyn's spokesman later clarified his comments, saying the Labour leader did not specifically call on the Queen to apologise but thought ""anyone who puts money into a tax haven to avoid paying tax should acknowledge the damage it does to society"". This video can not be played The Queen's private estate invested Â£10m in offshore funds Mr Corbyn called for a full inquiry, public lists of company ownership, and a new tax enforcement unit to tackle tax evasion. On Sunday,BBC Panorama broadcastthe first results of its year-long investigation into theParadise Papers,external, a massive leak of financial documents from Bermuda-based law firm Appleby. The leaks raised questions overtech firm Apple's tax structures, the investments ofConservative Party donor Lord Ashcroft,Everton FC owner Farhad Moshiri,Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton, and offshore investments made on theQueen's behalf by the Duchy of Lancaster. Buckingham Palace has not commented on the revelation that the Duchy of Lancaster, which handles the Queen's private wealth, used offshore investments. A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster said: ""We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate. ""The Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income she receives from the Duchy."" HMRC chief executive Jon Thompson vowed to ""chase down"" anyone trying to hide money offshore and evade tax. He told the Commons Public Accounts Committee that HMRC had asked to see the leaked Paradise Papers in order to ""look at every case of tax evasion very seriously"". Mr Thompson said there were 66 ongoing criminal investigations into thePanama Papers, which in April 2016 exposed tax avoidance and evasion, saying Â£100m could be retrieved. ""That gives you some sense about how long quite complicated tax cases take to bring to some sort of fruition,"" he added. This video can not be played Theresa May: 'UK already acting' on offshore tax havens Theresa May insisted efforts were already under way to obtain revenue from offshore tax vehicles, adding: ""We want people to pay the tax that is due"". At the CBI conference, the prime minister said HMRC had collected Â£160bn by tackling tax avoidance, evasion and non-compliance since 2010. Mrs May's spokesperson said: ""It is important to point out that holding investments offshore is not an automatic sign of wrongdoing, but HMRC has requested to see the papers urgently so it can look into any allegations."" But when asked, Mrs May did not commit to a public inquiry into tax revenue lost through offshore tax avoidance schemes. Among the Paradise Papers documents was evidence that Tory donorLord Ashcroftremained a non-dom and continued to avoid tax despite attempts to make peers pay their full share. Lord Ashcroft has insisted he did not ignore rules in relation to the Punta Gorda offshore trust and said  his tax residency was ""publicly available information"". The leaked documents show that between 2000 and 2010, Lord Ashcroft received payments of around $200m (Â£150m) from his offshore trust in Bermuda. Responding,externalto the programme, Lord Ashcroft wrote: ""At no point has it been suggested directly to me, or through others, that I have taken any inappropriate action."" He also explained why he ran away from a Panorama reporter who approached him for comment, taking refuge in a toilet, saying he was ""determined"" not to ""fall victim to their ambush"". This video can not be played Watch Lord Ashcroft try to avoid Richard Biltonâs questions about his offshore trust The Paradise Papers puts into question the practice of using highly secretive offshore tax havens, which is legal. Bermuda's premier David Burt said the territory has a ""robust regulatory regime"" with the same tax system in place since 1898. He added the UK's tax law allows the use of offshore tax havens. Former Business Secretary, Sir Vince Cable, criticised the government for not clamping down on offshore tax havens trading under the British flag.

"The leaks show about Â£10m of the Queen's private money was invested offshore A huge new leak of financial documents has revealed how the powerful and ultra-wealthy, including the Queen's private estate, secretly invest vast amounts of cash in offshore tax havens. Donald Trump's commerce secretary is shown to have a stake in a firm dealing with Russians sanctioned by the US. The leak, dubbed theParadise Papers, contains 13.4m documents, mostly from one leading firm in offshore finance. BBC Panorama is part of nearly 100 media groups investigating the papers. Follow live updates As with last year's Panama Papers leak, the documents were obtained by the German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,external, which called in theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,external(ICIJ) to oversee the investigation. TheGuardian,externalis also among the organisations investigating the documents. Sunday's revelations form only a small part of a week of disclosures that will expose the tax and financial affairs of some of the hundreds of people and companies named in the data, some with strong UK connections. Many of the stories focus on how politicians, multinationals, celebrities and high-net-worth individuals use complex structures of trusts, foundations and shell companies to protect their cash from tax officials or hide their dealings behind a veil of secrecy. This video can not be played Paradise Papers: How to hide your cash offshore The vast majority of the transactions involve no legal wrongdoing. Other key stories released on Sunday were: A key aide of Canada's PM has been linked to offshore schemes that may have cost the nation millions of dollars in taxes, threatening to embarrass Justin Trudeau, who has campaigned to shut tax havens.Read the full story here Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative party deputy chairman and a significant donor, may have ignored rules around how his offshore investments were managed.Read the full story hereOther papers suggest he retained his non-dom status while in the House of Lords, despite reports he had become a permanent tax resident in the UK.Read the full story here How questions were raised about the funding of a major shareholding in Everton FC.Read the full story here An oligarch with close links to the Kremlin, Alisher Usmanov, may have secretly taken ownership of a company responsible for anti-money laundering checks on Russian cash.Read the full story here The other media partners may be covering different stories affecting their regions. The Paradise Papers show that about Â£10m ($13m) of the Queen's private money was invested offshore. It was put into funds in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda by the Duchy of Lancaster, which provides the Queen with an income and handles investments for her Â£500m private estate. There is nothing illegal in the investments and no suggestion that the Queen is avoiding tax, but questions may be asked about whether the monarch should be investing offshore. There were small investments in the rent-to-buy retailer BrightHouse, which has been accused of exploiting the poor, and the Threshers chain of off-licences, which later went bust owing Â£17.5m in tax and costing almost 6,000 people their jobs. The Queen's private estate had a very small investment in the retailer BrightHouse The Duchy said it was not involved in decisions made by funds and there is no suggestion the Queen had any knowledge of the specific investments made on her behalf. The Duchy has in the past said it gives ""ongoing consideration regarding any of its acts or omissions that could adversely impact the reputation"" of the Queen, who it says takes ""a keen interest"" in the estate. The BBC's royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell says it is extraordinary and puzzling that the Queen's advisers could have felt that it was appropriate - for somebody whose reputation is based so much on setting a good example - to invest in these offshore funds. Questions will now be being asked inside Buckingham Palace about how that decision was made, he added. Read the full story here Wilbur Ross helped stave off bankruptcy for Donald Trump in the 1990s and was later appointed commerce secretary in Mr Trump's administration. The documents reveal Mr Ross has retained an interest in a shipping company which earns millions of dollars a year transporting oil and gas for a Russian energy firm whose shareholders include Vladimir Putin's son-in-law and two men subject to US sanctions. It will again raise questions about the Russian connections of Donald Trump's team. His presidency has been dogged by allegations that Russians colluded to try to influence the outcome of last year's US election. He has called the allegations ""fake news"". Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal has called for an investigation,telling NBC News that Mr Ross had given Congress the impression,externalhe no longer held shares in the shipping company. ""Our committee was misled, the American people were misled by the concealment of those companies."" Read the full story here Opposition politicians have said thegovernment must stop ""dragging its feet""and curb the use of offshore tax havens, and Labour Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has called for a public inquiry. But at the CBI conference on Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May did not commit to a public inquiry. She also did not directly answer when asked whether she would insist on British overseas territories publishing a list of who owns companies and trusts registered in crown dependencies. She said the UK government was working with its dependences ""to ensure we're seeing greater transparency."" Most of the data comes from a company called Appleby, a Bermuda-founded legal services provider at the top end of the offshore industry, helping clients set up in overseas jurisdictions with low or zero tax rates. Its documents, and others mainly from corporate registries in Caribbean jurisdictions, were obtained by SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung. It has not revealed the source. The media partners say the investigation is in the public interest because data leaks from the world of offshore have repeatedly exposed wrongdoing. In response to the leaks, Appleby said it was ""satisfied that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, either on the part of ourselves or our clients"", adding: ""We do not tolerate illegal behaviour.""Read the Appleby story here Essentially it's about a place outside of your own nation's regulations to which companies or individuals can reroute money, assets or profits to take advantage of lower taxes. These jurisdictions are known as tax havens to the layman, or the more stately offshore financial centres (OFCs) to the industry. They are generally stable, secretive and reliable, often small islands but not exclusively so, and can vary on how rigorously they carry out checks on wrongdoing. The UK is a big player here, not simply because so many of its overseas territories and Crown dependencies are OFCs, but many of the lawyers, accountants and bankers working in the offshore industry are in the City of London. It's also about the mega-rich. Brooke Harrington, author of Capital Without Borders: Wealth Managers and the One Percent, says offshore finance is not for the 1% but the .001%. Assets of around $500,000 (Â£380,000) would just not meet the offshore fees the schemes would need, she says. Are we taming offshore? Well, it is a lot of cash. The Boston Consulting Group says $10tn is held offshore. That's about the equivalent of the gross domestic products of the UK, Japan and France - combined. It may also be a conservative estimate. This video can not be played Labour MP Meg Hillier: âIf offshore wasnât secret then this stuff couldnât happenâ Critics of offshore say it is mainly about secrecy - which opens the door to wrongdoing - and inequality. They also say the action of governments to curb it has often been slow and ineffective. Brooke Harrington says if the rich are avoiding tax, the poor pick up the bill: ""There's a minimal amount the governments need to function and they recoup what they lose from the rich and from corporations by taking it out of our hides."" Meg Hillier, UK Labour MP and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, told Panorama: ""We need to see what's going offshore; if offshore was not secret then some of this stuff just couldn't happen... we need transparency and we need sunlight shone on this."" Your guide to a history of financial leaks The offshore financial centres say that if they did not exist, there would be no constraint on taxes governments might levy. They say they do not sit on hoards of cash, but act as agents that help pump money around the globe. This video can not be played Ex-Bermuda Finance Minister defends tax practices Bob Richards, who was Bermuda's finance minister when Panorama interviewed him for its programme, said it was not up to him to collect other nations' taxes and that they should sort themselves out. Both he and Howard Quayle, the chief minister for the Isle of Man, who was also interviewed for Panorama and whose Crown dependency plays a big part in the leaks, denied their jurisdictions could even be considered tax havens as they were well regulated and fully conformed to international financial reporting rules.

"The Uzbek-born billionaire is a major client of Bridgewaters An oligarch with close links to the Kremlin may have secretly taken ownership of a company responsible for anti-money laundering checks on Russian cash, theParadise Papersshow. Isle of Man-based Bridgewaters should conduct independent due diligence tests on firms it administers, including dozens linked to Alisher Usmanov. If he owns or controls the firm it would be a clear conflict of interest. He and Bridgewaters strongly deny it is owned or controlled by the Russian. Bridgewaters has been involved in major deals involving Russian cash, including the purchase of significant stakes in Facebook. The Uzbek-born billionaire is a major client of Bridgewaters and if he does own or control the company it could be carrying out financial checks on Mr Usmanov's own offshore business activities. Some of Mr Usmanov's $15.8bn (Â£9.97bn) fortune is in a private trust company called Bordeaux Limited. Bordeaux used to be managed by offshore law company Appleby, the source of much of the Paradise Papers leaks, but in 2011 the private trust's management was transferred toBridgewaters,external. An internal Appleby email from 2011 uncovered in the Paradise Papers about the transfer of Mr Usmanov's Bordeaux private trust states that ""the client has now bought a trust company in the Isle of Man (called Bridgewaters)"". Company filings show Mr Usmanov's business associate, Matthias Bolliger, was a director of Bridgewaters from 2011 to 2015. And a leaked 2015 document from the Paradise Papers lists Mr Bolliger as ""an ultimate beneficial official owner"" of the company. Author and taxation expert Nicholas Shaxson told BBC Panorama: ""These companies are supposed to have due diligence requirements to look at what their clients are doing and make sure that this is not criminal money. ""If the billionaire controls the company that's supposed to be doing the due diligence on his own stuff it's a massive conflict of interest."" Lawyers acting for Bridgewaters told BBC Panorama that their client was not secretly owned or controlled by any individual. The lawyers, who also act for Mr Bolliger, said he had never controlled Bridgewaters on behalf of any other individual and would be unable to do so as Bridgewaters was a regulated Isle of Man financial services company with a board of directors. Chief Minister for the Isle of Man Howard Quayle told Panorama he could not comment on individual cases but if there was evidence Mr Usmanov was approving his own deals ""we will have it thoroughly investigated and if there has been any wrongdoing whatsoever, we will take the relevant action. Whether that's a prosecution or withdrawal of right to operate on the Isle of Man"". Other revelations in the Paradise Papers have questioned whether Mr Usmanov may be secretly linked with both Arsenal and Everton in a way which if true could be a breach of Premier League rules. Mr Usmanov's business partner Farhad Moshiri bought a 49.9% stake in Everton. The Everton deal was administered by Bridgewaters. The company that owns Everton, Blue Heaven Holdings, is registered at Bridgewaters. One of its directors is an employee of Bridgewaters and the other is an employee of Mr Usmanov. Panorama has also seen a list of dozens of British Virgin Islands (BVI) companies linked to Mr Usmanov that are managed by Bridgewaters. Under anti-money laundering rules the true, or beneficial, owners of companies should be disclosed. However, the ownership details of most of the companies on the list remain hidden. The Panamanian law firm, Mossack Fonseca, often known as Mossfon and which was the source of last year's Panama Papers leaks, acted as an agent for Bridgewaters and was clearly frustrated by the lack of information it was getting about Mr Usmanov's companies. One Mossfon email says: ""The answers on the incorporation forms are ambiguous normally, given in a manner that can be interpreted in various ways. They are trying to give information without giving it if you know what I mean... now they have raised a bit of suspicion."" After Mossfon raised questions about compliance, Bridgewaters transferred most of its BVI companies to another financial services company, SHRM Trustees, in February 2015.

"Ian Squire was kidnapped in southern Nigeria in October A British aid worker kidnapped last month in southern Nigeria has been killed, while three other hostages have been freed, says the Foreign Office. Ian Squire, an optician, was one of four Britons working for a medical charity in the Niger Delta when taken. Suspected militants stormed the rural communityof Enekorogha on 13 October. UK and Nigerian authorities successfully negotiated the release of Alanna Carson, David Donovan and Shirley Donovan. BBC Lagos correspondent Stephanie Hegarty said there was little detail around Mr Squire's death, but that locals told her the kidnappers were a criminal gang who had been operating in the area for around a year. Our correspondent said: ""This is their first kidnapping of foreigners. They had kidnapped very recently the mother of a local politician, but before that they were just carrying out petty crime. ""We know that a ransom was demanded but we don't know if it was paid."" According to reports, Dr and Mrs Donovan have lived in Nigeria for the past 14 years, running a Christian charity called New Foundations, which gives aid to remote villages in the Niger Delta.

Mr Squire's friend Paul Allan, who ran a neighbouring business, described him as a ""good friend"" and a ""very straight forward, nice, gentle guy"". He described how Mr Squire fundraised in the community for his trips and even collected old glasses to take and reuse. ""I just can't believe what's happened,"" added Mr Allan. ""I find it shocking to believe for someone who has gone out to do good in the community overseas that the action has cost him dearly. It has cost him his life. It is beyond belief. ""It is a sign of this day and age, but he wasn't concerned about that. He just wanted to go out and help people in less fortunate situations than ours."" Ms Carson, a Specsavers optometrist, is now staying with her family in Northern Ireland, according to her employer in Leven, Fife. Relatives of the four said they were ""delighted and relieved"" that Ms Carson and Dr and Mrs Donovan had returned safely.

"A 24-hour service has been launched for NHS patients, offering GP consultations via videolink on smartphones. The pilot scheme will initially cover 3.5 million patients in greater London. Patients will be able to check their symptoms through the mobile app and then have video consultations within two hours of booking. The Royal College of GPs has warned the service may not help patients with complex needs. The new free service has been launched by a group of London GPs and the online healthcare provider Babylon. Patients joining will leave their existing practice, with their records transferred to a group of five central London surgeries. Dr Mobasher Butt, who is part of the team behind the GP at Hand service, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's high time that NHS patients were given the opportunity to benefit from technology to improve access to healthcare. ""We've benefited from this kind of technology in so many different aspects of our lives, whether that be shopping or banking, and it's really time that we were able to do that in healthcare for NHS patients."" Jane Barnacle, director of patients and information at NHS England London, said GP practices were right to carefully test innovative new technologies that could improve free NHS services for their patients while also freeing up staff time. But the Royal College of GPs is concerned the new service might only work for younger healthier commuters and not those with complex health conditions. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the RCPG, said: ""We are really worried that schemes like this are creating a twin-track approach to NHS general practice and that patients are being 'cherry-picked', which could actually increase the pressures on traditional GPs based in the community. ""We understand that with increasingly long waiting times to see a GP, an online service is convenient and appealing, but older patients and those living with more complex needs want continuity of care and the security of their local practice where their GPs know them. ""We notice there is an extensive list of patient conditions such as frailty, pregnancy and mental health conditions that are the essence of general practice and which GPs deal with every day, but which are not eligible for this service. ""We are also concerned that patients are being given the option of switching back to their local surgery if they are not satisfied with the level of service offered by the app. ""As well as issues with patient confidentiality and the safety of the patient record, it is hard to see how this could be achieved without adding to the huge burden of red tape that GPs are already grappling with. ""While this scheme is backed by the NHS and offers a free service to patients, it is undoubtedly luring GPs away from front-line general practice at a time when we are facing a severe workforce crisis and hardworking GPs are struggling to cope with immense workloads."" Dr Richard Vautrey from the British Medical Association said: ""This approach risks undermining the quality and continuity of care and further fragmenting the service provided to the public.""

"Stephen Bronfman (left) is a key aide of Justin Trudeau A key aide of Canada's PM is linked to offshore schemes that may have cost the nation millions of dollars in taxes, theParadise Papersshow. The revelations may embarrass Justin Trudeau, who has campaigned against tax havens. The leaks pose questions about the actions of Stephen Bronfman, chief fundraiser for Mr Trudeau's Liberal Party as well as ex-senator Leo Kolber. Lawyers for them said no deals had tried to evade tax and all were legal. Canadian broadcaster,CBC,external, and theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),externalhave been spearheading this investigation as part of the Paradise Papers leaks. They said a trove of documents found in the files of Appleby, the offshore law firm that is the main source of the leaks, suggested that Mr Bronfman's investment firm, Claridge, had for more than 20 years moved millions offshore for the Kolber family. Stephen Bronfman is not only a key aide to Mr Trudeau, he is a close friend and was central to his rise to power. He helped raise cash for Mr Trudeau's party leadership battle in 2013 and was then asked to turn around the Liberal Party's financial fortunes. The key revelations in the Paradise Papers concern a Cayman Islands trust which Claridge runs for Leo Kolber. Mr Kolber, a retired senator originally appointed by Mr Trudeau's father, Pierre, was the chief Liberal Party fundraiser for many years, earning the nickname ""Bagman"". He has had longstanding links with the Bronfman family - one of Canada's most illustrious - and is Stephen's godfather. Mr Kolber's home was used in September last year for a Liberal Party fundraising event co-hosted by Stephen Bronfman. Stephen Bronfman (right) with his father Charles The Bronfmans are one of Canada's most illustrious families. Samuel Bronfman, Stephen's grandfather, founded Seagram, once the largest alcohol distiller in the world. Samuel's son Charles - Stephen's father - is worth an estimated $2.3bn, while Stephen's cousin Edgar Jr engineered the disastrous sale of Seagram to Vivendi in 2000, losing the family billions. Stephen, born in 1963, took over the private equity firm Claridge, of which he is still executive chairman, in 1997 and initially kept a lower profile. In 2013, Justin Trudeau turned to him to raise money for his Liberal Party leadership bid. After winning, Mr Trudeau asked him to turn around the party's financial fortunes. Mr Bronfman has said Mr Trudeau is ""very, very saleable"". In March 2016, he joined Mr Trudeau on his first state visit as PM - to President Barack Obama. The Liberal Party told CBC and the ICIJ that Mr Bronfman's role was as a volunteer on its National Board and that although it was grateful for his contribution, his role was non-voting and did not involve policy decisions. The document trail raises significant questions about activities surrounding the Kolber Trust, which was set up in 1991 in the Cayman Islands, with Mr Kolber's son, Jonathan, and his ""legitimate issue"" as its beneficiaries. Millions of dollars were transferred into the Claridge-run trust, much of it in loans from the Bronfman family. The leaked documents show some of the Bronfman loans were made without interest, which many tax officials see as a red flag suggesting possible tax avoidance. In one case, the ICIJ found a C$4.1m ($3.1m) loan from a US-based Bronfman trust to the Kolber Trust that it says would appear to have required interest payment under US law. Leo Kolber was a former Liberal Party fundraiser who earned the nickname ""Bagman"" Jonathan Kolber's investment adviser tells Mr Kolber that if he pays the interest, Claridge will find a way to ""make him whole"", suggesting Mr Kolber send the company an invoice for unspecified ""services rendered"" in exactly the same amount. Tax expert Marwah Rizqy told CBC this was the ""smoking gun"" because, if true, ""that means it's not a real debt"". However, lawyers for Mr Kolber and Mr Bronfman told the ICIJ that ""non-interest bearing loans by a US person do not violate US law. Rather, in certain circumstances, there is a deemed interest concept"". This is a complex concept that deals with interest on a loan that is deemed to have been received even though it has not. It usually involves a profits adjustment made by tax authorities in the lender's country. Another question that was raised concerns the nature of trusts. One fundamental rule is that decisions about them are made by trustees offshore. Tax experts told CBC that if too many decisions were being made in Canada, tax authorities there would question the offshore nature of the trust and it could be liable for taxes dating back to its foundation. CBC said it had found a number of instances of attempts to reduce the Canada link. One document says an invoice to Montreal-based investment adviser Don Chazan ""should be treated as personal expenses and not expenses of the trusts... This results in one less formal link between the trusts and entities outside Cayman"". When earlier interviewed by CBC about who ran the Kolber Trust, Jonathan Kolber had said that Mr Chazan was ""the adviser. He's the guy who made the decisions"". However, the Kolber and Bronfman lawyers told the ICIJ that the Kolber Trust was run from the Cayman islands and that Mr Chazan ""was certainly never the directing mind of the Trust"". Another trail concerns Lynn Kolber Halliday, Jonathan's sister and another Kolber Trust beneficiary. As a US citizen the money sent to her could trigger taxes. Her name was later taken off the trust. She would ""be taken care of in other ways than through the trust"", one document reads. The Israel-based Jonathan ""will arrange to make gifts to her instead of the trust making the present distributions to her"". The Kolber and Bronfman lawyers told the ICIJ: ""Personal gifts are a customary mode of financial assistance."" They added that ""none of the transactions or entities at issue were effected or established to evade or even avoid taxation"" and that they ""were always in full conformity with all applicable laws and requirements"". Any tax avoidance would reflect badly on a party that has set out its stall on preventing it and on fair taxation. Back in March, Mr Trudeau had vowed to do a ""better job of getting tax avoiders"". He was responding to a CBC/Radio-Canada investigation that showed a number of wealthy Canadians were apparently linked to shell companies on the Isle of Man. ""It is absolutely unacceptable that there be people not paying their fair share of taxes,"" he said. ""It's something we continue to take very, very seriously.""

"This video can not be played 'Queen should apologise,' suggests Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn has suggested the Queen, among others, should apologise for using overseas tax havens if they were used to avoid taxation in the UK. The Labour leader was asked at the CBI conference whether the Queen should say sorry for making overseas investments. He said anyone putting money into tax havens for the purposes of avoidance should ""not just apologise for it, recognise what it does to our society"". The BBC has revealed that the Queen's estate has used overseas tax havens. Paradise Papers: All you need to know Latest reaction to the Paradise Papers leak It comes after a leak of confidential papers from Bermuda revealed the secret offshore investments of the rich and famous, including the Queen. Mr Corbyn's spokesman later clarified his comments, saying the Labour leader did not specifically call on the Queen to apologise but thought ""anyone who puts money into a tax haven to avoid paying tax should acknowledge the damage it does to society"". This video can not be played The Queen's private estate invested Â£10m in offshore funds Mr Corbyn called for a full inquiry, public lists of company ownership, and a new tax enforcement unit to tackle tax evasion. On Sunday,BBC Panorama broadcastthe first results of its year-long investigation into theParadise Papers,external, a massive leak of financial documents from Bermuda-based law firm Appleby. The leaks raised questions overtech firm Apple's tax structures, the investments ofConservative Party donor Lord Ashcroft,Everton FC owner Farhad Moshiri,Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton, and offshore investments made on theQueen's behalf by the Duchy of Lancaster. Buckingham Palace has not commented on the revelation that the Duchy of Lancaster, which handles the Queen's private wealth, used offshore investments. A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster said: ""We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate. ""The Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income she receives from the Duchy."" HMRC chief executive Jon Thompson vowed to ""chase down"" anyone trying to hide money offshore and evade tax. He told the Commons Public Accounts Committee that HMRC had asked to see the leaked Paradise Papers in order to ""look at every case of tax evasion very seriously"". Mr Thompson said there were 66 ongoing criminal investigations into thePanama Papers, which in April 2016 exposed tax avoidance and evasion, saying Â£100m could be retrieved. ""That gives you some sense about how long quite complicated tax cases take to bring to some sort of fruition,"" he added. This video can not be played Theresa May: 'UK already acting' on offshore tax havens Theresa May insisted efforts were already under way to obtain revenue from offshore tax vehicles, adding: ""We want people to pay the tax that is due"". At the CBI conference, the prime minister said HMRC had collected Â£160bn by tackling tax avoidance, evasion and non-compliance since 2010. Mrs May's spokesperson said: ""It is important to point out that holding investments offshore is not an automatic sign of wrongdoing, but HMRC has requested to see the papers urgently so it can look into any allegations."" But when asked, Mrs May did not commit to a public inquiry into tax revenue lost through offshore tax avoidance schemes. Among the Paradise Papers documents was evidence that Tory donorLord Ashcroftremained a non-dom and continued to avoid tax despite attempts to make peers pay their full share. Lord Ashcroft has insisted he did not ignore rules in relation to the Punta Gorda offshore trust and said  his tax residency was ""publicly available information"". The leaked documents show that between 2000 and 2010, Lord Ashcroft received payments of around $200m (Â£150m) from his offshore trust in Bermuda. Responding,externalto the programme, Lord Ashcroft wrote: ""At no point has it been suggested directly to me, or through others, that I have taken any inappropriate action."" He also explained why he ran away from a Panorama reporter who approached him for comment, taking refuge in a toilet, saying he was ""determined"" not to ""fall victim to their ambush"". This video can not be played Watch Lord Ashcroft try to avoid Richard Biltonâs questions about his offshore trust The Paradise Papers puts into question the practice of using highly secretive offshore tax havens, which is legal. Bermuda's premier David Burt said the territory has a ""robust regulatory regime"" with the same tax system in place since 1898. He added the UK's tax law allows the use of offshore tax havens. Former Business Secretary, Sir Vince Cable, criticised the government for not clamping down on offshore tax havens trading under the British flag. He said: ""The Paradise Papers suggest that a small number of wealthy individuals have been able, entirely legally, to put their money beyond the reach of the Exchequer.""

"Many homes have been targeted in racist, sectarian or paramilitary attacks More than 2,000 housing intimidation cases - where people were forced out of home by threats - have been acted upon by the Housing Executive since 2012. It spent Â£7m re-housing people forced out by paramilitary threats, sectarian, racist or homophobic intimidation or anti-social behaviour. But only 32 convictions were secured from 2011 to 2016 for the offence of intimidating victims from their homes. The figures have been compiled bythe investigative news website, The Detail,external. The website reported that during the financial years April 2012 to April 2017, the Housing Executive received more than 3,000 complaints of housing intimidation. The publicly funded housing body ""accepted"" a total of 2,060 cases but rejected about 1,000 of the complaints. The Detail said the ""overwhelming majority"" of the accepted cases were in eastern parts of Northern Ireland, including Belfast; Lisburn and Castlereagh; Ards and North Down and the Antrim and Newtownabbey council areas. Paramilitary threats account for most of the forced evictions The Housing Executive agreed to buy 57 properties from homeowners who were forced to flee, at a total cost of more than Â£6.7m. The sales are processed through the Scheme for the Purchase of Evacuated Dwellings (SPED). The housing body also paid emergency accommodation grants to more than 1,000 tenants who fled from rented homes, which meant an additional bill of more than Â£800,000. Almost three quarters (1,523) of the accepted complaints related to paramilitary intimidation. A significant number (222) of householders fled due to what was described as ""anti-social behaviour"". Sectarian intimation forced 153 people from their homes and racism was cited as the motive in 112 cases. The issue of housing intimidation hit the headlines in September, whenfour Catholic families fled their homes in Belfast's Cantrell Close. Cantrell Close was built under a shared housing initiative, in a bid to bring communities together PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said the victims had been forced to leave their homes ""because of their community background, because of their religion"". He said detectives believed members of the loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), had issued the threats. In recent years, PSNI officers have also been the victims of housing intimidation. In June, the BBC's Nolan Show reported thatevery year, an average of 16 police officers either move home or have special security measures installeddue to threats. Deputy Ch Constable Drew Harris told the programme: ""We could expect, every month, one or two officers to be in the position where they're having to move home."" The Detail asked the PSNI for its figures on the number of arrests and charges for housing intimidation over the past five years. The PSNI refused the request on the grounds of how much it would cost to compile the figures. The conviction statistics - 32 between March 2011 and August 2016 - are therefore based on figures obtained from the Northern Ireland Court Service.

"This video can not be played Warning signs of a potential mass shooter In the course of a short and troubled life, Devin Patrick Kelley,the gunman who killed 26 peopleand wounded 20 more at a Texas church on Sunday, beat his wife and infant stepson, was court martialled, and escaped a mental health clinic. Kelley, who was 26 when he killed himself, moments after the shooting, began military service with the US Air Force in 2010 and served in its logistical readiness department based at Holloman air force base in New Mexico. In 2012, two years into his military career, he came up before a court-martial for the assault on his wife and stepson - the young boy's skull was reportedly fractured - and was sentenced to a year's confinement and demoted in rank. Later that year he escaped from a mental health clinic in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, before being caught, according to a local police report. The report stated that he had attempted to sneak weapons onto the air base and ""carry out death threats"" against his chain of command. America's gun culture in 10 charts In pictures: Texas church shooting Kelley's first wife, Tessa, divorced him during his confinement, according to reports. He was released in 2013 and finally left the military in 2014 with a ""bad conduct"" discharge. He remarried in April 2014 to Danielle Shields. Law enforcement officials described the couple as estranged, the New York Times reported. Police have said that the shooting may have followed an argument between Kelley and Ms Shield's mother, Michelle, who worshipped at the church. Michelle Shields was not present during the shooting, at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, but her mother, Lula White, was killed in the hail of bullets, according to relatives' Facebook posts and interviews with the New York Daily News. Kelley fired many times inside the small church, clad in black tactical style clothing and using a military-style rifle. His victims ranged in age from from 5 to 72, authorities said. According to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Kelley was denied a permit for a gun by the state of Texas and should not have legally been allowed to own a firearm. Mr Abbott said it was important to ascertain how Kelley ""slipped through the crack"" in acquiring an assault rifle, given that he was ""a powder keg waiting to go off"". The killer's fragile mental state was likely worsened by his volatile relationship with his mother-in-law, who had received threatening text messages from him shortly before the shooting. Kelley's now-deleted Facebook page featured a photo of what appeared to be an assault rifle and a Mark Twain quote: ""I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it."" The suspect's LinkedIn page,externallists the causes he cares about, said to include animal welfare, arts and culture, children and civil rights. He describes himself as a ""hard working, dedicated person"" who has a high school diploma and is a ""management consultant"". A series of legal troubles began in 2012 when he was court-martialled and sentenced to a year in military prison for assaulting his wife and child In the same year Tessa Kelley filed court papers to divorce Kelley, with her wish being speedily granted. There were no children listed in the proceedings After his jail term ended in 2014, Kelley was demoted in rank and released from the military with a bad conduct discharge In August 2014 he again appeared in court - this time charged with mistreating, neglecting or being cruel to animals. The case was eventually dismissed Source: Washington Post,external It is not yet clear if Kelley had a specific grudge against the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs Kelley grew up in New Braunfels - about 35 miles (56km) north of Sutherland Springs - in the $1m home of his parents, the New York Times says. It was there that he was accused of assaulting his wife and stepson. He remarried in 2014. After leaving the military, Kelley worked for just over five weeks as a security guard for an amusement park in New Braunfels owned by the Schlitterbahn company. ""His employment was terminated in July,"" the company said in a statement. He was ""a seasonal unarmed night security guard"" Schlitterbahn said, and had passed a criminal background check. Some reports say that he lived for a while in a caravan park in a rural area. At night-timehe could be heard firing weapons, US media report.,external He is described as a loner with a number of minor traffic offences who posted about atheism online after giving up his role as a teacher in summer Bible classes. The latest mass killing has devastated the small community of people in Sutherland Springs Two former girlfriendstold NBC News,externalthat Kelley's behaviour had become ""disturbing - even violent"" after they broke up with him. ""Years after dating me he would try to bribe me to hang out with him,"" Katy Landry told the channel in a Facebook message. ""He ended up assaulting me. He would stalk me by repeatedly calling me - even prank calling me saying really weird stuff."" The small town where everyone knows a victim Another woman, Brittany Adcock, 22,said Kelley pressured her into having sex when she was 13,externaland he was 18. She told NBC he had continued to pester and harass her when she finished with him after two months. US officials say there is no evidence to suggest Kelley was linked to organised terrorists.

"This video can not be played Matthew Scully-Hicks made a 999 call two months before Elsie died claiming she fell down stairs A man has been found guilty of murdering his 18-month-old baby just two weeks after formally adopting her. Matthew Scully-Hicks, 31, of Delabole, Cornwall, had denied inflicting catastrophic injuries on Elsie at his Cardiff home four days before she died. He called 999 on 25 May 2016 claiming he had found her unresponsive on the floor but a jury unanimously rejected his claim. A pathologist said her injuries were""very typical""of a shaken baby. Baby Elsie's catalogue of injuries 999 call made four days before Elsie died Killer's 999 call two months before death Scully-Hicks will be sentenced on Tuesday and achild practice review,externalis now expected to take place which will investigate the role of agencies in the case and look at whether lessons can be learned to prevent future tragedies. Pathologist Dr Stephen Leadbetter told the trial Elsie's injuries were consistent with ""shaking impact syndrome"". He said she died after suffering a ""blunt head injury"", which triggered a cardiac arrest and starved her organs of blood. A CT scan showed she hadbleeding on the brainand a post-mortem examination revealed she had also suffered broken ribs, a fractured left femur and a fractured skull. There was alsohaemorrhaging within both of Elsie's retinas- associated with inflicted trauma or injury. In the months before her death, Scully-Hicks had told his husband and a health visitor a bruise on Elsie's face and leg fracture were caused by falls around the house. This video can not be played Scully-Hicks called 999 to say Elsie was not breathing But a doctor who examined Elsie after her death said his account was inconsistent with her injuries. Less than three months before she died Scully-Hicks called 999 and said Elsie hadfallen down the stairsafter a wooden stair gate accidentally opened when she pulled herself up on it. On 25 May, Scully-Hicks was on the phone to the emergency services again. This time he said he had changed Elsie's nappy in the living room, left the room before returning minutes later to find her unresponsive on the floor. He told the court: ""I got closer and called her, there was no response. I got down and gave her a gentle tap and there was no response at all so I picked up the phone and called for an ambulance."" He said he carried out CPR until a police officer arrived and took over and she was rushed to hospital. Elsie died at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff, on 29 May 2016 after doctors determined she could not be saved and her ventilator was switched off. During the trial, the jury was told Scully-Hicks had sent his husband Craig text messages saying he was ""struggling to cope"" and describing Elsie as""Satan in a babygro""and a ""psycho"". Neighbours told the court they heard Scully-Hicks raise his voice andswear at the the baby. The court heard Scully-Hicks who remained emotionless as the jury gave its unanimous verdict, did not suffer from a psychiatric illness or personality disorder. A jury unanimously found Matthew Scully-Hicks guilty of murdering 18-month-old Elsie Prosecutor Paul Lewis QC, said: ""[Scully-Hicks'] actions on the late afternoon of 25 May were the tragic culmination of a course of violent conduct on his part towards a defenceless child - an infant that he should have loved and protected, but whom he instead assaulted, abused, and ultimately murdered."" Following the unanimous verdict, Iwan Jenkins, from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""There were complicating factors in that the only two people who knew what happened in the months leading up to the incident which resulted in her hospitalisation were the defendant and the victim herself."" He said evidence from medical experts had been ""crucial"" to the case, adding the analysis of Elsie's injuries were ""vital to show explanations provided by the defendant were not true and were inconsistent"". He added: ""There are no winners in cases of murder."" A National Adoption Service spokesman said it was a ""tragic and extremely rare case"". Det Ch Insp Stuart Wales, of South Wales Police's major crime investigation team, said Elsie's ""untimely death"" has had a ""devastating effect first and foremost on her family"". ""Elsie's death has also impacted a wider community, including the many professionals involved in her care and the subsequent investigation. I would like to thank all of them, including the many witnesses who assisted the prosecution,"" he said. ""This case represents an extremely rare and distressing set of circumstances. We at South Wales Police continue to respect and value the role that adoption, and those involved, play in our society.""

"Catalan independence supporters protested outside the prosecutor's office in Brussels Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and four former ministers have been freed with conditions by an investigating judge in Belgium. The judge said they could not leave the country without permission and had to give details of their accommodation. They had handed themselves in to Belgian police following an EU arrest warrant issued by a Spanish judge. Mr Puigdemont fled to Belgium after Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia following an independence declaration. He has said he will not return to Spain unless he is guaranteed a fair trial. The five are wanted in Spain to face charges including rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Mr Puigdemont could be seen inside the public prosecutor's office in Brussels They are now expected to appear in court in Belgium within 15 days. Belgium has a maximum of 60 days to return the five to Spain but, if they do not raise legal objections, a transfer could happen much sooner. Catalonia's longest week The man who wants to break up Spain Catalonia crisis: What next for Spain? ""The request made this afternoon by the Brussels' Prosecutor's Office for the provisional release of all persons sought has been granted by the investigative judge,"" said a statement by the Belgian prosecutor's office. This video can not be played In Catalonia, this small town is divided over independence Mr Puigdemont's political party, PDeCAT, said he had surrendered to police to show his ""willingness not to flee from the judicial process but to defend himself in a fair and impartial process, which is possible in Belgium, and highly doubtful in Spain"". Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy imposed direct rule on Catalonia following a declaration of independence in the regional parliament. He sacked Mr Puigdemont, dissolved the parliament and called local elections for 21 December. The declaration of independence followed a referendum that the Spanish constitutional court had declared illegal. Mr Puigdemont's colleagues also listed on the EU arrest warrant are Meritxell Serret (former agriculture minister), Antoni ComÃ­n (former health minister), LluÃ­s Puig (former culture minister), and Clara PonsatÃ­ (former education minister). From left to right, Meritxell Serret, Antoni ComÃ­n, LluÃ­s Puig and Clara PonsatÃ­ have also handed themselves in They all handed themselves in to Belgian federal police, accompanied by their lawyers, on Sunday morning and were questioned in a hearing lasting 10 hours. There were more protests in Catalan cities on Sunday against the detention of officials and activists held by the Spanish authorities. Protesters plastered city squares with posters depicting the detainees as political prisoners. Eight politicians are being held in an investigation into alleged rebellion and sedition linked to Catalonia's declaration of independence.

"The area from Oxford Circus to near Selfridges could become traffic-free Large parts of London's Oxford Street could be pedestrianised by December 2018, under plans put forward by London Mayor Sadiq Khan. About half a mile of the street from Oxford Circus to Orchard Street could become a ""traffic-free pedestrian boulevard"", the mayor said. He said he hoped it would coincide with the arrival of theElizabeth Linein central London in December next year. More than four million people visit Oxford Street each week. All east-west traffic will be stopped but some north-south routes will be maintained, according to the plans. Older cars may have to pay extra London 'air pollution charge' London's Oxford Street bus routes cut by 40% Oxford Street to be pedestrianised by 2020 Some north-south traffic will be allowed Other proposals include: Raising the roads to pavement level to improve accessibility An 800m-long work of public art could be commissioned New and extended taxi ranks would be created close to Oxford Street Taxis would also still be able to cross Oxford Street at Duke Street, Stratford Place, Vere Street and Harewood Place Plans to transform the area east of Oxford Circus will be consulted on next spring A 800m-long work of public art could be commissioned for the length of the former road Cyclists would not be able to ride in the pedestrianised area but Transport for London said it would consult on plans to create ""new high-quality cycle routes"" to the north and south of Oxford Street. Mr Khan said: ""Oxford Street is world famous with millions of visitors every year, and in just over a year the iconic part of the street west of Oxford Circus could be transformed into a traffic-free pedestrian boulevard. ""Alongside the arrival of the Elizabeth Line, the Oxford Street area will be truly transformed over the coming years."" Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the New West End Company, said: ""After years of campaigning, it's excellent news finally to see commitment from our politicians to a game-changing transformation of Oxford Street."" Richard Massett, chairman of the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association said: ""The LTDA is disappointed by the proposals for Oxford Street that were presented today. ""A 24 hour vehicle ban presents a major threat to the West End as a whole. Forcing traffic onto neighbouring streets will merely shift congestion and pollution, all the while making it far harder to visit London's premier retail destination.""

"Globally, temperatures in 2017 look set to be the third highest on record The year 2017 is ""very likely"" to be in the top three warmest years on record, according to provisional figures from the World Meteorological Organization. The WMO says it will likely be the hottest year in the absence of the El NiÃ±o phenomenon. The scientists argue that the long-term trend of warming driven by human activities continues unabated. They say many of the ""extraordinary"" weather events seen this year bear the hallmarks of climate change. On the opening day of this year's key UN climate talks, researchers from the WMO have presented their annual State of the Global Climate report. It follows hot on the heels of their greenhouse gases study from last week which found that concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were the highest on record. Record surge in atmospheric CO2 in 2016 UN: Emissions gap is 'alarmingly high' What is climate change? While the new study only covers January to September, the WMO says the average global temperature was 1.1C above the pre-industrial figure. This is getting dangerously close to the 1.5 degrees threshold that many island states feel temperatures must be kept under to ensure their survival. The analysis suggests that 2017 is likely to come in 0.47C warmer than the 1981-2010 average. This is slightly down on 2016 when the El NiÃ±o weather phenomenon saw temperatures that were 0.56C above the average. According to the WMO, this year vies with 2015 to be the second or third warmest mark yet recorded. This video can not be played Aerial footage of the aftermath in Dominica ""The past three years have all been in the top three years in terms of temperature records. This is part of a long-term warming trend,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. ""We have witnessed extraordinary weather, including temperatures topping 50C in Asia, record-breaking hurricanes in rapid succession in the Caribbean and Atlantic, (and) reaching as far as Ireland, devastating monsoon flooding affecting many millions of people and a relentless drought in East Africa. ""Many of these events - and detailed scientific studies will determine exactly how many - bear the tell-tale sign of climate change caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities,"" he said. The Caribbean island of Saint-Barthelemy after it was hit by Hurricane Irma Scientists will have to do attribution studies to clearly link specific events from 2017 to rising temperatures. But they believe the fingerprints of climate change are to be seen in events such as tropical cyclones, where the warmer seas can transfer more heat to the gathering storms and increased sea levels can make flooding more damaging. The Accumulated Cyclone Energy Index, which measures the intensity and duration of these events, showed its highest ever monthly values in September this year. It was also the first time that two Category 4 hurricanes made landfall in the same year in the US. Hurricane Irma was a Category 5 storm for the longest period on record. Rain gauges in Nederland, Texas, recorded 1,539mm, the largest ever recorded for a single event in the mainland US. Scientists say that extreme heat and drought contributed to many destructive wildfires such as this one in California There were also significant flooding events with large loss of life in Sierra Leone, in Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Peru among many others. In contrast, droughts and heatwaves affected many parts of Africa and South America. In Somalia, more than half of cropland was impacted with herds reduced by 40-60%. More than 11 million people are experiencing severe food insecurity in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. ""This year saw a multitude of damaging weather extremes which is not uncommon but many of these events were made more severe by the sustained warming influence of increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas levels due to human activities,"" said Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading, UK. This video can not be played WATCH: Hurricane Hunters fly over eye of storm to help forecasters ""An increased severity of weather extremes is expected in the decades ahead as Earth continues to heat up and it is only with the substantive cuts in greenhouse gas emissions required by the Paris climate agreement that we can avert much more potent and widespread damage to our societies and the ecosystems upon which they depend."" With UN talks on climate change now underway here in Bonn, the report is likely to reinforce a sense of urgency among many delegates. ""These findings underline the rising risks to people, economies and the very fabric of life on Earth if we fail to get on track with the aims and ambitions of the Paris Agreement,"" said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of UN Climate Change, which is hosting the Bonn conference.

"A 24-hour service has been launched for NHS patients, offering GP consultations via videolink on smartphones. The pilot scheme will initially cover 3.5 million patients in greater London. Patients will be able to check their symptoms through the mobile app and then have video consultations within two hours of booking. The Royal College of GPs has warned the service may not help patients with complex needs. The new free service has been launched by a group of London GPs and the online healthcare provider Babylon. Patients joining will leave their existing practice, with their records transferred to a group of five central London surgeries. Dr Mobasher Butt, who is part of the team behind the GP at Hand service, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's high time that NHS patients were given the opportunity to benefit from technology to improve access to healthcare. ""We've benefited from this kind of technology in so many different aspects of our lives, whether that be shopping or banking, and it's really time that we were able to do that in healthcare for NHS patients."" Jane Barnacle, director of patients and information at NHS England London, said GP practices were right to carefully test innovative new technologies that could improve free NHS services for their patients while also freeing up staff time. But the Royal College of GPs is concerned the new service might only work for younger healthier commuters and not those with complex health conditions. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the RCPG, said: ""We are really worried that schemes like this are creating a twin-track approach to NHS general practice and that patients are being 'cherry-picked', which could actually increase the pressures on traditional GPs based in the community. ""We understand that with increasingly long waiting times to see a GP, an online service is convenient and appealing, but older patients and those living with more complex needs want continuity of care and the security of their local practice where their GPs know them. ""We notice there is an extensive list of patient conditions such as frailty, pregnancy and mental health conditions that are the essence of general practice and which GPs deal with every day, but which are not eligible for this service. ""We are also concerned that patients are being given the option of switching back to their local surgery if they are not satisfied with the level of service offered by the app. ""As well as issues with patient confidentiality and the safety of the patient record, it is hard to see how this could be achieved without adding to the huge burden of red tape that GPs are already grappling with. ""While this scheme is backed by the NHS and offers a free service to patients, it is undoubtedly luring GPs away from front-line general practice at a time when we are facing a severe workforce crisis and hardworking GPs are struggling to cope with immense workloads."" Dr Richard Vautrey from the British Medical Association said: ""This approach risks undermining the quality and continuity of care and further fragmenting the service provided to the public.""

"This video can not be played Teenagers have been speaking about the 'dangers' of sexting Police investigations into children sharing sexual images of themselves and others have more than doubled in two years, figures have shown. Forces in England and Wales recorded 6,238 underage ""sexting"" offences in 2016-17, a rate of 17 a day. Police said they received reports from children as young as 10. Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, said: ""There is a worrying upward trend."" He added social networks needed to remove indecent images more quickly. The number of cases where under-18s were sharing indecent or prohibited images was up by a third on the 4,681 offences recorded the previous year, and represented a 131% rise on 2014-15, with 2,700 incidents. BBC Advice - Sexting Children 'should be taught about pornography and sexting' Mr Bailey, who is head of Norfolk Constabulary, said: ""Sharing and possessing these images is against the law. Once an image is shared with others it can cause deep embarrassment and distress."" As well as calling for faster action from social media companies, he said schools needed to do more to counteract the influence of pornography. He said: ""I am concerned about the impact that exposure to extreme pornography can have on children so we need to consider if a lack of universal relationship and sex education is compounding the problem."" Police said the youngest children involved in sexting inquiries were aged 10, while the number of offences investigated was at its peak among 14-year-olds. Girls were more likely to be the victims, but suspects or perpetrators were evenly split between boys and girls. Investigators noted that reports of offences declined substantially in August, suggesting children were more at risk in school term time. The figures cover a period in which the College of Policing introduced new guidance, aimed at assuaging concerns that teenagers might be routinely criminalised by laws on sexting. It said that officers should record all cases of under-18s sharing images of themselves or other children as crimes. However, formal action only needs to be taken where there is exploitation, coercion or wider child protection issues. There were more than 2,000 such cases where police determined that further action was not in the public interest in 2016-17. Mr Bailey said: ""Forces are risk-assessing every case to ensure we are not unnecessarily stigmatising children and saddling them with a criminal record. ""But there will always be a criminal investigation where we see that young people are being coerced, exploited or blackmailed."" The NSPCC said the rise in sexting incidents is ""extremely worrying"". ""It is vital that parents and schools talk to children about the dangers of sexting as soon as they are given any technology,"" the charity said.

"This video can not be played The Queen's private estate invested Â£10m in offshore funds About Â£10m of the Queen's private money was invested offshore, leaked documents show. The Duchy of Lancaster, which provides the Queen with an income, held funds in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. A small amount ended up in the company behind BrightHouse, a chain accused of irresponsible lending, and Threshers, which went bust owing Â£17.5m in UK tax. The Duchy said the BrightHouse holding now equates to Â£3,208 and it was not involved in fund investment decisions. It added it had been unaware the stores featured in the investments. The chief finance officer of the Â£500m estate, Chris Adcock, told the BBC: ""Our investment strategy is based on advice and recommendation from our investment consultants and appropriate asset allocation... ""The Duchy has only invested in highly regarded private equity funds following a strong recommendation from our investment consultants."" A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster added: ""We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate. ""The Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income she receives from the Duchy."" Details about the Duchy's investments came to light in the Paradise Papers - a leak of 13.4m documents from companies including Appleby, one of the world's leading offshore law firms. The two funds were based in British overseas territories with no corporation tax and at the centre of the offshore financial industry. But the Duchy said it was not aware there were tax advantages to it from investing in offshore funds, adding that tax strategy was not a part of the estate's investment policy. The documents show the Duchy of Lancaster put Â£5m in the Jubilee Absolute Return Fund Limited in Bermuda in 2004, with the investment coming to an end in 2010. In 2005 the Duchy agreed to put $7.5m (Â£5.7m) in the Dover Street VI Cayman Fund LP. Documents show the fund invested in medical and technology companies. The connection to rent-to-buy firm BrightHouse began in 2007 when the US company running the fund asked the Duchy to contribute $450,000 to five projects, including the purchase of the two UK High Street retailers. This included an interest in London-based private equity firm Vision Capital, the company which acquired 100% of BrightHouse and 75% of the owners of Threshers off licence chain. This video can not be played Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge says she is furious with those who advise the Queen Under its new owners, Threshers' balance sheet was loaded with debt and it paid no corporation tax for two years.When the drinks retailer went bust in October 2009,external, almost 6,000 people lost their jobs. The majority of Vision Capital's BrightHouse investment later ended up in a company based in Luxembourg and it began paying less corporation tax in the UK. Last month,the UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, said BrightHouse, which sells electrical goods and furniture predominantly to people on lower incomes via weekly installments,  had not acted as a ""responsible lender"" and ordered it to pay Â£14.8m compensation to 249,000 customers. The Duchy said its investment in the Cayman Islands fund is due to continue until 2019 or 2020 and amounts to 0.3% of the total value of the estate, while its interest in BrightHouse now equates to just 0.0006% of its wealth. The Duchy did not provide a figure for its interest in Threshers. Vision Capital said it ""complies with all laws and regulations and pays its tax in full and on time. Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong"". The Paradise Papers' revelations over the Queen's finances are certainly embarrassing. Many will also view the Duchy of Lancaster's offshore investments in BrightHouse and Threshers as dubious and inappropriate. However, it is not a question of tax avoidance, but of judgement on behalf of her advisers. The Queen is officially exempt from UK tax laws, but voluntarily pays her share of income tax on her Â£500m estate. It is extraordinary and puzzling that her advisers could have felt that it was appropriate - for somebody whose reputation is based so much on setting a good example - to invest in these offshore funds. There will be meetings and questions being asked within Buckingham Palace this morning as the monarchy finds its reputation tarnished by association. TheDuchy's 2017 annual report,externalsays it ""gives ongoing consideration regarding any of its acts or omissions that could adversely impact the reputation of the Duchy or Her Majesty The Queen"". Labour MP Margaret Hodge, the former chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said she was ""pretty furious"" with the Queen's investment advisers, saying they were bringing her reputation into disrepute. ""It is so obvious that if you're looking after the money of the monarchy, you've got to be actually cleaner than clean and you must never go near the dirty world of money laundering, tax avoidance, tax evasion or actually making money in dubious ways,"" she said. The business model of BrightHouse has long come under the spotlight. Aparliamentary report in 2015,externalsaid the company was charging interest rates of up to 94%. One in five customers were in arrears and one in 10 purchases ended in repossession. In one case examined by MPs and Lords, a Samsung freezer cost Â£644 to buy in John Lewis but Â£1,716 under a five-year plan from the chain. BrightHouse was attracting attention at the time of the Duchy's investment - with theFinancial Times challenging its chief executive in November 2008 to respond to accusations,externalthat the chain was ""preying on the vulnerable"". The company maintains it is a responsible lender and through its 300 stores provides a services to millions of Britons who are unable to access up traditional lines of credit. BrightHouse told the Guardian newspaper it follows all relevant tax regulations and pays its tax in full and on time. Vision Capital announced it was acquiring the stakes in BrightHouse and Threshers,externalin June 2007. The offshore leaked documents show the Duchy of Lancaster was among 46 investors in the $312m Dover Street VI Cayman Fund LP. In September 2007, investors were asked to pay 6% of their financial commitment into five investments, including ""Project Bertie"". The investors were told Project Bertie was formed to take an interest in a company set up by Vision Capital to ""acquire a portfolio of two retailers in the United Kingdom"". The Duchy of Lancaster's $450,000 commitment to the ""capital call"" is listed in the documents. Another document shows the investment in Jubilee Absolute Return Fund. Established more than 700 years ago, the Duchy of Lancaster has a commercial and residential property portfolio and financial investments. Its main purpose is to provide income for the Queen, who is known as the ""Duke of Lancaster"". Although the Duchy is not subject to tax, since 1993 the Queen has voluntarily paid tax on any income she receives. The Duchy's annual report and accounts include a summary of its holdings and financial performance and are put before Parliament. The offshore investments were not referenced in the reports but there is no requirement for specific details of the Duchy's holdings to be disclosed. Dave McClure, the author of a book about the wealth of the Royal Family, told the BBC ""pressure will grow on the Duchy to open up to proper parliamentary scrutiny by the National Audit Office, which they've resisted for decades. ""The solution to the problem might be just full disclosure, so everyone knows what investments they're investing in."" The Duchy said the Queen ""takes a keen interest in the Duchy's estates and tenants""  but ""appoints a chancellor and the Duchy Council to administer the affairs of Her Duchy. The chancellor delegates the oversight to the Duchy to the Council"". Investors in the Dover Street VI Cayman Fund LP  made a commitment for a ""given period"" and are ""not party to its ongoing investment decisions"" or where money is ""ultimately invested"", it added. Asked whether the Duchy had other investments in offshore funds, it said it ""currently invests in a fund domiciled in Ireland"". TheChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is a government minister,externaland sits in the cabinet, but plays a nominal role in running the estate. The current chancellor is Sir Patrick McLoughlin MP, the Chairman of the Conservative Party. At the time the Duchy initially invested in the Dover Street VI Cayman Fund LP in September 2005, its chancellor was Labour MP John Hutton. Ed Miliband was the chancellor of the Duchy at the time the call came to invest in the company taking over BrightHouse and Threshers. Coincidentally in 2016, the former Labour leader called for better regulation on buy-to-rent firms such as BrightHouse in a film for the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.

"This video can not be played US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross: 'There is nothing whatsoever improper' Donald Trump's commerce secretary says there is ""nothing improper"" about his business links to Russian figures who are currently under US sanctions. Wilbur Ross was accused of misleading senators after leaked documents showed his interests in a firm in which some shareholders have ties to the Kremlin. He told the BBC that the US had not sanctioned the company, Sibur, so ""there's nothing wrong with that"". Mr Ross also denied he had failed to disclose the information. Earlier, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthalcalled the revelations of the Kremlin links ""inexcusable"",external. They come as part of a huge leak of financial documents, dubbed the Paradise Papers, revealing how the powerful and ultra-wealthy, including the Queen's private estate, secretly invest vast amounts of cash in offshore tax havens. Tax haven secrets of ultra-rich exposed Are we taming offshore finance? Tax revelations hit Trudeau fundraiser The leaks show he has investments in shipping firm Navigator Holdings, which earns millions a year transporting oil and gas for Sibur. Two major Sibur shareholders have been sanctioned by the US: Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko, who has at least 12 companies connected to him The Russian natural gas company, Novatek, belonging to Leonid Mikhelson Another key Sibur shareholder is President Vladimir Putin's son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov, who holds a 3.9% stake in the firm. While he is not subject to sanctions, his father, Nikolai, is. Mr Ross has not disputed the revelations, telling the BBC: ""There's nothing whatsoever improper about Navigator having a relationship with Sibur."" ""If our government decided to sanction them, that would be a different story,"" he continued. He said he had disclosed the business links to the office of government ethics, and denied misleading the confirmation hearing committee when he took office. He said he had never met any of the figures concerned. The US imposed some sanctions after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Others were imposed last year for alleged interference in the US presidential election. The commerce department earlier said Mr Ross had ""been generally supportive of the administration's sanctions of Russian and other entities"". Prior to being confirmed in office as commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross did not reveal to Congress the full details of his company holdings. According to the leaks, he retains a financial interest in Navigator Holdings via a number of companies in the Cayman Islands, some of which he did disclose at the time of his confirmation. However, under the disclosure rules he did not have to declare his interest in Navigator Holdings. This video can not be played Ex-US sanctions policy co-ordinator Daniel Fried says it would be a mistake for any US official to do business with Sibur But questions will be raised about Mr Ross's potential conflicts of interest and whether his ties undermine US sanctions against Russia. ""Our committee was misled, the American people were misled by the concealment of those companies,""Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told NBC News,externalafter the revelations came to light. Mr Blumenthal has called for an investigation into the treasury secretary's links to President Putin's son-in-law. The leaks come as an investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian connections to Donald Trump's 2016 campaign team continues. Mr Trump's presidency has been dogged by allegations that Russians colluded to try to influence the outcome of the election. He has called the allegations ""fake news"". They have known each other for more than a quarter of a century. Mr Ross played a key part in a pre-packaged bankruptcy deal - an agreement between a company and its creditors - for Mr Trump's Atlantic City casino, the Taj Mahal, in the 1990s. Donald Trump at the Taj Mahal casino in 1990 He stepped in to represent the angry bondholders but liked Donald Trump's style. Mr Ross, according to Trump biographer David Cay Johnston, was the key negotiator preventing Donald Trump from ""being swept into the dustbin of history because he saw the value in the Trump name"". ""If it hadn't been for Wilbur Ross, Donald Trump would not be in the White House."" WL Ross & Co, which was founded by Wilbur Ross, appears to have maintained a close relationship with the shipping company. On the night that he was nominated as commerce secretary, Mr Ross was congratulated on his promotion by the senior management of Navigator Holdings at a New York restaurant,Bloomberg reports,external. Mr Ross reportedly told the CEO of Navigator: ""Your interest is aligned to mine. The US economy will grow, and Navigator will be a beneficiary.""

"Andrea Leadsom knew of a rape case that had been reported to the Commons, the Victoria Derbyshire show understands. The Commons leader has been accused by the alleged victim, an ex-Tory activist, of ignoring concerns over the ""toxic"" culture of Westminster. ""Amanda"" said she told the Commons clerk she had been raped by someone who worked for a Conservative MP. The BBC has established Ms Leadsom was told about the alleged case by the clerk in a regular briefing. Ms Leadsom's office initially said she did not receive an official complaint in relation to the alleged rape. Both the clerk and Ms Leadsom said it would not have been appropriate to take any further action given the ongoing criminal case at the time. The alleged rape did not take place inside Parliament. 'Amanda' says the incident left her 'destroyed' Amanda - whose name has been changed to protect the identity of both parties - says she was raped ""by someone senior to me in the Conservative Party. ""It was violent. It wasn't in Westminster, it was in my own home."" ""And it shouldn't have happened. I remember the attack, during the attack. I remember the room disappearing around me and thinking I was going to die. ""When he left the next day I was at the police station within an hour and I reported it."" Growing number of MPs under scrutiny What counts as inappropriate behaviour- As she waited for a trial date, she decided to tell the Commons officials about the alleged rape. She explained how she felt the ""heavy-drinking and sex-driven"" culture within Westminster had contributed to it. This programme has confirmed Amanda had a 25-minute conversation with the House of Commons clerk, David Natzler. She said she left the conversation believing her concerns about both the culture and her alleged attack would be passed on to the then-Chief Whip Gavin Williamson and the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom - and that a meeting might follow. Mr Williamson has just been promoted to defence secretary after Michael Fallon resigned over his ""general conduct"" and Mrs Leadsom has since said Parliament would take a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to allegations of sexual misconduct. But Amanda said: ""I never received contact from either of them. The parliamentary authorities never followed it up with me either. I heard nothing."" The clerk refused to confirm who he spoke to about what he had been told, saying that Amanda's concerns were ""informally reported onwards"" and were ""acted on"". The BBC understands the allegation and Amanda's general concerns were raised by the clerk at a regular meeting with Ms Leadsom. But no-one will say how exactly it was acted upon and Amanda was not told either. It is understood Mr Williamson insists none of the claims was passed on to him. Amanda said the incident had ""destroyed"" her. ""I question how I could be so stupid as to get into that political scene,"" she added. ""And I blame myself for doing so because it led to what happened to me. If I hadn't have got into that scene I wouldn't have been attacked. It's as simple as that."" She added it had made her feel ""worthless and as if my experience wasn't important and that the experiences of others who had who had had similar things happen to them weren't important either"". The man Amanda had accused of rape, who was not an MP, strongly denied the allegation and the case was later dropped after a review of the evidence. But at the time she told the parliamentary authorities about it and her general concerns the case was due to go to trial and she says she was ignored despite their seriousness. In a statement, the clerk confirmed,externalthe conversation took place. It added: ""The allegation was mentioned but was not the focus of the discussion, as the incident had not taken place on the Parliamentary Estate, and the activist had not been employed on the estate. ""There was no question of formally 'referring' the allegations to other House authorities as there was already a criminal case under way."" Amanda said the clerk took her concerns extremely seriously. Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.

"Many homes have been targeted in racist, sectarian or paramilitary attacks More than 2,000 housing intimidation cases - where people were forced out of home by threats - have been acted upon by the Housing Executive since 2012. It spent Â£7m re-housing people forced out by paramilitary threats, sectarian, racist or homophobic intimidation or anti-social behaviour. But only 32 convictions were secured from 2011 to 2016 for the offence of intimidating victims from their homes. The figures have been compiled bythe investigative news website, The Detail,external. The website reported that during the financial years April 2012 to April 2017, the Housing Executive received more than 3,000 complaints of housing intimidation. The publicly funded housing body ""accepted"" a total of 2,060 cases but rejected about 1,000 of the complaints. The Detail said the ""overwhelming majority"" of the accepted cases were in eastern parts of Northern Ireland, including Belfast; Lisburn and Castlereagh; Ards and North Down and the Antrim and Newtownabbey council areas. Paramilitary threats account for most of the forced evictions The Housing Executive agreed to buy 57 properties from homeowners who were forced to flee, at a total cost of more than Â£6.7m. The sales are processed through the Scheme for the Purchase of Evacuated Dwellings (SPED). The housing body also paid emergency accommodation grants to more than 1,000 tenants who fled from rented homes, which meant an additional bill of more than Â£800,000. Almost three quarters (1,523) of the accepted complaints related to paramilitary intimidation. A significant number (222) of householders fled due to what was described as ""anti-social behaviour"". Sectarian intimation forced 153 people from their homes and racism was cited as the motive in 112 cases. The issue of housing intimidation hit the headlines in September, whenfour Catholic families fled their homes in Belfast's Cantrell Close. Cantrell Close was built under a shared housing initiative, in a bid to bring communities together PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said the victims had been forced to leave their homes ""because of their community background, because of their religion"". He said detectives believed members of the loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), had issued the threats. In recent years, PSNI officers have also been the victims of housing intimidation. In June, the BBC's Nolan Show reported thatevery year, an average of 16 police officers either move home or have special security measures installeddue to threats. Deputy Ch Constable Drew Harris told the programme: ""We could expect, every month, one or two officers to be in the position where they're having to move home."" The Detail asked the PSNI for its figures on the number of arrests and charges for housing intimidation over the past five years. The PSNI refused the request on the grounds of how much it would cost to compile the figures. The conviction statistics - 32 between March 2011 and August 2016 - are therefore based on figures obtained from the Northern Ireland Court Service.

"Andrea Leadsom knew of a rape case that had been reported to the Commons, the Victoria Derbyshire show understands. The Commons leader has been accused by the alleged victim, an ex-Tory activist, of ignoring concerns over the ""toxic"" culture of Westminster. ""Amanda"" said she told the Commons clerk she had been raped by someone who worked for a Conservative MP. The BBC has established Ms Leadsom was told about the alleged case by the clerk in a regular briefing. Ms Leadsom's office initially said she did not receive an official complaint in relation to the alleged rape. Both the clerk and Ms Leadsom said it would not have been appropriate to take any further action given the ongoing criminal case at the time. The alleged rape did not take place inside Parliament. 'Amanda' says the incident left her 'destroyed' Amanda - whose name has been changed to protect the identity of both parties - says she was raped ""by someone senior to me in the Conservative Party. ""It was violent. It wasn't in Westminster, it was in my own home."" ""And it shouldn't have happened. I remember the attack, during the attack. I remember the room disappearing around me and thinking I was going to die. ""When he left the next day I was at the police station within an hour and I reported it."" Growing number of MPs under scrutiny What counts as inappropriate behaviour- As she waited for a trial date, she decided to tell the Commons officials about the alleged rape. She explained how she felt the ""heavy-drinking and sex-driven"" culture within Westminster had contributed to it. This programme has confirmed Amanda had a 25-minute conversation with the House of Commons clerk, David Natzler. She said she left the conversation believing her concerns about both the culture and her alleged attack would be passed on to the then-Chief Whip Gavin Williamson and the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom - and that a meeting might follow. Mr Williamson has just been promoted to defence secretary after Michael Fallon resigned over his ""general conduct"" and Mrs Leadsom has since said Parliament would take a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to allegations of sexual misconduct. But Amanda said: ""I never received contact from either of them. The parliamentary authorities never followed it up with me either. I heard nothing."" The clerk refused to confirm who he spoke to about what he had been told, saying that Amanda's concerns were ""informally reported onwards"" and were ""acted on"". The BBC understands the allegation and Amanda's general concerns were raised by the clerk at a regular meeting with Ms Leadsom. But no-one will say how exactly it was acted upon and Amanda was not told either. It is understood Mr Williamson insists none of the claims was passed on to him. Amanda said the incident had ""destroyed"" her. ""I question how I could be so stupid as to get into that political scene,"" she added. ""And I blame myself for doing so because it led to what happened to me. If I hadn't have got into that scene I wouldn't have been attacked. It's as simple as that."" She added it had made her feel ""worthless and as if my experience wasn't important and that the experiences of others who had who had had similar things happen to them weren't important either"". The man Amanda had accused of rape, who was not an MP, strongly denied the allegation and the case was later dropped after a review of the evidence. But at the time she told the parliamentary authorities about it and her general concerns the case was due to go to trial and she says she was ignored despite their seriousness. In a statement, the clerk confirmed,externalthe conversation took place. It added: ""The allegation was mentioned but was not the focus of the discussion, as the incident had not taken place on the Parliamentary Estate, and the activist had not been employed on the estate. ""There was no question of formally 'referring' the allegations to other House authorities as there was already a criminal case under way."" Amanda said the clerk took her concerns extremely seriously. Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.

"Catalan independence supporters protested outside the prosecutor's office in Brussels Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and four former ministers have been freed with conditions by an investigating judge in Belgium. The judge said they could not leave the country without permission and had to give details of their accommodation. They had handed themselves in to Belgian police following an EU arrest warrant issued by a Spanish judge. Mr Puigdemont fled to Belgium after Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia following an independence declaration. He has said he will not return to Spain unless he is guaranteed a fair trial. The five are wanted in Spain to face charges including rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Mr Puigdemont could be seen inside the public prosecutor's office in Brussels They are now expected to appear in court in Belgium within 15 days. Belgium has a maximum of 60 days to return the five to Spain but, if they do not raise legal objections, a transfer could happen much sooner. Catalonia's longest week The man who wants to break up Spain Catalonia crisis: What next for Spain? ""The request made this afternoon by the Brussels' Prosecutor's Office for the provisional release of all persons sought has been granted by the investigative judge,"" said a statement by the Belgian prosecutor's office. This video can not be played In Catalonia, this small town is divided over independence Mr Puigdemont's political party, PDeCAT, said he had surrendered to police to show his ""willingness not to flee from the judicial process but to defend himself in a fair and impartial process, which is possible in Belgium, and highly doubtful in Spain"". Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy imposed direct rule on Catalonia following a declaration of independence in the regional parliament. He sacked Mr Puigdemont, dissolved the parliament and called local elections for 21 December. The declaration of independence followed a referendum that the Spanish constitutional court had declared illegal. Mr Puigdemont's colleagues also listed on the EU arrest warrant are Meritxell Serret (former agriculture minister), Antoni ComÃ­n (former health minister), LluÃ­s Puig (former culture minister), and Clara PonsatÃ­ (former education minister). From left to right, Meritxell Serret, Antoni ComÃ­n, LluÃ­s Puig and Clara PonsatÃ­ have also handed themselves in They all handed themselves in to Belgian federal police, accompanied by their lawyers, on Sunday morning and were questioned in a hearing lasting 10 hours. There were more protests in Catalan cities on Sunday against the detention of officials and activists held by the Spanish authorities. Protesters plastered city squares with posters depicting the detainees as political prisoners. Eight politicians are being held in an investigation into alleged rebellion and sedition linked to Catalonia's declaration of independence.

"Around 3,600 firms pay the voluntary living wage More than 150,000 workers whose firms are signed up to the voluntary living wage rate are set to get a pay rise. The voluntary rate, promoted by the Living Wage Foundation campaign group, is to rise by 30p an hour to Â£8.75. For those living  in London, the rate will rise by 45p to Â£10.20 an hour. About 3,600 firms are signed up to the scheme, including Ikea and Google. It is separate from the government's compulsory National Minimum Wage (NMW) and the National Living Wage (NLW). The National Living Wage, which was introduced in April last year for workers aged 25 and above, is currently set at Â£7.50 an hour. Those under 25, are still paid the lower National Minimum Wage. Living Wage Foundation director Katherine Chapman urged more employers to sign up to the scheme. ""In-work poverty is today's story,"" she said. ""The new living wage rates will bring relief for thousands of UK workers being squeezed by stagnant wages and rising inflation."" On Monday, a number of new companies announced their commitment to pay the living wage, including Heathrow Airport, the National Gallery and professional services firm JLL. Heathrow is the first airport to sign up to the scheme. Chief executive John Holland-Kaye said paying the living wage was ""the right thing to do as a responsible employer"". Research from accountancy firm KPMG on Sunday estimated around one in five UK workers were paid below the voluntary living wage. The level of the voluntary living wage is calculated annually by the Resolution Foundation, a not-for-profit research and policy organisation. It is overseen by the Living Wage Commission, which is appointed by the Living Wage Foundation and includes representation from employers, trade unions, civil society and independent experts.

"This video can not be played 'Queen should apologise,' suggests Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn has suggested the Queen, among others, should apologise for using overseas tax havens if they were used to avoid taxation in the UK. The Labour leader was asked at the CBI conference whether the Queen should say sorry for making overseas investments. He said anyone putting money into tax havens for the purposes of avoidance should ""not just apologise for it, recognise what it does to our society"". The BBC has revealed that the Queen's estate has used overseas tax havens. Paradise Papers: All you need to know Latest reaction to the Paradise Papers leak It comes after a leak of confidential papers from Bermuda revealed the secret offshore investments of the rich and famous, including the Queen. Mr Corbyn's spokesman later clarified his comments, saying the Labour leader did not specifically call on the Queen to apologise but thought ""anyone who puts money into a tax haven to avoid paying tax should acknowledge the damage it does to society"". This video can not be played The Queen's private estate invested Â£10m in offshore funds Mr Corbyn called for a full inquiry, public lists of company ownership, and a new tax enforcement unit to tackle tax evasion. On Sunday,BBC Panorama broadcastthe first results of its year-long investigation into theParadise Papers,external, a massive leak of financial documents from Bermuda-based law firm Appleby. The leaks raised questions overtech firm Apple's tax structures, the investments ofConservative Party donor Lord Ashcroft,Everton FC owner Farhad Moshiri,Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton, and offshore investments made on theQueen's behalf by the Duchy of Lancaster. Buckingham Palace has not commented on the revelation that the Duchy of Lancaster, which handles the Queen's private wealth, used offshore investments. A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster said: ""We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate. ""The Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income she receives from the Duchy."" HMRC chief executive Jon Thompson vowed to ""chase down"" anyone trying to hide money offshore and evade tax. He told the Commons Public Accounts Committee that HMRC had asked to see the leaked Paradise Papers in order to ""look at every case of tax evasion very seriously"". Mr Thompson said there were 66 ongoing criminal investigations into thePanama Papers, which in April 2016 exposed tax avoidance and evasion, saying Â£100m could be retrieved. ""That gives you some sense about how long quite complicated tax cases take to bring to some sort of fruition,"" he added. This video can not be played Theresa May: 'UK already acting' on offshore tax havens Theresa May insisted efforts were already under way to obtain revenue from offshore tax vehicles, adding: ""We want people to pay the tax that is due"". At the CBI conference, the prime minister said HMRC had collected Â£160bn by tackling tax avoidance, evasion and non-compliance since 2010. Mrs May's spokesperson said: ""It is important to point out that holding investments offshore is not an automatic sign of wrongdoing, but HMRC has requested to see the papers urgently so it can look into any allegations."" But when asked, Mrs May did not commit to a public inquiry into tax revenue lost through offshore tax avoidance schemes. Among the Paradise Papers documents was evidence that Tory donorLord Ashcroftremained a non-dom and continued to avoid tax despite attempts to make peers pay their full share. Lord Ashcroft has insisted he did not ignore rules in relation to the Punta Gorda offshore trust and said  his tax residency was ""publicly available information"". The leaked documents show that between 2000 and 2010, Lord Ashcroft received payments of around $200m (Â£150m) from his offshore trust in Bermuda. Responding,externalto the programme, Lord Ashcroft wrote: ""At no point has it been suggested directly to me, or through others, that I have taken any inappropriate action."" He also explained why he ran away from a Panorama reporter who approached him for comment, taking refuge in a toilet, saying he was ""determined"" not to ""fall victim to their ambush"". This video can not be played Watch Lord Ashcroft try to avoid Richard Biltonâs questions about his offshore trust The Paradise Papers puts into question the practice of using highly secretive offshore tax havens, which is legal. Bermuda's premier David Burt said the territory has a ""robust regulatory regime"" with the same tax system in place since 1898. He added the UK's tax law allows the use of offshore tax havens. Former Business Secretary, Sir Vince Cable, criticised the government for not clamping down on offshore tax havens trading under the British flag. He said: ""The Paradise Papers suggest that a small number of wealthy individuals have been able, entirely legally, to put their money beyond the reach of the Exchequer.""

"This video can not be played Texas officials give details on church mass shooting At least 26 people have been killed and 20 others wounded after a gunman opened fire at a Texas church during a Sunday service. The attack happened at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, a small town in Wilson County. The victims' ages ranged from five to 72. The suspected gunman was later found dead in his vehicle some miles away. Police identified him only as a ""young, white male"" but US media named him as Devin Patrick Kelley, 26. Kelley is reported to have been discharged from the US air force in 2014 following a court martial for assaulting his wife and child. The motive for the killings was not immediately clear. A candlelit vigil was held for victims of the shooting in Sutherland Springs Texas Department of Public Safety regional director Freeman Martin said the attacker, dressed all in black and wearing a bulletproof vest, opened fire with a Ruger assault rifle outside the church at around 11:30 local time (17:30 GMT) and then went inside. As the gunman left the church, a local citizen grabbed his own rifle and began shooting at the suspect, who then dropped his weapon and fled in a vehicle. The citizen pursued the suspect, who eventually drove off the road and crashed his car at the Guadalupe County line. By Owen Amos, BBC News, Sutherland Springs At 01:30, Chris Speer was still sitting on his porch, sucking his cigarette in the dark. Fourteen hours earlier he was in the same place, with his 11-month-old son, when he heard ""close to 30 shots"". ""Your first instinct, you're out in the country, you think someone is shooting, practising,"" he says. ""But it was too close. I knew something wasn't right."" He took his son inside. ""If I could have got my gun, I would have,"" he says. ""But when you've got a kid in your hands, I'm not risking it. He wouldn't let go."" Mr Speer didn't know the attacker but he knew ""a lot"" of the victims. ""We're a small community. We band together. But what doesn't kill us makes us stronger."" Police found the man dead in his car but it is unclear if he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound or from injuries received when fired on by the local citizen. The car contained several weapons. Mr Martin added: ""We have multiple crime scenes. We have the church, outside the church. We have where the suspect's vehicle was located. ""We have been following up on the suspect and where he's from. We have Texas Rangers at all the hospitals locating those and interviewing those who were injured."" One man has told how he chased the gunman after seeing ""two men exchanging gunfire"" outside the church. Speaking to local TV station Ksat.com,Johnnie Langendorff said a ""gentleman came and said we need to pursue him. And that's what I did, I just acted"",external. Mr Langendorff said the pair were driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) until the gunman lost control of his car and crashed. Governor Greg Abbott, confirming the death toll, said it was the worst mass shooting in the history of Texas. ""This will be a long, suffering mourning for those in pain,"" he said at a news conference on Sunday. The First Baptist Church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, told ABC News his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, was among those killed. Mr Pomeroy, who was in Oklahoma at the time of the attack, described her as ""one very beautiful, special child"" in a phone call to the television outlet. At least 10 victims, including four children, were being treated at the University Health System in nearby San Antonio,the hospital said in a tweet,external. The authorities could not confirm the names of any victims as they continued to work through the crime scene, Sheriff Joe Tackitt said.

"All five men died on the way back from the South Pole A photograph of the team which took part in the doomed 1910-13 Antarctic expedition is to be sold at auction. Captain Robert Scott and his four-man team died in 1912 after being beaten to the South Pole by Norwegian explorers. The photograph of all five was taken using an automatic trigger in January of that year after the men read Roald Amundsen's note and realised they were not the first ones to get there. The photo is expected to fetch Â£1,200 at Sotheby's in London on 14 November. Cecilie Gasselholm of Sotheby's said it was almost possible to see ""the disappointment in their faces"".

"Prince Mansour was the son of former Crown Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz A senior Saudi prince and seven other officials have been killed in a helicopter crash near the country's border with Yemen, state media report. Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, the deputy governor of Asir province, was returning from an inspection tour when his aircraft came down near Abha late on Sunday, the interior ministry said. It did not give a cause for the crash. The incident came hours after a major purge of the kingdom's political and business leadership. An anti-corruption body led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32, ordered the detentions of dozens of people, including 11 princes, four ministers and dozens of ex-ministers. Analysts see the unprecedented move as an attempt to cement the power of the heir to the throne. Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles Mohammed bin Salman, power behind the throne Prince Mansour was the son of Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, a former intelligence chief who was crown prince between January and April 2015, when he was pushed aside by Prince Mohammed's father, King Salman, now 81. Mansour served as a consultant to his father's royal court and in April 2017 wasamong eight young royals appointed deputy governors,external. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent These are heady and unpredictable times in Saudi Arabia. The Arab world's richest country is undergoing seismic changes almost unprecedented in its 85-year history as a sovereign nation. The idea of dozens of familiar pillars of the establishment all being publicly and humiliatingly removed from office and detained, albeit in great comfort, would have been unthinkable just three years ago. But the conservative, stodgy, risk-averse Saudi Arabia of old is under new management these days. Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who is leading the official anti-corruption purge, appears determined to take on all comers in his drive to both modernise the country and eliminate all opposition, both secular and religious. He is popular with young Saudis but critics say he is playing for high stakes, risking a dangerous backlash. An interior ministry statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency said the prince and seven provincial officials had boarded a helicopter on Sunday morning to tour a number of coastal projects west of the city of Abha. ""While returning in the evening of the same day, contact with the plane was lost in the vicinity of the Reda reserve,"" it added. ""The authorities are currently searching for survivors as the wreckage has been found."" Later, state news channel al-Ikhbariya announced the death of the prince. It also posted on Twitterphotographs of the wreckage,externalanda video showing the prince and his companions using the helicopter hours before their deaths,external. Allow Twitter content?

The Reda reserve is located in the Sarawat Mountains, the largest range in the Arabian Peninsula, and is about 10km (6 miles) west of Abha and 120km from the border with Yemen For the past two-and-a-half years, Saudi Arabia has been leading a coalition that is supporting Yemen's internationally-recognised government in its war with the rebel Houthi movement. The interior ministry statement did not draw any link between the crash and the conflict, but on Saturday the Saudi military intercepted and destroyed a ballistic missile near the capital, Riyadh, that was fired by Houthi fighters. On Sunday, the Saudi-led coalition said it was closing all of Yemen's air, land and sea borders in response to the missile attack. It accused Iran of supplying the missile, and said that it might amount to an act of war on Tehran's part.

"The controversial campaign has been labelled ""disgusting"" and ""offensive"" A campaign telling parents to send children to school if they have colds has prompted more than 6,500 signatures to a petition against its ""aggressive, condescending and insulting"" message. Leaflets were sent in East Sussex County Council's Get a Grip drive to parents whose children missed at least three days of the current school year. They also give advice on ""being more organised"" the night before school. The council said it ""won't flinch from this extremely serious issue"". The campaign features the slogan ""good reasons for missing school - there are none"". The petition, set up by Ella Lewis of Seaford, calls for the council to withdraw the campaign and apologise for the ""disgusting and offensive"" alienation of parents, particularly those ""struggling with serious illnesses, traumas and ongoing disabilities and conditions"". Mrs Lewis, 37, who has two children, received the leaflet after her six-year-old daughter had three days off for a chest infection and stomach bug. This equated to 91% attendance over the short autumn half term - below the council's 95% expectation. Ella Lewis said the campaign was offensive rather than productive She said: ""These are unattainable standards. The council says it expects a doctor's note, but even if you could get a GP appointment, people are told not to go to the doctor's with a sickness bug. ""Schools also tell you not to allow your child back to school until you're 48 hours clear of a vomiting bug. In taking that direction, you fall into the 'persistence absence' threshold and are potentially reported to the council by the school. It's nonsensical. ""As parents we need to be able to validate our own child's health and suitability to be in school."" Mrs Lewis, who works in a school, said: ""The council could have been more polite, engaging or creative. ""But they've just offended people who are trying to do their best every day for their children."" The council says headaches, coughs and colds are ""not reasons"" for school absence The leaflet sent out to parents also warns them about fines for unauthorised absences, including holidays during term time, and says children should attend school if they have a cold, headache or minor illness. A council spokesman said the campaign was not aimed at parents of children who had genuine medical reasons for being absent, but for those who regularly have odd days off or holiday in term time. He said: ""We appreciate this campaign has been controversial. ""Missing even one day of school has an impact not just on a child's education but on the rest of the class, as it means the teacher has to spend time helping them catch up - to the detriment of other pupils. Missing days of school reduces children's chances of achieving success.""

"A 24-hour service has been launched for NHS patients, offering GP consultations via videolink on smartphones. The pilot scheme will initially cover 3.5 million patients in greater London. Patients will be able to check their symptoms through the mobile app and then have video consultations within two hours of booking. The Royal College of GPs has warned the service may not help patients with complex needs. The new free service has been launched by a group of London GPs and the online healthcare provider Babylon. Patients joining will leave their existing practice, with their records transferred to a group of five central London surgeries. Dr Mobasher Butt, who is part of the team behind the GP at Hand service, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's high time that NHS patients were given the opportunity to benefit from technology to improve access to healthcare. ""We've benefited from this kind of technology in so many different aspects of our lives, whether that be shopping or banking, and it's really time that we were able to do that in healthcare for NHS patients."" Jane Barnacle, director of patients and information at NHS England London, said GP practices were right to carefully test innovative new technologies that could improve free NHS services for their patients while also freeing up staff time. But the Royal College of GPs is concerned the new service might only work for younger healthier commuters and not those with complex health conditions. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the RCPG, said: ""We are really worried that schemes like this are creating a twin-track approach to NHS general practice and that patients are being 'cherry-picked', which could actually increase the pressures on traditional GPs based in the community. ""We understand that with increasingly long waiting times to see a GP, an online service is convenient and appealing, but older patients and those living with more complex needs want continuity of care and the security of their local practice where their GPs know them. ""We notice there is an extensive list of patient conditions such as frailty, pregnancy and mental health conditions that are the essence of general practice and which GPs deal with every day, but which are not eligible for this service. ""We are also concerned that patients are being given the option of switching back to their local surgery if they are not satisfied with the level of service offered by the app. ""As well as issues with patient confidentiality and the safety of the patient record, it is hard to see how this could be achieved without adding to the huge burden of red tape that GPs are already grappling with. ""While this scheme is backed by the NHS and offers a free service to patients, it is undoubtedly luring GPs away from front-line general practice at a time when we are facing a severe workforce crisis and hardworking GPs are struggling to cope with immense workloads."" Dr Richard Vautrey from the British Medical Association said: ""This approach risks undermining the quality and continuity of care and further fragmenting the service provided to the public.""

"Malcolm Turnbull says the new declarations will help achieve transparency in Canberra Australia's Prime Minister has announced new rules to make all federal politicians declare their citizenship status. It comes amid a dual citizenship saga, which has led to six politicians losing their office. In Australia, dual citizens are not allowed to run for federal office. Malcolm Turnbull unveiled the new disclosure rules on Monday in a bid to clear up the uncertainty around politicians' eligibility in Canberra. The plan will need to be voted on in both the upper and lower houses in Australia's parliament, before coming into force. Are there more Australia dual citizen MPs? Under the new plan, politicians will be obliged to make a formal declaration about their citizenship status, as well as provide details about the time and place of their birth, and the time and place of birth of their parents. If the politicians had citizenship of another country they will also be required to detail when and how they renounced it. Current politicians will have 21 days to make the declaration, while future members of parliament will be required to make the declaration when they are elected. ""What we have seen is a concern, a legitimate concern that there is insufficient transparency,"" Mr Turnbull said on Monday. ""Members and senators have been put squarely on notice now and so they will be turning their mind to their own affairs and the issues of citizenship."" The plan comes followingweeks of pressureon the Turnbull government to carry out an audit of all sitting federal politicians. Last month, Australia's highest court decided that five politicians - including Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce - were invalidly elected because they held dual citizenship. Many of the politicians had argued that they had not been aware they were dual nationals due to their parents or place of birth. Last week Australian Senate President Stephen Parry also resigned, after confirming he was a UK dual citizen. Australia PM decries citizen 'witch hunt' Are there more Australia dual citizen MPs?

"The financial secrets of hundreds of world leaders, politicians and celebrities has been exposed in another huge leak of financial documents. Dubbed the Pandora Papers it features almost 12 million files from companies providing offshore services in tax havens around the world. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington DC, which has organised the biggest ever global investigation, spanning 117 countries and involving more than 600 journalists. In the UK the investigation has been led by BBC Panorama and the Guardian. The files are the latest in a series of whistleblower-led investigations that have rocked the world of finance in recent years. So let's round up the other major leaks of the past decade. In September 2020 theFinCEN Files exposed the failure of major global banksto stop money laundering and financial crime. They also revealed how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash. The files included more than 2,000 suspicious activity reports (SARs), filed by financial institutions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Agency, or FinCEN, a part of the US Treasury Department. They also include 17,641 records obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and other sources. They were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the ICIJ and 400 journalists around the world, including BBC Panorama, which led the investigation in the UK. A huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which revealed the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders. Who was named?The documents contained details about investments made bythe Queen's private estate, a tax avoidance schemeused by three stars of BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boysand showed thatFormula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet. They also revealed how Apple protected its low-tax regimeby using the Channel Island of Jerseyand thatPrince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreementswithout disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting. Who leaked the data?The BBC does not know the identity of the source. The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the ICIJ.Panoramaled research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including theGuardian,external, in 67 countries. A confidential settlement was later reachedbetween the BBC, the Guardian and Appleby over the reporting of the leaked documents, which Appleby said were taken by hackers. The Guardian and BBC said the reports were in the public interest but did not give more detail about the settlement. Until Pandora this leak was seen as the daddy of them all in data size. If you thought the Wikileaks dump of sensitive diplomatic cables in 2010 was a big deal, this carried 1,500 times more data. SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung's ""brothers"". Despite surnames that sound exactly the same, these two leading lights of the Panama Papers investigation, Frederik Obermaier (L) and Bastian Obermayer, are not related The Panama Papers came about after an anonymous source contacted reporters at German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,externalin 2015 and supplied encrypted documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. It sells anonymous offshore companies that help the owners hide their business dealings. Overwhelmed by the scale of the dump, which eventually grew to 2.6 terabytes of data, the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung called in theICIJ,external, which led to the involvement of about 100 other partner news organisations, including the BBC's Panorama. After more than a year of scrutiny, the ICIJ and its partners jointly published the Panama Papers on 3 April 2016,with the database of documents going online a month later. Who was named?Where do we start? A few of the news partners focused on how associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin shuffled cash around the globe. Not that the Russians cared much.The prime ministers of Iceland and Pakistan came to far stickier ends, the former quitting and the latter being thrown out of office by the Supreme Court. Overall the financial dealings of a dozen current and former world leaders, more than 120 politicians and public officials and countless billionaires, celebrities and sports stars were exposed. Who leaked the data?John Doe. Yes, we know. It's not a real name. In US crime series it is mostly used to label anonymous victims butMr (or Ms) Doe's manifesto, released a month after publication, reveals a self-styled revolutionary,external. The real identity is still unknown. Five months after the Panama Papers, the ICIJ published revelations from the Bahamas corporate registry. The 38GB cache revealed the offshore activities of ""prime ministers, ministers, princes and convicted felons"", it said.Former EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes admitted an ""oversight"" in failing to disclose her interest in an offshore company. This ICIJ investigation,involving hundreds of journalists from 45 countries,external,including BBC Panorama, went public in February 2015. It focused on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse), a subsidiary of the banking giant, and so lifted the lid on dealings in a country where banking secrecy is taken for granted. The leaked files covered accounts up to the year 2007, linked with more than 100,000 individuals and legal entities from more than 200 countries. The ICIJ said the subsidiary had served ""those close to discredited regimes"" and ""clients who had been unfavourably named by the United Nations"". HSBC admitted that the ""compliance culture and standards of due diligence"" at the subsidiary at the time were ""lower than they are today"". Who was named?The ICIJ said HSBC had profited from ""arms dealers, bag men for Third World dictators, traffickers in blood diamonds and other international outlaws"". It also cited those close to the regimes of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, former Tunisian President Ben Ali and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Leaker in chief HervÃ© Falciani - indicted, held, released Who leaked the data?Actually, we know this one.The ICIJ investigation was based on data originally leaked by the French-Italian software engineer and whistleblower HervÃ© Falciani, though the ICIJ got it later from another source. From 2008 onwards he passed information on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) to French authorities, who in turn passed them to other relevant governments. Mr Falciani was indicted in Switzerland. He was held in detention in Spain but was later released and now lives in France. Or LuxLeaks for short.Another extensive ICIJ investigation,external, which revealed its findings in November 2014. It centred on how professional services company PricewaterhouseCoopers helped multinational companies gain hundreds of favourable tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The ICIJ said multinationals had saved billions by channelling money through Luxembourg, sometimes at tax rates of less than 1%. One address in Luxembourg was home to more than 1,600 companies, it said. The leak of documents was first exposed in 2012after a joint investigation between Panorama and France2which lifted the lid on the tax agreements of UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline and media company Northern & Shell. Who was named?Pepsi, IKEA, AIG and Deutsche Bank were among those named. A second tranche of leaked documents said the Walt Disney Co and Skype had funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars in profits through Luxembourg subsidiaries. They and the other firms denied any wrongdoing. Jean-Claude Juncker had been PM of Luxembourg when it enacted many of its tax avoidance rules. He had been appointed president of the European Commission just a few days before the leak came out. He said he had not encouraged avoidance. This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker says he is ""politically responsible for what happened"" Eurosceptics went to town and pushed a censure motion against him and his commission. It was rejected. But the EU did investigate, and by 2016 had proposed a yet-to-be realised common tax scheme for the EU. Who leaked the data?Frenchman Antoine Deltour, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers employee, was the main man, saying he had acted in the public interest. Another PwC employee, Raphael Halet, helped him. (L-R) Edouard Perrin, Raphael Halet and Antoine Deltour The pair, along with journalist Edouard Perrin, were all charged in Luxembourg after a PwC complaint.A first verdictwas later revisited, watering down sentences, withDeltour given a six-month suspended jail term which was later quashed. Halet received a small fine and Mr Perrin was acquitted. This was about a tenth of the size of the Panama Papers but was seen as the biggest exposÃ© of international tax fraud ever when the ICIJ and its news partners went public in November 2012 and April 2013. Some 2.5 million files revealed the names of more than 120,000 companies and trusts in hideaways such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cook Islands. BBC Panoramaexposed a flourishing tax evasion industry in the UKin an undercover investigation based on the files. Who was named?The usual suspects. A mix of politicians, government officials and their families, with the Russians notable, but also those in China, Azerbaijan, Canada, Thailand, Mongolia and Pakistan. The Philippines - in the form of the family of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos - get a dishonourable mention. To be fair, the ICIJ does point out that the leaks are not necessarily evidence of illegal actions. Who leaked the data?The ICIJ cites ""two financial service providers, a private bank in Jersey and the Bahamas corporate registry"" as the sources, but says nothing more other than it was ""data obtained"". The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.

"The Uzbek-born billionaire is a major client of Bridgewaters An oligarch with close links to the Kremlin may have secretly taken ownership of a company responsible for anti-money laundering checks on Russian cash, theParadise Papersshow. Isle of Man-based Bridgewaters should conduct independent due diligence tests on firms it administers, including dozens linked to Alisher Usmanov. If he owns or controls the firm it would be a clear conflict of interest. He and Bridgewaters strongly deny it is owned or controlled by the Russian. Bridgewaters has been involved in major deals involving Russian cash, including the purchase of significant stakes in Facebook. The Uzbek-born billionaire is a major client of Bridgewaters and if he does own or control the company it could be carrying out financial checks on Mr Usmanov's own offshore business activities. Some of Mr Usmanov's $15.8bn (Â£9.97bn) fortune is in a private trust company called Bordeaux Limited. Bordeaux used to be managed by offshore law company Appleby, the source of much of the Paradise Papers leaks, but in 2011 the private trust's management was transferred toBridgewaters,external. An internal Appleby email from 2011 uncovered in the Paradise Papers about the transfer of Mr Usmanov's Bordeaux private trust states that ""the client has now bought a trust company in the Isle of Man (called Bridgewaters)"". Company filings show Mr Usmanov's business associate, Matthias Bolliger, was a director of Bridgewaters from 2011 to 2015. And a leaked 2015 document from the Paradise Papers lists Mr Bolliger as ""an ultimate beneficial official owner"" of the company. Author and taxation expert Nicholas Shaxson told BBC Panorama: ""These companies are supposed to have due diligence requirements to look at what their clients are doing and make sure that this is not criminal money. ""If the billionaire controls the company that's supposed to be doing the due diligence on his own stuff it's a massive conflict of interest."" Lawyers acting for Bridgewaters told BBC Panorama that their client was not secretly owned or controlled by any individual. The lawyers, who also act for Mr Bolliger, said he had never controlled Bridgewaters on behalf of any other individual and would be unable to do so as Bridgewaters was a regulated Isle of Man financial services company with a board of directors. Chief Minister for the Isle of Man Howard Quayle told Panorama he could not comment on individual cases but if there was evidence Mr Usmanov was approving his own deals ""we will have it thoroughly investigated and if there has been any wrongdoing whatsoever, we will take the relevant action. Whether that's a prosecution or withdrawal of right to operate on the Isle of Man"". Other revelations in the Paradise Papers have questioned whether Mr Usmanov may be secretly linked with both Arsenal and Everton in a way which if true could be a breach of Premier League rules. Mr Usmanov's business partner Farhad Moshiri bought a 49.9% stake in Everton. The Everton deal was administered by Bridgewaters. The company that owns Everton, Blue Heaven Holdings, is registered at Bridgewaters. One of its directors is an employee of Bridgewaters and the other is an employee of Mr Usmanov. Panorama has also seen a list of dozens of British Virgin Islands (BVI) companies linked to Mr Usmanov that are managed by Bridgewaters. Under anti-money laundering rules the true, or beneficial, owners of companies should be disclosed. However, the ownership details of most of the companies on the list remain hidden. The Panamanian law firm, Mossack Fonseca, often known as Mossfon and which was the source of last year's Panama Papers leaks, acted as an agent for Bridgewaters and was clearly frustrated by the lack of information it was getting about Mr Usmanov's companies. One Mossfon email says: ""The answers on the incorporation forms are ambiguous normally, given in a manner that can be interpreted in various ways. They are trying to give information without giving it if you know what I mean... now they have raised a bit of suspicion."" After Mossfon raised questions about compliance, Bridgewaters transferred most of its BVI companies to another financial services company, SHRM Trustees, in February 2015. The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with  corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.

"US President Donald Trump has lashed out at Japan over trade and said he would push for a fairer economic relationship between the two countries. Speaking to business leaders in Tokyo on Monday he said Japan ""has been winning"" on trade in recent decades. He also called on Japan to build more cars in America. Mr Trump's comments come at the start of a 12-day Asian tour which is expected to be dominated by North Korea and trade. The US leader said his country had ""suffered massive trade deficits at the hands of Japan for many, many years"". ""We want free and reciprocal trade but right now our trade with Japan is not free and it's not reciprocal and I know it will be and we've started the process,"" Mr Trump told the group of US and Japanese executives. He praised Japan, which counts the US as its second largest trade partner after China, for buying American military hardware. Mr Trump also said he wanted his country to be the most attractive place to hire and invest. Trump pledges US resolve on Japan leg of Asian tour What does Asia want from Donald Trump? Trump vows to tackle North Korea on Asia trip What has Trump said about your country? Japan had a $69bn (Â£52.8bn) trade surplus with the US in 2016, according to the US Treasury department. The US has a much bigger imbalance with China, which Mr Trump has long rallied against. The total trade relationship between the pair was worth $648bn last year, but trade was heavily skewed in China's favour with the US amassing a nearly $310bn deficit. Mr Trump's ""America First"" views are underpinning re-examination of trade with Asia, prompting acrackdown on China's intellectual property practicesand fresh negotiations after the US walked away from a major regional trade pact, theTrans Pacific Trade partnership.(TPP). The remaining 11 nations taking part in the TPP, which includes Japan, are proceeding with negotiations on the agreement without the US. Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe held formal talks with US president Donald Trump in Tokyo on Monday The US and Japan are now working on a new roadmap for trade, but talks could put a strain on otherwise warm relations between the two countries. Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, was the first foreign leader to meet Mr Trump following his election in November 2016. The pairplayed golf in Japan on Sundayafter which the US president described his relationship with his Japanese counterpart as ""really extraordinary"". Despite that, Mr Trump took aim at Japanese carmakers in Tokyo on Monday. ""Try building your cars in the United States instead of shipping them over. That's not too much to ask,"" the US president said at the briefing, adding, ""is that rude to ask""? Data fromthe Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association,external, a non-profit trade group, shows that in 2016, three-quarters of Japanese branded cars sold in the US were manufactured in North America. Last year, those carmakers built nearly 4 million vehicles and 4.7 million engines in the US it said. They contributed $45.6bn in total investment through 24 manufacturing plants, and 43 research and development and design centres in the US. Why is President Trump complaining about Japanese cars? It's true, as he points out, that there is a massive trade deficit between the US and Japan. Last count it was about second only to China's deficit with the US - although that's much bigger. It's also true that while a lot of Japanese cars ARE made in the US, Americans are still buying cars from Japan, along with agricultural goods, electronic components and pharmaceutical products. This doesn't wholly explain the trade gap though. The weakness of the Japanese currency, the yen, does. The weaker the yen against the US dollar, the cheaper Japanese goods are for American shoppers. But this is an old argument, which Tokyo has heard before. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be wary of any push from President Trump that will see the yen's value strengthen.

"Lord Ashcroft remained a non-dom, and continued to avoid tax despite attempts by Parliament to make peers pay their full share, leaked documents reveal. The peer was domiciled for tax purposes in Belize at a time when it was widely believed he had given up the status, the Paradise Papers show. While ordinary Britons have to pay tax on everything they earn, non-doms are only taxed on their UK income. Lord Ashcroft, who donated millions to the Tories, said he would not comment. He said it was because of the way he had been treated by BBC Panorama in the past. But his spokesman, Alan Kilkenny, is quoted in the Guardian newspaper as saying the peer had never engaged in tax evasion, abusive tax avoidance or tax avoidance using artificial structures. When questions were raised about the peer's non-dom status in 2010, he denied any ""impropriety or wrongdoing"". A former party treasurer and deputy chairman, Lord Ashcroft fell out with David Cameron in 2010 and later co-authored a controversial unauthorised biography of the then prime minister. But the 71-year-old remains involved in UK politics through his polling and publishing interests andlast year said he would start donating ""smaller sums""to the party again. Ashcroft 'ignored rules' on offshore trust Parliament tried to force the controversial peer to pay full British tax when he entered the House of Lords in 2000. Lord Ashcroft  promised to become a permanent resident in the UK - a change that would have meant giving up his status as a UK resident whose permanent home, or domicile, is outside of the country. The then leader of the Conservative Party William Hague told Parliament that becoming a peer would ""cost him [Lord Ashcroft] and benefit the Treasury tens of millions of pounds a year in tax"". This video can not be played Watch Lord Ashcroft try to avoid Richard Biltonâs questions about his offshore trust The tax was never paid because Lord Ashcroft, who was once Belize's ambassador to the United Nations and maintains links to the central American country, persuaded officials that he should be allowed to become a long term resident of the UK rather than a permanent one. A distinction that allowed him to retain his non-dom status. The leaked documents show that between 2000 and 2010, Lord Ashcroft received payments of around $200m (Â£150m) from his offshore trust in the Bermuda. The Tory Peer continued to sit in the House of Lords and as a non-dom he did not have to pay tax on these payments. Lord Ashcroft's admission in 2010 that he was still a non-dom led to a major political controversy and the introduction of legislation designed to force anybody who sits in Parliament to pay full British tax. After Lord Ashcroft told the BBC in May 2010 he was going to become ""a fully taxed person in Britain"",  it was widely reported he had given up his non-dom status. TheConservative Party also gave such an indication,externalon 7 July that same year. However, documents seen by the BBC's Panorama, reveal ""his true domicile is Belize"". The new law, theConstitutional Reform and Governance Act,external,  had not specified that non-dom MPs and peers would have to give up the status - only that they be ""treated as domiciled in the UK"" by the tax authorities. It meant Lord Ashcroft had to pay full British tax while he sat in Parliament, but as soon as he resigned from the House of Lords in March 2015 he was also a non-dom again in the eyes of UK revenue inspectors. The Paradise Papers suggest Lord Ashcroft worked around the new law to continue avoiding tax on his worldwide income between 2010 and 2015. On the 31 March 2010, the day before the new law came into effect, Lord Ashcroft's offshore trust bought shares worth Â£33.9m from one of his companies. His advisers note that the deal has ""capital gains tax implications"" but they point out he is ""not domiciled in the UK at the moment"". If the deal had happened the following day, he would have been treated differently and could have been liable for capital gains tax. Lord Ashcroft with William Hague and Ffion Hague in 2006 While he was sitting in the Lords as a full British taxpayer between 2010 and 2015, Lord Ashcroft appears to have stopped taking payments from his offshore trust. One of his advisers notes ""that there is no applicable tax as there is no distributable income"". The accounts for the trust show Lord Ashcroft didn't receive any payments in 2011, 2012 or 2013. The accounts for 2014 and 2015 were not in the leaked documents. Lord Ashcroft announced his resignation,externalfrom the House of Lords in March 2015. A week later, he sold shares worth Â£11.2m. If he had still been sitting in Parliament, he would have been liable for capital gains tax on any profits from the sale. But Lord Ashcroft was being treated as a non-dom again and could legally avoid the tax. Journalist Peter Oborne says Lord Ashcroft's non-dom status was a ""huge issue"" at the time he started to sit in the Lords and there was ""fresh controversy"" when the Tories entered power in 2010. The revelations in the Paradise Papers could cause a ""major political explosion,"" he said.  ""The Labour Party... will turn it into a first class political row. It will raise huge questions about not just the Conservatives [but] also the House of Lords."" The Conservative Party did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.

On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Prince denied that Charles had spoken out
on the climate-change deals in order to benefit financially. ""The Prince has never chosen to speak out on a topic simply because of a
company that The Duchy may have invested in,"" he said.
 ""In the case of climate change his views are well-known, indeed he has been

"Catalan independence supporters protested outside the prosecutor's office in Brussels Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and four former ministers have been freed with conditions by an investigating judge in Belgium. The judge said they could not leave the country without permission and had to give details of their accommodation. They had handed themselves in to Belgian police following an EU arrest warrant issued by a Spanish judge. Mr Puigdemont fled to Belgium after Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia following an independence declaration. He has said he will not return to Spain unless he is guaranteed a fair trial. The five are wanted in Spain to face charges including rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Mr Puigdemont could be seen inside the public prosecutor's office in Brussels They are now expected to appear in court in Belgium within 15 days. Belgium has a maximum of 60 days to return the five to Spain but, if they do not raise legal objections, a transfer could happen much sooner. Catalonia's longest week The man who wants to break up Spain Catalonia crisis: What next for Spain? ""The request made this afternoon by the Brussels' Prosecutor's Office for the provisional release of all persons sought has been granted by the investigative judge,"" said a statement by the Belgian prosecutor's office. This video can not be played In Catalonia, this small town is divided over independence Mr Puigdemont's political party, PDeCAT, said he had surrendered to police to show his ""willingness not to flee from the judicial process but to defend himself in a fair and impartial process, which is possible in Belgium, and highly doubtful in Spain"". Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy imposed direct rule on Catalonia following a declaration of independence in the regional parliament. He sacked Mr Puigdemont, dissolved the parliament and called local elections for 21 December. The declaration of independence followed a referendum that the Spanish constitutional court had declared illegal. Mr Puigdemont's colleagues also listed on the EU arrest warrant are Meritxell Serret (former agriculture minister), Antoni ComÃ­n (former health minister), LluÃ­s Puig (former culture minister), and Clara PonsatÃ­ (former education minister). From left to right, Meritxell Serret, Antoni ComÃ­n, LluÃ­s Puig and Clara PonsatÃ­ have also handed themselves in They all handed themselves in to Belgian federal police, accompanied by their lawyers, on Sunday morning and were questioned in a hearing lasting 10 hours. There were more protests in Catalan cities on Sunday against the detention of officials and activists held by the Spanish authorities. Protesters plastered city squares with posters depicting the detainees as political prisoners.

"Malcolm Turnbull says the new declarations will help achieve transparency in Canberra Australia's Prime Minister has announced new rules to make all federal politicians declare their citizenship status. It comes amid a dual citizenship saga, which has led to six politicians losing their office. In Australia, dual citizens are not allowed to run for federal office. Malcolm Turnbull unveiled the new disclosure rules on Monday in a bid to clear up the uncertainty around politicians' eligibility in Canberra. The plan will need to be voted on in both the upper and lower houses in Australia's parliament, before coming into force. Are there more Australia dual citizen MPs? Under the new plan, politicians will be obliged to make a formal declaration about their citizenship status, as well as provide details about the time and place of their birth, and the time and place of birth of their parents. If the politicians had citizenship of another country they will also be required to detail when and how they renounced it. Current politicians will have 21 days to make the declaration, while future members of parliament will be required to make the declaration when they are elected. ""What we have seen is a concern, a legitimate concern that there is insufficient transparency,"" Mr Turnbull said on Monday. ""Members and senators have been put squarely on notice now and so they will be turning their mind to their own affairs and the issues of citizenship."" The plan comes followingweeks of pressureon the Turnbull government to carry out an audit of all sitting federal politicians. Last month, Australia's highest court decided that five politicians - including Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce - were invalidly elected because they held dual citizenship. Many of the politicians had argued that they had not been aware they were dual nationals due to their parents or place of birth. Last week Australian Senate President Stephen Parry also resigned, after confirming he was a UK dual citizen. Australia PM decries citizen 'witch hunt' Are there more Australia dual citizen MPs?

"This video can not be played Teenagers have been speaking about the 'dangers' of sexting Police investigations into children sharing sexual images of themselves and others have more than doubled in two years, figures have shown. Forces in England and Wales recorded 6,238 underage ""sexting"" offences in 2016-17, a rate of 17 a day. Police said they received reports from children as young as 10. Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, said: ""There is a worrying upward trend."" He added social networks needed to remove indecent images more quickly. The number of cases where under-18s were sharing indecent or prohibited images was up by a third on the 4,681 offences recorded the previous year, and represented a 131% rise on 2014-15, with 2,700 incidents. BBC Advice - Sexting Children 'should be taught about pornography and sexting' Mr Bailey, who is head of Norfolk Constabulary, said: ""Sharing and possessing these images is against the law. Once an image is shared with others it can cause deep embarrassment and distress."" As well as calling for faster action from social media companies, he said schools needed to do more to counteract the influence of pornography. He said: ""I am concerned about the impact that exposure to extreme pornography can have on children so we need to consider if a lack of universal relationship and sex education is compounding the problem."" Police said the youngest children involved in sexting inquiries were aged 10, while the number of offences investigated was at its peak among 14-year-olds. Girls were more likely to be the victims, but suspects or perpetrators were evenly split between boys and girls. Investigators noted that reports of offences declined substantially in August, suggesting children were more at risk in school term time. The figures cover a period in which the College of Policing introduced new guidance, aimed at assuaging concerns that teenagers might be routinely criminalised by laws on sexting. It said that officers should record all cases of under-18s sharing images of themselves or other children as crimes. However, formal action only needs to be taken where there is exploitation, coercion or wider child protection issues. There were more than 2,000 such cases where police determined that further action was not in the public interest in 2016-17. Mr Bailey said: ""Forces are risk-assessing every case to ensure we are not unnecessarily stigmatising children and saddling them with a criminal record. ""But there will always be a criminal investigation where we see that young people are being coerced, exploited or blackmailed."" The NSPCC said the rise in sexting incidents is ""extremely worrying"". ""It is vital that parents and schools talk to children about the dangers of sexting as soon as they are given any technology,"" the charity said.

"This video can not be played Witnesses Phil and Kim Dick say they shouted for paramedics Many of the most seriously injured victims of the Manchester Arena attack did not get expert medical help for more than an hour, witnesses have said. Twenty-two people were killed and 512 injured by suicide bomber Salman Abediat an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. Only three paramedics ever entered the cordoned-off foyer area at the centre of the blast, in line with the major incident plan, the BBC has been told. Injured people inside were later taken to medical staff gathered outside by members of the public and police. Phil and Kim Dick, from Bradford, were in the arena foyer at the time of the explosion, waiting for their daughter and granddaughter to come out of the concert. They told BBC Inside Out a young victim with ""horrific"" injuries collapsed in front of them. Manchester attack: Who were the victims? Who carried out the attack? Mrs Dick said she sat with the girl, who survived, for more than an hour. ""She could hardly walk,"" she said. ""She was stumbling, bleeding from her arm and her mouth and her leg, and her hair was burnt. ""I just kept shouting: 'We need paramedics now'. And they [armed police] just said: 'We're just making sure there are no more bombs'."" Phil and Kim Dick were waiting to collect their daughter and granddaughter at the time of the explosion ""There was just too much for just three paramedics to deal with,"" Mr Dick added. ""The longer it went on the more silent it became. It was really eerie and people who I had seen a little earlier, who were severely injured, were now dead."" Mr Dick said he believed a decision was made ""about an hour and 10 minutes after the explosion that the medical staff weren't coming up to the foyer but were going to evacuate all the casualties"". While we have been able to piece together much of what happened on that terrible night, several key questions remain unanswered: Why did only three paramedics make it into the foyer to treat the seriously injured? One of them has told the BBC that police were worried about a second bomb. Did police prevent more from entering this so-called ""hot zone""? Or was this call made by ambulance chiefs? Similarly, why did it take an hour and 47 minutes after the explosion for fire officers to deploy at all? It's thought fire chiefs made that call. Ultimately those in the unenviable position of being in command on the night had a terrible dilemma on their hands. Did they deploy their staff - thereby potentially exposing them to the risk of being caught up in a second blast or facing marauding terrorists - to try to save the critically injured? Eight days after the bomb, Chief Constable Ian Hopkins told BBC Radio Manchester his force had been on the scene ""within seconds"" and one of its roles had been to co-ordinate the emergency services' response. He said his force had contacted North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) within three minutes of the incident being declared and the ambulance service had followed its major incident plan. Both the fire and ambulance services initially went to a rendezvous point as per standard practice, he said. Mr Hopkins added: ""The ambulance service were called forward and, at this stage, I am unsure as to why the fire service were delayed so long."" The BBC has ascertained one paramedic was already inside the inner cordon by the time it was established, and that two specially trained paramedics joined him. Thereafter no other paramedics entered the foyer, which was known as the ""hot zone"". In a statement, NWAS said that despite the ""clear risk"", the decision was made to allow three staff into the foyer. ""Their job was to triage the injured and work with police to move people to a place close by where they could be treated safely - and where 25 paramedics were waiting, in accordance with our major incident plan. ""Within an hour all critical patients had been moved and were being treated by 50 paramedics. Some people had already been taken to hospital. Within four hours, all the injured that required hospital care had been transferred. ""This is the clinical model used in all major incidents. ""The Kerslake inquiry will fully review the processes that we used and we welcome any findings or lessons learnt that may be provided as a result but we are confident in our response which followed implementation of our major incident plan."" In total, 56 ambulances and seven rapid response vehicles were deployed to the incident, NWAS added. Abedi detonated his home-made device, packed full of nuts and bolts so as to maximise casualties, at 22:31 BST. BBC Inside Out has also learned that Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) did not deploy crews to the arena until one hour and 47 minutes later, at 00:18. A serving GMFRS firefighter, who wants to remain anonymous, told the BBC that the paramedics were asking where the fire service was. ""People were dying, why weren't we there? We were just helpless. ""I don't want the public to think that we didn't want to go or were scared to go, we were held back by the senior management. ""There were homeless people helping, members of the public helping. I'm a paid public servant and I wanted to help, I just wasn't allowed to help. ""The hairs are standing up on the back of my neck because it's embarrassing that we weren't allowed to go."" Another firefighter, who also did not want to be named, told the BBC: ""There were rumours that some people wanted to self-deploy because they were watching ambulances drive past their fire station and they were wondering why they hadn't been tasked to the event."" An anonymous firefighter said there were rumours people ""wanted to self-deploy"" GMFRS said it had conducted a ""debrief"" of its response to the deadliest terror attack in the UK since thebombing of the London transport network on 7 July 2005. But it said it would be inappropriate to comment further,given the fact it was co-operating with an ongoing review by Lord Kerslake into the Manchester attack, commissioned by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. The BBC asked all 49 fire brigades in the UK whether their firefighters were covered by their service's insurance in the event of injury or death while attending a terrorist attack. Merseyside was the only fire service to confirm explicitly it has insurance in place for its officers to respond to terrorist attacks. In a statement on Sunday, GMFRS said its employers' liability insurance covers firefighters attending such incidents. Lord Kerslake's interim report is due to be published in early 2018. The BBC has been told the deadline for submissions to the inquiry is to be extended to 24 November.

"The previous contract ended in September 2017 The BBC has extended its contract with the Met Office to supply weather information after its replacement provider failed to be ready in time. Meteogroup was expected to take over providing meteorological data for TV, radio and online in spring 2017. But delays mean the Met Office's contract will now end in March 2018. In August 2015,the BBC announced it was changing weather forecasting providerto ""secure the best value for money for licence fee payers"". At the time, it said the contract change would save the corporation ""millions of pounds"". The previous deal with the Met Office, which has provided the data used for BBC forecasts since the corporation's first radio weather bulletin in 1922, ended on 30 September 2017. A Met Office spokeswoman said: ""As the UK's national weather service we will always ensure the UK public have the weather information they need so they can make informed decisions. ""We are continuing to provide the BBC with their weather services, having signed a contract out to March 2018."" When Meteogroup takes over the service, the BBC will continue to show all national severe weather warnings as agreed with the Exeter-based Met Office. Under the terms of the deal, the BBC will also be supported by the UK's national meteorological service at times of severe weather.

"This video can not be played May: Allegations must be properly investigated Theresa May has called for a ""new culture of respect"" ahead of a meeting with other party leaders to discuss the Westminster sexual misconduct scandal. The PM said in a speech to the CBI that people should know their complaints will be investigated properly. It comes as several Conservative and Labour MPs are investigated over claims of sexual misconduct. On Sunday Conservative MP Chris Pincher stepped down as a government whip after allegations about his behaviour. Mr Pincher has also referred himself to police and the Conservative Party's complaints procedure following newspaper reports of allegations about his conduct in 2001 made by a party activist. It follows the resignation of Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary following complaints about his behaviour and amid a Cabinet Office inquiry into the conduct of First Secretary of State Damian Green. Chris Pincher is the MP for Tamworth in Staffordshire Dover MP Charlie Elphicke, who denies wrongdoing, has been suspended from the party after ""serious allegations"" against him were referred to the police and three other Conservative MPs who deny wrongdoing - Stephen Crabb, Dan Poulter and Daniel Kawczynski - have been referred to the party's disciplinary committee after media allegations about their conduct. Labour has also suspended an MP - Kelvin Hopkins, who denies claims he made inappropriate physical contact with a Labour activist in 2004 - and is investigating a formal complaint made against Clive Lewis, who denies groping a woman. The party has also launched an independent investigation after Labour activist Bex Bailey said she had been raped at a party event in 2011 and discouraged by a senior official from reporting the attack. In a speech at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference Mrs May said: ""We need to establish a new culture of respect at the centre of our public life. ""One in which everyone can feel confident that they are working in a safe and secure environment, where complaints can be brought forward without prejudice and victims know that these complaints will be investigated properly. ""Political parties have not always got this right in the past. But I am determined to get it right for the future."" Tory rape claims 'ignored by Commons' Growing number of MPs under scrutiny What counts as inappropriate behaviour- She is due to meet other party leaders later to discuss setting up an independent grievance procedure for Parliament. ""Those working for Members of Parliament should not have to navigate different party systems depending on their employer's political affiliation,"" the prime minister told the CBI. ""What has been revealed over the last few weeks has been deeply troubling - and has understandably led to significant public unease. ""Women and men should be able to work free from the threat or fear of harassment, bullying or intimidation. ""But for too long the powerful have been able to abuse their power, and their victims have not felt able to speak out."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the CBI conference that everyone, including businesses, ""have a duty to act, and act now"" over sexual harassment. He said: ""Such abuse, sexism and misogyny is, sadly, very far from being confined to Hollywood and the corridors of power, but is also widespread in our schools and universities, in our businesses and workplaces, in our newspapers and on our TV screens. It is all around us. ""That must change and business has an essential role to play. All of you need to look hard at yourselves, as we in the Labour Party are doing ourselves, to see how your processes and procedures can be improved. How it can be made easier for women to speak out and for victims to get the support they have a right to expect."" Meanwhile, Mr Green, Mrs May's most senior minister, is to be interviewed as part of the Cabinet Office investigation into his conduct. The inquiry was triggered after Kate Maltby, who is three decades younger than him, claimed he ""fleetingly"" touched her knee during a meeting in a Waterloo pub in 2015, and a year later sent her a ""suggestive"" text message after she was pictured wearing a corset in the newspaper. Damian Green said the allegations were from a ""tainted and untrustworthy source"" Mr Green said any allegation that he made sexual advances to Ms Maltby was ""untrue (and) deeply hurtful"". The inquiry was broadened after the Sunday Times reported that a statement prepared by ex-Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick alleged pornography was discovered by officers searching Mr Green's parliamentary office following a spate of leaks of Home Office information in 2008. Mr Green said the claims were ""completely untrue"" and ""political smears"".

"Prince Mansour was the son of former Crown Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz A senior Saudi prince and seven other officials have been killed in a helicopter crash near the country's border with Yemen, state media report. Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, the deputy governor of Asir province, was returning from an inspection tour when his aircraft came down near Abha late on Sunday, the interior ministry said. It did not give a cause for the crash. The incident came hours after a major purge of the kingdom's political and business leadership. An anti-corruption body led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32, ordered the detentions of dozens of people, including 11 princes, four ministers and dozens of ex-ministers. Analysts see the unprecedented move as an attempt to cement the power of the heir to the throne. Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles Mohammed bin Salman, power behind the throne Prince Mansour was the son of Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, a former intelligence chief who was crown prince between January and April 2015, when he was pushed aside by Prince Mohammed's father, King Salman, now 81. Mansour served as a consultant to his father's royal court and in April 2017 wasamong eight young royals appointed deputy governors,external. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent These are heady and unpredictable times in Saudi Arabia. The Arab world's richest country is undergoing seismic changes almost unprecedented in its 85-year history as a sovereign nation. The idea of dozens of familiar pillars of the establishment all being publicly and humiliatingly removed from office and detained, albeit in great comfort, would have been unthinkable just three years ago. But the conservative, stodgy, risk-averse Saudi Arabia of old is under new management these days. Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who is leading the official anti-corruption purge, appears determined to take on all comers in his drive to both modernise the country and eliminate all opposition, both secular and religious. He is popular with young Saudis but critics say he is playing for high stakes, risking a dangerous backlash. An interior ministry statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency said the prince and seven provincial officials had boarded a helicopter on Sunday morning to tour a number of coastal projects west of the city of Abha. ""While returning in the evening of the same day, contact with the plane was lost in the vicinity of the Reda reserve,"" it added. ""The authorities are currently searching for survivors as the wreckage has been found."" Later, state news channel al-Ikhbariya announced the death of the prince. It also posted on Twitterphotographs of the wreckage,externalanda video showing the prince and his companions using the helicopter hours before their deaths,external. Allow Twitter content?

The interior ministry statement did not draw any link between the crash and the conflict, but on Saturday the Saudi military intercepted and destroyed a ballistic missile near the capital, Riyadh, that was fired by Houthi fighters. On Sunday, the Saudi-led coalition said it was closing all of Yemen's air, land and sea borders in response to the missile attack. It accused Iran of supplying the missile, and said that it might amount to an act of war on Tehran's part.
