"Fina, swimming's world governing body, has voted to stop transgender athletes from competing in women's elite races if they have gone through any part of the process of male puberty. Fina will also aim to establish an 'open' category at competitions for swimmers whose gender identity is different than their birth sex. The new policy, which was passed with 71% of the vote from 152 Fina members, was described as ""only a first step towards full inclusion"" for transgender athletes. The 34-page policy document says that male-to-female transgender athletes could compete in the women's category - but only ""provided they have not experienced any part of male puberty beyond Tanner Stage 2 [which marks the start of physical development], or before age 12, whichever is later"". The decision was made during an extraordinary general congress at the ongoing World Championships in Budapest. It means that transgender American college swimmerLia Thomas,who has expressed a desire to compete for a place at the Olympics, would be blocked from participating in the female category at the Games. However, the policy does not apply to national federations or the US college championships, the NCAAs, at which Thomas recently won in the 500-yard freestyle. Instead, each national federation - including British Swimming - will need to decide if it is to implement the Fina policy. British Swimming told BBC Sport it would ""take time to review [the policy's] content"" before making any further comment. The NCAA said it ""continues its evidence-based evaluation of transgender student-athlete participation in college sports"" and ""will carefully consider"" any updates to its policy. Earlier, Fina members heard a report from a transgender task force made up of leading figures from the world of medicine, law and sport. ""Fina's approach in drafting this policy was comprehensive, science-based and inclusive, and, importantly, Fina's approach emphasised competitive fairness,"" said Brent Nowicki, the governing body's executive director. Fina president Husain Al-Musallam said the organisation was trying to ""protect the rights of our athletes to compete"" but also ""protect competitive fairness"". He said: ""Fina will always welcome every athlete. The creation of an open category will mean that everybody has the opportunity to compete at an elite level. This has not been done before, so Fina will need to lead the way. I want all athletes to feel included in being able to develop ideas during this process."" Former Great Britain swimmer Sharron Davies, who has argued against transgender participation in women's elite swimming, told BBC Sport she was ""really proud of Fina"". ""Four years ago, along with 60 other Olympic medallists, I wrote to the IOC (International Olympic Committee) and said 'Please just do the science first' and no governing body has done the science until now,"" she said. ""That is what Fina has done. They've done the science, they've got the right people on board, they've spoken to the athletes, and coaches. ""Swimming is a very inclusive sport, we love everyone to come and swim and be involved. But the cornerstone of sport is that it has to be fair and it has to be fair for both sexes."" Asked whether Fina's policy left trans athletes ""in limbo"" while they waited for an open category to be created, Davies praised Fina for having conversations around trans inclusion that should have ""happened five years ago"". ""Sport by definition is exclusionary - we don't have 15-year-old boys racing in the under-12s, we don't have heavyweight boxers in with the bantamweights, the whole reason we have lots of different classes in the Paralympics is so that we can create fair opportunities for everybody,"" she said. ""So that is the whole point of having classifications in sports and the only people who were going to be losing out were females - they were losing their right to fair sport."" Ex-GB swimmer Karen Pickering told BBC Radio 4: ""I empathise that there will be people who now can't compete in the category that they identify with as their gender. That is very sad and I do understand that, but in this situation inclusivity and fairness cannot be compatible and the science has shown that there is just no way to make that compatible."" However, 'Athlete Ally' - an LGBT advocacy group which organised a letter of support for Thomas in February, called the new policy ""discriminatory, harmful, unscientific and not in line with the 2021 IOC principles"". ""The eligibility criteria for the women's category as it is laid out in the policy polices the bodies of all women, and will not be enforceable without seriously violating the privacy and human rights of any athlete looking to compete in the women's category,"" said Anne Lieberman, the group's director of policy and programmes. Australia's four-time Olympic champion Cate Campbell had addressed Fina before the decision was made, asking the governing body to ""uphold the cornerstone of fairness"". However, fellow Australian swimmer Maddie Groves has criticised Campbell's comments, asking if she was ""OK with ostracising an already marginalised group"". ""There are already gender diverse people in swimming and I'm guessing they're not feeling very accepted right now,"" Groves said onTwitter,external. ""Shame on everyone that supported this discriminatory and unscientific decision."" Joanna Harper, who is studying transgender athletes for her PhD at Loughborough University and is a transgender athlete herself, says Fina's decision is not necessary to ""ensure meaningful competition for all women"". ""Currently, there are no trans women competing in swimming at an international level so effectively this ruling doesn't currently ban anyone,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""If USA Swimming adopts it, it will affect Lia Thomas, but it doesn't right now."" She fears an open category would increase marginalisation and discrimination, saying the introduction of such a category is ""not likely"" to work. ""It's likely to be more of a sideshow and it's not going to have the number of competitors qualifying, compared to the male or female categories,"" she said. ""Are they going to have Olympic medals for this open category? Will there be professional swimmers in an open category? I don't know for sure, it might potentially work but I doubt that it would be meaningful."" Trans athletes no threat to women's sport - Thomas Newsnight report - should trans athletes compete in female categories? Listen to The Sports Desk podcast: Sport's transgender conundrum Q&A: Transgender women in sport - key questions answered What do the scientists say?' Fina's decision followsa move on Thursday by the UCI, cycling's governing body, to double the period of time before a rider transitioning from male to female can compete in women's races. The issue in swimming has been catapulted into the spotlight by the experiences of American Thomas. In March, Thomas became the first known transgender swimmer to win the highest US national college title with victory in the women's 500-yard freestyle. Thomas swam for the Pennsylvanian men's team for three seasons before starting hormone replacement therapy in spring 2019. She has since broken records for her university swimming team. More than 300 college, Team USA and Olympic swimmers signed an open letter in support of Thomas and all transgender and non-binary swimmers, but other athletes and organisations have raised concerns about trans inclusion. Some of Thomas' team-mates and their parents wrote anonymous letters supporting her right to transition, but added it was unfair for her to compete as a woman. USA Swimming updated its policy for elite swimmersin Februaryto allow transgender athletes to swim in elite events, alongside criteria that aim to reduce any unfair advantage, including testosterone tests for 36 months before competitions. Last year, weightlifter Laurel Hubbard from New Zealand became the the first openly transgender athlete to compete at an Olympics in a different sex category to that in which they were born. Schuyler Bailar - the first transgender athlete to compete for an NCAA division one men's swimming team - was one of the swimmers to sign the open letter. Speaking on social media about Fina's policy, he said: ""This is not about preserving fairness, it is not about protecting women's sports. ""It is about trying to exclude trans people and it continues the policing of women's bodies and sports, it continues the degradation and othering of trans people."" Dr Michael Joyner, a physiologist and leading expert in human performance ""Testosterone in male puberty alters the physiological determinants of human performance and explains the sex-based differences in human performance, considered clearly evident by age 12. ""Even if testosterone is suppressed, its performance enhancing effects will be retained."" Dr Adrian Jjuuko, an activist, researcher and lawyer ""The policy emphasises that no athlete is excluded from Fina competition or setting Fina records based on their legal gender, gender identity or gender expression. ""[The proposed open category] should not become a category that adds to the already existing levels of discrimination and marginalisation against these groups. ""I see this policy as only the first step towards full inclusion and support for the participation of transgender and gender-diverse athletes in aquatic sports, and there is a lot more to be done."" Dr Sandra Hunter, an exercise physiologist specialising in sex and age differences in athletic performance ""By 14 years or older, the difference between boys and girls is substantial. That's due to the advantages experienced due to the physiological adaptations in testosterone and the possession of the Y chromosome. ""Some of these physical advantages are structural in origin such as height, limb length, heart size, lung size and they will be retained, even with the suppression or reduction of testosterone that occurs in the transition from male to female."" Summer Sanders, former Olympic and world champion in swimming ""This is not easy. There must be categories - women's, men's and of course a category for trans women and trans men. ""Fair competition is a stronghold and staple of our community - this approach safeguards the integrity of the existing sports process in which millions of girls and women participate annually."" The conversation around the inclusion of transgender women in women's sport has divided opinion both inside and outside the sporting sphere. Many argue transgender womenshould not competein women's sport because of any advantages they may retain - but others argue sport should be more inclusive. World Athletics president Lord Coe has said the ""integrity"" and ""future"" of women's sport would be ""very fragile"" if sporting organisations get regulations for transgender athletes wrong. British Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsaid in Aprilhe did not believe transgender women should compete in female sporting events. On Sunday, culture secretary Nadine Dorries told radio station LBC she would ""encourage other sports"" to follow Fina's lead and that ""fairness should always trump inclusion as a principle"". The heart of the debate on whether transgender women athletes should compete in women's sport involves the complex balance of inclusion, sporting fairness and safety - essentially, whether trans women can compete in female categories without giving them an unfair advantage or presenting a threat of injury to competitors. Trans women have to adhere to a number of rules to compete in specific sports, including in many cases lowering their testosterone levels to a certain amount, for a set period of time, before competing. There are concerns, however, as highlighted in Fina's decision, that athletes retain an advantage from going through male puberty that is not addressed by lowering testosterone.

"This video can not be played ""Once we did the sound check I was 10 feet tall"" A choir performed on their biggest stage for Stereophonics fans after frontman Kelly Jones bumped into an old teacher in a supermarket. Cwmbach Male Choir director Mike Thomas used to teach at Jones's school, the former Blaengwawr Comprehensive in Aberaman, Rhondda Cynon Taf. The pair met while shopping and Jones agreed they could work together after hearing the choir was celebrating its centenary in 2021. ""It's been a dream,"" said Mr Thomas. He explained how the band's management got in touch to ask them to perform last year but that had to be postponed due to the Covid pandemic. Allow Instagram content?

"The new head of the British Army has issued a rallying cry to troops - telling them they need to be ready to face Russia on the battlefield. Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, who started the job last week, addressed all ranks and civil servants in an internal message on 16 June, seen by the BBC. Russia's invasion of Ukraine shows the need ""to protect the UK and be ready to fight and win wars on land"", he says. He adds the Army and allies must now be ""capable of...defeating Russia"". A defence source told the BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale the tone of the message - issued on the Ministry of Defence's internal intranet - was unsurprising. They said all armies train to fight, but the threat has clearly changed. Gen Sir Patrick noted in the message that he was the first Chief of the General Staff ""since 1941 to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a major continental power"". He added: ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of force."" He noted ""the world has changed since the 24th February and there is now a burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies and defeating Russia in battle"". Gen Sir Patrick also set out his goal to ""accelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of Europeâ¦ we are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once again"". Gen Sir Patrick Sanders is a former Commander of Strategic Command and has commanded operations in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan The Russian invasion of Ukraine has changed the outlook and context for the Army, which faces cuts to the workforce in the coming years. In March 2021, the government announced a reduction in the number of soldiersit plans to have in the Armyto 72,500 by 2025. Defence spending in the UK has seen an increase of Â£3bn a year in real terms since 2016-17, following a real-terms cut in funding of Â£6.6bn between 2010 and 2017. Russia spends about 4.14% of its gross domestic product on its military, while the UK spends about 2.33%, according to data from IISS Global Military Balance 2020. Before Russia's invasion, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs last November that he believed the era of tanks rolling through Europe was behind us. Challenged over defence spending in light of growing Russian aggression, Mr Johnson said at the time: ""We have to recognise that the old concepts of fighting big tank battles on European land mass are over and there are other better things we should be investing in."" He said enhanced air combat systems and cyber strategies were ""how warfare in the future is going to be fought... and that is where we need to be"".

"The ban will not apply to Russian composers who died before the collapse of the Soviet Union Ukraine's parliament has voted in favour of banning some Russian music in media and public spaces. The ban will not apply to all Russian music, but rather relates to music created or performed by those who are or were Russian citizens after 1991. Artists who have condemned Russia's war in Ukraine can apply for an exemption from the ban. The import of books from Russia and Belarus will also be prohibited under the legislation. Many of those living in areas of east and south Ukraine have historically felt a strong connection to Russia, often speaking Russian as their first language. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led many Ukrainians to want to separate themselves from Russian culture. The bill, approved by MPs on Sunday, bans some Russian music from being played or performed on television, radio, schools, public transport, hotels, restaurants, cinemas and other public spaces. It secured support from 303 of the 450 deputies in the Ukrainian parliament. The document says the ban will ""minimise the risks of possible hostile propaganda through music in Ukraine and will increase the volume of national music products in the cultural space,"" BBC Monitoring reports. The ban will apply to musicians who have or had Russian citizenship at any time after 1991 - the year Ukraine declared independence - except for those who are Ukrainian citizens or were so at the time of their death. This means the works of long-dead Russian composers such as Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich can still be performed. Russian artists who condemn the war in Ukraine can apply for an exemption for their music by submitting an application to Ukraine's security service. In it, they must state that they support the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine, call on Russia to immediately stop its aggression against Ukraine, and undertake to refrain from any steps that contradict these written statements, the BBC's Ukrainian Service reports. The document also includes laws to increase the share of Ukrainian songs played on the radio to 40%, as well as increasing the use of Ukrainian in daily programmes to 75%, Ukraine's public broadcaster (Suspilne) reports. In a parallel bill to that affecting music, books imported from Russia, Belarus and occupied Ukrainian territories will also banned, as well as material in Russian imported from other countries. This law will ban the publishing and distributing of books written by Russian citizens (with similar exemptions to those for music) though this will not apply to books already published in Ukraine. In addition, translations of books will only be published in Ukrainian, official EU languages or indigenous Ukrainian languages.

"MicheÃ¡l Martin warned that there was an issue around trust Plans by the UK government toscrap parts of the post-Brexit trade deal it agreed with the EUwould be ""economic vandalism"" on Northern Ireland, the taoiseach (Irish PM) has said. The government wants to change the Northern Ireland Protocol to make it easier for some goods to flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. MicheÃ¡l Martin said they would damage Northern Ireland's economy. But DUP MP Sammy Wilson said Mr Martin was ""focused on Dublin's interests"". Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, the taoiseach said that the legislation was unacceptable and represented  ""unilateralism of the worst kind"". ""We accept fully that there are legitimate  issues around the operation of the protocol and we believe that with serious sustained negotiations between the EU and the UK government those issues could be resolved,"" he said. Mr Martin said other parts of the bill, namely dual regulatory standards, could be severely damaging to the Northern Ireland economy. ""It is deeply concerning to industry and businesses in Northern Ireland... in effect it represents a form of economic vandalism on Northern Ireland,"" he said. Mr Martin said data showed the Northern Ireland economy was ""doing very well"" under the protocol and argued that this was not being articulated enough by the UK government. But the DUP's MP for East Antrim, Sammy Wilson, accused the taoiseach of failing to recognise ""the flaws of the protocol"". ""From day one Dublin has done what's in Dublin's interests and never once prioritised consensus in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""Not one unionist MP or MLA supports the protocol but instead of Dublin trying to understand or recognise our objections, they repeatedly lecture us, talk down to us and demand we change our mind. He added: ""It's time for Dublin to step back and recognise that the reason we find ourselves without a fully operating devolved institution is because of their determination to steamroller over unionist objections."" Sinn FÃ©in's vice-president Michelle O'Neill said it was an ""irrefutable fact that the protocol is working"". Speaking at the annual Wolfe Tone commemoration in Bodenstown, Co Kildare, Ms O'Neill said the UK government's attempt to change the protocol ""discards international law at a whim in such a reckless way"". She said: ""There is a majority in the assembly who support the protocol because it is working, giving us continued access to the European single market, creating jobs and economic benefit."" The protocol prevents a hard border with the Republic of Ireland, but it means checks on some goods arriving into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK. The arrangement is opposed by unionists in Northern Ireland because it creates a trade border in the Irish Sea and they argue it undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK. At the centre of the government's plan to ease the impact on businesses is the concept of green lanes and red lanes for trade. This would mean: Goods coming from Great Britain (GB) into Northern Ireland (NI) and which are staying would use the green lane. This means there would be no checks and paperwork would be minimal. GB goods moving through NI into Ireland or the wider European Union would use the red lane and continue to be checked at NI ports. London also wants any trade disputes resolved by ""independent arbitration"" and not by the European Court of Justice, and Northern Ireland to benefit from the same tax breaks as elsewhere in the UK. The government says there is ""no other way"" of safeguarding essential interests of the UK. But the EU opposes the move, saying going back on the deal breaches international law. Draft legislation from the UK government this week to overturn parts of the protocol includes the use of a green lane for goods arriving into Northern Ireland from GB Mr Martin said the EU had been flexible trying to come up with solutions to issues with the protocol. The European Commission tabled proposals in October 2021 to reduce the post-Brexit checks on goods and medicines arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. At the heart of the plan was the idea of an ""express lane"", to allow for a reduction in the level of paperwork and checks on goods coming into and remaining in Northern Ireland from GB. But the proposals werepublicly rejected by the UK in May. London said they did not address the core problems presented by the protocol, would require more checks and controls than under the current ""grace period"" regime, and would result in the disappearance from Northern Ireland supermarket shelves of certain products. The trade deal governs how goods enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and was agreed by the UK government and the European Union following the Brexit vote in 2019. It was designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland when the UK left the European Union. The protocol led to the creation of new goods checks at Northern Ireland sea ports on some products from Great Britain, effectively creating a new trade border in the Irish Sea. Unionist parties, including the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), argue that this has led to extra costs and unnecessary delays, as well as undermining the union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic said there was ""no legal or political justification whatsoever for unilaterally changing an international agreement"".

"A police officer lays floral tributes at the scene of the attack People gathered to remember the victim of the Finsbury Park terror attack on its fifth anniversary on Sunday. Makram Ali, 51, died and 11 were injured when Darren Osborne ploughed a van into worshippers gathered outside the Muslim Welfare House shortly after evening Ramadan prayers in 2017. Speaking at the memorial, mosque chairman Mohammed Kozbar claimed Islamphobia was ""much worse now"". Sadiq Khan said that ""London stands united against terrorism"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson also paid tribute to the attack's victims. He tweeted: ""Five years on from this cowardly act of terrorism my thoughts are with the family of Makram Ali and those affected by the Finsbury Park Mosque attack. ""Freedom of worship and tolerance for different faiths is fundamental to our values. ""Terrorists will never change our way of life."" Mr Ali died after Osborne deliberately drove at worshippers Mr Khan, the current mayor of London, said: ""Our thoughts are with Makram's family and everyone who was impacted by this dreadful attack. ""London stands united against terrorism. We will always celebrate and cherish the incredible diversity of our city. ""That senseless attack five years ago was an assault on our shared values of openness, freedom and respect. ""But the solidarity shown by all communities in our city in the wake of the attack showed that we will never let terrorists win by dividing us."" Five years since Ruzina Akhtar lost her father, Makram Ali, she takes us to the park where he used to bring his grandchildren, and where there's now a plaque dedicated to him. She tells me he loved his family, was always telling jokes- even when they begged him to stop- and they'd tease him over his habit of falling asleep on buses and ending up in the wrong place. The terror attack that night not only took her father from her, but left her family and many of London's Muslim community in fear. Many had worried that Islamophobia would increase following the terror attacks just weeks earlier at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge. Ruzina told me her mother was afraid to leave the house in case she was attacked for wearing a headscarf. Although the number of Islamophobic hate crimes recorded by the Metropolitan Police have fallen over the last five years, the group Tell MAMA, who monitor such incidents, say many are not reported. They say their own figures show a rise of 45% since 2017. Many London mosques have tightened their security. Ruzina Akhtar says the anniversary of the attack is always a difficult day, but the family are determined to focus on the good memories. She tells me they still have ""granddad's chair"", and the children argue over who gets to sit in it. ""I don't know anyone like him who's 24-7 happy"", she told me. ""He never had a bad word to say about anyone."" While remembering the attack's victims, Mr Kozbar said: ""We as Muslims are still feeling the effects of this attack and we won't feel safe until Islamophobia is taken seriously by the authorities and the police."" Osborne is currently serving a minimum of 43 years for the terror attack Osborne, from Cardiff, was found guilty of terrorism-related murder and jailed for life in February 2018. A judge ordered that he spend at least 43 years behind bars after being ""rapidly radicalised"" online in the months before the attack.

"Sara Duterte took the oath standing beside her parents, including her father President Rodrigo Duterte The eldest daughter of outgoing Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has been sworn in as vice-president. Sara Duterte vowed to unite the Philippines at a ceremony in Davao. It was there that the 44-year-old took over from her father as the city's mayor over a decade ago - before pursuing a career in national politics. She took the oath beside her running mate, Ferdinand Marcos Junior, who will soon replace her father as president. ""The days ahead may be full of challenges that call for us to be more united as a nation,"" Ms Duterte said. Her six-year term in office alongside Ferdinand Marcos Junior will formally begin on 30 June. As candidates in May's elections the pair shored up historic landslide victories by forging a powerful alliance and running on a message of unity that helped many of their allies win power elsewhere in government too. In the Philippines, the president and vice-president are elected separately. Mr Duterte is a controversial ""strongman"" figure who came to power in 2016 promising to reduce crime and fix the country's drug crisis. But critics say that during his five years in power, Mr Duterte has encouraged police to carry out thousands of extrajudicial killings of suspects in what he has called his ""war on drugs"". The International Criminal Court has called for a formal probeinto the thousands of killings that happened during the deadly crackdown. Mr Duterte had initially said he would stand as vice-president, before changing his mind last month andannouncing his retirement from politics. On Sunday he stood beside his daughter as she was sworn in to the new role. Ferdinand Marcos Junior - known by the nickname Bongbong - also attended the ceremony. Like his future vice-president, he too is the son of a former Philippines leader. His disgraced father, with whom he shares a name, was driven from power as the country's dictator in a 1986 uprising. What a Marcos revival means for the Philippines The man attempting to revive a corrupt dynasty Bongbong's election means that the Marcos family will now return after 36 years to power at the MalacaÃ±ang - or presidential palace. The Marcos family has never apologised for the abuses of the old dictatorship, nor given back much of the treasure they are accused of stealing from the national purse.

"Colin Furze has been making the tunnel for about a year A YouTuber has won retrospective planning permission to burrow a tunnel between his house and shed. Colin Furze spent three years digging the passage by hand under his Lincolnshire garden without permission. The subterranean structure lies 1.2m (4ft) beneath the surface and could eventually also connect to a special underground bunker he has built. Mr Furze, from Stamford, said he wanted to do it because he thought ""it would be cool"". Planning documents from South Kesteven District Council show the bunker was granted permission eight years ago. However, tunnels to connect his house, shed and bunker did not have permission. ""The proposal is partially retrospective with a large portion of the tunnelling works having been carried out,"" the document stated. Mr Furze has been documenting his progress to his 12 million YouTube followers after beginning the tunnelling project in November 2018. Initially, the tunnel was a secret but millions have since watched his exploits, with the tunnel currently connecting his kitchen pantry with his shed. He said the response had been positive, adding: ""If you ask people about tunnels, they love them"". The tunnel has been supported using steel and concrete Mr Furze said he built his bunker in 2015and turned it into the ""ultimate man cave"" with a flat-screen TV, drum kit and several video consoles, which was a childhood dream of his. ""I thought wouldn't it be amazing if I could get to the bunker without having to walk down the path outside?"" he said. He said the next part of his plans will see a digger used to connect the shed with the bunker - a distance of about 15m (49 ft) - providing further planning permission is granted. A track system was installed to help move soil away as he dug his tunnel The tunnel has been built in stages which has included lighting, ventilation shafts and a track to help move soil away. A planning inspector visited after the plans were shared widely on Facebook, bringing the project to the attention of the council. The parish council strongly objected to the plans which it said would cause concern regarding health and safety and subsidence. A condition was added to the granting of permission that further work was subject to the ""ground and constructions structural integrity being investigated"".

"A by-election deep in once-safe Conservative territory threatens to upend British politics. For the parties fighting it, the stakes are huge - but they're picking their battles in very different ways. It's a hot summer morning in mid-Devon and Kayleigh Diggle stands in the bookshop she runs, feeling conflicted. The 32-year-old, who normally supports the Greens, is annoyed with the Conservative government and is considering a tactical vote for the Liberal Democrats. But the sheer relentlessness of the latter's campaign makes her recoil. ""It's their constant leafleting,"" says Kayleigh. She's sick, too, of looking at the party's Day-Glo yellow-and-black diamond-shaped posters (""Winning here!"") everywhere she goes. ""It's very, very, over-the-top."" Voters in Tiverton and Honiton aren't used to anyone having to fight quite this hard for their votes. Kayleigh Diggle Sprawling from the fringes of Exmoor to a stretch of the Jurassic Coast, this cluster of villages and market towns was seen until recently as an extremely safe Conservative seat. Then erstwhile MP Neil Parish admitted watching pornography in Parliament after, by his own account, searching online for tractors. Now there's a by-election to replace him. Partygate, turmoil on the Tory benches and the cost of living crisis have made the 23 June vote a crucial test of the public's mood. And with another by-election taking place on the same dayin the northern ""Red Wall"" battleground of Wakefield, Tiverton and Honiton has been tasked with delivering an interim verdict from the Tories' southern base on Boris Johnson's government. The three main parties are joined by candidates from the For Britain Movement, the Green Party, the Heritage Party, Reform UK and the UK Independence Party.A full list is available here. The Lib Dems came third here in 2019, while the Conservative winning margin was a gargantuan 24,239. But having recently won a brace of safe Tory seats at by-elections in Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire, Lib Dem campaigners have poured into the seat. However, the Conservatives are also battling hard to hold on to what was theirs, albeit with a lower-key, tightly controlled strategy that couldn't be more different to the Lib Dems' electoral shock and awe. And despite talk of an informal alliance between opposition parties, Labour's candidate, who came second here in 2019, insists she hasn't given up the fight, either. On Honiton's handsome Georgian High Street, Jubilee bunting flutters against the florists and tea rooms. It's here that the Lib Dems have set up one of their campaign headquarters in an empty shop unit. Inside, a crudely sketched map on the wall shows where party volunteers have travelled from - Orkney, Carlisle, Kingston-upon-Hull. The party say that last weekend, 350 activists knocked on 14,000 doors. Piles of leaflets are carefully arranged into neat bundles by polling district. Canvassers are given issues specific to each area to discuss - river pollution in Axminster, for instance, or lack of dental services here in Honiton. In charge of directing volunteers today is Chessie Flack, 24. What gives her a political identity, she says, is ""this perfect Lib Dem machine of a load of activists in socks and sandals, and they knock on every door in the constituency and they win the campaign"". But no-one is under any illusions that overturning such a huge majority will be easy. Chessie Flack In a cafe across the street, the party's candidate Richard Foord empties a pile of miniature marshmallows into his hot chocolate and stirs. Bookmakers have named him the favourite to win but he knows he'll need all the energy he can summon. ""I think we can't entirely take at face value the bookies' odds as a predictor or a forecast of this election outcome,"" Foord says. ""We are absolutely working for every single vote but recognising that there's a mountain to climb, frankly."" Richard Foord In his Tattersall shirt, Foord, who lives locally, looks like he's stepped out of the pages of Country Life magazine. He has the military bearing, too, of a man who spent a decade in the Army, having risen to the rank of major. On the front page of a leaflet distributed by his campaign, he is pictured in uniform above the slogan: ""I served my country. Now I'm fighting for Devon."" Along with the Union Jack bunting in the window of the campaign office, this looks a lot like a pitch to the 58% of voters in the seat who voted to leave the EU. Earlier in the day I spotted Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, on a train heading west, and asked if his party's ""Stop Brexit"" slogan under former leader Jo Swinson in 2019 damaged its chances here in 2022. He was emphatic that it didn't: ""Traditionally we've been strong in rural communities, Liberal Democrats have been strong in the West Country,"" said Sir Ed. ""So in many ways this is going back to where our roots are."" Helen Hurford In a 1980s estate on the fringe of Tiverton, the sun blazes down on a near-empty car park outside a community centre. Half an hour ago, the phone in my pocket buzzed and a Tory press officer summoned me here to meet candidate Helen Hurford. Previously, the Independent reported that she had been ""ordered not to speak to the media"". The Financial Times wrote that she ""was being shielded from the national media"" and the Times described her as ""somewhat elusive"". But now a car pulls up and out steps Hurford, in a blue dress and trainers. With a broad smile, she flatly rejects the suggestion that she'd been kept hidden from the press corps. ""If you'd wanted to find me you could have just followed me around, knocking on the doors - you would have easily found me,"" she says. Her focus, she suggests, is on the residents of Tiverton and Honiton, not reporters: ""The people of the constituency come first."" She talks about the need to improve the area's road and rail network and support local farmers. Hurford emphasises, too, that she was born and brought up in Honiton and was the head teacher at a local school. ""She has probably taught a large part of the population around here,"" says local Conservative activist Luis Gordon. It's not the only way in which the Conservative campaign appears to have been carefully managed. While Johnson has visited the constituency during the campaign, his appearances have been low-key and without advance fanfare. The Lib Dems have accused the prime minister of ""hiding away"" - but equally, it makes sense for the Tories not to take risks. ""It's a small-C and big-C Conservative area,"" says Dr Hannah Bunting, a political scientist at the University of Exeter. ""It would really be remarkable if we saw the seat changing hands, even under the current conditions."" Privately, senior Lib Dem insiders concede that the Conservatives are taking this contest a lot more seriously than they did prior to their December 2021 defeat in North Shropshire. And while national issues might be a headache for the Tory campaign, it's not clear that the circumstances of Neil Parish's departure are having much of an impact. The former MP, a farmer himself, enjoyed a lot of goodwill among the agricultural community, according to Richard Tucker, chair of the local National Farmers Union. Richard Tucker ""As farmers we felt we were well represented in this area,"" adds Tucker. At a recent NFU hustings, he says, ""all the candidates were pretty open in acknowledging that they weren't as agriculturally qualified as Neil. But they're all open to learning - well, they've got to be."" Why some farmers are turning away from the Tories First-time voters consider cost of living Issues they'll need to have brushed up on include the government's new food strategy, the phasing out of taxpayer-funded direct payments to farmers under an EU scheme and the surging cost of fertiliser - all of huge concern to those working in agriculture locally. Among those contesting the by-election are the United Kingdom Independence Party, which came second in the seat in 2015, and Reform UK, which shares some of its political DNA, having also once been led by Nigel Farage. The Green Party, which attracted more than 2,000 votes here in 2019, is also standing again. Above all, what seems to motivate Conservative activists is the suggestion that Labour - who are concentrating their fire on Wakefield - have agreed to give the Lib Dems a free run in Tiverton and Honiton. Both opposition parties strenuously deny there has been any kind of formal agreement. But Chris Daw, a local councillor who has been campaigning for Hurford, is visibly riled at the notion of any stitch-up. ""It annoys me because I think, you know, let's just be honest with each other,"" she says. ""Not just put out hints. I believe they should be straight up front and say what they're doing."" If anyone could confirm or deny the existence of a pact, it's Liz Pole. This is the second time she has stood as Labour's candidate in Tiverton and Honiton. On the previous occasion, in 2019, she earned more than 11,000 votes while finishing second, albeit distantly. Over tea in a cafe in Cullompton, in the west of the constituency, Pole is emphatic that there has been no deal. ""That is definitely not part of my political DNA whatsoever,"" she says. ""I'm fighting to win this constituency, I want to see Labour thriving and growing."" Liz Pole However, Pole, who runs a software business and has lived locally for 20 years, admits it's ""frustrating"" to read articles anointing the Lib Dems as the main challengers. Remarks by nearby Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw were interpreted as calling for a Lib Dem win, although Pole says his comments were ""taken a little bit out of context"". While Labour's big beasts, including party leader Keir Starmer and deputy Angela Rayner, have flocked to Wakefield, it's harder to detect them in this part of Devon. Asked about this, Pole replies that she's expecting a visit from shadow food, farming and fisheries minister Daniel Zeichner - a frontbencher, certainly, but perhaps not one with the greatest box-office appeal. Is Tory marginal Wakefield ready to go red again? So Pole is getting help from closer to home. She says Labour has activists in each of the seat's 24 wards and their campaign will go into each of them with her messages about affordable housing, the cost of living crisis and food strategy. Richard Clarke, 49, has travelled here from Cawsand, south-east Cornwall, to campaign for Pole.  He says that on the doorstep, voters are receptive to what she's saying. ""People know we need a change of government - and people also know that needs to be a Labour government, because obviously you don't get Liberal governments, unless you're living in 1906,"" he says. There's a sense among Labour's activists, however, that the by-election has come at an inopportune time for the party. Broader trends suggest traditional north-south political divides are being upended and in 2021's local elections Labour won district council seat in Honiton, its first in East Devon for more than two decades. Parish's resignation, some volunteers feel, interrupted that momentum. ""Voters are looking for a home, I think, and a by-election isn't necessarily the best time to find that,""  says retired academic Paul Furlong, 73, from Aveton Gifford in south Devon. Nonetheless, Tiverton and Honiton has until Thursday to find a berth, temporary or otherwise. Photos by Emma Lynch / BBC Â© 2025 BBC.

"A scheme offering interest-free loans to the financially vulnerable is being expanded to reach up to 20,000 people. After a successful trial in Manchester the No Interest Loan Scheme (NILS) will be rolled out across the UK from September. It's backed by the Treasury but will be run by credit unions and other lenders. The aim is to offer emergency loans to people who would normally be turned down, because they can't afford the interest payments. That's the position Lisa was in when she needed help to pay for her brother's funeral. The 40-year-old from Manchester couldn't find a traditional lender to borrow from. ""My finances were shocking, I was going to court every other week - mainly because of council tax and rent [debt],"" she said. But as part of the No Interest Loans initial trial scheme, she was given a Â£300 loan. And her involvement with South Manchester Credit Union, who ran the trial, led her to change her approach to managing her finances. ""I'm saving now, I've learnt how to budget, I've learnt how to pay my bills on time, so we've got a roof over our heads and food in our cupboards. Going from having nothing to having everything, is all I could ask for,"" she said. The initial trial Lisa benefited from began earlier this year and is still ongoing. But it is now being expanded in a larger pilot phase to various locations across the UK which will last for up to two years. After that, a decision will be made on whether to roll it out further. It is only available to people who have been turned down for normal borrowing They can borrow between Â£100 and Â£2,000. The average amount borrowed is Â£500 They can borrow the money for six to 18 months. The average length of time is 12 months Customers can only have one no interest loan The No Interest Loan Scheme is being run, in part, byFair4AllFinance,external, which was founded by the Treasury and Department for Culture Media and Sport three years ago to ""support the financial wellbeing of people in vulnerable circumstances"" with a mission to ""increase access to fair, affordable and appropriate financial products and services"". The pilot is being funded with Â£3.8m committed from HM Treasury, Â£1.2m from JPMorgan Chase and up to Â£1m of lending capital from each devolved administration, matched in England by Fair4All Finance. The nationwide pilot phase is designed to offer small scale help to 20,000 people, who otherwise would have struggled to borrow. If that phase is a success, a full-scale roll-out could reach 500,000 people, according to a feasibility study conducted before the pandemic. Thanks to the cost of living crisis, even more people could now be eligible, one expert suggests. Apart from the emergency finance, one over-arching benefit of the scheme is that it introduces people to the credit union and other lenders providing the loans, which can then offer further support in the form of advice around budgeting and debt management. Credit unions are financial co-operatives owned by their members. They offer lots of the same services as banks, including ways to save, secure deposits and loans. They're fully regulated and because they're owned by members any profits stay within the union for the benefit of members - rather than going to shareholders. Encouraged by the credit union, Lisa is now saving for the first time and has put away Â£5 every week since January leaving her with Â£105. ""Even seeing it brings a smile to my face. For some people that's nothing, but to me it could be a million pounds,"" she said ""That's how it feels because I've never had it before."" Sheenagh Young, chief executive of South Manchester Credit Union, where the initial proof-of-concept trial took place, says the feedback so far has been excellent. ""Credit Unions are working away on street level but somehow we're a bit of a best-kept secret, so we need to rocket fuel it and scale it up. ""This [trial] shows that HM Treasury want to invest in us, external investors want to invest... and extend that gateway which supports the work we're doing and amplify it."" Sheenagh Young, chief executive of the south Manchester Credit Union, says the new no interest loan scheme needs to be scaled up using ""rocket fuel"" Earlier this year Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glen talked about the Â£3.8m of government funding for the pilot. The scheme was designed for consumers ""in vulnerable circumstances who would benefit most from affordable credit to meet unexpected costs"", he said. ""This is a fundamental, worthwhile, new initiative, to provide a gateway product for people who at the moment are beyond the lending capacity of some credit unions. ""The challenge now will be to take that proof-of-concept pilot to a bigger pilot so that we can now validate it,"" he said.

"The strikes will take place at the same time as several large public events, including the first Glastonbury Festival for three years The dispute at the heart of strikes set to hit Britain's railways this week is resolvable, an industry boss says. Steve Montgomery, chair of the Rail Delivery Group, said more talks were planned for Monday - and that management wanted to work with unions on pay increases and reform. This weekend, the RMT union confirmed three days of strikes would go ahead on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Just 20% of usual services are expected to run - with knock-on disruption. A strike will also take place across the London Underground on Tuesday, with Transport for London advising passengers to walk and cycle instead. When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? How much are rail workers paid? Mr Montgomery told BBC News that rail bosses were trying to work with trade unions ""on how to carry out modernisation and reform of the industry"" amid falling passenger numbers. ""Ultimately we do want to give our people a pay increase... but we have to get on with reform, and that helps us deliver the next phase of giving people a pay rise."" Challenged over the apparent lack of a pay offer from many train operators, Mr Montgomery - who also runs train operator First Rail - said talks, both informal and formal, had been ongoing and discussions would continue on Monday. ""We need both parties around the table and we really require details and an acceptance that reform can go ahead,"" he said. Meanwhile, the RMT's Mick Lynch told the BBC the union would ""run this campaign for as long as it takes to get a settlement"", potentially for six months or more. ""We're in this to get a deal - and we'll do whatever we can to protect our members and get them a square deal off the companies. But there's got to be movement from those companies."" The RMT- the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers' union - represents 40,000 members from cleaners to train guards across the rail network The Rail Delivery Grouprepresents train operators andNetwork Rail- which maintains the tracks and runs some bigger stations Aslefrepresents many train drivers - with some of its members striking at Greater Anglia, Hull Trains and on tramlines in south London on certain days in June and July The Transport Secretary- Grant Shapps says it is not his role to negotiate with unions, though Labour and some Tory MPs think he should be involved The RMT said this weekend the strike would go ahead, after talks between the union and Network Rail - which maintains the track and runs some bigger stations - broke down. The union has said it is unhappy about stagnated pay and proposed job losses. Mr Lynch denied the union was demanding a pay rise in line with RPI inflation - which was 11.1% in April - but said any proposed rise must reflect the higher cost of living. He pointed out to Sky News that RPI in December, when he said a deal with Network Rail should have been struck, was 7.1%. Mr Lynch earlier said the union had rejected a Network Rail offer of a 2% rise with a further 1% increase linked to job cuts. The RMT recently won an 8.4% pay rise on the London Underground,it said.,external He said on Sunday that no new offer had been put on the table by Network Rail or rail operators. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps dismissed a call from the RMT for ministerial intervention as a ""stunt"" - and claimed union bosses were ""gunning for"" industrial action. When?There will be rail strikes onTuesday, Thursday and Saturdayand a London Underground Strike onTuesday Where?Many lines will face disruption including: Avanti West Coast; C2C; Chiltern Railways; Cross Country Trains; Croydon Tramlink; Greater Anglia; LNER; East Midlands Railway; Elizabeth Line; Great Western Railway; Hull Trains; London Underground; Northern Trains; South Eastern Railway; South Western Railway; TransPennine Express; West Midlands Trains. Who?The RMT union's members include everyone from guards and catering staff to signallers and track maintenance workers. Train driver members of the Aslef union will be striking on Thursday and 2 July on Greater Anglia and 28, 29 June and 13, 14 July on Croydon Tramlink. Read morehere. Labour's shadow levelling-up secretary Lisa Nandy said the government should ""get round the table"" with rail workers. Leaders at 13 trade unions and the Trades Union Congress jointly wrote to Mr Shapps urging him to ""help deliver a fair resolution"". And Tory MP Jake Berry also called on ministers to try to resolve the dispute. ""By training I'm a lawyer - and I can tell you that the only way out of a dispute is via negotiation,"" he told Times Radio.

"President Macron needs 289 seats in the National Assembly to maintain his outright majority Emmanuel Macron beat the far right to retain the presidency in April but, less than two months on, it is the left that is threatening his hold on power. French voters are deciding if he can keep control of the National Assembly. If the president loses his outright majority, he could struggle to push through reforms. Far-left Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon's left-green alliance finished neck and neck with the centrist Macron coalition in the first round a week ago.

Pollsters suggest Ensemble will win 255-305 seats and Nupes 140-200. ""They didn't think the left and Greens could get together - it would be chaos and catastrophe,"" Nupes spokesman Ian Brossat told a rally at the end of the campaign.

"Fina, swimming's world governing body, has voted to stop transgender athletes from competing in women's elite races if they have gone through any part of the process of male puberty. Fina will also aim to establish an 'open' category at competitions for swimmers whose gender identity is different than their birth sex. The new policy, which was passed with 71% of the vote from 152 Fina members, was described as ""only a first step towards full inclusion"" for transgender athletes. The 34-page policy document says that male-to-female transgender athletes could compete in the women's category - but only ""provided they have not experienced any part of male puberty beyond Tanner Stage 2 [which marks the start of physical development], or before age 12, whichever is later"". The decision was made during an extraordinary general congress at the ongoing World Championships in Budapest. It means that transgender American college swimmerLia Thomas,who has expressed a desire to compete for a place at the Olympics, would be blocked from participating in the female category at the Games. However, the policy does not apply to national federations or the US college championships, the NCAAs, at which Thomas recently won in the 500-yard freestyle. Instead, each national federation - including British Swimming - will need to decide if it is to implement the Fina policy. British Swimming told BBC Sport it would ""take time to review [the policy's] content"" before making any further comment. The NCAA said it ""continues its evidence-based evaluation of transgender student-athlete participation in college sports"" and ""will carefully consider"" any updates to its policy. Earlier, Fina members heard a report from a transgender task force made up of leading figures from the world of medicine, law and sport. ""Fina's approach in drafting this policy was comprehensive, science-based and inclusive, and, importantly, Fina's approach emphasised competitive fairness,"" said Brent Nowicki, the governing body's executive director. Fina president Husain Al-Musallam said the organisation was trying to ""protect the rights of our athletes to compete"" but also ""protect competitive fairness"". He said: ""Fina will always welcome every athlete. The creation of an open category will mean that everybody has the opportunity to compete at an elite level. This has not been done before, so Fina will need to lead the way. I want all athletes to feel included in being able to develop ideas during this process."" Former Great Britain swimmer Sharron Davies, who has argued against transgender participation in women's elite swimming, told BBC Sport she was ""really proud of Fina"". ""Four years ago, along with 60 other Olympic medallists, I wrote to the IOC (International Olympic Committee) and said 'Please just do the science first' and no governing body has done the science until now,"" she said. ""That is what Fina has done. They've done the science, they've got the right people on board, they've spoken to the athletes, and coaches. ""Swimming is a very inclusive sport, we love everyone to come and swim and be involved. But the cornerstone of sport is that it has to be fair and it has to be fair for both sexes."" Asked whether Fina's policy left trans athletes ""in limbo"" while they waited for an open category to be created, Davies praised Fina for having conversations around trans inclusion that should have ""happened five years ago"". ""Sport by definition is exclusionary - we don't have 15-year-old boys racing in the under-12s, we don't have heavyweight boxers in with the bantamweights, the whole reason we have lots of different classes in the Paralympics is so that we can create fair opportunities for everybody,"" she said. ""So that is the whole point of having classifications in sports and the only people who were going to be losing out were females - they were losing their right to fair sport."" Ex-GB swimmer Karen Pickering told BBC Radio 4: ""I empathise that there will be people who now can't compete in the category that they identify with as their gender. That is very sad and I do understand that, but in this situation inclusivity and fairness cannot be compatible and the science has shown that there is just no way to make that compatible."" However, 'Athlete Ally' - an LGBT advocacy group which organised a letter of support for Thomas in February, called the new policy ""discriminatory, harmful, unscientific and not in line with the 2021 IOC principles"". ""The eligibility criteria for the women's category as it is laid out in the policy polices the bodies of all women, and will not be enforceable without seriously violating the privacy and human rights of any athlete looking to compete in the women's category,"" said Anne Lieberman, the group's director of policy and programmes. Australia's four-time Olympic champion Cate Campbell had addressed Fina before the decision was made, asking the governing body to ""uphold the cornerstone of fairness"". However, fellow Australian swimmer Maddie Groves has criticised Campbell's comments, asking if she was ""OK with ostracising an already marginalised group"". ""There are already gender diverse people in swimming and I'm guessing they're not feeling very accepted right now,"" Groves said onTwitter,external. ""Shame on everyone that supported this discriminatory and unscientific decision."" Joanna Harper, who is studying transgender athletes for her PhD at Loughborough University and is a transgender athlete herself, says Fina's decision is not necessary to ""ensure meaningful competition for all women"". ""Currently, there are no trans women competing in swimming at an international level so effectively this ruling doesn't currently ban anyone,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""If USA Swimming adopts it, it will affect Lia Thomas, but it doesn't right now."" She fears an open category would increase marginalisation and discrimination, saying the introduction of such a category is ""not likely"" to work. ""It's likely to be more of a sideshow and it's not going to have the number of competitors qualifying, compared to the male or female categories,"" she said. ""Are they going to have Olympic medals for this open category? Will there be professional swimmers in an open category? I don't know for sure, it might potentially work but I doubt that it would be meaningful."" Trans athletes no threat to women's sport - Thomas Newsnight report - should trans athletes compete in female categories? Listen to The Sports Desk podcast: Sport's transgender conundrum Q&A: Transgender women in sport - key questions answered What do the scientists say?' Fina's decision followsa move on Thursday by the UCI, cycling's governing body, to double the period of time before a rider transitioning from male to female can compete in women's races. The issue in swimming has been catapulted into the spotlight by the experiences of American Thomas. In March, Thomas became the first known transgender swimmer to win the highest US national college title with victory in the women's 500-yard freestyle. Thomas swam for the Pennsylvanian men's team for three seasons before starting hormone replacement therapy in spring 2019. She has since broken records for her university swimming team. More than 300 college, Team USA and Olympic swimmers signed an open letter in support of Thomas and all transgender and non-binary swimmers, but other athletes and organisations have raised concerns about trans inclusion. Some of Thomas' team-mates and their parents wrote anonymous letters supporting her right to transition, but added it was unfair for her to compete as a woman. USA Swimming updated its policy for elite swimmersin Februaryto allow transgender athletes to swim in elite events, alongside criteria that aim to reduce any unfair advantage, including testosterone tests for 36 months before competitions. Last year, weightlifter Laurel Hubbard from New Zealand became the the first openly transgender athlete to compete at an Olympics in a different sex category to that in which they were born. Schuyler Bailar - the first transgender athlete to compete for an NCAA division one men's swimming team - was one of the swimmers to sign the open letter. Speaking on social media about Fina's policy, he said: ""This is not about preserving fairness, it is not about protecting women's sports. ""It is about trying to exclude trans people and it continues the policing of women's bodies and sports, it continues the degradation and othering of trans people."" Dr Michael Joyner, a physiologist and leading expert in human performance ""Testosterone in male puberty alters the physiological determinants of human performance and explains the sex-based differences in human performance, considered clearly evident by age 12. ""Even if testosterone is suppressed, its performance enhancing effects will be retained."" Dr Adrian Jjuuko, an activist, researcher and lawyer ""The policy emphasises that no athlete is excluded from Fina competition or setting Fina records based on their legal gender, gender identity or gender expression. ""[The proposed open category] should not become a category that adds to the already existing levels of discrimination and marginalisation against these groups. ""I see this policy as only the first step towards full inclusion and support for the participation of transgender and gender-diverse athletes in aquatic sports, and there is a lot more to be done."" Dr Sandra Hunter, an exercise physiologist specialising in sex and age differences in athletic performance ""By 14 years or older, the difference between boys and girls is substantial. That's due to the advantages experienced due to the physiological adaptations in testosterone and the possession of the Y chromosome. ""Some of these physical advantages are structural in origin such as height, limb length, heart size, lung size and they will be retained, even with the suppression or reduction of testosterone that occurs in the transition from male to female."" Summer Sanders, former Olympic and world champion in swimming ""This is not easy. There must be categories - women's, men's and of course a category for trans women and trans men. ""Fair competition is a stronghold and staple of our community - this approach safeguards the integrity of the existing sports process in which millions of girls and women participate annually."" The conversation around the inclusion of transgender women in women's sport has divided opinion both inside and outside the sporting sphere. Many argue transgender womenshould not competein women's sport because of any advantages they may retain - but others argue sport should be more inclusive. World Athletics president Lord Coe has said the ""integrity"" and ""future"" of women's sport would be ""very fragile"" if sporting organisations get regulations for transgender athletes wrong. British Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsaid in Aprilhe did not believe transgender women should compete in female sporting events. On Sunday, culture secretary Nadine Dorries told radio station LBC she would ""encourage other sports"" to follow Fina's lead and that ""fairness should always trump inclusion as a principle"". The heart of the debate on whether transgender women athletes should compete in women's sport involves the complex balance of inclusion, sporting fairness and safety - essentially, whether trans women can compete in female categories without giving them an unfair advantage or presenting a threat of injury to competitors. Trans women have to adhere to a number of rules to compete in specific sports, including in many cases lowering their testosterone levels to a certain amount, for a set period of time, before competing. There are concerns, however, as highlighted in Fina's decision, that athletes retain an advantage from going through male puberty that is not addressed by lowering testosterone.

"Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a ""front-line city,"" Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister says Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the conflict could last for years In an interview with German newspaper Bild, Stoltenberg adds that the supply of state-of-the-art weaponry to Ukrainian troops would increase the chance of liberating the Donbas region Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the Sunday Times that ""we need to steel ourselves for a long war"" Ukrainian authorities say their air defence systems in the Kyiv Region shot down a Russian âair objectâ on Sunday morning Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre, but no casualties were reported Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© We are now wrapping up our day of live coverage of events in Ukraine. This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A police officer lays floral tributes at the scene of the attack People gathered to remember the victim of the Finsbury Park terror attack on its fifth anniversary on Sunday. Makram Ali, 51, died and 11 were injured when Darren Osborne ploughed a van into worshippers gathered outside the Muslim Welfare House shortly after evening Ramadan prayers in 2017. Speaking at the memorial, mosque chairman Mohammed Kozbar claimed Islamphobia was ""much worse now"". Sadiq Khan said that ""London stands united against terrorism"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson also paid tribute to the attack's victims. He tweeted: ""Five years on from this cowardly act of terrorism my thoughts are with the family of Makram Ali and those affected by the Finsbury Park Mosque attack. ""Freedom of worship and tolerance for different faiths is fundamental to our values. ""Terrorists will never change our way of life."" Mr Ali died after Osborne deliberately drove at worshippers Mr Khan, the current mayor of London, said: ""Our thoughts are with Makram's family and everyone who was impacted by this dreadful attack. ""London stands united against terrorism. We will always celebrate and cherish the incredible diversity of our city. ""That senseless attack five years ago was an assault on our shared values of openness, freedom and respect. ""But the solidarity shown by all communities in our city in the wake of the attack showed that we will never let terrorists win by dividing us."" Five years since Ruzina Akhtar lost her father, Makram Ali, she takes us to the park where he used to bring his grandchildren, and where there's now a plaque dedicated to him. She tells me he loved his family, was always telling jokes- even when they begged him to stop- and they'd tease him over his habit of falling asleep on buses and ending up in the wrong place. The terror attack that night not only took her father from her, but left her family and many of London's Muslim community in fear. Many had worried that Islamophobia would increase following the terror attacks just weeks earlier at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge. Ruzina told me her mother was afraid to leave the house in case she was attacked for wearing a headscarf. Although the number of Islamophobic hate crimes recorded by the Metropolitan Police have fallen over the last five years, the group Tell MAMA, who monitor such incidents, say many are not reported. They say their own figures show a rise of 45% since 2017. Many London mosques have tightened their security. Ruzina Akhtar says the anniversary of the attack is always a difficult day, but the family are determined to focus on the good memories. She tells me they still have ""granddad's chair"", and the children argue over who gets to sit in it. ""I don't know anyone like him who's 24-7 happy"", she told me. ""He never had a bad word to say about anyone."" While remembering the attack's victims, Mr Kozbar said: ""We as Muslims are still feeling the effects of this attack and we won't feel safe until Islamophobia is taken seriously by the authorities and the police."" Osborne is currently serving a minimum of 43 years for the terror attack Osborne, from Cardiff, was found guilty of terrorism-related murder and jailed for life in February 2018. A judge ordered that he spend at least 43 years behind bars after being ""rapidly radicalised"" online in the months before the attack.

"Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a ""front-line city,"" Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister says Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the conflict could last for years In an interview with German newspaper Bild, Stoltenberg adds that the supply of state-of-the-art weaponry to Ukrainian troops would increase the chance of liberating the Donbas region Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the Sunday Times that ""we need to steel ourselves for a long war"" Ukrainian authorities say their air defence systems in the Kyiv Region shot down a Russian âair objectâ on Sunday morning Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre, but no casualties were reported Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© We are now wrapping up our day of live coverage of events in Ukraine. This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April.

"Fina, swimming's world governing body, has voted to stop transgender athletes from competing in women's elite races if they have gone through any part of the process of male puberty. Fina will also aim to establish an 'open' category at competitions for swimmers whose gender identity is different than their birth sex. The new policy, which was passed with 71% of the vote from 152 Fina members, was described as ""only a first step towards full inclusion"" for transgender athletes. The 34-page policy document says that male-to-female transgender athletes could compete in the women's category - but only ""provided they have not experienced any part of male puberty beyond Tanner Stage 2 [which marks the start of physical development], or before age 12, whichever is later"". The decision was made during an extraordinary general congress at the ongoing World Championships in Budapest. It means that transgender American college swimmerLia Thomas,who has expressed a desire to compete for a place at the Olympics, would be blocked from participating in the female category at the Games. However, the policy does not apply to national federations or the US college championships, the NCAAs, at which Thomas recently won in the 500-yard freestyle. Instead, each national federation - including British Swimming - will need to decide if it is to implement the Fina policy. British Swimming told BBC Sport it would ""take time to review [the policy's] content"" before making any further comment. The NCAA said it ""continues its evidence-based evaluation of transgender student-athlete participation in college sports"" and ""will carefully consider"" any updates to its policy. Earlier, Fina members heard a report from a transgender task force made up of leading figures from the world of medicine, law and sport. ""Fina's approach in drafting this policy was comprehensive, science-based and inclusive, and, importantly, Fina's approach emphasised competitive fairness,"" said Brent Nowicki, the governing body's executive director. Fina president Husain Al-Musallam said the organisation was trying to ""protect the rights of our athletes to compete"" but also ""protect competitive fairness"". He said: ""Fina will always welcome every athlete. The creation of an open category will mean that everybody has the opportunity to compete at an elite level. This has not been done before, so Fina will need to lead the way. I want all athletes to feel included in being able to develop ideas during this process."" Former Great Britain swimmer Sharron Davies, who has argued against transgender participation in women's elite swimming, told BBC Sport she was ""really proud of Fina"". ""Four years ago, along with 60 other Olympic medallists, I wrote to the IOC (International Olympic Committee) and said 'Please just do the science first' and no governing body has done the science until now,"" she said. ""That is what Fina has done. They've done the science, they've got the right people on board, they've spoken to the athletes, and coaches. ""Swimming is a very inclusive sport, we love everyone to come and swim and be involved. But the cornerstone of sport is that it has to be fair and it has to be fair for both sexes."" Asked whether Fina's policy left trans athletes ""in limbo"" while they waited for an open category to be created, Davies praised Fina for having conversations around trans inclusion that should have ""happened five years ago"". ""Sport by definition is exclusionary - we don't have 15-year-old boys racing in the under-12s, we don't have heavyweight boxers in with the bantamweights, the whole reason we have lots of different classes in the Paralympics is so that we can create fair opportunities for everybody,"" she said. ""So that is the whole point of having classifications in sports and the only people who were going to be losing out were females - they were losing their right to fair sport."" Ex-GB swimmer Karen Pickering told BBC Radio 4: ""I empathise that there will be people who now can't compete in the category that they identify with as their gender. That is very sad and I do understand that, but in this situation inclusivity and fairness cannot be compatible and the science has shown that there is just no way to make that compatible."" However, 'Athlete Ally' - an LGBT advocacy group which organised a letter of support for Thomas in February, called the new policy ""discriminatory, harmful, unscientific and not in line with the 2021 IOC principles"". ""The eligibility criteria for the women's category as it is laid out in the policy polices the bodies of all women, and will not be enforceable without seriously violating the privacy and human rights of any athlete looking to compete in the women's category,"" said Anne Lieberman, the group's director of policy and programmes. Australia's four-time Olympic champion Cate Campbell had addressed Fina before the decision was made, asking the governing body to ""uphold the cornerstone of fairness"". However, fellow Australian swimmer Maddie Groves has criticised Campbell's comments, asking if she was ""OK with ostracising an already marginalised group"". ""There are already gender diverse people in swimming and I'm guessing they're not feeling very accepted right now,"" Groves said onTwitter,external.

"Fina, swimming's world governing body, has voted to stop transgender athletes from competing in women's elite races if they have gone through any part of the process of male puberty. Fina will also aim to establish an 'open' category at competitions for swimmers whose gender identity is different than their birth sex. The new policy, which was passed with 71% of the vote from 152 Fina members, was described as ""only a first step towards full inclusion"" for transgender athletes. The 34-page policy document says that male-to-female transgender athletes could compete in the women's category - but only ""provided they have not experienced any part of male puberty beyond Tanner Stage 2 [which marks the start of physical development], or before age 12, whichever is later"". The decision was made during an extraordinary general congress at the ongoing World Championships in Budapest. It means that transgender American college swimmerLia Thomas,who has expressed a desire to compete for a place at the Olympics, would be blocked from participating in the female category at the Games. However, the policy does not apply to national federations or the US college championships, the NCAAs, at which Thomas recently won in the 500-yard freestyle. Instead, each national federation - including British Swimming - will need to decide if it is to implement the Fina policy. British Swimming told BBC Sport it would ""take time to review [the policy's] content"" before making any further comment. The NCAA said it ""continues its evidence-based evaluation of transgender student-athlete participation in college sports"" and ""will carefully consider"" any updates to its policy. Earlier, Fina members heard a report from a transgender task force made up of leading figures from the world of medicine, law and sport. ""Fina's approach in drafting this policy was comprehensive, science-based and inclusive, and, importantly, Fina's approach emphasised competitive fairness,"" said Brent Nowicki, the governing body's executive director. Fina president Husain Al-Musallam said the organisation was trying to ""protect the rights of our athletes to compete"" but also ""protect competitive fairness"". He said: ""Fina will always welcome every athlete. The creation of an open category will mean that everybody has the opportunity to compete at an elite level. This has not been done before, so Fina will need to lead the way. I want all athletes to feel included in being able to develop ideas during this process."" Former Great Britain swimmer Sharron Davies, who has argued against transgender participation in women's elite swimming, told BBC Sport she was ""really proud of Fina"". ""Four years ago, along with 60 other Olympic medallists, I wrote to the IOC (International Olympic Committee) and said 'Please just do the science first' and no governing body has done the science until now,"" she said. ""That is what Fina has done. They've done the science, they've got the right people on board, they've spoken to the athletes, and coaches. ""Swimming is a very inclusive sport, we love everyone to come and swim and be involved. But the cornerstone of sport is that it has to be fair and it has to be fair for both sexes."" Asked whether Fina's policy left trans athletes ""in limbo"" while they waited for an open category to be created, Davies praised Fina for having conversations around trans inclusion that should have ""happened five years ago"". ""Sport by definition is exclusionary - we don't have 15-year-old boys racing in the under-12s, we don't have heavyweight boxers in with the bantamweights, the whole reason we have lots of different classes in the Paralympics is so that we can create fair opportunities for everybody,"" she said. ""So that is the whole point of having classifications in sports and the only people who were going to be losing out were females - they were losing their right to fair sport."" Ex-GB swimmer Karen Pickering told BBC Radio 4: ""I empathise that there will be people who now can't compete in the category that they identify with as their gender. That is very sad and I do understand that, but in this situation inclusivity and fairness cannot be compatible and the science has shown that there is just no way to make that compatible."" However, 'Athlete Ally' - an LGBT advocacy group which organised a letter of support for Thomas in February, called the new policy ""discriminatory, harmful, unscientific and not in line with the 2021 IOC principles"". ""The eligibility criteria for the women's category as it is laid out in the policy polices the bodies of all women, and will not be enforceable without seriously violating the privacy and human rights of any athlete looking to compete in the women's category,"" said Anne Lieberman, the group's director of policy and programmes. Australia's four-time Olympic champion Cate Campbell had addressed Fina before the decision was made, asking the governing body to ""uphold the cornerstone of fairness"". However, fellow Australian swimmer Maddie Groves has criticised Campbell's comments, asking if she was ""OK with ostracising an already marginalised group"". ""There are already gender diverse people in swimming and I'm guessing they're not feeling very accepted right now,"" Groves said onTwitter,external. ""Shame on everyone that supported this discriminatory and unscientific decision.""

"MicheÃ¡l Martin warned that there was an issue around trust Plans by the UK government toscrap parts of the post-Brexit trade deal it agreed with the EUwould be ""economic vandalism"" on Northern Ireland, the taoiseach (Irish PM) has said. The government wants to change the Northern Ireland Protocol to make it easier for some goods to flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. MicheÃ¡l Martin said they would damage Northern Ireland's economy. But DUP MP Sammy Wilson said Mr Martin was ""focused on Dublin's interests"". Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, the taoiseach said that the legislation was unacceptable and represented  ""unilateralism of the worst kind"". ""We accept fully that there are legitimate  issues around the operation of the protocol and we believe that with serious sustained negotiations between the EU and the UK government those issues could be resolved,"" he said. Mr Martin said other parts of the bill, namely dual regulatory standards, could be severely damaging to the Northern Ireland economy. ""It is deeply concerning to industry and businesses in Northern Ireland... in effect it represents a form of economic vandalism on Northern Ireland,"" he said. Mr Martin said data showed the Northern Ireland economy was ""doing very well"" under the protocol and argued that this was not being articulated enough by the UK government. But the DUP's MP for East Antrim, Sammy Wilson, accused the taoiseach of failing to recognise ""the flaws of the protocol"". ""From day one Dublin has done what's in Dublin's interests and never once prioritised consensus in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""Not one unionist MP or MLA supports the protocol but instead of Dublin trying to understand or recognise our objections, they repeatedly lecture us, talk down to us and demand we change our mind. He added: ""It's time for Dublin to step back and recognise that the reason we find ourselves without a fully operating devolved institution is because of their determination to steamroller over unionist objections."" Sinn FÃ©in's vice-president Michelle O'Neill said it was an ""irrefutable fact that the protocol is working"". Speaking at the annual Wolfe Tone commemoration in Bodenstown, Co Kildare, Ms O'Neill said the UK government's attempt to change the protocol ""discards international law at a whim in such a reckless way"". She said: ""There is a majority in the assembly who support the protocol because it is working, giving us continued access to the European single market, creating jobs and economic benefit."" The protocol prevents a hard border with the Republic of Ireland, but it means checks on some goods arriving into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK. The arrangement is opposed by unionists in Northern Ireland because it creates a trade border in the Irish Sea and they argue it undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK. At the centre of the government's plan to ease the impact on businesses is the concept of green lanes and red lanes for trade. This would mean: Goods coming from Great Britain (GB) into Northern Ireland (NI) and which are staying would use the green lane. This means there would be no checks and paperwork would be minimal. GB goods moving through NI into Ireland or the wider European Union would use the red lane and continue to be checked at NI ports. London also wants any trade disputes resolved by ""independent arbitration"" and not by the European Court of Justice, and Northern Ireland to benefit from the same tax breaks as elsewhere in the UK. The government says there is ""no other way"" of safeguarding essential interests of the UK. But the EU opposes the move, saying going back on the deal breaches international law. Draft legislation from the UK government this week to overturn parts of the protocol includes the use of a green lane for goods arriving into Northern Ireland from GB Mr Martin said the EU had been flexible trying to come up with solutions to issues with the protocol. The European Commission tabled proposals in October 2021 to reduce the post-Brexit checks on goods and medicines arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. At the heart of the plan was the idea of an ""express lane"", to allow for a reduction in the level of paperwork and checks on goods coming into and remaining in Northern Ireland from GB. But the proposals werepublicly rejected by the UK in May. London said they did not address the core problems presented by the protocol, would require more checks and controls than under the current ""grace period"" regime, and would result in the disappearance from Northern Ireland supermarket shelves of certain products. The trade deal governs how goods enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and was agreed by the UK government and the European Union following the Brexit vote in 2019. It was designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland when the UK left the European Union. The protocol led to the creation of new goods checks at Northern Ireland sea ports on some products from Great Britain, effectively creating a new trade border in the Irish Sea. Unionist parties, including the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), argue that this has led to extra costs and unnecessary delays, as well as undermining the union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem On Wednesday, the EU announced legal action against the UK governmentover its plans to scrap parts of the protocol. European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic said there was ""no legal or political justification whatsoever for unilaterally changing an international agreement"". ""So let's call a spade a spade, this is illegal,"" Mr Sefcovic said, adding that the UK's decision ""left us with no choice"" but to take legal action. The NI Protocol and its economic impact How will NI protocol plans affect businesses? Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson said his government was disappointed the EU had taken legal action and continued to favour a negotiated resolution.

"Former Mr Gay Universe says disabled and LGBTQ+ people need support to make sure they reach their full potential ""I am gay, disabled and from the valleys - of course I've faced barriers."" Paul Davies was the first Mr Gay Universe who had a physically disability and was often told he could not follow his dreams. He said while he grew up with support, other people were not as lucky and young people needed to be empowered to ensure they are not forgotten. One charity said 40% of LGBTQ+ people in the UK identified as disabled. Themost recent figures,externalshowed the amount of people in Wales who did not identify as heterosexual was about 5.6%. 'People assume I can't be gay because I'm disabled' Have attitudes to LGBTQ+ people really changed? LGBT Wales fans pledge boycott of Qatar World Cup Co-founder of the charity ParaPride, Daniele Lul, said ""cultural barriers"" had a real impact on people. Paul wants to empower young LGBTQ+ and disabled people but says it is down to others to help them also Paul, from Treherbert, Rhondda Cynon Taf, was born without a left hand and said before becoming Mr Gay Wales and Mr Gay Universe he did not realise how severe sexual discrimination was. He said he always wanted to be a performer and is a former Red Coat at Butlins, a drag artist and TV presenter, alongside campaigning for disability and LGBTQ+ rights. ""I am gay from the Welsh valleys, from a mining community, and born in the 80s amongst a group of people that were fighting for their right to work, but I was also a disabled young man as well,"" he said. ""I think, without realising, I was facing a lot of barriers."" This video can not be played The unique challenges that come with having a learning disability and being LGBT He said while he had a supportive family and school, people did assume he was less capable than he was, which did knock his confidence. ""Growing up was difficult sometimes, and I've faced my share of discrimination and stereotyping,"" he said. ""One moment that has stuck with me was a teacher telling me that my disability would hold me back from achieving my life and career ambitions. ""For me, I'm a very confident person now, but I wasn't always like that and having specialised support would have really helped me when I was starting out."" He wants to empower young people who are also both LGBTQ+ and disabled but said other people needed to make effort to support then and investments needed to be made to make training and workplace environments more inclusive. He said programmes such asReAct,external, which helps people out of work gain new skills, was one way to make a difference as disabled and LGBTQ+ people were more likely to struggle at work. ""For an LGBTQ+ disabled person the constant stresses, anxieties and pressure associated to constantly proving their ability and breaking stigmas is heightened and this can become tiring if you consider their disability and fact that they are continually having to adapt to the world around them every day."" He said it was common knowledge that people with disabilities faced more barriers in the workplace but LGBTQ+ people also struggle, particularly as they aremore likely to suffer from mental health issues. He said: ""Investing in more LGBTQ+ training can help remove stigmas and barriers faced by individuals and help improve workplace culture to be more open and inclusive. ""By striving to be more inclusive in our workplaces, surroundings and our communities we can show that every person belongs."" Daniele Lul co-founded ParaPride to help tackle ""cultural barriers"" disabled LGBTQ+ people face For Daniele, who had both legs amputated at 40 after having meningitis, a lot of the stigma that falls on to LGBTQ+ people who are also disabled comes from people thinking they do not feel and function in the same way as everyone else. ""LGBTQ+ is an umbrella term but with disability it's just that one word and it can mean so many different things, so for many people who identify as both it can be tough."" He said there was an ""obvious need"" for a charity like ParaPride as even in physically inclusive spaces there were still ""cultural barriers"" that meant people were treated differently, such as people talking down or assuming they needed aid. He said because gay communities in general could often be quite image-focused, he in particular found it difficult to adjust after his amputation and finding his place. This video can not be played ""People assume I can't be gay because I am disabled"" ""It is very interesting because sex is a favourite topic among the LGBTQ+ society but disabilities are often left out of these conversations and considered incompatible to sex-related topics,"" he said. ""People are still very uncomfortable and it's also almost easier to think of disabled people as asexual."" Asexuality means people who experience little or no sexual attraction to others. He said more support needed to go into education and having discussions around intersectional LGBTQ+ people but also people within the community needed to be educated. He said while attitudes would not change overnight, having the conversations would help make ""us feel and be included"". ""People are disabled only by the barriers that are presented by society and it's really important to put that message across.""

"Boris Johnson visited nearby Rhyl during the local election campaign It was a ""disastrous result"", according to one Conservative. Before May's local elections, Hugh Irving was one of seven Tory councillors in Prestatyn. Now he's the only one left - and by the smallest possible margin after a majority of just one vote saved his seat on Denbighshire council. Were it not for the rapport he's built with the local electorate during 30 years in local politics, his party might have been wiped out in this seaside resort. What's it like to lose an election on a coin toss? PM admits tough losses for Tories in elections 'Trust Tories like you trust GPs after Shipman' ""They were saying 'yes Hugh, we've always supported you, we know what you've done, but we're not happy',"" he said. ""I think, probably you've got to be blunt about this. ""As far as they were concerned - not necessarily me - they weren't happy about a lot of the news and reports of what I would call misdemeanours being carried out in Westminster."" Those ""misdemeanours"" - theparties in Downing Street that broke the Covid rules- cost Welsh Tories dearly. Hugh Irving is the last Tory standing in Prestatyn In the south they lost seats in Vale of Glamorgan andlost control of Monmouthshire, the party's only Welsh council. In Denbighshire, they slumped from first to fourth. Prestatyn and nearby Rhyl are in the Vale of Clwyd constituency. The Conservatives won the Senedd and Westminster seats from Labour in the past two elections. It's a bit of a stretch to say Sir Keir Starmer won't get to Downing Street if he can't win the seat back, but this is a key battleground. Which is why, a week before his party's drubbing, Mr Johnson was serving ice cream on a campaign visit to a caravan park in Rhyl. Clearly Partygate blunted the appeal of such stunts. Here, as elsewhere, people were not impressed by what they heard in the news. Allison Ward: ""We are not idiots in the big wide world"" Allison Ward, who works in The Deli on the Hill on Prestatyn High Street, said: ""Somebody comes in to buy some cheese and you have these conversations and they are angry. They are disappointed. ""And also people like to feel that they are not stupid. We are not idiots in the big wide world. We don't forget these things."" Mr Irving hopes voters have got their frustrations out of their system, allowing the Conservatives enough time to recover before the next electoral test. Tory high command must surely hope he's right. Certainly, one woman on the high street told me she felt the media had made far too much fuss about the rule breaking. But Labour thinks this result was a pivotal moment in a long campaign to win back territory in north-east Wales that has been ceded to Mr Johnson's Conservatives. Jason McLellan says positive campaigning was behind Labour's success One of Prestatyn's new Labour councillors, Jason McLellan, now leads Denbighshire council after the former Independent-Conservative alliance was ousted. He was Labour's candidate for the Senedd in Vale of Clwyd last year, losing to the Conservatives by 300 votes. Rather than rely on Partygate to explain the turnaround in Labour's fortunes, he prefers to credit their local manifesto and a ""positive message"" which they promoted on the doorsteps and on Facebook. But just like the prime minister's conduct, Welsh Labour's record has been under scrutiny. Betsi Cadwaladr, the area's health board,has been mired in problems. Gill German, another Prestatyn councillor now on the local authority's cabinet, said: ""Because we went out and had those conversations - and some of them were robust - and we answered, people put their trust in us to carry out what they had seen Mark Drakeford doing at Welsh government level."" Labour's Gill German says there were ""robust"" conversations with voters Labour aren't the only ones who want to talk about Mr Drakeford. They're convinced the first minister is an electoral asset, but the Tories' opposition leader in the Senedd says his party must do more to pin the blame on him for failures in the NHS. Andrew RT Davies said voters needed reminding that the politicians ultimately responsible for well-documented problems at Denbighshire's hospital were not in London. ""What we need to be doing is far more aggressively making the case to people that when you can't get a service at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd that's not because of the Conservative government in Westminster,"" he said. ""That's because of the Labour government here in Cardiff Bay."" Andrew RT Davies launched the Welsh Conservative local election campaign in Llandudno The local election losses have revived a debate about whether the Welsh Tories are Welsh enough. Mr Davies says they need to ""build on a strong Welsh brand"". But he dismisses a recent report in the Daily Telegraph suggesting someone in senior Welsh Conservative ranks wants to douse the party in clear blue water. Clear red water was the phrase deployed by former First Minister Rhodri Morgan - and coined by his then-advisor Mr Drakeford - to distinguish Welsh Labour from Tony Blair. But Mr Davies said Welsh Tories already had the freedom they needed to offer unique policies. Last month, for example, he put himself at odds with the UK government when he said it should cough up afair share of HS2 funding for Wales. As for Labour accusing the UK government of undermining the Senedd, Mr Davies said two Wales Acts - laws that transferred more power to Cardiff Bay - showed ""we have put the turbo on devolution"". Wales should get a share of cash from building the HS2 high-speed rail line in England, Mr Davies says There's probably only so much the Welsh Conservatives can do to shield themselves from the political headwinds blowing in from Westminster. Mr Davies said the prime minister has his full support, but the UK government must now get on and deliver its 2019 manifesto. To do that, Conservative MPs have decided to keep Boris Johnson in Number 10, albeit in a vote that has wounded him as a leader. Veteran councillor Mr Irving sums up the predicament like this: ""I'm content with that for the moment. ""But I think he's on probation. No doubt about that.""

"Rail travel has been disrupted this week by industrial action, including an overtime ban which continues on Friday. Members of the train drivers' union Aslef walked out on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, prompting widespread cancellations. The six-day overtime ban, which started on Bank Holiday Monday and runs until Saturday, will continue to have an impact on some services. Drivers from 16 train operating companies staged walkouts on different days this week. The services affected included LNER, Northern Trains and TransPennine Express, c2c, Greater Anglia, Great Northern, Thameslink, Southeastern, Southern/Gatwick Express, South Western Railway main line and Island Line, Avanti West Coast, Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Great Western Railway and West Midlands Trains. The overtime ban also means drivers have not been accepting any extra shifts, which they say are crucial to the smooth running of the rail network. National Rail said train timetables were likely to be affected. Passengers are advised tocheck before they travel.,external Rail passengers with advance tickets can get refunds if the train they are booked on is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled due to strikes.â¯â¯ If passengers have a return ticket they may also be entitled to a fee-free refund if part of the journey is cancelled. Season ticket holders (flexi, monthly or longer) who cannot travel, canclaim 100% compensation for strike dates,external. Aslef, the train drivers' union, is seeking better pay for its members. It says drivers are being asked to accept worse working conditions in exchange for a wage increase. Strike action began in July 2022 but no formal talks have taken place between the two sides since April 2023, when the most recent pay deal was rejected. The offer, described as ""risible"" by Aslef, included 4% pay rises two years in a row, on the condition drivers accepted changes to training and negotiated new work patterns. Train operators say ways of working need to change for wages to rise, because of the financial challenges they are facing and to ensure fairness to taxpayers. The body which negotiates on behalf of the rail companies, the Rail Delivery Group, says it continues to ""seek a fair agreement"". Unions need to re-ballot members every six months to see if they want to continue with industrial action. Currently, unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. In November last year, RMT members, including guards and ticket office staff,voted to accept a pay offer. This included a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022-23 and job security guarantees. Talks over future pay deals and working practices will continue. A new law meanstrain companies can require enough staff to work on strike daysto run 40% of services. The Department for Transport said it expects employers to use minimum service levels ""if appropriate to do so, and to deliver the best possible service"". PM 'disappointed' as new rail strike law not used However, industry insiders told the BBC that applying the new rules was complicated. One source said it meant co-ordinating a reduced timetable with other operators in a short space of time. The Rail Delivery Group, a membership organisation of Britain's train operating companies, said the minimum services levels law was a potential tool but not a ""silver bullet"". Unions strongly oppose it. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says median pay for ""train and tram drivers"" is just under Â£59,000. Train companies and the government say the offer rejected by Aslef would take average train driver pay to Â£65,000. The average salary of rail workers in 2022 was Â£45,919,according to the ONS.,external If drivers are excluded (because they tend to be members of the Aslef union, not RMT) its estimate is Â£39,518. However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff. Will you be affected by the strikes?

"At the centre of the government's plan to ease the impact on businesses is the concept of green lanes and red lanes for trade. Goods coming from Great Britain (GB) into Northern Ireland (NI) and which are staying would use the green lane. This means there would be no checks and paperwork would be minimal. GB goods moving through NI into Ireland or the wider European Union would use the red lane and continue to be checked at NI ports. Connoisseurs of Brexit will recognise this concept from an earlier stage in the process. Back in 2018Dr Andrew McCormick, the civil servant leading Stormont's Brexit response, wrote a paper,externalwhich considered how it could work. He has spoken about it to the UK in a Changing Europe think tank, as part of their series of interviews with Brexit players, He identified three tests of the concept which apply equally today: Will it facilitate the flow of goods without an unacceptable burden on traders? Will it provide appropriate management of the risks? Would it be politically acceptable - especially to unionism? The UK government has attempted to answer at least the first two of those questions - though not in the text of the bill itself which contains no mention of green lanes or red lanes. Instead you need to look at the bill's explanatory notes and aseparate briefing document.,external The green lane would only require traders to provide ""ordinary commercial information"" rather than customs declarations and agri-food certificates. But it would not be a free for all as it would be based on membership of a trusted trader scheme. The government says this new scheme would require firms to provide ""detailed information on their operations and supply chains to support robust audit and compliance work"". Precisely how onerous the qualifications for that scheme would be is not yet clear. One immediate concern for NI business groups is how GB businesses would engage with such a scheme. A significant source of difficulty with the protocol has been the unpreparedness of GB suppliers selling into NI. The government is also proposing that what it calls non-commercial goods, such as post and parcels, will automatically go through the green lane without the need for registration. Presumably this would include most online shopping purchases but this isn't spelled out. Aside from the trusted trader scheme, the second level of assurance the government is offering the EU is what it calls ""robust data sharing"". It says this would be delivered through a purpose-built IT system with information available in real time and ""well within the time taken to cross the Irish Sea"". The third line of assurance is what the government says will be ""robust penalties"" for businesses who abuse the green lane. That would include being kicked out of the trusted trader scheme, civil fines and criminal charges. On Dr McCormick's third point one issue for unionists to consider is that this arrangement would mean NI was still not trading on precisely the same terms as other parts of the UK. There will be no requirements for a business in Edinburgh to use a trusted trader scheme to sell goods to London or Cardiff. But they would have to take that additional step to get goods to Belfast.

"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

"Boris Johnson has said he will find it ""very difficult"" to vote for Rishi Sunak's new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland (NI). Rishi Sunakhas announced changesto the protocol - the agreement which Mr Johnson negotiated with the EU and which came into force in NI at the start of 2021. It introduced checks on goods arriving in NI from the rest of the UK and became a source of political tensions. Mr Johnson,in a speech in Westminster,external, said ""I thought those checks would not be onerous"" and went on to say ""it's all my fault, I fully accept responsibility"". This is in marked contrast to what he said about his deal before it came into force. Northern Ireland Brexit deal: At-a-glance Brexit: What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Claims about Northern Ireland's Brexit fact-checked Northern Ireland: Did anyone warn about Brexit checks? In August 2020, Mr Johnson made this pledge - one he repeated several times. But Northern Ireland has been treated differently to the rest of the UK for the trade in goods, as the protocol said it would be. So, there has indeed been a trade border in the Irish Sea. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been deeply unhappy about this, using the slogan: ""No border in the Irish Sea"". Mr Johnson said this on Sky News in response to a question abouta leaked internal Treasury document,external. On the impact of the protocol, the document warned ""customs declarations and documentary and physical checks... will be highly disruptive to the NI economy"". It highlighted potential constitutional implications, saying Northern Ireland (NI) could be ""symbolically separated"" from Great Britain (GB). Mr Johnson's dismissal of the document's main findings ran counter to the facts of his own deal. Parts of the Treasury document are now out of date (the possibility that tariffs or taxes could be charged on many goods crossing from GB to NI, for example, was removed by the signing of the new EU-UK free trade agreement in December 2020). But it set out clearly that there would be a range of bureaucratic measures affecting GB-NI trade, including customs declarations, food safety checks, security checks, and regulatory checks on product standards. The NI Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) says that SPS checks (controls to protect animal, plant or public health) were carried out between 1 January 2021 and 19 February 2023 at NI ports on: 275,955 products of animal origin (mainly food) 14,853 consignments of live animals 19,627 consignments of plants and plant products 1,233 consignments of high risk food (not of animal origin) 319 consignments were rejected or refused entry And this was despite grace periods being in place during which the full implementation of EU rules was suspended. Mr Johnson was asked by an NI businessman whether he could tell his staff that they wouldn't have to complete customs declarations for goods going from NI to GB. Mr Johnson said he could. At the time, the terms of the protocol suggested export declarations would have to be filled in - a pointacknowledged by then Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay. In subsequent negotiations, though, the need for formal NI-GB customs forms was waived - so this part of the prime minister's promise was met. However, in 2021 there weremore than a million,externalfull customs declarations for goods coming the other way - from GB-NI - with each declaration comprising multiple forms and steps. Boris Johnson asserted this in response to a question in Parliament from Nigel Dodds of the DUP who said the protocol ""drives a coach and horses through the Belfast Agreement"" and urged Mr Johnson to reconsider the plan. He reminded the prime minister that he had told the DUP conference in 2018 that ""no British Conservative government could or should sign up"" to an arrangement with regulatory checks and customs controls between GB and NI. What is the Good Friday Agreement? On 11 May 2022, at a press conference in Sweden, Mr Johnson said that the Good Friday Agreement meant that ""things have got to command cross-community support. Plainly the Northern Ireland Protocol fails to do that and we need to sort it out."" The protocol has a consent mechanism that means assembly members are asked to vote on it. The first consent vote is due in 2024. Mr Johnson gave this assessment in the House of Commons shortly after agreeing the terms of the deal, urging MPs to back it. But annexes to the protocol set out a long list of EU laws that would apply to NI, including laws dealing with products of animal origin and the EU customs code. In addition to the leaked Treasury document,the government's own impact assessment,,externalpublished at the time, was clear. ""Goods arriving in Northern Ireland, including from Great Britain,"" it said, ""would undergo regulatory checks in accordance with EU rules."" One year on from the changes coming into effect,the NI Chambers of Commerce found,externalthat a very high proportion of members had experienced increases in prices of goods and services and the amount of time taken to transport goods.

"Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a ""front-line city,"" Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister says Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the conflict could last for years In an interview with German newspaper Bild, Stoltenberg adds that the supply of state-of-the-art weaponry to Ukrainian troops would increase the chance of liberating the Donbas region Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the Sunday Times that ""we need to steel ourselves for a long war"" Ukrainian authorities say their air defence systems in the Kyiv Region shot down a Russian âair objectâ on Sunday morning Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre, but no casualties were reported Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© We are now wrapping up our day of live coverage of events in Ukraine. This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a ""front-line city,"" Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister says Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the conflict could last for years In an interview with German newspaper Bild, Stoltenberg adds that the supply of state-of-the-art weaponry to Ukrainian troops would increase the chance of liberating the Donbas region Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the Sunday Times that ""we need to steel ourselves for a long war"" Ukrainian authorities say their air defence systems in the Kyiv Region shot down a Russian âair objectâ on Sunday morning Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre, but no casualties were reported Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© We are now wrapping up our day of live coverage of events in Ukraine. This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident.

Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson visited nearby Rhyl during the local election campaign It was a ""disastrous result"", according to one Conservative. Before May's local elections, Hugh Irving was one of seven Tory councillors in Prestatyn. Now he's the only one left - and by the smallest possible margin after a majority of just one vote saved his seat on Denbighshire council. Were it not for the rapport he's built with the local electorate during 30 years in local politics, his party might have been wiped out in this seaside resort. What's it like to lose an election on a coin toss? PM admits tough losses for Tories in elections 'Trust Tories like you trust GPs after Shipman' ""They were saying 'yes Hugh, we've always supported you, we know what you've done, but we're not happy',"" he said. ""I think, probably you've got to be blunt about this. ""As far as they were concerned - not necessarily me - they weren't happy about a lot of the news and reports of what I would call misdemeanours being carried out in Westminster."" Those ""misdemeanours"" - theparties in Downing Street that broke the Covid rules- cost Welsh Tories dearly. Hugh Irving is the last Tory standing in Prestatyn In the south they lost seats in Vale of Glamorgan andlost control of Monmouthshire, the party's only Welsh council. In Denbighshire, they slumped from first to fourth. Prestatyn and nearby Rhyl are in the Vale of Clwyd constituency. The Conservatives won the Senedd and Westminster seats from Labour in the past two elections. It's a bit of a stretch to say Sir Keir Starmer won't get to Downing Street if he can't win the seat back, but this is a key battleground. Which is why, a week before his party's drubbing, Mr Johnson was serving ice cream on a campaign visit to a caravan park in Rhyl. Clearly Partygate blunted the appeal of such stunts. Here, as elsewhere, people were not impressed by what they heard in the news. Allison Ward: ""We are not idiots in the big wide world"" Allison Ward, who works in The Deli on the Hill on Prestatyn High Street, said: ""Somebody comes in to buy some cheese and you have these conversations and they are angry. They are disappointed. ""And also people like to feel that they are not stupid. We are not idiots in the big wide world. We don't forget these things."" Mr Irving hopes voters have got their frustrations out of their system, allowing the Conservatives enough time to recover before the next electoral test. Tory high command must surely hope he's right. Certainly, one woman on the high street told me she felt the media had made far too much fuss about the rule breaking. But Labour thinks this result was a pivotal moment in a long campaign to win back territory in north-east Wales that has been ceded to Mr Johnson's Conservatives. Jason McLellan says positive campaigning was behind Labour's success One of Prestatyn's new Labour councillors, Jason McLellan, now leads Denbighshire council after the former Independent-Conservative alliance was ousted. He was Labour's candidate for the Senedd in Vale of Clwyd last year, losing to the Conservatives by 300 votes. Rather than rely on Partygate to explain the turnaround in Labour's fortunes, he prefers to credit their local manifesto and a ""positive message"" which they promoted on the doorsteps and on Facebook. But just like the prime minister's conduct, Welsh Labour's record has been under scrutiny. Betsi Cadwaladr, the area's health board,has been mired in problems. Gill German, another Prestatyn councillor now on the local authority's cabinet, said: ""Because we went out and had those conversations - and some of them were robust - and we answered, people put their trust in us to carry out what they had seen Mark Drakeford doing at Welsh government level."" Labour's Gill German says there were ""robust"" conversations with voters Labour aren't the only ones who want to talk about Mr Drakeford. They're convinced the first minister is an electoral asset, but the Tories' opposition leader in the Senedd says his party must do more to pin the blame on him for failures in the NHS. Andrew RT Davies said voters needed reminding that the politicians ultimately responsible for well-documented problems at Denbighshire's hospital were not in London. ""What we need to be doing is far more aggressively making the case to people that when you can't get a service at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd that's not because of the Conservative government in Westminster,"" he said. ""That's because of the Labour government here in Cardiff Bay."" Andrew RT Davies launched the Welsh Conservative local election campaign in Llandudno The local election losses have revived a debate about whether the Welsh Tories are Welsh enough. Mr Davies says they need to ""build on a strong Welsh brand"". But he dismisses a recent report in the Daily Telegraph suggesting someone in senior Welsh Conservative ranks wants to douse the party in clear blue water. Clear red water was the phrase deployed by former First Minister Rhodri Morgan - and coined by his then-advisor Mr Drakeford - to distinguish Welsh Labour from Tony Blair. But Mr Davies said Welsh Tories already had the freedom they needed to offer unique policies. Last month, for example, he put himself at odds with the UK government when he said it should cough up afair share of HS2 funding for Wales. As for Labour accusing the UK government of undermining the Senedd, Mr Davies said two Wales Acts - laws that transferred more power to Cardiff Bay - showed ""we have put the turbo on devolution"". Wales should get a share of cash from building the HS2 high-speed rail line in England, Mr Davies says There's probably only so much the Welsh Conservatives can do to shield themselves from the political headwinds blowing in from Westminster. Mr Davies said the prime minister has his full support, but the UK government must now get on and deliver its 2019 manifesto. To do that, Conservative MPs have decided to keep Boris Johnson in Number 10, albeit in a vote that has wounded him as a leader. Veteran councillor Mr Irving sums up the predicament like this: ""I'm content with that for the moment. ""But I think he's on probation. No doubt about that.""
