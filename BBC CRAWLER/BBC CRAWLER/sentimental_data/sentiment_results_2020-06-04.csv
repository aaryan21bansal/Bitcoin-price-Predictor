"Luxury carmaker Bentley has said it will cut 1,000 jobs in the UK, about a quarter of its workforce. The company, which makes its cars in Crewe, has offered all staff the chance to take voluntary redundancy. The move comes as the car industry faces a sharp drop in sales due to coronavirus. Bentley has also struggled to be profitable in recent years. Bentley's boss, Adrian Hallmark, said the virus was not the cause of the cuts, but a ""hastener"". Bentley workers to be furloughed in agency U-turn Aston Martin profits hit by 'disappointing' year Car sales have been severely hit by the closure of car manufacturers, suppliers and showrooms due to the virus. In a statement, Bentley which turns 101 on 10 July, said it was launching a restructuring programme which would ""redefine Bentley for the next 100 years"". The plan had been due to be announced in March, but was deferred due to the pandemic. While the substance of the new strategy remained the same, the company said the effects on the short-term financial outlook for the company meant that it had to ""significantly reduce the size of the organisation through a voluntary release programme"". It said it was looking for as many as 1,000 people to accept voluntary redundancy, but it ""cannot rule out future compulsory redundancies"". ""Losing colleagues is not something we are treating lightly but this is a necessary step that we have to take to safeguard the jobs of the vast majority who will remain, and deliver a sustainable business model for the future through our Beyond100 strategy,"" said Mr Hallmark. That strategy aims to make Bentley the ""leader in sustainable luxury mobility for the next 100 years"", with an ""accelerated journey towards electrification with every model"". Last month, Mr Hallmark said that a quarter of the company's workers had been furloughed due to the lockdown while another quarter were working from home. The carmaker has since restarted production at its Crewe factory, but with only around half the usual number of staff. Bentley, which is owned by Volkswagen, has struggled to be profitable in recent years. It is in the middle of a turnaround plan which began in 2018. Last year, it increased its worldwide sales by 5% to 11,000 cars and it reported a record performance in the first quarter of 2020. But now with ""considerable forecast reduction to future revenues"" due to coronavirus it has carried out a review of its cost and investment structure and ""as the last resort... the people cost and structure"". The SMMT trade body said only 20,000 new cars were registered in the UK last month - down 89% year-on-year - the worst May performance since 1952.

"Almost Â£7bn has been raised to immunise 300 million children at a virtual global vaccine summit hosted by the UK. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said up to eight million lives would be saved as a result of the funds pledged at the Gavi vaccine summit on Thursday. The money will help immunise children against diseases like polio, diphtheria and measles over five years. Mr Johnson said the triumph of humanity over disease was the ""greatest shared endeavour of our lifetimes"". The summit raised funds for Gavi, a global alliance of public and private sector organisations promoting vaccination among the world's poorest communities. Pledges by more than 50 countries and individuals like billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates saw the total surpass an initial target of $7.4bn (almost Â£6bn). Mr Gates donated $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) from his foundation and Mr Johnson pledged Â£1.65bn over the next five years, making the UK the organisation's biggest donor. Stalled vaccine schemes 'put young lives at risk' The summit comes as the world continues to struggle to get to grips with the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Johnson also used the conference to urge world leaders to renew their ""collective resolve"" to find a Covid-19 vaccine. ""Just as we have great military alliances like Nato... where countries collaborate on building their collective military defence, so we now need that same spirit of collaboration and collective defence against the common enemy of disease,"" he said. ""It will require a new international effort to co-operate on the surveillance and the sharing of information - data is king - that can underpin a global alert system, so we can rapidly identify any future outbreak. And it will mean a radical scaling-up of our global capacity to respond."" International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan later said she believed the UK was capable of delivering a coronavirus vaccine to those who need it ""at speed"" when one becomes available. By Tulip Mazumdar, global health correspondent US President Donald Trump made a surprise appearance at the virtual global vaccine summit. Last week, Mr Trump severed ties with the UN's health agency, the World Health Organization, stopping around $400m (Â£317m) in support, after accusing it and China of mishandling the outbreak. There was international criticism of the decision, particularly because it was made in the middle of a global pandemic. But at the summit, Mr Trump struck a different tone in what was a very brief and seemingly very off-the-cuff, pre-recorded message. ""As the coronavirus has shown, there are no borders, it doesn't discriminate,"" he said. ""It's mean, it's nasty but we're going to take care of it together.... We will work hard, we will work strong... good luck, let's get the answer.""

"The Covent Garden venue has been closed since 17 March The BBC is to broadcast the Royal Opera House's first post-lockdown performance across TV and radio later this month. The concert, which will take place without a live audience, is scheduled for 13 June, hosted by the venue's director of music Antonio Pappano. It will feature a dance premiere by Wayne McGregor, resident choreographer of the Royal Ballet, as well as music by Britten, Handel and Butterworth. Radio 3 will air the show on 15 June, with TV highlights later in the month. Like all cultural venues around the UK, the Opera House closed in March, when the government banned gatherings to stop the spread of coronavirus. Since then, the venue's income has dropped by 60%, chief executive Alex Beard told the BBC. ""With no box office income and limited reserves we, like theatres and performing arts organisations across the country, face unprecedented financial stress,"" he said. ""We need all our creativity and resolve to get through this, alongside a catalysing and vital investment from Government. Together we can ensure that a generation of talent is not lost to history, and the UK's creative sector can continue to play its full role in our cultural lives."" The venue's re-opening performance will also be free to watch on YouTube and Facebook, with subsequent concerts on 20 and 27 June available to view live and on demand for Â£4.99. The BBC's coverage was announced by director general Tony Hall as part of a raft of cultural commissions. Peter Capaldi will play Ludwig van Beethoven in a new Radio 3 drama marking the 250th anniversary of the German composer's birth, while BBC Four will present a ""major new series"" about his life. A performance of his opera Fidelio, filmed at the Royal Opera House before it closed its doors, will also be broadcast. The musical family of royal wedding cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason will feature in a new BBC One film, culminating in a lockdown concert from their home; while BBC Four will profile conductor Bernard Haitink to mark his 90th birthday earlier this year. This video can not be played Growing up in a very musical family And with the summer music season on hold, a number of performances will be made available on iPlayer from opera houses that have had to shut their doors during the lockdown. Among them will be The Barber of Seville from Glyndebourne, The Turn of the Screw and The Marriage of Figaro from Garsington, and a performance of Opera North's La Traviata filmed from backstage. Lord Hall said the BBC would also expand its Culture In Quarantine programme, with ""unique projects focused on museums and galleries"" and the release of archived concerts from the BBC's vaults. Meanwhile, BBC Children's will launch a major Shakespeare project in partnership with the Royal Shakespeare Company, with readings and lessons from actors including Niamh Cusack and Jamie Wilkes on the educational website BBC Bitesize. ""While the weeks ahead may see many forms of retail opening again, culture will effectively remain in quarantine for some time,""Lord Hall said in a blog post. ""Many theatres have had to face up to the fact they are unlikely to be able to produce new work until the second half of 2021. For some the consequences will be devastating. ""It has left me more convinced than ever that the BBC has an essential role to play as ringmaster and champion for the arts in this country.""

"Home Secretary Priti Patel insists quarantine will help stop the virus' spread British Airways refused to attend a meeting with Home Secretary Priti Patel on Thursday to discuss the UK's new quarantine plans. The UK's biggest airline is a fierce opponent of the plans, which will require travellers to the UK to isolate for 14 days or face a Â£1,000 fine. BA did not give a reason for its absence and declined further comment. But a Whitehall source told the BBC it was clear BA was not serious about getting ""Britain moving again"". The new quarantine rules come into force from 8 June. BA, under huge financial strain due to the pandemic, has called it ""another blow to our industry"". BA and owner IAG - which also runs Iberia and Aer Lingus - are understood to be annoyed at what they see as a lack of consultation over the quarantine's introduction. EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic, as well as the owner of Heathrow Airport, were among the aviation businesses that attended the telephone meeting with Ms Patel and junior aviation minister Kelly Tolhurst. The Home Office said 24 representatives from the aviation, maritime and rail industries were on the call. Airlines across the world have grounded aircraft as passenger numbers collapse The home secretary told the meeting it was important for everyone in the transport sector to help ""safeguard our [economic] recovery"" and ""protect passengers and the whole country from a second wave of coronavirus"". However, an industry source said that BA feels ""it has not been treated professionally; that the meeting was a waste of time"". A Whitehall official hit back, telling the BBC: ""It's a shame that British Airways don't want to directly make their case to the home secretary and the aviation minister. Clearly they are not serious about working with the government to get Britain moving ."" BA has faced heavy criticism in parliament in recent days over a plan to slash jobs while accessing the government's furlough scheme. In April, BA said it would cut 12,000 roles and weaken terms and conditions for its remaining staff, just weeks after it had put 30,000 workers on the job retention scheme which pays workers' wages. The airline has defended the cuts as necessary, but on Wednesday Ms Tolhurst suggested BA should be held to account for what one MP called a ""breach of faith"". ""The [furlough] scheme was not designed for taxpayers to fund the wages of employees only for those companies to put the same staff on notice of redundancy during the furlough period,"" Ms Tolhurst said. Aviation bosses are fuming about the quarantine. And tonight's conference call seems to have made things worse. Most were apparently unimpressed, with one person present on the call even describing it as ""a shambles"". They feel they got no reassurances from Priti Patel that the quarantine would be reduced in any significant way soon by agreeing so-called ""air bridges"". These are safe corridors between the UK and countries with low infection rates meaning people won't have to self-isolate after they travel. That is an interesting contradiction in tone from other government sources who insist ministers are working hard to establish a number of air bridges, especially with European countries, as soon as possible. The fact that BA's parent company IAG didn't even attend the call is the ultimate sign that relations between the government and UK aviation are at rock bottom. The government insists the new quarantine rules will help contain the spread of coronavirus but has faced a backlash from Conservative MPs who argue they will harm airlines and stop people taking summer holidays The rules have also been roundly criticised by the UK's tourism industry, which has all but ground to a halt due to the pandemic. In her opening remarks at the meeting Ms Patel said: ""Protecting lives will always be our top priority, but I am alive to the impact on your sector and I'm asking you to work with us on this."" But earlier on Thursday, the boss of the UK's biggest airport services company, Swissport, said on Thursday that the plan could deliver a ""killer blow"" to the tourism sector. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has criticised the plans Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, echoed those concerns, saying the requirement to self-isolate would ""significantly reduce European visitors"". ""The safety and security of our people and our customers is always our top priority and public health must come first,"" a Virgin Atlantic spokesman said. ""However, the introduction of mandatory 14-day self-isolation for every single traveller entering the UK will reduce customer demand significantly and prevent a resumption of services at scale."" On Monday, a group of 200 travel companies wrote to Ms Patel asking for the plans to be scrapped. The letter suggested travel should be possible for people - without quarantine - between destinations ""deemed safe from coronavirus"". So-called air bridges would allow visitors from countries where coronavirus infection rates are low into the UK, without having to self-isolate for two weeks. A government source told the BBC there was a ""list"" of countries which the government was hoping to secure air bridge agreements with, which include all major European tourist destinations such as Portugal, Spain and France as well as Australia and Singapore. However, for now the government's official position is that the idea is ""under consideration"", not established policy.

"This video can not be played Rev Al Sharpton eulogy: 'Get your knee off our neck' A lawyer for George Floyd has told a memorial service that a ""pandemic of racism"" led to his death. Those gathered at Thursday's tribute stood in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd was alleged to be on the ground under the control of police in Minneapolis. Hundreds attended the service, which also heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. It was time to stand up and say ""get your knee off our necks"", he said. Mr Floyd's killing, which was captured on video, has caused outrage and sparked a wave of protests in cities across the US. Meanwhile, a few blocks away, three police officers charged with aiding and abetting Mr Floyd's murder made their first appearance in court. Bail was set at $1m (Â£800,000) but would be lowered to $750,000 if they handed in any guns they owned and met other conditions, the judge said. Derek Chauvin, the officer who continued to kneel on Mr Floyd's neck as he pleaded that he could not breathe, has been charged with second-degree murder and is due to appear in court on Monday. From left: Derek Chauvin, Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane The vast majority of demonstrations over the past eight days have been peaceful, but some have descended into violence and rioting, with curfews imposed in a number of cities. Addressing Thursday's memorial service, lawyer Benjamin Crump said it was ""not the coronavirus pandemic that killed George Floyd"". ""It was that other pandemic,"" he said. ""The pandemic of racism and discrimination."" This video can not be played ""I remember George Floyd as me"" Members of Mr Floyd's family, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were among several hundred people at the service at North Central University in downtown Minneapolis. Philonise Floyd, one of Mr Floyd's brothers, described how the family had been poor when he and Mr Floyd were young and had washed their clothes in the sink and dried them in the oven. ""It's crazy man, all these people came to see my brother, it's amazing he touched so many hearts,"" he said. Reverend Al Sharpton meanwhile demanded accountability. ""We won't stop,"" he said, referring to protests that have taken place in every US state. ""We're going to keep going until we change the whole system of justice."" In an emotional eulogy, he said Mr Floyd's story had echoed that of black people in America. George Floyd's nephew Brandon comforts his cousin Shareeduh Tate at the memorial ""What happened to Floyd happens every day in this country, in education, in health services and in every area of American life. It's time for us to stand up in George's name and say: get your knee off our necks,"" he said. Further tributes will be held at Mr Floyd's birthplace of North Carolina on Saturday, and in his hometown of Houston on Monday. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially-divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African-Americans treated? HOW IT HAPPENED:The last moments of his life In his first video comments since Mr Floyd's death, former President Barack Obama said the demonstrations were as profound as anything he had seen in his lifetime, and called on Americans to seize the chance to deal with underlying problems in society. This video can not be played The USA's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality ""Too often some of that violence has come from folks who were supposed to be serving and protecting you,"" Mr Obama said. ""I want you to know that you matter. I want you to know that your lives matter, your dreams matter."" The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, has also issued a personal messageabout Mr Floyd's death, saying his life mattered and recent events had been devastating. This video can not be played George Floyd's ex partner: ""Gianna doesn't have a father"" George Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis. A video showed Mr Floyd being arrested and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally, with rallies on Wednesday in Australia, France, the Netherlands andin the UK, where thousands gathered in central London. This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting Mr Floyd's death follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. For many, the outrage over Mr Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination. Protests over the death continued in dozens of cities on Wednesday night despite widespread curfews. George Floyd died after officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes They have been largely peaceful, with cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago relaxing their restrictions amid hopes that the worst of the violence had passed. A post-mortem examination has revealed that Mr Floyd had the coronavirus in early April. But officials stressed that this played no role in his death. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support.

"Madeleine McCann was three years old when she went missing in 2007 Madeleine McCann is ""assumed"" to be dead, say German prosecutors, who are investigating the disappearance of the British girl in 2007. A 43-year-old German man is being investigated on suspicion of murder, the public prosecutor added. The suspect, who has been named in German media as Christian B, is currently serving a prison sentence. He is believed to have been in the area where Madeleine, aged three, was last seen while on holiday in Portugal. The UK's Metropolitan Police said it had received more than 270 calls and emails since a new appeal for information was launched on Wednesday. Hans Christian Wolters, from the Braunschweig Public Prosecutor's Office in Germany, said in an update on Thursday: ""We are assuming that the girl is dead. ""With the suspect, we are talking about a sexual predator who has already been convicted of crimes against little girls and he's already serving a long sentence."" He said the suspect was regularly living in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007 and had jobs in the area, including in catering, but also committed burglaries in hotels and dealt drugs. The Madeleine McCann case: A timeline Madeleine McCann: False turns and a final breakthrough? In pictures: The search for Madeleine McCann More funds pledged for Madeleine McCann search The McCann family's spokesman said Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry, felt the new development was ""potentially very significant"". Clarence Mitchell, who has represented the family since Madeleine went missing, said that in 13 years he couldn't ""recall an instance when the police had been so specific about an individual. ""Of all the thousands of leads and potential suspects that have been mentioned in the past, there has never been something as clear cut as that from not just one, but three police forces"", he said. The Met Police, who are working with their German and Portuguese counterparts, said the case remained a ""missing persons"" investigation in the UK because it does not have ""definitive evidence"" as to whether Madeleine is alive or not. The man is linked to a house between Praia da Luz and Lagos, and another inland Police released pictures showing the interior of one house believed to be linked to the suspect The suspect has been described as white with short blond hair, and about 6ft (1.8m) tall with a slim build at the time. Police have also released photos of two vehicles - a VW camper van and a Jaguar car - which are believed to be linked to the man, as well as a house in Portugal. The day after Madeleine vanished in 2007, the suspect transferred the Jaguar to someone else's name. New suspect identified in Madeleine McCann case Madeleine went missing shortly before her fourth birthday from an apartment in Praia da Luz on the evening of 3 May 2007 while her parents were with friends at a nearby tapas bar. Her disappearance sparked a huge and costly police hunt across much of Europe - the most recent Metropolitan Police investigation, which began in 2011, has cost more than Â£11m. Det Ch Insp Mark Cranwell, who is in charge of the Met investigation - known as Operation Grange - said the suspect, then aged 30, frequented the Algarve between 1995 and 2007, staying for ""days upon end"" in his camper van and living a ""transient lifestyle"". He was in the Praia da Luz area where the McCann family was staying when she disappeared and received a phone call at 19:32, which ended at 20:02. Madeleine is believed to have disappeared between 21:10 and 22:00 that evening. Police have released details of the suspect's phone number (+351 912 730 680) and the number which dialled him (+351 916 510 683), and said any information about these numbers could be ""critical"". Det Ch Insp Cranwell said the caller was a ""key witness"" and should get in touch, while he also appealed to the public for details about the suspect. The Ocean Club in Praia da Luz where the McCann family were staying A camper van belonging to the suspect was seen around Praia da Luz in Portugal The suspect transferred the registration of this 1993 Jaguar XJR6 to someone else the day after Madeleine disappeared The joint appeal from the British, German and Portuguese police includes a Â£20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the person responsible for Madeleine's disappearance. Those with information can contact the Operation Grange incident room on 020 7321 9251. Det Ch Insp Cranwell said he wanted to thank members of the public who had already got in touch. ""We are pleased with the information coming in, and it will be assessed and prioritised,"" he said. ""We continue to urge anyone with information to come forward and speak with us."" Jim Gamble, who served as the senior child protection officer in the UK's first police investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, said it was the first time in 13 years ""when I actually dare to hope"". The ""circumstantial evidence"" that had been shared by the police made the new suspect a ""really significant person of interest"", he said. He said he believed the man ""came to light a number of years ago"" but was only being made public now because it was a ""painstaking"" process which began from ""a point of chaos"" after the initial investigation had been ""bungled"". Is this the breakthrough? Is this German prisoner the man who can unlock the mystery? It certainly has the feel of a significant development - police have used those very words. Evidence, according to detectives, places the man near the scene; the re-registering of his car the next day is undoubtedly suspicious. And his criminal record, disclosed by the German police, is a disturbing guide as to what his motivations might have been. But... there have been so many false trails in the case before - clues, sightings and suspects that led nowhere. Three years ago, during the last major police appeal, Scotland Yard said it was working on one final ""critical"" line of inquiry. Now, we're told there's another one. That may explain why Met detectives - who've been involved in the case for nine years - are being rather more cautious than their German counterparts. In a statement, the McCanns, from Rothley in Leicestershire, welcomed the appeal: ""We would like to thank the police forces involved for their continued efforts in the search for Madeleine. ""All we have ever wanted is to find her, uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice. ""We will never give up hope of finding Madeleine alive, but whatever the outcome may be, we need to know as we need to find peace."" A Downing Street spokesman said the latest developments appeared to be significant and No 10's thoughts were with the McCann family ""who have had to endure so much"". Police said the suspect was one of 600 people that detectives on the UK inquiry originally looked at, though he had not been a suspect. After a 10-year anniversary appeal in 2017, ""significant"" fresh information about him was provided. 3 May 2007:Alarm is raised after Madeleine is found to be missing September 2007: Kate and Gerry McCann are made ""arguidos"" - formal suspects - in their daughter's disappearance July 2008: Portuguese police halt their investigation and lift the ""arguido"" status of the McCanns and another man, Robert Murat May 2011:Prime Minister David Cameron asks the Metropolitan Policeto help investigate.

"Almost Â£7bn has been raised to immunise 300 million children at a virtual global vaccine summit hosted by the UK. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said up to eight million lives would be saved as a result of the funds pledged at the Gavi vaccine summit on Thursday. The money will help immunise children against diseases like polio, diphtheria and measles over five years. Mr Johnson said the triumph of humanity over disease was the ""greatest shared endeavour of our lifetimes"". The summit raised funds for Gavi, a global alliance of public and private sector organisations promoting vaccination among the world's poorest communities. Pledges by more than 50 countries and individuals like billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates saw the total surpass an initial target of $7.4bn (almost Â£6bn). Mr Gates donated $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) from his foundation and Mr Johnson pledged Â£1.65bn over the next five years, making the UK the organisation's biggest donor. Stalled vaccine schemes 'put young lives at risk' The summit comes as the world continues to struggle to get to grips with the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Johnson also used the conference to urge world leaders to renew their ""collective resolve"" to find a Covid-19 vaccine. ""Just as we have great military alliances like Nato... where countries collaborate on building their collective military defence, so we now need that same spirit of collaboration and collective defence against the common enemy of disease,"" he said. ""It will require a new international effort to co-operate on the surveillance and the sharing of information - data is king - that can underpin a global alert system, so we can rapidly identify any future outbreak. And it will mean a radical scaling-up of our global capacity to respond."" International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan later said she believed the UK was capable of delivering a coronavirus vaccine to those who need it ""at speed"" when one becomes available. By Tulip Mazumdar, global health correspondent US President Donald Trump made a surprise appearance at the virtual global vaccine summit. Last week, Mr Trump severed ties with the UN's health agency, the World Health Organization, stopping around $400m (Â£317m) in support, after accusing it and China of mishandling the outbreak. There was international criticism of the decision, particularly because it was made in the middle of a global pandemic. But at the summit, Mr Trump struck a different tone in what was a very brief and seemingly very off-the-cuff, pre-recorded message. ""As the coronavirus has shown, there are no borders, it doesn't discriminate,"" he said. ""It's mean, it's nasty but we're going to take care of it together.... We will work hard, we will work strong... good luck, let's get the answer.""

Launched as Covid-Organics, the tea is produced from the artemisia plant - the source of an ingredient used in a malaria treatment - and other Malagasy plants. The potential benefits of the tea has not been validated by any specific study. Andriamanana announced last week that she was ordering $2.2 million (Â£1.7 million) worth of sweets to go alongside the ""cure"". Following outrage, the order was cancelled and the government has now announced she has been sacked. Governments around the world have pledged $8.8bn (Â£6.98m) in

to honour those who have died in the pandemic. Around 600 people attended Seville's cathedral, with many of the seats reserved
for families of the victims and authorities in what is one of the largest
gatherings in Spain since the lockdown began in March. The cathedral, which is a World Heritage site, accommodated the mourners under strict safety conditions, as a  53-person choir, led by four soloists and accompanied by 27
musicians performed Mozartâs Requiem. Spain has had over 240,000 confirmed cases and in excess of
27,000 deaths according to its official figures, thoughmultiple reports,externalhave
questioned the way in which those figures have been reached. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has told those in New York who have attended protests to assume they have been exposed to the virus. He said that the state was opening testing facilities for everyone who has attended a protest. People across the US have been protesting following the death of African-American George Floyd. Cuomo estimates about 30,000 people took to the streets in New York state. Every region across New York state has been allowed to start reopening aside from New York City. Cuomo is set to allow New York City to open on Monday for limited economic activity. A second phase of opening could start as early as July and will include outdoor restaurant seating.

Read more on the story Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent Members of the aviation industry have held a conference call with the government following an announcement that people landing in the UK will have to undergo a two-week quarantine period. Aviation bosses are fuming about the quarantine. And the phone call seems to have made things worse. One person present on the conference call described it as âa shamblesâ. The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps wasnât there because he was leading the Downing Street briefing and making a big announcement about face coverings become compulsory on public transport.But airline bosses were apparently unimpressed. They felt they got no reassurances from the Home Secretary Priti Patel that the quarantine would be reduced in any significant way soon by agreeing so-called âair bridgesâ, safe corridors between the UK and countries with low infection rates meaning people wonât have to self-isolate after they travel. That is an interesting contradiction in tone from other government sources who insist ministers are working hard to establish a number of air bridges, especially with European countries, as soon as possible. The fact that British Airwaysâ sister company, IAG didnât even attend the call is the ultimate sign that relations between the government and UK aviation are rock bottom. We reported earlier on people in Peru queuing to buy oxygen tanks for their relatives who are suffering from coronavirus. Here are some pictures of the extraordinary scenes in Lima. ""Prices are very high, but there's an urgent need and lots of companies are taking advantage,"" resident Erick Vila told the EFE news agency. Hospitals are stretched across the country and oxygen shortages have caused deaths. Many people suspected of having the virus now prefer to stay at home. Peru is now the second most badly affected country in Latin America, behind Brazil. Some 179,000 cases have been recorded and authorities are struggling to contain the spread of the disease. The prosecutor-general in Egypt has called for urgent legal action after a man reportedly arranged female genital mutilation (FGM) for his three young daughters, telling them it was a treatment for Covid-19. Both the father and the doctor who performed the procedures have been referred to a criminal court. The incident was reported to the authorities by their mother who is divorced from the children's father. He is said to have told the girls they were being ""vaccinated"" for coronavirus. They were then reportedly drugged and FGM was carried out on them. FGM has been illegal in Egypt since 2008, however it remains prevalent. Three of the authors behind a study in medical journal The Lancet that raised safety concerns over the use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 have retracted their paper. Hydroxychloroquine is being studied by a number of scientists to see if it is a viable treatment for Covid-19. US President Donald Trump took a two-week course of the drug as a preventative measure. The Lancet said the company that provided the data used in the study would not transfer the full statistics for an independent review. They concluded they ""can no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources"", a statement from the medical journal said. The study claimed there were no benefits to treating coronavirus patients with the drug and said taking it might even increase the number of deaths among those in hospital with the disease. Following the publication of the study, the World Health Organization (WHO) halted its trial, but it announced on Wednesday that this work would resume. Allow Twitter content?

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A forthcoming US ban on flights from China has left some Chinese students worried they wonât be able to get home. Yesterday, the US announced that it would suspend all Chinese passenger planes from 16 June. This has led to an outpouring of anxiety on social media, with many asking, ""What will international students do?"" The independent South China Morning Post said that last yearsome 370,000 students from China were enrolled in institutes across the US.,external. Seemingly in response to reaction to the US ban, the Civil Aviation Administration of China has signalled that it will loosen its own restrictions on arrivals, saying airports in 37 cities across China should now become available to international flights. This has led to praise online, with users of the popular Sina Weibo platform saying that China is âputting peopleâs interests firstâ and that they hope those in the US can âhurry homeâ. But there are also concerns. China has gone to great lengths to ensure that it doesnât see a second wave of Covid-19, implementing mass testing and strict quarantine procedures. Many are worried that an influx of people returning from overseas could lead to a fresh spike in cases. Parts of the Brecon Beacons national park are set to reopen next week for the first time since coronavirus restrictions came into effect.

Launched as Covid-Organics, the tea is produced from the artemisia plant - the source of an ingredient used in a malaria treatment - and other Malagasy plants. The potential benefits of the tea has not been validated by any specific study. Andriamanana announced last week that she was ordering $2.2 million (Â£1.7 million) worth of sweets to go alongside the ""cure"".

a virtual summit hosted by the UK to raise funds for global vaccine alliance, Gavi,
which distributes life-saving immunisations in developing countries. Pledges by more than 50 countries and individuals like
billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, saw the total surpass an initial target
of $7.4bn. The funding will be used to vaccinate 300 million children worldwide
against deadly diseases such as polio, measles and cholera. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who hosted the event has pledged
Â£1.65bn ($2.08bn) to Gavi over the next five years, making the UK the organisationâs
biggest donor. The summit was also the backdrop for the launch of a $2bn (Â£1.6m)
fund to ensure Gavi has future access to Covid-19 vaccines for poorer countries. Face coverings are to become compulsory for people using

to honour those who have died in the pandemic. Around 600 people attended Seville's cathedral, with many of the seats reserved
for families of the victims and authorities in what is one of the largest
gatherings in Spain since the lockdown began in March. The cathedral, which is a World Heritage site, accommodated the mourners under strict safety conditions, as a  53-person choir, led by four soloists and accompanied by 27
musicians performed Mozartâs Requiem. Spain has had over 240,000 confirmed cases and in excess of
27,000 deaths according to its official figures, thoughmultiple reports,externalhave
questioned the way in which those figures have been reached. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has told those in New York who have attended protests to assume they have been exposed to the virus. He said that the state was opening testing facilities for everyone who has attended a protest. People across the US have been protesting following the death of African-American George Floyd. Cuomo estimates about 30,000 people took to the streets in New York state. Every region across New York state has been allowed to start reopening aside from New York City. Cuomo is set to allow New York City to open on Monday for limited economic activity. A second phase of opening could start as early as July and will include outdoor restaurant seating. NBA owners have approved a plan to restart the basketball season season at Florida's

Read more on the story Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent Members of the aviation industry have held a conference call with the government following an announcement that people landing in the UK will have to undergo a two-week quarantine period. Aviation bosses are fuming about the quarantine. And the phone call seems to have made things worse. One person present on the conference call described it as âa shamblesâ. The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps wasnât there because he was leading the Downing Street briefing and making a big announcement about face coverings become compulsory on public transport.But airline bosses were apparently unimpressed. They felt they got no reassurances from the Home Secretary Priti Patel that the quarantine would be reduced in any significant way soon by agreeing so-called âair bridgesâ, safe corridors between the UK and countries with low infection rates meaning people wonât have to self-isolate after they travel. That is an interesting contradiction in tone from other government sources who insist ministers are working hard to establish a number of air bridges, especially with European countries, as soon as possible. The fact that British Airwaysâ sister company, IAG didnât even attend the call is the ultimate sign that relations between the government and UK aviation are rock bottom. We reported earlier on people in Peru queuing to buy oxygen tanks for their relatives who are suffering from coronavirus. Here are some pictures of the extraordinary scenes in Lima. ""Prices are very high, but there's an urgent need and lots of companies are taking advantage,"" resident Erick Vila told the EFE news agency. Hospitals are stretched across the country and oxygen shortages have caused deaths. Many people suspected of having the virus now prefer to stay at home. Peru is now the second most badly affected country in Latin America, behind Brazil. Some 179,000 cases have been recorded and authorities are struggling to contain the spread of the disease. The prosecutor-general in Egypt has called for urgent legal action after a man reportedly arranged female genital mutilation (FGM) for his three young daughters, telling them it was a treatment for Covid-19. Both the father and the doctor who performed the procedures have been referred to a criminal court. The incident was reported to the authorities by their mother who is divorced from the children's father. He is said to have told the girls they were being ""vaccinated"" for coronavirus. They were then reportedly drugged and FGM was carried out on them. FGM has been illegal in Egypt since 2008, however it remains prevalent. Three of the authors behind a study in medical journal The Lancet that raised safety concerns over the use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 have retracted their paper. Hydroxychloroquine is being studied by a number of scientists to see if it is a viable treatment for Covid-19. US President Donald Trump took a two-week course of the drug as a preventative measure. The Lancet said the company that provided the data used in the study would not transfer the full statistics for an independent review. They concluded they ""can no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources"", a statement from the medical journal said. The study claimed there were no benefits to treating coronavirus patients with the drug and said taking it might even increase the number of deaths among those in hospital with the disease. Following the publication of the study, the World Health Organization (WHO) halted its trial, but it announced on Wednesday that this work would resume. Allow Twitter content?

The country is set to reopen hotels and cafes, allow sporting events without spectators and shorten a night-time curfew from Saturday. Prime Minister Omar al-Razzaz told reporters that toughening enforcement of social distancing measures was to ensure there is not a resurgence of infections.

"Debenhams is to reopen its first stores in Northern Ireland on Monday, followed by 50 shops in England the week after. It says three stores with street access in Belfast, Newry and Rushmere will be able to open following updated guidance from the NI Executive. Debenhams collapsed into administration for the second time in a year in April after coronavirus ramped up the pressures facing the business. It has struck deals with landlords to keep 120 stores open. However, 17 stores will remain closed for good when coronavirus lockdown restrictions are lifted.  It is still in discussions over a ""handful"" of others. The future of its five main stores in Wales has been secured after it reached agreement on business rates.Debenhams had threatened to close themif it did not get the same level of support enjoyed by its stores in England. Steven Cook, managing director of Debenhams, said: ""We are delighted to be welcoming customers back to our stores in the coming weeks. ""From the installation of perspex screens at till points to the roll-out of social distancing procedures and PPE, we have been working hard to ensure our colleagues and customers can work and shop with confidence. ""Our reopening plans follow the successful conclusion of lease negotiations on 120 stores, meaning that the vast majority of our stores will be reopening."" 'Why couldn't they keep us furloughed?' Debenhams strikes deals to rescue most stores Meanwhile, the administrators have written to creditors with an update. When Debenhams collapsed into administration, the business owed Â£155m to creditors, including many suppliers. It is still unclear how much will be paid and to whom. Debenhams has also been cutting jobs at its head office and closing the majority of its store cafes in a bid to cut costs and become a leaner business. A total of 4,000 jobs will be lost as a result of these changes, as well as the 17 store closures. The key question now is whether the chain can be rescued from administration as a going concern. It is in what is being described as a ""light touch"" administration, where the current management has remained in place. Its lenders are said to remain supportive. They took control of the chain after it collapsed into administration last year, after struggling for years to keep up with the competition. The business may not exit administration until the new year. Administrators and lenders will no doubt want to see how the business performs post-lockdown, as well as the crucial Christmas trading period, in order to be confident it has a viable future in its current form. Future store closures are still possible. Debenhams will be back in business on the High Street along with its rivals this month, but it still has a long and difficult journey ahead.

"Luxury carmaker Bentley has said it will cut 1,000 jobs in the UK, about a quarter of its workforce. The company, which makes its cars in Crewe, has offered all staff the chance to take voluntary redundancy. The move comes as the car industry faces a sharp drop in sales due to coronavirus. Bentley has also struggled to be profitable in recent years. Bentley's boss, Adrian Hallmark, said the virus was not the cause of the cuts, but a ""hastener"". Bentley workers to be furloughed in agency U-turn Aston Martin profits hit by 'disappointing' year Car sales have been severely hit by the closure of car manufacturers, suppliers and showrooms due to the virus. In a statement, Bentley which turns 101 on 10 July, said it was launching a restructuring programme which would ""redefine Bentley for the next 100 years"". The plan had been due to be announced in March, but was deferred due to the pandemic. While the substance of the new strategy remained the same, the company said the effects on the short-term financial outlook for the company meant that it had to ""significantly reduce the size of the organisation through a voluntary release programme"". It said it was looking for as many as 1,000 people to accept voluntary redundancy, but it ""cannot rule out future compulsory redundancies"". ""Losing colleagues is not something we are treating lightly but this is a necessary step that we have to take to safeguard the jobs of the vast majority who will remain, and deliver a sustainable business model for the future through our Beyond100 strategy,"" said Mr Hallmark. That strategy aims to make Bentley the ""leader in sustainable luxury mobility for the next 100 years"", with an ""accelerated journey towards electrification with every model"". Last month, Mr Hallmark said that a quarter of the company's workers had been furloughed due to the lockdown while another quarter were working from home. The carmaker has since restarted production at its Crewe factory, but with only around half the usual number of staff. Bentley, which is owned by Volkswagen, has struggled to be profitable in recent years. It is in the middle of a turnaround plan which began in 2018. Last year, it increased its worldwide sales by 5% to 11,000 cars and it reported a record performance in the first quarter of 2020. But now with ""considerable forecast reduction to future revenues"" due to coronavirus it has carried out a review of its cost and investment structure and ""as the last resort... the people cost and structure"". The SMMT trade body said only 20,000 new cars were registered in the UK last month - down 89% year-on-year - the worst May performance since 1952.

"Home Secretary Priti Patel insists quarantine will help stop the virus' spread British Airways refused to attend a meeting with Home Secretary Priti Patel on Thursday to discuss the UK's new quarantine plans. The UK's biggest airline is a fierce opponent of the plans, which will require travellers to the UK to isolate for 14 days or face a Â£1,000 fine. BA did not give a reason for its absence and declined further comment. But a Whitehall source told the BBC it was clear BA was not serious about getting ""Britain moving again"". The new quarantine rules come into force from 8 June. BA, under huge financial strain due to the pandemic, has called it ""another blow to our industry"". BA and owner IAG - which also runs Iberia and Aer Lingus - are understood to be annoyed at what they see as a lack of consultation over the quarantine's introduction. EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic, as well as the owner of Heathrow Airport, were among the aviation businesses that attended the telephone meeting with Ms Patel and junior aviation minister Kelly Tolhurst. The Home Office said 24 representatives from the aviation, maritime and rail industries were on the call. Airlines across the world have grounded aircraft as passenger numbers collapse The home secretary told the meeting it was important for everyone in the transport sector to help ""safeguard our [economic] recovery"" and ""protect passengers and the whole country from a second wave of coronavirus"". However, an industry source said that BA feels ""it has not been treated professionally; that the meeting was a waste of time"". A Whitehall official hit back, telling the BBC: ""It's a shame that British Airways don't want to directly make their case to the home secretary and the aviation minister. Clearly they are not serious about working with the government to get Britain moving ."" BA has faced heavy criticism in parliament in recent days over a plan to slash jobs while accessing the government's furlough scheme. In April, BA said it would cut 12,000 roles and weaken terms and conditions for its remaining staff, just weeks after it had put 30,000 workers on the job retention scheme which pays workers' wages. The airline has defended the cuts as necessary, but on Wednesday Ms Tolhurst suggested BA should be held to account for what one MP called a ""breach of faith"". ""The [furlough] scheme was not designed for taxpayers to fund the wages of employees only for those companies to put the same staff on notice of redundancy during the furlough period,"" Ms Tolhurst said. Aviation bosses are fuming about the quarantine. And tonight's conference call seems to have made things worse. Most were apparently unimpressed, with one person present on the call even describing it as ""a shambles"". They feel they got no reassurances from Priti Patel that the quarantine would be reduced in any significant way soon by agreeing so-called ""air bridges"". These are safe corridors between the UK and countries with low infection rates meaning people won't have to self-isolate after they travel. That is an interesting contradiction in tone from other government sources who insist ministers are working hard to establish a number of air bridges, especially with European countries, as soon as possible. The fact that BA's parent company IAG didn't even attend the call is the ultimate sign that relations between the government and UK aviation are at rock bottom. The government insists the new quarantine rules will help contain the spread of coronavirus but has faced a backlash from Conservative MPs who argue they will harm airlines and stop people taking summer holidays The rules have also been roundly criticised by the UK's tourism industry, which has all but ground to a halt due to the pandemic. In her opening remarks at the meeting Ms Patel said: ""Protecting lives will always be our top priority, but I am alive to the impact on your sector and I'm asking you to work with us on this."" But earlier on Thursday, the boss of the UK's biggest airport services company, Swissport, said on Thursday that the plan could deliver a ""killer blow"" to the tourism sector. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has criticised the plans Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, echoed those concerns, saying the requirement to self-isolate would ""significantly reduce European visitors"". ""The safety and security of our people and our customers is always our top priority and public health must come first,"" a Virgin Atlantic spokesman said. ""However, the introduction of mandatory 14-day self-isolation for every single traveller entering the UK will reduce customer demand significantly and prevent a resumption of services at scale."" On Monday, a group of 200 travel companies wrote to Ms Patel asking for the plans to be scrapped. The letter suggested travel should be possible for people - without quarantine - between destinations ""deemed safe from coronavirus"". So-called air bridges would allow visitors from countries where coronavirus infection rates are low into the UK, without having to self-isolate for two weeks. A government source told the BBC there was a ""list"" of countries which the government was hoping to secure air bridge agreements with, which include all major European tourist destinations such as Portugal, Spain and France as well as Australia and Singapore. However, for now the government's official position is that the idea is ""under consideration"", not established policy.

a virtual summit hosted by the UK to raise funds for global vaccine alliance, Gavi,
which distributes life-saving immunisations in developing countries. Pledges by more than 50 countries and individuals like
billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, saw the total surpass an initial target
of $7.4bn. The funding will be used to vaccinate 300 million children worldwide
against deadly diseases such as polio, measles and cholera. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who hosted the event has pledged
Â£1.65bn ($2.08bn) to Gavi over the next five years, making the UK the organisationâs
biggest donor. The summit was also the backdrop for the launch of a $2bn (Â£1.6m)
fund to ensure Gavi has future access to Covid-19 vaccines for poorer countries. Face coverings are to become compulsory for people using
public transport in England from Monday 15 June as the government eases restrictions further. They are already recommended in some enclosed spaces - like
public transport and shops - when social distancing (staying more than 2m
apart) isn't possible. But just exactly what do the new rules say and how will they be enforced? You can find out morehere. A funeral has been held in the Spanish city of Seville,
to honour those who have died in the pandemic. Around 600 people attended Seville's cathedral, with many of the seats reserved
for families of the victims and authorities in what is one of the largest
gatherings in Spain since the lockdown began in March. The cathedral, which is a World Heritage site, accommodated the mourners under strict safety conditions, as a  53-person choir, led by four soloists and accompanied by 27
musicians performed Mozartâs Requiem. Spain has had over 240,000 confirmed cases and in excess of
27,000 deaths according to its official figures, thoughmultiple reports,externalhave
questioned the way in which those figures have been reached. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has told those in New York who have attended protests to assume they have been exposed to the virus. He said that the state was opening testing facilities for everyone who has attended a protest. People across the US have been protesting following the death of African-American George Floyd. Cuomo estimates about 30,000 people took to the streets in New York state. Every region across New York state has been allowed to start reopening aside from New York City. Cuomo is set to allow New York City to open on Monday for limited economic activity. A second phase of opening could start as early as July and will include outdoor restaurant seating. NBA owners have approved a plan to restart the basketball season season at Florida's
Disney World Resort on 31 July. Under the plan, Disney's ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex,
which has multiple hotels and arenas, will provide a single site for games,
training and accommodation. The NBA was the first US competition to suspend its season
due to the pandemic in March. The end of season playoffs are now due to take place in
August, with the NBA Finals set to be completed by 12 October. The league has also pencilled in a provisional start date of
1 December for the 2020-21 season. It normally begins in mid-October. Read more on the story Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent Members of the aviation industry have held a conference call with the government following an announcement that people landing in the UK will have to undergo a two-week quarantine period. Aviation bosses are fuming about the quarantine. And the phone call seems to have made things worse. One person present on the conference call described it as âa shamblesâ. The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps wasnât there because he was leading the Downing Street briefing and making a big announcement about face coverings become compulsory on public transport.But airline bosses were apparently unimpressed. They felt they got no reassurances from the Home Secretary Priti Patel that the quarantine would be reduced in any significant way soon by agreeing so-called âair bridgesâ, safe corridors between the UK and countries with low infection rates meaning people wonât have to self-isolate after they travel. That is an interesting contradiction in tone from other government sources who insist ministers are working hard to establish a number of air bridges, especially with European countries, as soon as possible. The fact that British Airwaysâ sister company, IAG didnât even attend the call is the ultimate sign that relations between the government and UK aviation are rock bottom. We reported earlier on people in Peru queuing to buy oxygen tanks for their relatives who are suffering from coronavirus. Here are some pictures of the extraordinary scenes in Lima. ""Prices are very high, but there's an urgent need and lots of companies are taking advantage,"" resident Erick Vila told the EFE news agency. Hospitals are stretched across the country and oxygen shortages have caused deaths. Many people suspected of having the virus now prefer to stay at home. Peru is now the second most badly affected country in Latin America, behind Brazil. Some 179,000 cases have been recorded and authorities are struggling to contain the spread of the disease. The prosecutor-general in Egypt has called for urgent legal action after a man reportedly arranged female genital mutilation (FGM) for his three young daughters, telling them it was a treatment for Covid-19. Both the father and the doctor who performed the procedures have been referred to a criminal court. The incident was reported to the authorities by their mother who is divorced from the children's father. He is said to have told the girls they were being ""vaccinated"" for coronavirus. They were then reportedly drugged and FGM was carried out on them. FGM has been illegal in Egypt since 2008, however it remains prevalent. Three of the authors behind a study in medical journal The Lancet that raised safety concerns over the use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 have retracted their paper. Hydroxychloroquine is being studied by a number of scientists to see if it is a viable treatment for Covid-19. US President Donald Trump took a two-week course of the drug as a preventative measure. The Lancet said the company that provided the data used in the study would not transfer the full statistics for an independent review. They concluded they ""can no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources"", a statement from the medical journal said. The study claimed there were no benefits to treating coronavirus patients with the drug and said taking it might even increase the number of deaths among those in hospital with the disease. Following the publication of the study, the World Health Organization (WHO) halted its trial, but it announced on Wednesday that this work would resume. Allow Twitter content?

Jordan says it will loosen coronavirus restrictions in the country but warned it would now toughen its enforcement of social distancing. The country is set to reopen hotels and cafes, allow sporting events without spectators and shorten a night-time curfew from Saturday. Prime Minister Omar al-Razzaz told reporters that toughening enforcement of social distancing measures was to ensure there is not a resurgence of infections. The country imposed a state of emergency in March, sealing its borders and enforcing a night curfew. There have been 757 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and nine deaths. Officials say new infections have dropped to less than  10 a day over the past week. ThePremier League has confirmedthat its shareholders have agreed temporary changes to the rules relating to substitutes. For the remainder of the
2019-20 season, which isset to resume on 17 June,the number of substitutes that can be used during a match will

Clubs can also increase the maximum number of substitute players on their bench from seven to nine. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A forthcoming US ban on flights from China has left some Chinese students worried they wonât be able to get home. Yesterday, the US announced that it would suspend all Chinese passenger planes from 16 June. This has led to an outpouring of anxiety on social media, with many asking, ""What will international students do?"" The independent South China Morning Post said that last yearsome 370,000 students from China were enrolled in institutes across the US.,external. Seemingly in response to reaction to the US ban, the Civil Aviation Administration of China has signalled that it will loosen its own restrictions on arrivals, saying airports in 37 cities across China should now become available to international flights. This has led to praise online, with users of the popular Sina Weibo platform saying that China is âputting peopleâs interests firstâ and that they hope those in the US can âhurry homeâ. But there are also concerns. China has gone to great lengths to ensure that it doesnât see a second wave of Covid-19, implementing mass testing and strict quarantine procedures. Many are worried that an influx of people returning from overseas could lead to a fresh spike in cases. Parts of the Brecon Beacons national park are set to reopen next week for the first time since coronavirus restrictions came into effect. The park authority said it had been reviewing its approach since the Welsh Government announced theeasing of some lockdown measures. It hopes toopen some areas from Monday,external, but more popular sites, such as Pen y Fan, will remain closed. It said protecting people and health services was the ""utmost priority"". Wales' national parks and other beauty spots werethronged with visitors at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, with the closure of many sites thencoming with the lockdown at the end of March. BBC OS A number of large protests are taking place around the globe. There are concerns that gatherings  could cause a spike in cases of coronavirus.

Before lockdown, the BBC visited one care home in Blackpool to find out how it - and its 89 sister homes across the UK - were preparing. In this special report, Newsnight's Katie Razzall hears from staff about about the way the crisis unfolded. The Department of Health and Social Care said its priority was to protect everyone in care homes, and that the latest statistics show over 60% of care homes have had no outbreak at all. The British Crown Dependency of the Isle of Man has announced that it will allow groups of up to 30 people to gather in public as part of what its chief minister has described as""the new Manx normal"". From 15 June, the self-governing territory in the Irish Sea will also allow restaurants, pubs and cafes to serve diners indoors and gyms will be permitted to partially reopen. The island, which has seen 24 Covid-19-linked deaths, now has no active cases. People who took part in protests over the killing of George Floyd should ""highly consider"" getting tested for coronavirus, a top US health official said on Thursday. ""Those individuals that have partaken in these peaceful
protests or have been out protesting, and particularly if
they're in metropolitan areas that really haven't controlled the
outbreak...  we really want those individuals to highly consider
being evaluated and get tested,"" Robert Redfield, director for
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a House of Representatives committee. Protests over the death of George Floyd - who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes - continued in dozens of cities on Wednesday night despite widespread curfews.

"Michael R White is seen here in an undated photograph A US Navy veteran is returning home after being freed from detention in Iran. Michael White was sentenced to prison last year on unspecified charges, but was released temporarily on medical grounds to the Swiss embassy in March. He was arrested in 2018 after travelling to meet his girlfriend in the Iranian city of Mashhad. His release came on the day that Iran's foreign minister announced the return from the US of an Iranian doctor. US officials have yet to confirm the release of Majid Taheri, but a third man -an Iranian scientist detained in the US- was deported to Iran earlier this week. Sirous Asgari, a materials science professor from Tehran, had been charged in 2016 with trying to trade secret research from an American university, but was acquitted in November. The releases appear to be a rare example of co-operation between Iran and the US - although Washington has denied so far that it was a straight prisoner swap. US President Donald Trump confirmed on Thursday that Mr White had been freed and the Swiss plane he was travelling on had left Iranian airspace. ""I will never stop working to secure the release of all Americans held hostage overseas,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I am blessed to announce that the nightmare is over, and my son is safely on his way home."" Both Mr White's family and President Trump thanked Switzerland for its help. The 48-year-old was one of at least six US citizens either imprisoned in Iran or out on bail. Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals He was granted medical furlough to the Swiss embassy in March amid the release of large numbers of prisoners due to the spread of coronavirus in Iran. His family said he had visited the country a number of times before he was detained. ""We look forward to reuniting him with his family,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday. ""[We] will not rest until we bring every American detained in Iran and around the world back home to their loved ones,"" he added. In December, the US and Iran conducted a prisoner swapin a rare sign of co-operation. Chinese-American researcher Xiyue Wang and Iranian scientist Massoud Soleimani were freed. Relations between the two countries have been increasingly hostile since the US abandoned the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. But tensions escalated further this year when the US assassinated top Iranian commander Gen Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Iraq in January.

"People arriving in the UK will have to isolate for 14 days or face penalties The travel industry has condemned the government's quarantine rules, warning the mandatory two-week isolation will deter visitors and put jobs at risk. From 8 June all passengers arriving in the UK must self-isolate for 14 days. The manufacturing industry has added to the criticism, warning fewer flights will restrict imports and exports. The boss of the UK's biggest airport services company, Swissport, said the plan could deliver a ""killer blow"" to the tourism sector. Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, echoed those concerns, saying the requirement to self-isolate would ""significantly reduce European visitors"". Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr O'Leary said most countries in Europe have a lower rate of coronavirus than the UK. At a time when ""Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal are removing visitor restrictions, the UK is imposing them,"" he said. What are the new quarantine rules for passengers? UK quarantine plans and Â£1,000 penalties confirmed 'Iâm ready to face quarantine just to get away' Swissport chief Jason Holt questioned why the rules were being put in place now. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, he said: ""If it's so important and it's so relevant to the virus, and we all want the country to be safe, why wasn't this done in March? That's why everybody's quite confused on this."" More than 200 travel companies have written to the government asking for the new rules to be scrapped, while some MPs have also raised concerns. The boss of tour operator Red Savannah said the government had failed to listen to the concerns of the travel industry. ""We are none the wiser as to the science behind the rationale for quarantine,"" said George Morgan-Grenville. ""It is the wrong policy that is going to cause untold misery for hundreds of thousands of people who will now very likely be made redundant."" But the government says the quarantine period is a ""proportionate and time-limited approach'' to protect public health. On Wednesday, Home Secretary Priti Patel told Parliament imported coronavirus cases now ''pose a more significant threat''. ""We are past the peak but we are now more vulnerable to infections being brought in from abroad,"" she said. The manufacturing industry has warned the quarantine rules will have knock on effects for freight, and that will hamper the recovery of some businesses. Speaking to a committee of senior MPs, Stephen Phipson, the head of the manufacturers' association Make UK, said ""passenger aircraft are really important for freight. The belly of the aircraft carries freight. Heathrow is the largest port in the country."" ""For import and export in manufacturing that passenger freight traffic is vital"", he said. He described the quarantine rules as ""disappointing from that point of view"". From Sunday, all passengers arriving in the UK by plane, ferry or train will have to provide an address where they will remain for 14 days. Surprise visits will be used to check they are following the quarantine rules. Those in England could be fined up to Â£1,000 if they are not at home. A spokesman for the trade body Airlines UK said the government needed to clarify whether people from some countries with low infection rates would be exempt from quarantine rules, under a so-called air bridge. ""If the government leave it too late we run the risk of the summer season being over and losing out to other countries who are starting to open up their borders now,"" he said.

Swissport, which handles airport ground services and cargo, earned more than â¬3bn (Â£2.8bn) in revenue in 2019 but the coronavirus crisis has reduced revenue by 95%, according to Mr Holt. The company has furloughed most of its 6,000 UK staff. Mr Holt said they would remain on the Job Retention Scheme until the government's future travel policies became clear. He said Swissport had lobbied the government to avoid introducing quarantine, but the company was now hoping the rules will only be in place for short time. ""We're really hoping no more than three weeks,"" he said. If it goes beyond that it could do ""irredeemable damage to the sector"". How are travel rules being relaxed?

"Protests have taken place around the US for several days Hundreds of people are expected to attend a memorial in Minneapolis for African American George Floyd, who died in police custody last month. The death of Floyd, whose neck was pinned under a white officer's knee, has sparked huge protests over racism and police killings of black Americans. The tribute comes despite fears over coronavirus at large gatherings. New charges were announced on Wednesday against all four of the now sacked officerspresent at Floyd's death. The charge against Derek Chauvin has been elevated to second-degree murder while the other three officers, previously uncharged, face counts of aiding and abetting murder. The vast majority of demonstrations over the past eight days have been peaceful, but some have turned violent and curfews have been imposed in a number of cities. Former President Barack Obama and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, are among senior public figures who have offered their support to the protesters. They were joined on Wednesday by former Defence Secretary James Mattis, who alsoattacked his former boss President Donald Trump, saying that he stoked division and had abused his authority in his reaction to the protests. The event, in the northern city of Minneapolis where Floyd died, is the first of several to honour him. It will take place at a sanctuary at the city's North Central University. Benjamin Crump,a lawyer for the Floyd family, said it was more than just honouring the dead man's memory,external. ""It's going to be a celebration of life, but it's also going to be a plea to America and a plea for justice that we don't let his death be in vain,"" he told NBC's Today show. Veteran civil rights campaigner, Rev Al Sharpton, will deliver the eulogy for the two-hour service, which will start at 13:00 local time (18:00 GMT). ""Out of all the years that I've been marching and protesting and doing eulogies and speeches, I'm more hopeful going to this service than I have been in a long time,""Rev Sharpton said on MSNBC's Morning Joe programme,external. ""Because I see more Americans of different races and different ages standing up together, marching together, raising their voices together... That makes me know we're on the brink of real change."" VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially-divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African-Americans treated? HOW IT HAPPENED:The last moments of his life Rev Sharpton, who met Floyd's family on Wednesday, said he would announce the launch of a new social movement at the memorial, as well as call for new federal legislation to end racial discrimination by police. Further tributes will be held at Floyd's birthplace in North Carolina on Saturday, and in his home town of Houston on Monday. .An athlete, friend and father - who was George Floyd? NFL teammates row over kneeling protests This video can not be played Mr Obama sees limitless potential in the faces of his fellow African Americans Mr Obama said it was vital to channel the momentum built up in the recent protests to bring about change. In his first video comments since Floyd's death, he said the demonstrations were as profound as anything he had seen in his lifetime, and called on Americans to seize the chance to deal with the underlying problems in society. ""Too often some of that violence has come from folks who were supposed to be serving and protecting you,"" Mr Obama said. ""I want you to know that you matter. I want you to know that your lives matter, your dreams matter. ""There is a change in mindset that's taking place, a greater recognition that we can do better,"" he added. Mr Obama did not comment directly on Mr Trump's handling of the unrest, although he urged mayors around the country to review their use-of-force policies. This video can not be played George Floyd's ex partner: ""Gianna doesn't have a father"" The Duchess of Sussex has also issued a personal messageabout Floyd's death, saying his life mattered and recent events had been devastating. George Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis. A video showed Floyd being arrested and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally, with rallies on Wednesday in Australia, France, the Netherlands andin the UK, where thousands gathered in central London. This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting Floyd's death follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. For many, the outrage over Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination. Protests over the death continued in dozens of cities on Wednesday night despite widespread curfews. They have been largely peaceful, with cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago relaxing their restrictions amid hopes that the worst of the violence had passed. A post-mortem examination has revealed that Floyd had the coronavirus in early April. But officials stressed that this played no role in his death. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church.

Protests over the death continued in dozens of cities on Wednesday night despite widespread curfews.

"Protests have taken place around the US for several days Hundreds of people are expected to attend a memorial in Minneapolis for African American George Floyd, who died in police custody last month. The death of Floyd, whose neck was pinned under a white officer's knee, has sparked huge protests over racism and police killings of black Americans. The tribute comes despite fears over coronavirus at large gatherings. New charges were announced on Wednesday against all four of the now sacked officerspresent at Floyd's death. The charge against Derek Chauvin has been elevated to second-degree murder while the other three officers, previously uncharged, face counts of aiding and abetting murder. The vast majority of demonstrations over the past eight days have been peaceful, but some have turned violent and curfews have been imposed in a number of cities. Former President Barack Obama and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, are among senior public figures who have offered their support to the protesters. They were joined on Wednesday by former Defence Secretary James Mattis, who alsoattacked his former boss President Donald Trump, saying that he stoked division and had abused his authority in his reaction to the protests. The event, in the northern city of Minneapolis where Floyd died, is the first of several to honour him. It will take place at a sanctuary at the city's North Central University. Benjamin Crump,a lawyer for the Floyd family, said it was more than just honouring the dead man's memory,external. ""It's going to be a celebration of life, but it's also going to be a plea to America and a plea for justice that we don't let his death be in vain,"" he told NBC's Today show.

"Michael R White is seen here in an undated photograph A US Navy veteran is returning home after being freed from detention in Iran. Michael White was sentenced to prison last year on unspecified charges, but was released temporarily on medical grounds to the Swiss embassy in March. He was arrested in 2018 after travelling to meet his girlfriend in the Iranian city of Mashhad. His release came on the day that Iran's foreign minister announced the return from the US of an Iranian doctor. US officials have yet to confirm the release of Majid Taheri, but a third man -an Iranian scientist detained in the US- was deported to Iran earlier this week. Sirous Asgari, a materials science professor from Tehran, had been charged in 2016 with trying to trade secret research from an American university, but was acquitted in November. The releases appear to be a rare example of co-operation between Iran and the US - although Washington has denied so far that it was a straight prisoner swap. US President Donald Trump confirmed on Thursday that Mr White had been freed and the Swiss plane he was travelling on had left Iranian airspace. ""I will never stop working to secure the release of all Americans held hostage overseas,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""For the past 683 days my son, Michael, has been held hostage in Iran by the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps] and I have been living a nightmare,"" Mr White's mother said in a statement. ""I am blessed to announce that the nightmare is over, and my son is safely on his way home."" Both Mr White's family and President Trump thanked Switzerland for its help. The 48-year-old was one of at least six US citizens either imprisoned in Iran or out on bail. Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals He was granted medical furlough to the Swiss embassy in March amid the release of large numbers of prisoners due to the spread of coronavirus in Iran. His family said he had visited the country a number of times before he was detained. ""We look forward to reuniting him with his family,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday. ""[We] will not rest until we bring every American detained in Iran and around the world back home to their loved ones,"" he added. In December, the US and Iran conducted a prisoner swapin a rare sign of co-operation. Chinese-American researcher Xiyue Wang and Iranian scientist Massoud Soleimani were freed. Relations between the two countries have been increasingly hostile since the US abandoned the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. But tensions escalated further this year when the US assassinated top Iranian commander Gen Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Iraq in January. Iran retaliated by launching ballistic missiles at Iraqi military bases hosting US forces.

"This video can not be played Meghan called on young people and students at the school to come together to rebuild society The Duchess of Sussex has issued a personal message about the impact of George Floyd's death in the United States, saying his life ""mattered"". Addressing students graduating from her former school in Los Angeles, Meghan said the events had been ""devastating"". She also recalled living through race riots in 1992 and spoke of her regret that nothing appeared to have changed. In her video message, Meghan called on young people and students at the school to come together to rebuild society. A wave of anti-racism protests have been triggered by the death of African-American Mr Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May. Four officers have been charged in relation to his death. New charges brought over George Floyd's death Why has a US city gone up in flames? Thousands join UK protests over George Floyd death Anger has since spread to other parts of the world, including the UK, wherethousands of people joined a protest in Londonon Wednesday organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter. The sister of black teenager Anthony Walker, who was murdered by two men in a racially-motivated attack in Merseyside in 2005, called for an ""ongoing revolution"" following the demonstrations - to break down institutional racism in society. Dominique Walker, vice chair of the Anthony Walker Foundation set up after her brother's murder,told BBC Breakfast that police reform in the UK ""has to be taken further"". ""There has to be that definitive work that works to break down institutional racism,"" she said. In the UK, protesters marched to Westminster in central London, where they blocked the roads outside Parliament In the video of her virtual address to Immaculate Heart High School, the duchess said she was ""nervous"" about addressing graduates and speaking about events of the previous weeks. But she said that she ""realised the only wrong thing to say is nothing because George Floyd's life mattered"", before referring to other African-Americans who died in police shootings in the US in recent years. In the video, whichwas first reported,externalby the African-American female magazine Essence, Meghan also gave a heartfelt apology to the graduating students ""that we have not gotten the world to the place that you deserve it to be"". She told the all-girls school: ""I wasn't sure what I could say to you. I wanted to say the right thing and I was really nervous that I wouldn't or it would get picked apart, and I realised the only wrong thing to say is to say nothing - because George Floyd's life mattered and Breonna Taylor's life mattered and Philando Castile's life mattered and Tamir Rice's life mattered. ""And so did so many other people whose names we know and whose names we do not know."" She then shared her memories of living in the city through race riots in 1992, after police officers were filmed violently beating Rodney King. The duchess said: ""I was 11 or 12 years old and it was the LA riots, which was also triggered by a senseless act of racism. ""I remember the curfew and I remember rushing back home, and on that drive home, seeing ash fall from the sky, and smelling the smoke and seeing the smoke billow out of buildings. ""I remember seeing men in the back of a van just holding guns and rifles. ""I remember pulling up the house and seeing the tree, that had always been there, completely charred. And those memories don't go away."" CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African-Americans treated? GEORGE FLOYD:An athlete, friend and father NEWS REPORTERS:A new target for police? DECEPTIVE FOOTAGE:Conspiracy theories spread online HOW IT HAPPENED:The last moments of his life Meghan said she could not imagine that the students ""would have to have a different version of that same type of experience"". ""That's something you should have an understanding of, but an understanding... as a history lesson not as your reality,"" she said. ""So I'm sorry that in a way we have not gotten the world to the place that you deserve it to be."" She went on to highlight that people are ""standing in solidarity"" despite the unrest, and appealed to young people to ""be part of this movement"". The duchess said: ""I know that this is not the graduation that you envisioned [...] but I also know that there is a way to reframe this for you, and to not see this as the end of something. ""But instead to see this as the beginning of you harnessing all of the work, all of the values, all of the skills that you have embodied over the last four years. ""Now all of that work gets activated, now you get to be part of rebuilding."" She added: ""We are going to rebuild and rebuild and rebuild until it is rebuilt, because when the foundation is broken, so are we."" In the US, protests began in Minneapolis where Mr Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. Demonstrations have taken place in areas including New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Washington DC, South Carolina and Houston. Some have included clashes between police and protesters, including the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by officers. US president Donald Trump has pressed state governors to take a more forceful approach against protesters.

"James Mattis was President Donald Trump's first defence secretary - but resigned in 2018 Ex-US Defence Secretary James Mattis has denounced President Donald Trump, saying he deliberately stokes division. He said he was ""angry and appalled"" by Mr Trump's handling of ongoing protests over the death of African American George Floyd at the hands of police. Mr Mattis berated Mr Trump's ""abuse of authority"" - and backed protesters seeking to uphold American values, as did ex-President Barack Obama. Mr Trump has described Mr Mattis repeatedly as an ""overrated general"". Mr Mattis quit in 2018 after Mr Trump decided to pull US troops out of Syria. He has remained mostly silent since then, untilhis rebuke of the Trump administration was published in The Atlantic magazine,externalon Wednesday.

""Instead, he tries to divide us."" He continued: ""We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership."" Mr Mattis also addressed the recent wave of anti-racism protests. This video can not be played White House compares Trump to Churchill in WW2 ""We must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers,"" Mr Mattis wrote. ""The protests are defined by tens of thousands of people of conscience who are insisting that we live up to our values... as a nation."" The retired general -whose resignation letter in December 2018was full of implied criticism of the president's foreign policy - also condemned the use of the military in response to the protests. ""Never did I dream that troops... would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens,"" he said. ""Militarising our response, as we witnessed in Washington DC, sets up a conflict... between the military and civilian society,"" he added. Mattis mocks Donald Trump at gala dinner Defence Secretary Mattis announces resignation Who is General 'Mad Dog' Mattis? Mr Mattis was referring to an incident earlier this week when peaceful protesters were dispersed with tear gas and rubber bullets from a park close to the White House. Mr Trump then crossed the park for a photo-op at a historic church that had been damaged by fire in the unrest. This provoked sharp criticism from top Democrats and religious leaders, who accused the president of aggressively targeting the demonstrators for the purpose of posing for photographs. In his latest comments, Mr Mattis derided the ""bizarre photo-op"" and said clearing the park of demonstrators beforehand was an ""abuse of executive authority"". Mr Trump has repeatedly questioned whether the protesters were peaceful and, in an earlier tweet, he said ""people liked my walk to this historic place of worship"". And in an interview with his former press secretary Sean Spicer on Wednesday, the president once again defended the church visit. He said it was ""handled really well"" and ""religious leaders loved it"". This video can not be played Mr Obama sees limitless potential in the faces of his fellow African Americans Former President Barack Obama said it was vital to channel the momentum built up in the recent protests to bring about change. In his first video comments since Mr Floyd's death, he said the demonstrations were as profound as anything he'd seen in his lifetime, and called on Americans to seize the chance to deal with the underlying problems in society. ""Too often some of that violence has come from folks who were supposed to be serving and protecting you,"" Mr Obama said. ""I want you to know that you matter. I want you to know that your lives matter, your dreams matter."" ""There is a change in mindset that's taking place, a greater recognition that we can do better,"" he added. Mr Obama did not comment directly on Mr Trump's handling of the unrest, although he urged mayors around the country to review their use-of-force policies.

They have been largely peaceful, with cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago relaxing their restrictions amid hopes that the worst of the violence had passed. A post-mortem examination has revealed that Floyd had the coronavirus in early April. But officials stressed that this played no role in his death. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church.

"Debenhams is to reopen its first stores in Northern Ireland on Monday, followed by 50 shops in England the week after. It says three stores with street access in Belfast, Newry and Rushmere will be able to open following updated guidance from the NI Executive. Debenhams collapsed into administration for the second time in a year in April after coronavirus ramped up the pressures facing the business. It has struck deals with landlords to keep 120 stores open. However, 17 stores will remain closed for good when coronavirus lockdown restrictions are lifted.  It is still in discussions over a ""handful"" of others. The future of its five main stores in Wales has been secured after it reached agreement on business rates.Debenhams had threatened to close themif it did not get the same level of support enjoyed by its stores in England. Steven Cook, managing director of Debenhams, said: ""We are delighted to be welcoming customers back to our stores in the coming weeks. ""From the installation of perspex screens at till points to the roll-out of social distancing procedures and PPE, we have been working hard to ensure our colleagues and customers can work and shop with confidence. ""Our reopening plans follow the successful conclusion of lease negotiations on 120 stores, meaning that the vast majority of our stores will be reopening."" 'Why couldn't they keep us furloughed?' Debenhams strikes deals to rescue most stores Meanwhile, the administrators have written to creditors with an update. When Debenhams collapsed into administration, the business owed Â£155m to creditors, including many suppliers. It is still unclear how much will be paid and to whom. Debenhams has also been cutting jobs at its head office and closing the majority of its store cafes in a bid to cut costs and become a leaner business. A total of 4,000 jobs will be lost as a result of these changes, as well as the 17 store closures. The key question now is whether the chain can be rescued from administration as a going concern. It is in what is being described as a ""light touch"" administration, where the current management has remained in place. Its lenders are said to remain supportive. They took control of the chain after it collapsed into administration last year, after struggling for years to keep up with the competition. The business may not exit administration until the new year. Administrators and lenders will no doubt want to see how the business performs post-lockdown, as well as the crucial Christmas trading period, in order to be confident it has a viable future in its current form. Future store closures are still possible. Debenhams will be back in business on the High Street along with its rivals this month, but it still has a long and difficult journey ahead.

Apple has temporarily closed some of its US stores following a series of attacks, amid protests over the death of George Floyd. Several images of the warnings have been shared on social media. Apple said that it did not comment on ""security matters"". It is not clear whether the company has passed on the location of stolen devices to any police forces. It has long been rumoured that the devices on display in Apple stores have software installed so that they can be tracked if any are stolen. Pictures on social media confirm this. One image of a device posted to Twitter showed the message: ""Please return to Apple Walnut Street. This device has been disabled and is being tracked. Local authorities will be alerted."" The store in Philadelphia was among those attacked and looted. Purchased devices do not have such software on them but they can be remotely locked by Apple if they are subsequently stolen or lost. The firm had only recently started reopening stores following the easing of lockdowns around the country but a series of raids in Washington DC, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Philadelphia has forced them to shut again. Chief executive Tim Cook has told employees in a memo that the killing of Mr Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer, was ""senseless"" and has pledged to donate to human rights groups.

"James Mattis was President Donald Trump's first defence secretary - but resigned in 2018 Ex-US Defence Secretary James Mattis has denounced President Donald Trump, saying he deliberately stokes division. He said he was ""angry and appalled"" by Mr Trump's handling of ongoing protests over the death of African American George Floyd at the hands of police. Mr Mattis berated Mr Trump's ""abuse of authority"" - and backed protesters seeking to uphold American values, as did ex-President Barack Obama. Mr Trump has described Mr Mattis repeatedly as an ""overrated general"". Mr Mattis quit in 2018 after Mr Trump decided to pull US troops out of Syria. He has remained mostly silent since then, untilhis rebuke of the Trump administration was published in The Atlantic magazine,externalon Wednesday.

The row comes asnew charges were brought against all of the sacked police officers present at Mr Floyd's deathin the city of Minneapolis. The charge against Derek Chauvin has been elevated to second-degree murder while the other three officers, previously uncharged, face counts of aiding and abetting murder. The death has sparked huge protests across the US in recent days. NFL star pledges $1m for anti-racism fight The vast majority of demonstrations over the past nine days have been peaceful, but some have turned violent and curfews have been imposed in a number of cities. ""Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try,"" Mr Mattis wrote in The Atlantic. ""Instead, he tries to divide us."" He continued: ""We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership."" Mr Mattis also addressed the recent wave of anti-racism protests.

This provoked sharp criticism from top Democrats and religious leaders, who accused the president of aggressively targeting the demonstrators for the purpose of posing for photographs. In his latest comments, Mr Mattis derided the ""bizarre photo-op"" and said clearing the park of demonstrators beforehand was an ""abuse of executive authority"".

She also recalled living through race riots in 1992 and spoke of her regret that nothing appeared to have changed. In her video message, Meghan called on young people and students at the school to come together to rebuild society. A wave of anti-racism protests have been triggered by the death of African-American Mr Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May. Four officers have been charged in relation to his death. New charges brought over George Floyd's death Why has a US city gone up in flames? Thousands join UK protests over George Floyd death Anger has since spread to other parts of the world, including the UK, wherethousands of people joined a protest in Londonon Wednesday organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter. The sister of black teenager Anthony Walker, who was murdered by two men in a racially-motivated attack in Merseyside in 2005, called for an ""ongoing revolution"" following the demonstrations - to break down institutional racism in society. Dominique Walker, vice chair of the Anthony Walker Foundation set up after her brother's murder,told BBC Breakfast that police reform in the UK ""has to be taken further"". ""There has to be that definitive work that works to break down institutional racism,"" she said. In the UK, protesters marched to Westminster in central London, where they blocked the roads outside Parliament In the video of her virtual address to Immaculate Heart High School, the duchess said she was ""nervous"" about addressing graduates and speaking about events of the previous weeks. But she said that she ""realised the only wrong thing to say is nothing because George Floyd's life mattered"", before referring to other African-Americans who died in police shootings in the US in recent years. In the video, whichwas first reported,externalby the African-American female magazine Essence, Meghan also gave a heartfelt apology to the graduating students ""that we have not gotten the world to the place that you deserve it to be"". She told the all-girls school: ""I wasn't sure what I could say to you. I wanted to say the right thing and I was really nervous that I wouldn't or it would get picked apart, and I realised the only wrong thing to say is to say nothing - because George Floyd's life mattered and Breonna Taylor's life mattered and Philando Castile's life mattered and Tamir Rice's life mattered. ""And so did so many other people whose names we know and whose names we do not know."" She then shared her memories of living in the city through race riots in 1992, after police officers were filmed violently beating Rodney King. The duchess said: ""I was 11 or 12 years old and it was the LA riots, which was also triggered by a senseless act of racism. ""I remember the curfew and I remember rushing back home, and on that drive home, seeing ash fall from the sky, and smelling the smoke and seeing the smoke billow out of buildings. ""I remember seeing men in the back of a van just holding guns and rifles. ""I remember pulling up the house and seeing the tree, that had always been there, completely charred. And those memories don't go away."" CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African-Americans treated? GEORGE FLOYD:An athlete, friend and father NEWS REPORTERS:A new target for police? DECEPTIVE FOOTAGE:Conspiracy theories spread online HOW IT HAPPENED:The last moments of his life Meghan said she could not imagine that the students ""would have to have a different version of that same type of experience"". ""That's something you should have an understanding of, but an understanding... as a history lesson not as your reality,"" she said. ""So I'm sorry that in a way we have not gotten the world to the place that you deserve it to be."" She went on to highlight that people are ""standing in solidarity"" despite the unrest, and appealed to young people to ""be part of this movement"". The duchess said: ""I know that this is not the graduation that you envisioned [...] but I also know that there is a way to reframe this for you, and to not see this as the end of something. ""But instead to see this as the beginning of you harnessing all of the work, all of the values, all of the skills that you have embodied over the last four years. ""Now all of that work gets activated, now you get to be part of rebuilding."" She added: ""We are going to rebuild and rebuild and rebuild until it is rebuilt, because when the foundation is broken, so are we."" In the US, protests began in Minneapolis where Mr Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. Demonstrations have taken place in areas including New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Washington DC, South Carolina and Houston. Some have included clashes between police and protesters, including the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by officers. US president Donald Trump has pressed state governors to take a more forceful approach against protesters. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are now living in Los Angeles with their one-year-old son Archie, after stepping back as working members of the Royal Family.

"Family law practitioners said video and phone calls were not suitable for some sensitive cases Court hearings held remotely in lockdown disadvantage vulnerable people and should not be used longer term, lawyers and charities have said. Since the pandemic broke earlier this year, the number of virtual hearings held in England and Wales has increased five-fold. But family law practitioners said video and phone calls were not suitable for some sensitive cases. HM Courts and Tribunals Service said it would consider court users' feedback. Incidents to have raised concern to lawyers include: Defendants using mobiles to access hearings An order to take a newborn baby into care made over the telephone A judge accidentally dialling a stranger into a call A victim being left on the same line alone with the perpetrator During the Covid-19 pandemic,so-called ""priority courts"" have remained open,externalfor urgent cases that could not be conducted over video link or phone, but other hearings, such as cases over guardianship of children, have been carried out remotely. From 23 March - when lockdown began - to 6 April, audio hearings across all courts and tribunals in England and Wales increased by more than 500%, and video hearings by 340%,the Nuffield Family Justice Observatory,externalsaid. Since 2010,the Ministry of Justice has closed,external164 magistrates' courts, 90 county courts, 17 family courts and eight crown courts. The money saved from closures was to be reinvested in digital services to reduce reliance on physical hearings as part ofa Â£1bn plan to modernise the justice system,external. For criminal cases,supporters said,externalvideo technology saved thousands of hours of police officers' time travelling to and from court and encouraged more vulnerable witnesses to come forward. Before the pandemic hit, family law group Resolution said its members reported ""substantial"" problems of vulnerable people accessing courts and having to travel increasingly-long distances to them. The Nuffield Family Justice Observatory,externalasked family law practitioners how remote hearings were operating during the crisis. Concerns were raised over urgent orders to remove newborn babies from their mother in hospital, which had to be made over the telephone because of lockdown restrictions. A judge said ""to have a two-day-old baby removed in such circumstances did not feel morally or ethically right"", while a barrister said it felt ""horribly cruel"". One family solicitor, who did not want to be named, told the BBC she had been in a separate hearing where a party was disconnected and the judge accidentally dialled a stranger into the call. ""Luckily nothing highly confidential was being discussed and it was only a minute or two but it's an example of where things go wrong,"" she said. Domestic abuse cases are among those heard in remote family court hearings The Nuffield consultation noted time was saved on procedural hearings and some domestic abuse victims found remote hearings ""less intimidating"". Other responses urged clear guidance to avoid distressing scenarios, such as an alleged victim being left alone on the same line as the alleged perpetrator. An independent review into how the civil justice system has been coping during the pandemic wasdue to be published later this week,externalby the Civil Justice Council. A lack of access to the internet, suitable technology or private space were also highlighted by charitable groups and advocates. Family lawyer Edward Cookefought for a ""pop-up court"" for family and civil cases in Chichester,externalwhen its county court closed in 2018. ""A justice system reconfigured during a global pandemic response is not the model for an effective system in a post-pandemic world,"" Mr Cooke, who also sits on the committee of Resolution, said. ""In family cases, which involve dispute resolution of complex, often emotionally-charged issues, court provision delivered by video or phone is never going to be an adequate substitute for face-to-face contact."" Family lawyer Edward Cooke warned virtual hearings were ""absolutely not a panacea"" Family lawyer Valerie Cox said the judiciary was ""trying extremely hard"" in unexpected circumstances but the experience for families was ""very poor"". She said remote hearings meant for some people ""if you don't have enough data on your phone to attend a hearing, you're paying to access justice"". She added: ""Disadvantaged people often find it very hard to engage, you might phone a parent who doesn't answer your call and answer your statement but the one thing they will do is go to court. ""There you can talk to them and explain what's happening. That's incredibly important."" Community Advice, run by the Centre for Justice Innovation, is an independent service that directs defendants in Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court to help with benefits, addictions and mental health problems and other issues, but its offices have been closed during lockdown. Head of innovative practice, Claire Ely, said: ""The people that we support initially find out about our service because they see our office when they come into court, or because one of our members of staff approaches them when they are in the waiting area or custody. ""With the shift to virtual hearings, there simply isn't the same opportunity."" Mary Marvel, from legal information website Advicenow said remote hearings could be a ""huge barrier"" for more vulnerable people, particularly those with limited internet access. ""Many of these people will also havelittle or no access to legal advice,"" she said. HM Courts and Tribunals Service said it would ""continue to work closely with the judiciary to use technology and keep the justice system running during the pandemic"". ""Judges will consider the best way for a hearing to take place, taking into account the needs of those participating,"" it said.

Huw OxburghLocal Democracy Reporter East Sussex councillors have called for extra funding from government after warnings the county council faces a Â£23m funding shortfall as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The calls came at a virtual meeting of the councilâs cabinet, where councillors shared an update on its activities since the beginning of the outbreak. During the meeting, councillors heard from the councilâs chief finance officer Ian Gutsell that the council had been hit with additional budget pressures of around Â£49m, as a result of additional spending, missed savings and reduced income. Based on current modelling, Mr Gutsell said the council faced a Â£23m funding shortfall and would begin to eat into its reserves by the beginning of August â even with the Â£26.1m of emergency Covid-19 funding received from central government so far. Plans are under way to clear the backlog of court cases that have built up during the coronavirus pandemic. Solicitor General Michael Ellis said he was ""concerned"" but added ""everything has been disrupted by this awful"" virus. In the House of Commons, Tory MP Tom Randall asked: ""Can Mr Ellis tell me what discussions he's had with the Lord Chancellor in order to deal with the backlog of cases?"" Mr Ellis replied: ""Work is ongoing with the CPS, across government partners and stakeholders to contribute to planning on recovery, clearing that backlog.""

Current rules state that households can drive any distance in England to destinations such as parks and beaches. The University of Reading has revealed it has a Â£106m funding gap due to the impact of coronavirus. Vice-chancellor Prof Robert Van de Noort said the university - Reading's second biggest employer - needed to save the amount over the next three years. He said its income will be affected by a halving in the number of new international students, UK students deferring and a loss in income from conferences, all due to the virus. Prof Van de Noort said: ""The majority [of the lost money] is from the international students who are less likely to come to the University of Reading, and all universities in the UK have seen the same impact."" He added there could be redundancies, but it is understood the university is exploring pay freezes and short working weeks to try to avoid 500 job losses. Staff and unions are being consulted. Prof Van de Nort added ""difficult decisions"" might also have to be made about research. Lockdown restrictions have started to be eased across the UK, but there are still limits on what we are able to do. BBC News answers some of your questions on what it all means.

"More than half the UK population has struggled with sleep during the lockdown, a survey suggests. King's College London researchers said sleep problems were more common in people facing financial hardship, while two in five reported having more vivid dreams than usual. Some people slept for longer than usual, but without feeling rested. The findings are based on online interviews in late May with 2,254 UK residents in the 16-75 age bracket. The study was carried out by market research company Ipsos MORI and King's College London. The researchers said lack of sleep may itself have had knock-on effects on people's capacity to be resilient during the pandemic, and there are signs of a disproportionate impact on particular groups: women, younger people and those facing financial difficulties. ""As with so much about Covid-19, the crisis is affecting people very differently depending on their circumstances, and that includes the most fundamental aspects of life, such as sleep,"" said Prof Bobby Duffy of King's College London. He said nearly two-thirds of the public reported some negative impact on their sleep, showing just how unsettling the pandemic and lockdown measures have been. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic Disturbed sleep is often caused by stress, and can itself increase stress levels, creating a cycle that is difficult to break, added Dr Ivana Rosenzweig, of Kings College. However, a quarter of participants reported they were sleeping more and feeling better for it, she said, highlighting that, ""as a society, we simply do not get the chance to sleep as much as we need, and that this pandemic is allowing some of us to rediscover the importance of sleep"". Previous research has shown that for many people lockdown has led to disturbed sleep, insomnia and vivid dreams. Experts have suggested keeping to a routine, not taking naps and trying to get some exercise outside.

Read more ways here Madagascar's education minister Rijasoa Andriamanana has been fired after announcing a plan to buy sweets for students to take the edge off the ""bitter taste"" of a herbal tea the president claims is a remedy for coronavirus. Launched as Covid-Organics, the tea is produced from the artemisia plant - the source of an ingredient used in a malaria treatment - and other Malagasy plants. The potential benefits of the tea has not been validated by any specific study. Andriamanana announced last week that she was ordering $2.2 million (Â£1.7 million) worth of sweets to go alongside the ""cure"". Following outrage, the order was cancelled and the government has now announced she has been sacked. Governments around the world have pledged $8.8bn (Â£6.98m) in
a virtual summit hosted by the UK to raise funds for global vaccine alliance, Gavi,
which distributes life-saving immunisations in developing countries. Pledges by more than 50 countries and individuals like
billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, saw the total surpass an initial target
of $7.4bn. The funding will be used to vaccinate 300 million children worldwide
against deadly diseases such as polio, measles and cholera. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who hosted the event has pledged
Â£1.65bn ($2.08bn) to Gavi over the next five years, making the UK the organisationâs
biggest donor. The summit was also the backdrop for the launch of a $2bn (Â£1.6m)
fund to ensure Gavi has future access to Covid-19 vaccines for poorer countries. Face coverings are to become compulsory for people using
public transport in England from Monday 15 June as the government eases restrictions further. They are already recommended in some enclosed spaces - like
public transport and shops - when social distancing (staying more than 2m
apart) isn't possible. But just exactly what do the new rules say and how will they be enforced? You can find out morehere. A funeral has been held in the Spanish city of Seville,
to honour those who have died in the pandemic. Around 600 people attended Seville's cathedral, with many of the seats reserved
for families of the victims and authorities in what is one of the largest
gatherings in Spain since the lockdown began in March. The cathedral, which is a World Heritage site, accommodated the mourners under strict safety conditions, as a  53-person choir, led by four soloists and accompanied by 27
musicians performed Mozartâs Requiem. Spain has had over 240,000 confirmed cases and in excess of
27,000 deaths according to its official figures, thoughmultiple reports,externalhave
questioned the way in which those figures have been reached. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has told those in New York who have attended protests to assume they have been exposed to the virus. He said that the state was opening testing facilities for everyone who has attended a protest. People across the US have been protesting following the death of African-American George Floyd. Cuomo estimates about 30,000 people took to the streets in New York state. Every region across New York state has been allowed to start reopening aside from New York City. Cuomo is set to allow New York City to open on Monday for limited economic activity. A second phase of opening could start as early as July and will include outdoor restaurant seating. NBA owners have approved a plan to restart the basketball season season at Florida's
Disney World Resort on 31 July. Under the plan, Disney's ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex,
which has multiple hotels and arenas, will provide a single site for games,
training and accommodation. The NBA was the first US competition to suspend its season
due to the pandemic in March. The end of season playoffs are now due to take place in
August, with the NBA Finals set to be completed by 12 October. The league has also pencilled in a provisional start date of
1 December for the 2020-21 season. It normally begins in mid-October. Read more on the story Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent Members of the aviation industry have held a conference call with the government following an announcement that people landing in the UK will have to undergo a two-week quarantine period. Aviation bosses are fuming about the quarantine. And the phone call seems to have made things worse. One person present on the conference call described it as âa shamblesâ. The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps wasnât there because he was leading the Downing Street briefing and making a big announcement about face coverings become compulsory on public transport.But airline bosses were apparently unimpressed. They felt they got no reassurances from the Home Secretary Priti Patel that the quarantine would be reduced in any significant way soon by agreeing so-called âair bridgesâ, safe corridors between the UK and countries with low infection rates meaning people wonât have to self-isolate after they travel. That is an interesting contradiction in tone from other government sources who insist ministers are working hard to establish a number of air bridges, especially with European countries, as soon as possible. The fact that British Airwaysâ sister company, IAG didnât even attend the call is the ultimate sign that relations between the government and UK aviation are rock bottom. We reported earlier on people in Peru queuing to buy oxygen tanks for their relatives who are suffering from coronavirus. Here are some pictures of the extraordinary scenes in Lima. ""Prices are very high, but there's an urgent need and lots of companies are taking advantage,"" resident Erick Vila told the EFE news agency. Hospitals are stretched across the country and oxygen shortages have caused deaths. Many people suspected of having the virus now prefer to stay at home. Peru is now the second most badly affected country in Latin America, behind Brazil. Some 179,000 cases have been recorded and authorities are struggling to contain the spread of the disease. The prosecutor-general in Egypt has called for urgent legal action after a man reportedly arranged female genital mutilation (FGM) for his three young daughters, telling them it was a treatment for Covid-19. Both the father and the doctor who performed the procedures have been referred to a criminal court. The incident was reported to the authorities by their mother who is divorced from the children's father. He is said to have told the girls they were being ""vaccinated"" for coronavirus. They were then reportedly drugged and FGM was carried out on them. FGM has been illegal in Egypt since 2008, however it remains prevalent. Three of the authors behind a study in medical journal The Lancet that raised safety concerns over the use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 have retracted their paper. Hydroxychloroquine is being studied by a number of scientists to see if it is a viable treatment for Covid-19. US President Donald Trump took a two-week course of the drug as a preventative measure. The Lancet said the company that provided the data used in the study would not transfer the full statistics for an independent review. They concluded they ""can no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources"", a statement from the medical journal said. The study claimed there were no benefits to treating coronavirus patients with the drug and said taking it might even increase the number of deaths among those in hospital with the disease. Following the publication of the study, the World Health Organization (WHO) halted its trial, but it announced on Wednesday that this work would resume. Allow Twitter content?

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A forthcoming US ban on flights from China has left some Chinese students worried they wonât be able to get home. Yesterday, the US announced that it would suspend all Chinese passenger planes from 16 June. This has led to an outpouring of anxiety on social media, with many asking, ""What will international students do?"" The independent South China Morning Post said that last yearsome 370,000 students from China were enrolled in institutes across the US.,external. Seemingly in response to reaction to the US ban, the Civil Aviation Administration of China has signalled that it will loosen its own restrictions on arrivals, saying airports in 37 cities across China should now become available to international flights. This has led to praise online, with users of the popular Sina Weibo platform saying that China is âputting peopleâs interests firstâ and that they hope those in the US can âhurry homeâ. But there are also concerns. China has gone to great lengths to ensure that it doesnât see a second wave of Covid-19, implementing mass testing and strict quarantine procedures. Many are worried that an influx of people returning from overseas could lead to a fresh spike in cases.

People who took part in protests over the killing of George Floyd should ""highly consider"" getting tested for coronavirus, a top US health official said on Thursday. ""Those individuals that have partaken in these peaceful
protests or have been out protesting, and particularly if
they're in metropolitan areas that really haven't controlled the
outbreak...  we really want those individuals to highly consider
being evaluated and get tested,"" Robert Redfield, director for
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a House of Representatives committee. Protests over the death of George Floyd - who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes - continued in dozens of cities on Wednesday night despite widespread curfews.

"Passengers may have to book trains and buses in future because of Covid-19 Passengers might have to pre-book bus and train tickets in future to help prevent the spread of coronavirus, Wales' economy minister has warned. Ken Skates said space on services would be ""vastly reduced"" for passenger safety. It comes as travellers are being warned by a Welsh train operator to only use services if ""absolutely essential"". Transport for Wales said rail journeys had fallen 95% over the lastÂ 10Â weeks. Leyton Powell, Transport for Wales' safety and assurance director, said: ""Only travel by rail if it's absolutely essential and you have no other means of transport available."" He added: ""Our capacity is down because of social distancing, less than 10% availability. We cannot guarantee people's safety unless we manage the controls at all times, we are trying to run a safe service for our key workers."" What's the risk on public transport? Train stations put crowd-control measures in place Is social distancing on trains here to stay? Mr Skates said the Welsh Government did not want trains and buses full of commuters in Wales,as happened in Londonwhen lockdown rules were relaxed. The Welsh Government said it would also consider prioritising places on public transport for key workers and disabled people. Mr Skates said passenger safety on public transport was a ""huge consideration"".Â The Welsh Government has been discussing with transport operators and unions how they will manage demand with social distancing in place. Scenes like these could become a thing of the past as people are urged only to use public transport if absolutely necessary Mr Skates said: ""Trains and buses will carry far fewer people. ""We will have to consider measures such as pre-booking only, such as careful travel planning, such as prioritisation of who travels on buses and trains - for example key workers and disabled people."" Meanwhile, Transport for Wales is urging people to ""travel safe"" and keep public transport clear for key workers. It said people should follow five new principles if they are going to travel. These include staying local, avoiding busy periods, following travel advice and respecting other passengers. In Newport, a pilot project is trialling booking bus journeys by phone and app. The ""Fflecsi"" scheme is being run by Newport Bus with Transport for Wales. Ken Skates said passenger safety on public transport was a ""huge consideration"" Numerous scheduled services have been replaced with flexible ones. Passengers can request to be picked up and dropped off near work, shops or home, rather than following a set timetable at fixed stops. Once a passenger has booked, Newport Bus will guarantee them a seat and space to social distance. The scheme runs Monday to Saturday and includes key destinations such as hospitals and supermarkets. If the pilot is successful Transport for Wales will look to roll the scheme elsewhere.

""The reality is that 76% of Covid-19 deaths in the UK have been aged over 75 with most of those entirely avoidable - and that's a tragedy,"" says Linda Bauld, Professor of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh. ""But the risk for young people is minimal and I think we need to recognise that. ""Social distancing is something we all need to try and maintain because we don't want more preventable cases rising in the future. ""But we have to balance the need to restart society - to not seriously disadvantage the young in the longer term. I'd like to see a gradual, phased approach, but try to get education and the economy up and running as quickly and as competently as we can."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Outdoor nurseries and childminders have today been able to get back to work. But one nursery owner has warned safety restrictions in place will make businesses not viable without financial support to cover the shortfall. Zoey Sills, who runs the Earthtime Forest Nursery in Elgin, said normal worker ratios require two staff for up to 16 children. With group sizes limited to eight, this essentially doubles staff costs, she said. She urged government to trust nurseries to make safety decisions, because the outdoor setting and the fact nurseries already care for small groups means they are well equipped on safety. Scottish Childminding Association lead Graeme McAlister said there has been an increase in demand for services in recent weeks. He said childminders were now focused on five key safety points: enhanced hygiene, keeping groups small, minimising contact between different groups, utilising outdoor space and physical distancing between adults when they come to collect children. Scotland's transport secretary says there was a significant rise in traffic last weekend. Data shows car traffic levels rose by 70% over the weekend, and by 110% on some tourist routes. Traffic at cross-border sites was also up by 35% These volumes go beyond what would be expected to be generated by local residents. Nor do these figures indicate that everyone is sticking to the guidance to stay within five miles of home or by people travelling a reasonable distance to meet loved ones. Michael Matheson, Transport secretary Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The Institute of Travel and Tourism has hit out at the UK government's plan to have people quarantine for two weeks after entering the UK. Chairman Steven Freudman labelled the decision a ""total shambles"". He also questioned the timing of the decision, highlighting this had been the policy in March before it was dropped. A targeted approach would be better, he argued, for example by testing everyone on arrival and not requiring those who are negative to isolate or by developing air bridges with low-risk countries.

"Floyd's death has sparked huge protests against racism and the police killings of black Americans New charges have been announced against all of the sacked police officers present at the death of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis. The charge against Derek Chauvin has been elevated to second-degree murder, court documents show. The other three officers, previously uncharged, face counts of aiding and abetting murder. Floyd's death has sparked huge protests across the US against racism and the police killings of black Americans. The vast majority of demonstrations over the past eight days have been peaceful, but some have turned violent and curfews have been imposed in a number of cities. This video can not be played Activist explains plea for peaceful protests Announcing the new charges, Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison said that they were in the interests of justice. Derek Chauvin had initially faced charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. These will stay on his charge sheet. The other three sacked officers are Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao. They all face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder, and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar said on Twitter that the latest charges were ""another important step for justice"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Floyd family lawyer Benjamin Crump said in a statement: ""This is a significant step forward on the road to justice and we are gratified that this important action was brought before George Floyd's body was laid to rest."" But he later told CNN that the family believed the charge against Derek Chauvin should be first-degree murder and that they had been told that the investigation was ongoing and the charges could change further. At a press briefing, rights activist Rev Al Sharpton said that the Floyd case must lead to a national federal act. He said: ""If we come out of all this and do not have federal legislation where we can protect citizens from local policing... then all of this is drama to no end. Drama in the street must be geared to fundamental legal change."" This video can not be played George Floyd's ex partner: 'Gianna doesn't have a father' Mr Ellison said he was under no illusion that bringing a successful prosecution against the former police officers would be difficult. ""Winning a conviction will be hard. History does show there are clear challenges,"" he said. Only one officer in Minnesota has been convicted of killing a civilian while serving in the role. Attorney General Keith Ellison spells out the charges Mr Ellison said George Floyd was ""loved by his family, his life had value"" and that ""we will seek justice for you and we will find it"". He said bringing justice to society more generally would be slow and difficult work and that Americans did not have to wait for the end of the Floyd case to start that work. ""We need to rewrite the rules for a just society now,"" he said. First- and second-degree murder under Minnesota law require proof that the defendant intended to kill. First-degree in most cases requires premeditation, with second-degree more related to crimes of passion. Why did a US city go up in flames? A third-degree murder conviction would not require proof that the defendant wanted the victim to die, only that their actions were dangerous and were carried out without regard to human life. A second-degree murder conviction can carry a sentence of up to 40 years, 15 longer than for third-degree. CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African-Americans treated? GEORGE FLOYD:An athlete, friend and father NEWS REPORTERS:A new target for police? DECEPTIVE FOOTAGE:Conspiracy theories spread online HOW IT HAPPENED:The last moments of his life George Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis. A video showed Floyd being arrested and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally, with rallies on Wednesday in Australia, France, the Netherlands andin the UK, where thousands gathered in central London. This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting The Floyd case follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. For many, the outrage over Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church.

"Madeleine McCann was three years old when she went missing in 2007 Madeleine McCann is ""assumed"" to be dead, say German prosecutors, who are investigating the disappearance of the British girl in 2007. A 43-year-old German man is being investigated on suspicion of murder, the public prosecutor added. The suspect, who has been named in German media as Christian B, is currently serving a prison sentence. He is believed to have been in the area where Madeleine, aged three, was last seen while on holiday in Portugal. The UK's Metropolitan Police said it had received more than 270 calls and emails since a new appeal for information was launched on Wednesday. Hans Christian Wolters, from the Braunschweig Public Prosecutor's Office in Germany, said in an update on Thursday: ""We are assuming that the girl is dead. ""With the suspect, we are talking about a sexual predator who has already been convicted of crimes against little girls and he's already serving a long sentence."" He said the suspect was regularly living in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007 and had jobs in the area, including in catering, but also committed burglaries in hotels and dealt drugs. The Madeleine McCann case: A timeline Madeleine McCann: False turns and a final breakthrough? In pictures: The search for Madeleine McCann More funds pledged for Madeleine McCann search The McCann family's spokesman said Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry, felt the new development was ""potentially very significant"". Clarence Mitchell, who has represented the family since Madeleine went missing, said that in 13 years he couldn't ""recall an instance when the police had been so specific about an individual. ""Of all the thousands of leads and potential suspects that have been mentioned in the past, there has never been something as clear cut as that from not just one, but three police forces"", he said. The Met Police, who are working with their German and Portuguese counterparts, said the case remained a ""missing persons"" investigation in the UK because it does not have ""definitive evidence"" as to whether Madeleine is alive or not. The man is linked to a house between Praia da Luz and Lagos, and another inland Police released pictures showing the interior of one house believed to be linked to the suspect The suspect has been described as white with short blond hair, and about 6ft (1.8m) tall with a slim build at the time. Police have also released photos of two vehicles - a VW camper van and a Jaguar car - which are believed to be linked to the man, as well as a house in Portugal. The day after Madeleine vanished in 2007, the suspect transferred the Jaguar to someone else's name. New suspect identified in Madeleine McCann case Madeleine went missing shortly before her fourth birthday from an apartment in Praia da Luz on the evening of 3 May 2007 while her parents were with friends at a nearby tapas bar. Her disappearance sparked a huge and costly police hunt across much of Europe - the most recent Metropolitan Police investigation, which began in 2011, has cost more than Â£11m. Det Ch Insp Mark Cranwell, who is in charge of the Met investigation - known as Operation Grange - said the suspect, then aged 30, frequented the Algarve between 1995 and 2007, staying for ""days upon end"" in his camper van and living a ""transient lifestyle"". He was in the Praia da Luz area where the McCann family was staying when she disappeared and received a phone call at 19:32, which ended at 20:02. Madeleine is believed to have disappeared between 21:10 and 22:00 that evening. Police have released details of the suspect's phone number (+351 912 730 680) and the number which dialled him (+351 916 510 683), and said any information about these numbers could be ""critical"". Det Ch Insp Cranwell said the caller was a ""key witness"" and should get in touch, while he also appealed to the public for details about the suspect. The Ocean Club in Praia da Luz where the McCann family were staying A camper van belonging to the suspect was seen around Praia da Luz in Portugal The suspect transferred the registration of this 1993 Jaguar XJR6 to someone else the day after Madeleine disappeared The joint appeal from the British, German and Portuguese police includes a Â£20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the person responsible for Madeleine's disappearance. Those with information can contact the Operation Grange incident room on 020 7321 9251. Det Ch Insp Cranwell said he wanted to thank members of the public who had already got in touch. ""We are pleased with the information coming in, and it will be assessed and prioritised,"" he said. ""We continue to urge anyone with information to come forward and speak with us."" Jim Gamble, who served as the senior child protection officer in the UK's first police investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, said it was the first time in 13 years ""when I actually dare to hope"". The ""circumstantial evidence"" that had been shared by the police made the new suspect a ""really significant person of interest"", he said. He said he believed the man ""came to light a number of years ago"" but was only being made public now because it was a ""painstaking"" process which began from ""a point of chaos"" after the initial investigation had been ""bungled"". Is this the breakthrough? Is this German prisoner the man who can unlock the mystery? It certainly has the feel of a significant development - police have used those very words. Evidence, according to detectives, places the man near the scene; the re-registering of his car the next day is undoubtedly suspicious. And his criminal record, disclosed by the German police, is a disturbing guide as to what his motivations might have been. But... there have been so many false trails in the case before - clues, sightings and suspects that led nowhere. Three years ago, during the last major police appeal, Scotland Yard said it was working on one final ""critical"" line of inquiry. Now, we're told there's another one. That may explain why Met detectives - who've been involved in the case for nine years - are being rather more cautious than their German counterparts. In a statement, the McCanns, from Rothley in Leicestershire, welcomed the appeal: ""We would like to thank the police forces involved for their continued efforts in the search for Madeleine. ""All we have ever wanted is to find her, uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice. ""We will never give up hope of finding Madeleine alive, but whatever the outcome may be, we need to know as we need to find peace."" A Downing Street spokesman said the latest developments appeared to be significant and No 10's thoughts were with the McCann family ""who have had to endure so much"". Police said the suspect was one of 600 people that detectives on the UK inquiry originally looked at, though he had not been a suspect. After a 10-year anniversary appeal in 2017, ""significant"" fresh information about him was provided. 3 May 2007:Alarm is raised after Madeleine is found to be missing September 2007: Kate and Gerry McCann are made ""arguidos"" - formal suspects - in their daughter's disappearance July 2008: Portuguese police halt their investigation and lift the ""arguido"" status of the McCanns and another man, Robert Murat May 2011:Prime Minister David Cameron asks the Metropolitan Policeto help investigate.

"This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston Protests against the death of George Floyd, the black man who died while being restrained by a Minnesota police officer, have taken place in the UK, organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter. This is despite Home Secretary Priti Patel and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick asking people not to go on to the streets. So are such demonstrations actually legal given the coronavirus lockdown? England now has the loosest lockdown in the UK, with no restrictions on going outside. But the rules (officially known as regulations) don't explicitly say anything about protests. However, regulation seven restricts public gatherings to no more than six people. The law defines a ""gathering"" as a meeting involving ""social interaction with each other, or to undertake any other activity"". And so that means, pretty clearly, that a protest is currently illegal along with any other activity that could increase the virus's spread. ""There's a reason that we have laws in place temporarily to say that gatherings of over six people should not happen,"" says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Police have been trying to encourage people to follow the law and the public health message, and they can break up gatherings. Before Mr Floyd's death, this tended to mean officers directing large parties to stop and ordering people to go home - such as with thisrave in the West Midlandslast month. Officers can hand out fixed-penalty notices - a form of on-the-spot ticket - that start at Â£100 to anyone who won't follow the health regulations. They can also arrest and charge someone with an offence, potentially leading to a large fine in a magistrates' court. So taking all that together, officers have the power to break up and ticket people for being part of a protest, on coronavirus health grounds. Hundreds of people joined a protest in Cardiff Yes, but this is where it gets rather tricky because that right is often misunderstood. And the coronavirus health emergency has complicated things further. Barrister Audrey Cherryl Mogan explains the European Convention on Human Rights (in British law as the Human Rights Act) says that public bodies must respect both the right to assemble and to express one's views. But these two rights are not absolute. The government or another public body can interfere with them if it has a proper legal reason to do so. ""So it becomes a balancing exercise,"" she says. ""If what's being done is to enforce the health regulations, then you can argue that [stopping a protest] would be reasonable and proportionate."" Ms Mogan argues the police should approach these protests in the same way that officers would consider a park full of sunbathing friends. ""If we are talking about stopping a protest, there has to be a fair and just application of the law to these people."" If not, she warns, closing down a Black Lives Matter protest on coronavirus grounds could be seen as unfair and a disproportionate use of the regulations. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Chief constables today talk about their public duty to ""facilitate"" demonstrations - and say that they only turn to force - such as bringing in riot police - if they have to quell trouble. And over the first weekend in June, it was pretty clear that the police didn't want to break up peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations even though, on paper at least, they would breach coronavirus laws. Dame Cressida and other police chiefs had asked people not to come out and protest on the streets. She said that: ""Coming together in a gathering is not only unlawful but also, perhaps more importantly, it is putting yourself and your family at unnecessary risk and other people around you."" She said officers, if faced with large gatherings, would seek to uphold the law but would make ""a case-by-case decision"" as to what was the right thing to do. Some of the organisers of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations argued over the weekend that they were completely justified in asking people to protest. They said it was because racism - and the violence that comes with it - is like a virus that can only be combatted and defeated by taking a stand. This video can not be played Raheem Sterling: ""The only disease right now is the racism that we're fighting"" England and Manchester City striker Raheem Sterling summed up that sentiment in a BBC interview, saying:""The only disease right now is the racism that we are fighting."" So, in short, many protesters believe that it is their duty to come out and have their say - and that their decision should be recognised as a lawful and reasonable excuse to be out on the streets.

""Silence can be as deadly as violence,"" former Democratic President Jimmy Carter has warned in a statement on the George Floyd protests. The comments from Carter, the oldest living US president, follow those made by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama. Carter continued: ""People of power, privilege, and moral conscience must stand up and say 'no more' to a racially discriminatory police and justice system, immoral economic disparities between whites and blacks, and government actions that undermine our unified democracy."" ""Dehumanising people debases us all; humanity is beautifully and almost infinitely diverse,"" he adds. ""The bonds of our common humanity must overcome the divisiveness of our fears and prejudices."" ""We are responsible for creating a world of peace and equality for ourselves and future generations,"" he continued. ""We need a government as good as its people, and we are better than this."" For another day, protesters are out on the streets near the White House. In 90F (32C) heat, they lay down in the streets and chanted: ""I can't breathe."" The Washington DC mayor has pushed back the curfew time tonight to 23:00 local time, from 19:00 the past two nights. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The White House press secretary has likened President Donald Trump's ""resilience and determination"" during the #GeorgeFloyd protests to Winston Churchill inspecting bomb damage during World War Two. This video can not be played White House likens Trump to Churchill in WW2 Three alleged far-right activists in Las Vegas have been charged with trying to exploit peaceful protests and incite violence, according to prosecutors. According to the local prosecutor's office, the three men are alleged members of the âBoogalooâ movement, which prosecutors describe as ""a term used by extremists to signify a coming civil war and/or collapse of society"". âViolent instigators have hijacked peaceful protests and demonstrations across the country, including Nevada, exploiting the real and legitimate outrage over Mr Floydâs death for their own radical agendas,â US Attorney Nicholas Trutanich saidin a statement,external. âLaw enforcement is focused on keeping violence and destruction from interfering with free public expression and threatening lives.â The three men were apprehended late last month after attempting to use a molotov cocktail, officials say.

A former winner of Miss Universe Malaysia is facing calls for her title to be stripped after comments she made about protests in the US. Samantha Katie James, who won the pageant in 2017, wrote a series of Instagram posts on Monday criticising the demonstrations and telling black people to ""relax"". ""You chose to be born as a 'coloured' person in America for a reason. To learn a certain lesson,"" she wrote. ""Accept it as it is."" The Brazilian-Chinese model added that ""it seems like the 'whites' won. Because if you're angry, you respond in rage and anguish. That means it has power over you. THEY HAVE POWER OVER YOU."" Her comments have drawn ire on social media, and more 120,000 people have signedan online petition calling for her title to be removed,external. The Miss Universe Malaysia Organisation has distanced itself from the remarks, calling them ""inappropriate, offensive, unacceptable and hurtful."" The beauty queen has since issued an apology on her Instagram, and said she has ""first hand experience"" of racism herself. ""I was insulted all my life for being white girl in local Malaysian school,"" she added. Former Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis, who resigned in 2018 in opposition to Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, has denounced the president's actions and blamed him for the current state of division in America. In an extraordinary critique,external, printed by the Atlantic magazine, Mattis writes that ""Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try. ""Instead, he tries to divide us."" Mattis continues: ""When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizensâmuch less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside."" The general urges the public to unite through ""the strengths inherent in our civil society"". ""This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.â Anatoly Antonov Russia's ambassador to the US has denied accusations that his country is helping to stir up unrest. On Sunday, White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien told ABC News that Russia could be using social media campaigns to stoke anger and confusion. Speaking with CNN, former national security advisor Susan Rice also said she ""would not be surprised"" if ""foreign actors"" like Russia were helping to encourage violence. But in a sharp rebuttal, Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov told state news channel Rossiya-1 that the claims were ""utterly wrong. ""It goes without saying that what is happening in the United States is fresh evidence of human rights violations and double standards,"" said Mr Antonov, according to state-run TASS news agency. ""I will say unequivocally that nobody is rejoicing. Everybody is watching with great regret what is happening,"" he added. ""We are very much worried over the situation in the host country. We wish to see its recovery."" A protester faces off with military police near the White House on Wednesday US Defence Secretary Mark Esper has abruptly reversed a plan for soldiers of the Army's 82nd Airborne division to leave Washington DC on Wednesday. The volte-face comes hours after Esper said he disagreed with Trump's threat to send active-duty soldiers into American states and cities. Active-duty troops should be deployed âonly in the most urgent and dire of situations,â he said earlier. âWe are not in one of those situations now.â Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told AP News that 200 of the 1,600 soldiers in the Washington DC region had been due to depart earlier on Wednesday. But, he said, Esper intervened to order them to remain. The White House today had refused to express confidence in Esper, with the president's spokeswoman telling reporters: ""As of right now Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper, and should the president lose faith we will all learn about that in the future."" Troops staged on the National Mall in Washington DC Virginia governor Ralph Northam will announce tomorrow that a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee will be removed from the state capital, Associated Press reports. A senior official told the news agency that the controversial statue will be removed from Richmond's Monument Avenue and put into storage until a new location is agreed upon. The monument has been vandalised during recent protests, and is the largest of five Confederate statues along the avenue. The expected announcement comes after authorities in Alexandria removed the so-called Appomattox statue honouring Confederate soldiers from the Virginian city. Memorials to the Confederacy, which fought for the legal right to keep black people as slaves, have long stirred controversy in the US. They have been criticised by black advocates as everyday symbols of white supremacy, but opponents of their removal say it is tantamount to erasing history. The Robert E Lee statue in Richmond - once the seat of the Confederate South - is one of the most well-known public landmarks in the Virginian capital. In his first on-camera remarks regarding the unrest of the past week, Democratic President Barack Obama praised protesters for making the ""kinds of epic changes and events in our country that are as profound as everything that Iâve seen in my lifetime"". The first black US president said that he saw reason for optimism despite the pain reflected in recent days and urged young people, especially, to vote for changes. ""Although all of us have been feeling pain uncertainty and disruption, some folks have been feeling it more than others,"" he said. Obama adds that the recent protests are the direct ""result of a long history of slavery and Jim Crow [laws] and red lining and institutionalised racism that have too often been the plague, the original sin, of our society"". He also called on US mayors and local officials to review police tactics. While in office, the former president also faced protests spurred by police brutality against Americans of colour, and was himself criticised for characterising demonstrators as ""criminals and thugs"". Former US president Barack Obama is hosting a video conference town hall, marking his first on-camera comments since anti-police brutality protests swept the US and world. He is expected to call for ""real change"" according to aides, and express his hope ""that we can turn protest into policyâ. He is starting to speak now. The call is being hosted on the Obama Foundation website. Thousands are expected to attend a protest in Melbourne on Saturday in response to the death of George Floyd, while also highlighting Aboriginal deaths in Australian police custody. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said people will not be fined for attending the protest, but police warned the demonstration could potentially spread Covid-19. ""What we've seen happen in the United States is a tragedy and it speaks to many of the differences between our society and the society in the United States,"" Andrews said. He added it was ""simply not feasible"" to impose fines or arrest demonstrators for breaching restrictions in place due to the pandemic. However, assistant commissioner Luke Cornelius said he would prefer the event be postponed until restrictions on large gathering are eased further. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Against the backdrop of the current US unrest, Russian activists have launched an online answer to the Black Lives Matter movement in response to a law enforcement shooting in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg. The hashtag RussianLivesMatter - in English - has gone viral in the last few days; it appears to have been started by Mikhail Svetov, of the Russian Libertarian Party, in a tweet about the 31 May shooting of a man suspected of stealing four rolls of wallpaper. The contents highlight cases of police brutality in Russia. A number of tweets have recalled the violent suppression of last summerâs protests held in support of free and fair elections in Moscow. Svetov has also tweeted calls for people to attend pickets at police headquarters in Moscow to protest abuses. However, he is a controversial character with links to the far-right. In March, Svetov posted a 70-minute interview with British far-right activist Tommy Robinson on his YouTube channel. Jessica LussenhopSenior staff writer, BBC News in Minneapolis Moments before it was announced that additional charges have been filed against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and three other former officers, the father of Michael Brown - the teenager killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 - arrived at the site of George Floydâs death. Michael Brown Sr has always asked that the officer in his sonâs case, former officer Darren Wilson, be fired, arrested and charged. None of that has yet come to pass. But standing in front of a mural to Floyd, he said the announcement of new charges gave him hope. âWe have a chance in St Louis. we have a chance to reopen our case,â he said. âThereâs no statute of limitations on murder.â Michael Brown Sr visits the site of George Floyd's death George Floyd's death in custody has sparked protests around the US - and also in countries around the world. On Wednesday, thousands protested in London, marching towards Parliament. It comes as UK chief constables said they stand alongside all those ""appalled and horrified"" by his death. A number of videos shared on social media showed protesters and police clashing outside Downing Street. Footage showed objects, including signs and a traffic cone, being thrown at police, while one protester was wrestled to the ground and restrained by officers. Read more on the London protesthere, and aboutdeaths in UK police custodyhere. Attorney General Ellison ends the press conference by promising to ""hold everyone accountable for
behaviour we can prove in court"". ""As the people who are legal professionals,
professional prosecutors â we are taking our duty seriously, and we are working
with the people who gather the facts, and we have done the work that we begin
is possible, ethical and right."" When asked about the lack of trust between the public and the authorities, he says: ""Our country has under-prosecuted these matters, in Minnesota
and throughout the country."" This, he says, is ""the origin of the trust problem"" - as ""people who have public guardians"" have not been held accountable in similar situations in the past. ""We canât control the past â all we can do is take the case we have in
front of us right now, and do our best to bring justice to the situation."" Ellison is asked about whether he is concerned the officers will be acquitted - with the reporter noting that no one has successfully prosecuted a second-degree murder charge for a policeman before - prompting more unrest, as happened during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. The 1992 riots broke out after white police officers were acquitted of police brutality for the beating of King, a black motorist. Ellison answers that the charges filed are based on the facts. ""We believe we have the ability to charge the charges that fit the facts in this case and we have done so,""  he says. ""So our concern is to put all the energy we can into putting forth the strongest case that we can, without fear or favor of anyone or anything. These charges are based on the facts that we have found and weâre gonna pursue them."" Drew Evans, the superintendant in Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, says authorities are in the process of taking the three police officers, who have just been charged, into custody. ""One is in custody, the other two we are in the process of taking into custody
and expect them to this afternoon,"" he says. Meanwhile, Attorney General Ellison tells reporters that public pressure did not influence his decision, saying he ""made the decision based on the lawâ. Â© 2025 BBC.

We'll be monitoring protests as curfew hour draws nigh across the US. Here's the main points from today:  Today's live page was brought to you by Matthew Davis, Victoria Bisset, George Wright, Max Matza, Sean Fanning, Helier Cheung, Vicky Baker, Joshua Cheetham, Ritu Prasad and Boer Deng. ""Silence can be as deadly as violence,"" former Democratic President Jimmy Carter has warned in a statement on the George Floyd protests. The comments from Carter, the oldest living US president, follow those made by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama. Carter continued: ""People of power, privilege, and moral conscience must stand up and say 'no more' to a racially discriminatory police and justice system, immoral economic disparities between whites and blacks, and government actions that undermine our unified democracy."" ""Dehumanising people debases us all; humanity is beautifully and almost infinitely diverse,"" he adds. ""The bonds of our common humanity must overcome the divisiveness of our fears and prejudices."" ""We are responsible for creating a world of peace and equality for ourselves and future generations,"" he continued. ""We need a government as good as its people, and we are better than this."" For another day, protesters are out on the streets near the White House. In 90F (32C) heat, they lay down in the streets and chanted: ""I can't breathe."" The Washington DC mayor has pushed back the curfew time tonight to 23:00 local time, from 19:00 the past two nights. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The White House press secretary has likened President Donald Trump's ""resilience and determination"" during the #GeorgeFloyd protests to Winston Churchill inspecting bomb damage during World War Two. This video can not be played White House likens Trump to Churchill in WW2 Three alleged far-right activists in Las Vegas have been charged with trying to exploit peaceful protests and incite violence, according to prosecutors. According to the local prosecutor's office, the three men are alleged members of the âBoogalooâ movement, which prosecutors describe as ""a term used by extremists to signify a coming civil war and/or collapse of society"". âViolent instigators have hijacked peaceful protests and demonstrations across the country, including Nevada, exploiting the real and legitimate outrage over Mr Floydâs death for their own radical agendas,â US Attorney Nicholas Trutanich saidin a statement,external. âLaw enforcement is focused on keeping violence and destruction from interfering with free public expression and threatening lives.â The three men were apprehended late last month after attempting to use a molotov cocktail, officials say. As though in a direct rebuttal to Mattis, President Trump has released a video addressing the nationwide protests, with a final shot of the word âUniteâ superimposed over the stars of the US flag. The advert features the presidentâs voice over a contemplative piano soundtrack and footage of the demonstrations. Trump says he understands the pain people are feeling over the âgrave tragedyâ of George Floydâs death. He then argues Floydâs memory is being dishonoured by violence that he claims without evidence is being instigated by antifa, a loose affiliation of mainly far-left protesters. âNo one is more upset than fellow law enforcement officers,"" he says, ""by the small handful who fail to abide by their oath to serve and protect.â Images of police standing in solidarity with demonstrators play. âHealing not hatred, justice not chaos, are the mission at hand,â Trump adds. âWe are working towards a more just society, but that means building up, not tearing down, joining hands, not hurling fists.â Allow Twitter content?

A former winner of Miss Universe Malaysia is facing calls for her title to be stripped after comments she made about protests in the US. Samantha Katie James, who won the pageant in 2017, wrote a series of Instagram posts on Monday criticising the demonstrations and telling black people to ""relax"". ""You chose to be born as a 'coloured' person in America for a reason. To learn a certain lesson,"" she wrote. ""Accept it as it is."" The Brazilian-Chinese model added that ""it seems like the 'whites' won. Because if you're angry, you respond in rage and anguish. That means it has power over you. THEY HAVE POWER OVER YOU."" Her comments have drawn ire on social media, and more 120,000 people have signedan online petition calling for her title to be removed,external. The Miss Universe Malaysia Organisation has distanced itself from the remarks, calling them ""inappropriate, offensive, unacceptable and hurtful."" The beauty queen has since issued an apology on her Instagram, and said she has ""first hand experience"" of racism herself. ""I was insulted all my life for being white girl in local Malaysian school,"" she added. Former Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis, who resigned in 2018 in opposition to Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, has denounced the president's actions and blamed him for the current state of division in America. In an extraordinary critique,external, printed by the Atlantic magazine, Mattis writes that ""Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try. ""Instead, he tries to divide us."" Mattis continues: ""When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizensâmuch less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside."" The general urges the public to unite through ""the strengths inherent in our civil society"". ""This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.â Anatoly Antonov Russia's ambassador to the US has denied accusations that his country is helping to stir up unrest. On Sunday, White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien told ABC News that Russia could be using social media campaigns to stoke anger and confusion. Speaking with CNN, former national security advisor Susan Rice also said she ""would not be surprised"" if ""foreign actors"" like Russia were helping to encourage violence. But in a sharp rebuttal, Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov told state news channel Rossiya-1 that the claims were ""utterly wrong. ""It goes without saying that what is happening in the United States is fresh evidence of human rights violations and double standards,"" said Mr Antonov, according to state-run TASS news agency. ""I will say unequivocally that nobody is rejoicing. Everybody is watching with great regret what is happening,"" he added. ""We are very much worried over the situation in the host country. We wish to see its recovery."" A protester faces off with military police near the White House on Wednesday US Defence Secretary Mark Esper has abruptly reversed a plan for soldiers of the Army's 82nd Airborne division to leave Washington DC on Wednesday. The volte-face comes hours after Esper said he disagreed with Trump's threat to send active-duty soldiers into American states and cities. Active-duty troops should be deployed âonly in the most urgent and dire of situations,â he said earlier. âWe are not in one of those situations now.â Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told AP News that 200 of the 1,600 soldiers in the Washington DC region had been due to depart earlier on Wednesday. But, he said, Esper intervened to order them to remain. The White House today had refused to express confidence in Esper, with the president's spokeswoman telling reporters: ""As of right now Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper, and should the president lose faith we will all learn about that in the future."" Troops staged on the National Mall in Washington DC Virginia governor Ralph Northam will announce tomorrow that a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee will be removed from the state capital, Associated Press reports. A senior official told the news agency that the controversial statue will be removed from Richmond's Monument Avenue and put into storage until a new location is agreed upon. The monument has been vandalised during recent protests, and is the largest of five Confederate statues along the avenue. The expected announcement comes after authorities in Alexandria removed the so-called Appomattox statue honouring Confederate soldiers from the Virginian city. Memorials to the Confederacy, which fought for the legal right to keep black people as slaves, have long stirred controversy in the US. They have been criticised by black advocates as everyday symbols of white supremacy, but opponents of their removal say it is tantamount to erasing history. The Robert E Lee statue in Richmond - once the seat of the Confederate South - is one of the most well-known public landmarks in the Virginian capital. In his first on-camera remarks regarding the unrest of the past week, Democratic President Barack Obama praised protesters for making the ""kinds of epic changes and events in our country that are as profound as everything that Iâve seen in my lifetime"". The first black US president said that he saw reason for optimism despite the pain reflected in recent days and urged young people, especially, to vote for changes. ""Although all of us have been feeling pain uncertainty and disruption, some folks have been feeling it more than others,"" he said. Obama adds that the recent protests are the direct ""result of a long history of slavery and Jim Crow [laws] and red lining and institutionalised racism that have too often been the plague, the original sin, of our society"". He also called on US mayors and local officials to review police tactics. While in office, the former president also faced protests spurred by police brutality against Americans of colour, and was himself criticised for characterising demonstrators as ""criminals and thugs"". Former US president Barack Obama is hosting a video conference town hall, marking his first on-camera comments since anti-police brutality protests swept the US and world. He is expected to call for ""real change"" according to aides, and express his hope ""that we can turn protest into policyâ. He is starting to speak now. The call is being hosted on the Obama Foundation website. Thousands are expected to attend a protest in Melbourne on Saturday in response to the death of George Floyd, while also highlighting Aboriginal deaths in Australian police custody. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said people will not be fined for attending the protest, but police warned the demonstration could potentially spread Covid-19. ""What we've seen happen in the United States is a tragedy and it speaks to many of the differences between our society and the society in the United States,"" Andrews said. He added it was ""simply not feasible"" to impose fines or arrest demonstrators for breaching restrictions in place due to the pandemic. However, assistant commissioner Luke Cornelius said he would prefer the event be postponed until restrictions on large gathering are eased further. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Against the backdrop of the current US unrest, Russian activists have launched an online answer to the Black Lives Matter movement in response to a law enforcement shooting in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg. The hashtag RussianLivesMatter - in English - has gone viral in the last few days; it appears to have been started by Mikhail Svetov, of the Russian Libertarian Party, in a tweet about the 31 May shooting of a man suspected of stealing four rolls of wallpaper. The contents highlight cases of police brutality in Russia. A number of tweets have recalled the violent suppression of last summerâs protests held in support of free and fair elections in Moscow. Svetov has also tweeted calls for people to attend pickets at police headquarters in Moscow to protest abuses. However, he is a controversial character with links to the far-right. In March, Svetov posted a 70-minute interview with British far-right activist Tommy Robinson on his YouTube channel. Jessica LussenhopSenior staff writer, BBC News in Minneapolis Moments before it was announced that additional charges have been filed against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and three other former officers, the father of Michael Brown - the teenager killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 - arrived at the site of George Floydâs death. Michael Brown Sr has always asked that the officer in his sonâs case, former officer Darren Wilson, be fired, arrested and charged. None of that has yet come to pass. But standing in front of a mural to Floyd, he said the announcement of new charges gave him hope. âWe have a chance in St Louis. we have a chance to reopen our case,â he said. âThereâs no statute of limitations on murder.â Michael Brown Sr visits the site of George Floyd's death George Floyd's death in custody has sparked protests around the US - and also in countries around the world. On Wednesday, thousands protested in London, marching towards Parliament. It comes as UK chief constables said they stand alongside all those ""appalled and horrified"" by his death. A number of videos shared on social media showed protesters and police clashing outside Downing Street. Footage showed objects, including signs and a traffic cone, being thrown at police, while one protester was wrestled to the ground and restrained by officers. Read more on the London protesthere, and aboutdeaths in UK police custodyhere. Attorney General Ellison ends the press conference by promising to ""hold everyone accountable for
behaviour we can prove in court"". ""As the people who are legal professionals,
professional prosecutors â we are taking our duty seriously, and we are working
with the people who gather the facts, and we have done the work that we begin
is possible, ethical and right."" When asked about the lack of trust between the public and the authorities, he says: ""Our country has under-prosecuted these matters, in Minnesota
and throughout the country."" This, he says, is ""the origin of the trust problem"" - as ""people who have public guardians"" have not been held accountable in similar situations in the past. ""We canât control the past â all we can do is take the case we have in
front of us right now, and do our best to bring justice to the situation."" Ellison is asked about whether he is concerned the officers will be acquitted - with the reporter noting that no one has successfully prosecuted a second-degree murder charge for a policeman before - prompting more unrest, as happened during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. The 1992 riots broke out after white police officers were acquitted of police brutality for the beating of King, a black motorist. Ellison answers that the charges filed are based on the facts. ""We believe we have the ability to charge the charges that fit the facts in this case and we have done so,""  he says. ""So our concern is to put all the energy we can into putting forth the strongest case that we can, without fear or favor of anyone or anything. These charges are based on the facts that we have found and weâre gonna pursue them."" Drew Evans, the superintendant in Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, says authorities are in the process of taking the three police officers, who have just been charged, into custody. ""One is in custody, the other two we are in the process of taking into custody
and expect them to this afternoon,"" he says. Meanwhile, Attorney General Ellison tells reporters that public pressure did not influence his decision, saying he ""made the decision based on the lawâ. Â© 2025 BBC.
