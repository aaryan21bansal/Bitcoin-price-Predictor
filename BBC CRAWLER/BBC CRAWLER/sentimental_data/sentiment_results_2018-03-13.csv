"Ahmed Hassan said he had a fantasy about being a fugitive after watching lots of action movies The Iraqi asylum seeker accused of planting a bomb on a Tube train at Parsons Green has said it became a ""fantasy"" for him when he was ""very bored"" over the school holidays. Ahmed Hassan, 18, admitted building the device that partially detonated on the District Line on 15 September 2017. Mr Hassan told the court the ""idea of being chased by police and in Europe by Interpol... was very attractive"". He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. He said the fantasy was about being a fugitive and getting away, rather than the bomb, saying he ""wanted attention"". Mr Hassan added: ""The idea of killing another human being never crossed my mind at all. Never in my life."" When the prosecution asked if he regretted his actions, he said: ""I regret [it] very much every day... and I wish I hadn't done it. I wish I could travel back in time. ""I am very sorry but it can't be undone."" However, prosecutor Alison Morgan said it was ""a very calculated act of anger"". The teenager told the Old Bailey he did not like having time off from school and had not been sleeping because of bad dreams. ""The school holidays were basically my enemy,"" said Mr Hassan. ""I didn't like it because there was nothing to do. I would get very bored."" The restless teenager would then watch lots of action movies and documentaries about fugitives, as well as drinking up to six energy drinks each day. The court also heard he had considered suicide ""many many times"". This video can not be played The court has seen CCTV of the blast which showed what one witness described as a ""rolling fireball"" The court heard how Mr Hassan made TATP explosives two days before the attack from chemicals he had bought, after he had already assembled a timer by following a ""step-by-step"" guide online. He then went on to test the explosive the next day in a fizzy drink can on the kitchen table of his foster home in Sunbury, Surrey. Mr Hassan told jurors: ""I heard a 'whoof' and a very small heat, fire, for a fraction of a second."" He said he was certain that the substance ""would not explode"" and ""it would just burn"". But Ms Morgan said he ""knew precisely"" what TATP was and what would happen. She claimed Mr Hassan had lied about testing the chemical compound on the table as there were no burn marks or traces of explosives found on it. When he refused to watch the CCTV of the explosion in court, she said: ""Well I will tell you then - there's a huge fireball that rips its way through that carriage, and you say that's what you intended to happen?"" Mr Hassan replied: ""I knew it would make a fire as it did in the test."" Ms Morgan asked what an ""acceptable level of injury"" would have been, but he said he had not thought about it. Apologising for his actions, he added: ""I know how hard it is to have trauma... and also for people who cared for me in this country. Now I think this is wrong."" Earlier, Mr Hassan, an Iraqi asylum seeker, denied having any contact with the Islamic State group in Iraq. Prosecutors said that he had told Home Office officials 20 months before the attack that he had been kidnapped by IS and trained to kill. But the teenager told jurors he had lied to improve his case for asylum after being given advice by other migrants he met when he was in the so-called Jungle camp in Calais. ""I came from a wealthy part of Northern Iraq and if I told them that they would have deported me,"" he said. ""In the Jungle in Calais, people used to talk about these things and make up stories. ""I never came across a refugee who said he would tell the truth when he arrived in the country."" Mr Hassan described his journey to the UK, first from Iraq to Turkey, then on to Italy where he claimed he had been ""abused"" by the Italian authorities. He travelled from there to Paris and then to Calais, where he stayed for around two months before entering the UK on a lorry in October 2015. He was then taken to Bay Tree, a Barnardo's home in Horley, Surrey, where he was for about six months, saying it was a ""relief"" after the refugee camp. Mr Hassan was enrolled on a two-year media course at Brooklands College in Weybridge, Surrey, and his ""ultimate goal"" was to become a wildlife photographer, ""like David Attenborough"". The teenager claimed to have won a student of the year prize six times in a row in Iraq, and was awarded another at his college in June 2017. He described himself as a Sunni Muslim and said he prayed five times a day, but when asked if he cared about people being from other faiths, he said: ""Not at all, not in the slightest."" CCTV allegedly showed Ahmed Hassan exiting Putney Bridge, the stop before Parsons Green Mr Hassan also told the jury that both his parents were dead. He said he was too young to remember his mother, but remembered his father, who died ""in an explosion while he was working as a taxi driver."" He added: ""He used to go to work and come back evenings and then he did not come back. ""It was very difficult. I did not understand what was going on. I was in a state of confusion because of fighting, because of bombing."" On Monday, the court heard from the prosecution that Mr Hassan blamed the UK and US for the deaths of his parents, and that he believed his father had been killed by an American bomb. College lecturer Kayte Cable said Ahmed Hassan told her it was ""his duty to hate Britain"" because of what happened to his family. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Lucy Allan told parliament the girls were targeted because of their backgrounds Vulnerable white working class girls are being traded for sex in a ""routine way"" an MP has told ministers. Conservative politician Lucy Allan addressed fellow politicians in the wake of reports claiming up to 1,000 children could have been targeted in her Telford constituency. Ms Allan said the cases would not have happened had the victims been from different backgrounds. Calls are growing for a fresh inquiry into sex abuse in the Shropshire town. Speaking at a Westminster Hall debate, Ms Allan said the girls had ""multiple vulnerabilities"". Telford has found itself in the spotlight afterthe Sunday Mirror published a report about ""groups of mainly Asian men"" targeting vulnerable white teenagers in the town,externalsince the 1980s. A lawyerwho led prosecutions against one child sex abuse ring in Telfordhas said those cases were the ""tip of the iceberg"". The latest reports focus on organised abuse in Wellington, Telford Ms Allan said the girls were targeted because of their backgrounds. ""It is also why so often they are miscast as bringing it on themselves, they are miscast as indulging in risky behaviour, as being promiscuous, as somehow being to blame for what is happening to them,"" she said. ""In their own minds, so often they also internalise that sense that they are somehow at fault."" Ms Allan said she was concerned difficult family backgrounds led authorities to see victims as ""troublemakers"" who were ""too difficult"" to deal with. ""Maybe that's why these crimes were not identified for quite so long,"" she said. ""Had those girls been from a different background, had they been able to articulate more clearly what it was that was happening to them, had they been able to identify that it was a crime then I think perhaps we would not have the cases that we're seeing in Telford, in Rotherham, in Oxford. ""How did it happen that our young girls are being traded for sex in what is becoming a routine way? ""Whether it's from takeaways or taxis or betting shops, it's happening in our streets."" Meanwhile, the country's top child protection officer said ""difficult cultural questions"" needed to be asked about the type of abuse seen in Telford. Addressing a Home Affairs Select Committee, Chief Constable Simon Bailey asked: ""What culturally drives this? What culturally permits the type of abuse that we are seeing in that particular offending model?"" Ms Allan has previously called for a Rotherham-style inquiry into the allegations. Telford and Wrekin Council, which initially resisted calls for a probe focused on the town, has since pledged its support for the idea.,external Council leader and Labour Councillor Shaun Davies, who previously said a national review chaired by Alexis Jay would suffice, has backed Ms Allan's plea. Council leader Shaun Davies has backed calls for an inquiry Justice Minister Phillip Lee praised Ms Allan for her contribution, and said ""strong women"" in this area were needed to provide ""leadership that is desperately required"". He added: ""Child sexual abuse is, I think, the worst of all crimes."" Mr Lee said he had written a theses on ""the psychology of the child sex offender"" in the early 90s, and had been ""somewhat sceptical"" of estimates in textbooks about the extent of such offences across the UK. ""Sadly, that academic literature has turned out to be more accurate than I can ever have imagined,"" he said. Seven men were jailed in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali Seven men were jailed in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali. The force said more than 100 girls could have been targeted by the gang between 2007 and 2009. Many of the seven men worked for or had connections with fast food restaurants across Telford. Victims as young as 13 were plied with drugs and alcohol and sold for sex by men who posed as their boyfriends. The men initially won the girls' trust by giving them presents such as mobile phones in an ""almost boyfriend-girlfriend scenario"", police said. Speaking in 2013, Det Ch Insp Neil Jamieson said: ""It then spiralled into them being shared with other men."" The girls were moved around the country for the purposes of sexual exploitation, he added. Mubarek Ali was released in November last year after serving about five years behind bars. He was banned from returning to Telford and Shrewsbury. MP for Rotherham, Sarah Champion, was among those who welcomed Ms Allan's speech. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Victim: I will do whatever it takes to keep Worboys behind bars The Parole Board failed to consider ""critical evidence"" against rapist John Worboys before approving his prison release, a lawyer for two of his victims has told the High Court. The lawyer said the evidence related to ""wider allegations"" of sexual attacks. Police believe that Worboys - jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women in London - had more than 100 victims. Lawyer Phillippa Kaufmann QC said the board was wrong to decide Worboys took ""full responsibility"" for his crimes. Worboys is thought to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in the capital between 2002 and 2008. The 60-year-old, who has changed his name to John Radford, is watching the trial via video link from prison. The court heard he denies any allegation other than the offences he was convicted of. Legal papers submitted to the High Court show that as recently as September last year, the prison authorities believed he posed such a risk that he needed to remain in a Category A prison. Three months later the Parole Board decided that he should be let out with stringent licence conditions, without having been assessed at a less secure prison. Ms Kaufmann said this ""highly exceptional step"" was ""in the face of opposition"" from senior prison managers, prison psychologists, the probation service and the justice secretary. John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women Ms Kaufmann said the claims of Worboys' further crimes ""completely undermined"" the board's decision. She told the court: ""It is obvious, absolutely obvious, that this evidence of wider offending had a central bearing on all of those conclusions that formed the basis of the Parole Board's conclusion that there had been a reduction in risk."" Ms Kaufmann added it would have been fair to consider these allegations as the board did not have to determine whether he had actually committed the crimes. She said it would be ""extraordinary"" to release Worboys straight from a Category A prison, the highest security prison, into the community. At last, the cloak of secrecy surrounding the Parole Board's decision-making in this case has been lifted. Thanks to the judicial review challenge the public, and John Worboys' victims, can find out why the Board ruled it was safe to release him. Its decision was apparently influenced by assessments from three independent psychologists all of whom at some stage had been instructed by Worboys. One expert initially recommended he be moved from HMP Wakefield, a high security jail, to an 'open' prison, which allows inmates more freedom. That's the usual route to eventual release, taken by those serving life or indeterminate sentences. It enables the authorities to test whether prisoners can be trusted in a less secure environment where they're allowed to spend time working in the community. But the psychologist later changed their view and agreed with two other psychologists that the 60-year-old sex offender should be let out straight away - direct from Wakefield jail. To be released from a Category A prison, the court heard, is ""very unusual"".  Nevertheless,  their advice was accepted by the three-member parole panel, resulting in this landmark legal challenge. Ahead of the High Court challenge against the decision to grant him parole, victims said they were not properly informed and warned of risks to women's safety. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has also launched a judicial review against the action to free the former black-cab driver. During the High Court challenge, three judges are hearing evidence over two days from victims and Mr Khan. As the case got under way, Mr Khan said in a statement that Worboys presented a ""significant threat"" to safety. He said: ""I have been clear that he shouldn't be released at the very least until the decision has been properly independently scrutinised and we are reassured that those in positions of power and responsibility are doing everything they can to keep all his victims, and the rest of us, safe."" The Sun newspaper is also part of the legal challenge, after it was granted permission last month to challenge the Parole Board over not publishing its decision. The Parole Boardhas previously apologised to victimswho were not told about the decision but said it was ""confident"" Worboys would not re-offend. The case continues.

"Nikolas Cruz is facing 17 counts of murder US prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the teenager accused of killing 17 people at a Florida high school last month. Nikolas Cruz, 19, has admitted carrying out the attack and is charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. The attack, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, is the deadliest US school shooting since 2012. It has re-ignited long-running debates about tougher firearm restrictions. Cruz has told police that he arrived on campus and began shooting students before abandoning his weapon and escaping, according to court documents. The FBI has admitted it received a tip-off about him last year. Who are the victims? How the school attack happened English teen hid from gunman in cupboard Analysis: One shooting, two Americas In a notice filed on Tuesday, prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty and would prove the crime ""was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel."" ""The capital felony was a homicide and was committed in a cold, calculated and premeditated manner without any pretence of moral or legal justification,"" the notice said. This video can not be played Shoes mark young victims of gun violence Lawyers representing Cruz have said he will plead guilty if the death penalty is not considered. ""We still stand ready to immediately plead guilty to 34 consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole,"" Howard Finkelstein, a county public defender,  said. ""We are not saying he is not guilty but we can't plead guilty while death is still on the table,"" he added. Nikolas Cruz is a former student at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He was reportedly investigated by local police and the Department of Children and Family Services in 2016 after posting evidence of self-harm on the Snapchat app. A depressed loner 'crazy about guns' Tales of heroism from Florida attack Child services said he had planned to buy a gun, but authorities determined he was already receiving adequate support, reports say.

The tip was not the only information the FBI received. In September, a Mississippi man reported to the law enforcement agency a disturbing comment left on a YouTube video under Cruz's name.

"A new millennial railcard has sold out despite strong demand crashing the website on the first day of sales. The National Railcards website apologised for the problems and said ""we will consider carefully"" the high demand when more cards are issued. The railcard for 26 to 30-year-olds cost Â£30 and offers a third off most fares in England, Wales and Scotland. Only 10,000 cards were released on Tuesday under a trial, but big demand caused website problems for hours. A spokeswoman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the train companies and Network Rail, said: ""This morning, when the 26-30 railcard trial began, the National Railcard website was receiving 12 times the normal number of visitors. We were prepared for demand to be similar to that of previous trial launches. ""Due to the unprecedented demand we have been working with our suppliers throughout the morning to further increase the capacity on the website to create a better experience for our customers. We recommend that customers continue trying the National Railcard website, and keep an eye on @_Railcards Twitter and Facebook pages for updates."" Allow Twitter content?

"The Home Affairs Committee took this screenshot of one of the video uploads before it was removed Google has blamed human error for a failure to remove four propaganda videos posted to YouTube by the banned UK Neo-Nazi group National Action. Google's counter-terrorism chief said the material had been flagged by its systems, but its review team then wrongly decided not to remove it. William McCants told the Home Affairs Committee that action was being taken to avoid this happening again. But the committee chair said the matter should have been taken more seriously. Yvette Cooper noted that the MPs had reported the same 2016 National Action speech in Darlington eight times to YouTube over the past 12 months, after spotting that it had been reposted and not removed. ""I'm not sure what else we could have done to raise the seriousness of this organisation,"" she said. Mr McCants replied: ""Clearly this was a failure of our review process and we are going to fix it. I personally am charged with taking care of this problem, and I am going to be watching it like a hawk."" YouTube last appeared before the committee in December when it was criticised for failing to deal with earlier instances of the same material. Mr McCants said that in the latest instance, three of the videos were caught by YouTube's automated systems and a fourth by a human reviewer. He explained that uploads of the demonstration were not always an exact match. They therefore had to be sent to human reviewers to check whether the footage had been used legally - for instance as part of a news report. Mr McCants said YouTube had dealt with about 150 instances of National Action material In all four cases, he acknowledged, the team had made ""the wrong call"" despite having been trained to recognise that such material should be banned. He added that three steps were being taken to address this: videos featuring National Action supporters would now be sent to specialist reviewers trained to recognise the group's slogans the training for general human reviewers would be improved software used to flag National Action videos would be fine-tuned to make it able to spot shorter clips than it had before ""It is my job and my sole mission to make sure [extremist videos] have no space on our platforms,"" Mr McCants added. ""I am going to do my job."" However, he faced further criticism later in the hearing when Stephen Doughty MP said he had found other illegal material on YouTube this morning, featuring outlawed Northern Irish Loyalist and Republican terrorists. ""If you came back in four weeks time, would I be able to find that material on your platform again?"" Mr Doughty asked. ""I hope not,"" Mr McCants replied. ""You hope not? Well I'm sorry that is simply not good enough,"" Mr Doughty followed up. Rehman Chishti MP also attacked the Google executive when it emerged Mr McCants had not checked whether the reviewer who had made the incorrect decision had made previous mistakes. ""That goes to the competence of the individuals that you have,"" the politician said. Mr Chishti also suggested Mr McCants should consider resigning if banned extremist videos were still available on YouTube in six months time. MPs were also disappointed that Mr McCants - who has held his post for four months - did not know: where the reviewers involved were based if the reviewers were employed directly by YouTube or were third-party contractors how many third-party contractors were employed to check videos who provided the training to the contractors ""The failing is not simply an accident,"" Ms Cooper concluded. ""The evidence that you have given us today is so weak that I am afraid this looks like a failure to even do the basics. ""We are extremely disappointed by the evidence that you have given.""

"National Geographic's first edition was in 1888 US magazine National Geographic says its past coverage of people around the world was racist. It ignored non-white Americans and showed different groups as exotic or savage, propagating ""every type of clichÃ©"", editor Susan Goldberg said. The magazine's April edition is dedicated to race and it has asked a historian to look at past issues. It decided to re-examine its coverage to mark 50 years since civil rights leader Martin Luther King was murdered. ""Let's confront today's shameful use of racism as a political strategy and prove we are better than this,""Ms Goldberg wrote in an editorial entitled ""For Decades, Our Coverage Was Racist"",external. Ms Goldberg said some of the magazine's archive material left her ""speechless"", including a 1916 photo of Australian Aborigines with the caption ""South Australian Blackfellows: These savages rank lowest in intelligence of all human beings"".

Asked to examine its coverage, University of Virginia associate professor John Edwin Mason said National Geographic had served only to reinforce racist attitudes in a magazine with ""tremendous authority"".

He compared a piece covering apartheid-era South Africa in 1962 - which barely mentions any problems - and a second piece from 1977, which shows opposition to the regime by black leaders. ""It's not a perfect article, but it acknowledges the oppression,"" Prof Mason wrote.

"Players of the hugely popular Fortnite video game are being urged to be vigilant as malicious hackers kick off campaigns to hijack accounts. In recent weeks, many Fortnite players have reported via social media that their accounts have been taken over. Many have been hit with high charges for games and other items they never bought. Fortnite maker Epic said it was aware of the attacks and was looking into them. The game is a co-operative survival shooting title that lets players build structures out of materials they scavenge from the game world. Its most popular format is the Battle Royale mode which pits 100 players against each other, some of whom are in small teams, to see who is the last man standing. News site Forbes said it had seen ""dozens"" of reports online by people who said their accounts had been compromised. Many said they did not know how the hackers had got at their accounts. The fraudulent payments made by the hackers appear to have been completed using payment details saved on the Fortnite game accounts. Players have been hit by high charges for different versions of the Fortnite game as well as its online currency and cosmetic items for in-game characters. Should you limit kids' time on Fortnite- - BBC News Mum defends teen in gaming lawsuit Erik Kain,writing on Forbes,external, speculated that the attackers may have got at accounts because people re-used passwords across different services. Recent data breaches had given attackers a ready-made list of possible passwords, he said, which they would then use against other services they were targeting. In a statement, Epic said it was ""aware"" of the continuing attacks against players and the cyber-thieves were using ""well-known hacking techniques"". It added: ""Any players who believe their account has been compromised should reach out to our player support immediately."" At the same time, a row is brewing between Microsoft and Sony over letting players battle each other in Fortnite no matter how they access the game. Soon it will be possible for PC, Mac and mobile players of Fortnite to take on people who access the game via console, and vice versa. However, it will not be possible for Xbox or PlayStation owners to directly take each other on. In a statement shared with technology news site Kotaku,external, Microsoft said it had offered to help set a system that bridged the divide between the two console populations but Sony had not responded to its offer. Sony has yet to respond to a BBC request for comment about cross-console play. This video can not be played WATCH: Should you limit your children's time on Fortnite? In the past, reports the Verge, Sony has turned down offers to make cross-play work, citing safety fears.

"The man found on Monday is believed to be Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov Counter-terror police are leading an investigation into the ""unexplained"" death of a man in London. He is believed to be Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov, who claimed political asylum in the UK after being convicted of fraud. The Metropolitan Police said its specialist unit was looking into it ""as a precaution because of associations that the man is believed to have had"". There was no evidence linking the death to the incidents in Salisbury, it said. In a statement, it said the man in his 60s had been found at a residential address in New Malden on Monday night. The man has been identified, but not formally. However, next of kin have been informed. Mr Glushkov, 69, is the former deputy director of Russian state airline Aeroflot. He was jailed in 1999 for five years after being charged with money laundering and fraud. Investigators' tents were erected outside the house in New Malden After being given a suspended sentence for another count of fraud in 2006, he fled to the UK to seek political asylum and became a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Glushkov also had a close friendship with fellow Russian businessman Boris Berezovsky, who came to the UK in 1999 after falling out with Mr Putin. Mr Berezovsky was found hanged in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in 2013 and an inquest recorded an open verdict. By BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera There may be nothing suspicious about the death of Nikolai Glushkov, but given the current context it is impossible for the police to do anything other than take it seriously and ask Counter Terrorism Command to lead the investigation. In the past, there has been criticism of the police not taking such deaths seriously enough. The Home Secretary has also today asked the police and MI5 to review a series of other deaths of Russians and Russian-linked individuals in the UK over the last decade or so. One of those may well be Boris Berezovsky, who was found dead in 2013 and who was a close ally of Glushkov. This is all a sign that the prism through which those past deaths are seen has changed. That is because the notion of what Russia might be capable of doing has changed. The top priority though, for MI5 and police, will not be looking back at previous cases but instead the ongoing investigation in Salisbury.

"This video can not be played Telford abuse: 'I was sold twice a night' A lawyer who led prosecutions against a child sex abuse ring in Telford has said those cases were the ""tip of the iceberg"". Former chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who also oversaw similar high-profile cases in Rochdale, said he knew ""more would come out"". Speaking amid calls for a new inquiry, he said there were probably thousands of street grooming victims in the UK. West Mercia Police said it took all allegations ""extremely seriously"". A Sunday Mirror investigation,externalsaid the scale of sexual exploitation in Telford made it the UK's ""worst-ever child grooming scandal"". The paper claimed abuse in the town has been widespread since 1980, when it began with ""groups of mainly Asian men"" targeting vulnerable white teenagers. Mr Afzal led several prosecutions concerning offences in Telford, includingone against two brothers convicted of trafficking girls for sex. Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, he said: ""I prosecuted, when I led nationally, the Telford original issue, I knew then that this was a bigger issue not just in Telford but everywhere."" Midlands Live: West Midlands Police joins nerve agent attack probe; Flood warnings issued across region Nazir Afzal said he thinks abuse of this nature is happening all over the country He appeared alongside ""Holly"" - who spoke out anonymously about her abuse at the hand of gangs in the town. ""Now, seven or eight years later, I see stories like Holly's where she is not being listened to, she's not being believed, her abusers have acted with impunity because they think the authorities are not going to do anything about it. ""She is one of probably one of thousands of young girls and young boys who are being abused in street grooming up and down the country."" Ansar Ali, a spokesman for Together Against Grooming, also appeared on the programme and was asked why Asian gangs are often blamed for child sexual exploitation. ""These gangs that operate are not what you call your classic, typical paedophile, that's not their motivation,"" he said. ""Yes they are sexual predators but it is more that they use these girls as a sexual commodity and it is about making money off them. ""That is their main driver. ""I don't think there is a link to their heritage because most people from their background don't commit these sort of acts. ""The vast majority of people find their actions reprehensible, including the communities from which they originate."" Telford MP Lucy Allan has asked for an urgent question in Parliament about the situation and called for an urgent inquiry. Seven men were jailed in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali Seven men were jailed in 2012as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali. The force said more than 100 girls could have been targeted by the gang between 2007 and 2009. Many of the seven men worked for or had connections with fast food restaurants across Telford. Victims as young as 13 were plied with drugs and alcohol and sold for sex by men who posed as their boyfriends. The men initially won the girls' trust by giving them presents such as mobile phones in an ""almost boyfriend-girlfriend scenario"", police said. Speaking in 2013, Det Ch Insp Neil Jamieson said: ""It then spiralled into them being shared with other men."" The girls were moved around the country for the purposes of sexual exploitation, he added. Mubarek Ali was released in November last year after serving about five years behind bars. He was banned from returning to Telford and Shrewsbury. Mark Berry, a volunteer who helped to run a night cafe in Wellington said he witnessed signs of the abuse in the town before Operation Chalice began. In about 2012, he said, groups of young men were hanging around nightclubs without entering them, and approaching girls who exited the venues alone or in small groups. ""We began talking to the girls, as you do when looking after people and we started to hear things that were going on,"" he said. ""At that point we didn't know what to call it."" He said the group reported what they saw to anti-trafficking teams, who at the time were focusing on women being brought into the UK. ""We weren't calling it CSE, there was a different language,"" Mr Berry said. ""We raised concerns about what we were seeing and asked if there was anything we could do to help. ""Really, at the time, there were things going on that felt not normal. ""Chalice then took off and it all became clear it was bigger than we thought."" Reacting to the news, locals in Wellington, Telford, said they were saddened, but not surprised that organised sexual abuse was occuring. One woman, who did not wish to be named, said: ""We know it has being going on for a long time but it is disgusting. ""I hate to think of it, innocent children having to put up with it, it has been going on for years but it has not come to light. ""There should be more done about it, but I don't know what they can do."" Carer Tracy Shaw, 40, and her daughter Amber, 20, said they feel fearful living in the town. Tracy said: ""When I am working, I always have something in my pocket. I don't let my daughter go to nightclubs."" Amber added: ""It makes me not want to go out. ""You don't expect it to happen anywhere but especially not in Telford."" Mr Berry agreed with Mr Afzal's assessment that the cases so far had been ""potentially just the tip of the prosecutions"". He also backed calls for a new inquiry, and called on the authorities to get local organisations involved. ""Often community groups know more about what is going on on the ground,"" he said. In 2016,street pastors claimed that men were ""blatantly"" approaching young girls in Shropshire for sex. Arecent meeting of a Telford and Wrekin Council scrutiny committee,externalheard evidence of ""gang-related"" child sexual exploitation was no longer being found in the wake of Operation Chalice.

"This video can not be played From ""moron"" to ""castration"": a history of Trump v Tillerson bust-ups The Las Vegas shootings were Donald Trump's first experience of being consoler-in-chief. After a man barricaded himself into the Mandalay Bay hotel and over a terrifying 10 minutes opened fire on concertgoers below, killing dozens and injuring hundreds, the president went to Vegas and met families, first responders, medics and the emergency services. He left on Air Force One later that day feeling the day had gone as well as it could have, given the circumstances. But by the time he got back to Washington, his mood had darkened considerably. And there were two reasons for it. For a start, his visit to Vegas was NOT leading the bulletins on cable news channels. But secondly it's what WAS the top story that tipped him over the edge and into a hair-raising (lacquer allowing) rage. The lead item - with whooshes and flashes and giant straps rushing urgently across the  bottom of the screen - was the news that Rex Tillerson had refused to deny that he had called Donald Trump a ""moron"" (with expletive attached). This video can not be played In October, Rex Tillerson responded to a report he called Mr Trump 'a moron' The secretary of state had apparently been at a Pentagon meeting when he gave this somewhat disobliging opinion on the commander-in-chief. Those are things that are not easy to come back from. This is a president who nurses his grievances and personal slights with a love, care and attention that a botanist might bestow on a particularly rare and fragile orchid. From that moment on, the die in some ways was cast. Rex Tillerson - Trump's former top diplomat The White House revolving door: Who's gone? For a start they are not cut from the same cloth. Yes, they were both global businessmen - Trump with his beauty pageants, Tillerson the head of the slightly bigger, world renowned petro-chemical firm Exxon. But beyond that, they seemed very different people. Tillerson had been recommended to Trump by a former secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, and a former CIA director and defence secretary, Robert Gates. They thought he had the weight and the global experience as boss of Exxon to be the man to represent American interests around the world; to be the flag-waver-in-chief; to be the translator of Trumpism and ""America First"" to an anxious global audience. Tillerson's appointment was opposed by some But he seemed a little at sea. Like a child put in an ill-fitting suit for church on Sunday, he never really looked comfortable in the role. His first joint news conference with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov was a classic - with Lavrov expansive and  loquacious, maybe even verbose. And the Texan, Rex Tillerson, saying the bare minimum. Terse, taut, fearful. And he had a lot to be fearful of. He committed the State Department to massive expenditure cuts without any clear plan of how they would be implemented. The central symbol of US diplomacy had become a hollowed out vessel. Junior staff were acting several grades above their pay level because no senior jobs had been filled. There was a sense of despair. This video can not be played Trump says goodbye to Tillerson: 'I like Rex a lot, but we disagreed' And then there was Donald Trump. Forget ""Morongate"" - these were two people never on the same page, either personally or policy-wise. The president repeatedly undercut his secretary of state. On North Korea, the president tweeted that Tillerson was wasting his time. On other issues, he sent members of his family to do the negotiating abroad. You had the impression that Rex Tillerson was in office but not in power. He gave the appearance of a semi-detached panjandrum, travelling the world with a fancy title - but little leverage to alter the president's thinking. In public he stayed loyal and acted as though he was fully in the loop - when in reality, it often seemed the reverse was true. This video can not be played Mike Pompeo: Meet America's new top diplomat Except last night. Flying back from Africa, he was unusually forthright. He struck a markedly different tone to the White House on what had unfolded in Salisbury, England, where a Russian double agent and his daughter were poisoned by a Russian-produced nerve agent. Where the White House wouldn't level any criticism at Moscow, Tillerson weighed in. Maybe he knew he was about to face the firing squad; maybe he no longer cared. But mid-flight his fate was sealed. Battles ahead after another Trump sacking Gina Haspel - Trump's pick as CIA director 'You're fired!' - A reality TV White House? And the end was a perfect metaphor for the relationship. The odd couple of politics had been yoked together for too long. Men of different temperaments, demeanour and style had reached a parting of the ways. The secretary of state landed back at Joint Base Andrews to have a member of staff inform him that the president had tweeted. Because Mr Tillerson is not on Twitter, the tweet had to be printed out. Fancy being the one tasked with handing that over to the boss. Fired by a tweet. The career of a one-time giant of corporate America had come to an ignominious end. And the response of President Trump as he spoke to reporters this morning: ""I think Rex will be much happier now."" Overjoyed, I'm sure. A series of Trump v Tillerson bust-ups.

"This video can not be played Trump says goodbye to Tillerson: 'I like Rex a lot, but we disagreed' Rex Tillerson, who as a longtime corporate executive was an unconventional pick for secretary of state, seemed like he was on thin ice from very early on in his administration tenure. He was distrusted by long-time State Department employees, who viewed him as an outside interloper with little affinity for the organisation he headed. The president, initially enamoured with the brash Texan, quickly appeared to sour on his pick, as he frequently broke with the White House line on foreign policy. Reportedly calling the president a moron (intensified by a choice expletive) certainly didn't help, either. Mr Tillerson did manage to hang around through those earlier controversies, outliving earlier expectations that he would be gone by year's end. Those initial reports prompted Mr Trump to tweet in Mr Tillerson's defence, labelling speculation that Mr Tillerson was on the way out ""FAKE NEWS!"" ""While we disagree on certain subjects, (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again,"" the president wrote. This video can not be played From ""moron"" to ""castration"": a history of Trump v Tillerson bust-ups It turns out, as is often the case, there was truth behind those adamantly denied stories - including that CIA Director Mike Pompeo was a leading replacement candidate. Mr Tillerson ended up making it to March, but it was clear that this was a move some time in the making, given that Mr Pompeo is lined up to take over the reins at State and CIA Deputy Director Gina Haspel would be elevated to the agency's top job. Just last week, Mr Tillerson was in Africa (and waylaid by illness) while Mr Pompeo and other senior White House officials joined the president in the Oval Office for a key meeting with South Korean diplomats. By then, it had become clear that the secretary of state was decidedly on the margins. On Friday, according to the White House, Mr Tillerson was informed that his services would no longer be needed. That appears to have prompted the secretary of state to go out with at least a modest blaze of glory, departing one last time from the administration's talking points, by directing blame for the UK poison attack toward Russia. The fact that the secretary met with reporters in the plane with him on his flight back from that ill-fated Africa trip was a clue to the perceived urgency to get a statement out quickly. All evidence is that this was far from a cordial dismissal. According to a State Department deputy, the president never spoke directly to Mr Tillerson to explain why he was being let go and the secretary had wanted to remain on the job at Foggy Bottom. Mr Tillerson becomes the 20th time a member of Mr Trump's Cabinet has either resigned or been fired in the 13 months of his presidency. In addition, it caps a tumultuous few weeks for the administration, which has seen the announced departures of top economic advisor Gary Cohn, communications director Hope Hicks and White House staff secretary Rob Porter. This sets up a springtime confirmation fight to get Mr Pompeo and Ms Haspel formally seated in their jobs. Mr Pompeo has a reputation as a foreign policy hard-liner, vehemently opposed to the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal and a more vocal critic of Russia's efforts to disrupt the 2016 US presidential election than Mr Trump has been. This video can not be played Pompeo on Russia, North Korea and Trump Gina Haspel - first female CIA director nominee Mike Pompeo - Trump's loyalist new diplomat The White House revolving door: Who's gone? During his senate hearings, the secretary-designate is sure to be asked to elaborate on areas where he may stray from the administration's professed views on this matter. He probably will also be questioned about any pressure Mr Trump or other senior officials may have put on him to undermine FBI Director James Comey prior to his firing by Mr Trump last year. Ms Haspel's confirmation is also set to be a bumpy one, given that she was involved in the controversy surrounding the CIA's use of black sites and ""enhanced interrogation"" on suspected Islamic militants in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. With the 1 April resignation of Mississippi Republican Senator Thad Cochran, the Republican margin in the Senate will be reduced to one vote. If Democrats hold together, they could sink either nomination with the support of just one Republican. With this administration, there simply is no break from the drama.

"Women's leggings and mashed potato will now be used instead of pork pies and lager sold in nightclubs to help calculate the cost of living in the UK. The changes are part of the Office for National Statistics' (ONS) annual review of the basket of goods used to measure the UK's inflation rate. Quiche, action cameras and soft play sessions have also been added. The price movements of 700 goods and services are measured in 20,000 UK outlets to calculate inflation. The basket of goods reflects contemporary habits and technology to calculate the changing cost of living, as measured by the inflation rate. The ONS also aims to ensure that each sector is reflected adequately in the calculations. So, this year, a high chair has been introduced to represent nursery furniture, which has not been covered in the baskets since the removal of a cot in 1999. The exclusion of the pork pie is the result of rethinking the area of ""cooked pastry-based savoury snacks"", according to the ONS. The aim was to reflect the ""widening collection across a range of takeaway outlets"", rather than only pasties and pies in traditional fish and chip shops. Some items are replaced with updated versions, so mashed potato returns - although now it is chilled rather than dried - and a sit-upon wheeled toy replaces the traditional tricycle. Last year, speciality gin and children's scooters were among the items that went into the inflation basket, and menthol cigarettes and a child's swing were among those that were ejected.

"University staff are now threatening another 14 days of strike action University strikers have turned down an agreement reached by university union leaders and employers to end the pensions dispute. It means the strike will continue - with threats to disrupt final exams and assessments in the summer term. University staff rejected the deal as failing to address their concerns over threats to their pensions. The university strike is in its fourth week and has meant classes being cancelled in over 60 universities. It began over planned changes to the pension, which the University and College Union said could mean a Â£10,000 per year reduction in retirement income. But the dispute has also raised issues of wage stagnation, casualisation and high pay for vice chancellors. An agreement between the UCU and Universities UK, announced after days of negotiations, had offered a deal - but this failed to convince a meeting of university representatives on Tuesday. ""The strike action for this week remains on and we will now make detailed preparations for strikes over the assessment and exam period,"" said Sally Hunt, the leader of the University and College Union. ""We want urgent talks with the universities' representatives to try and find a way to get this dispute resolved."" University staff have been on strike over threats to their pensions The union has threatened a further 14 days of strikes, ""designed to hit the exam and assessment periods between April and June"". A Universities UK spokesman said: ""It is hugely disappointing that students' education will be further disrupted through continued strike action."" He said the deal had been jointly agreed by union and employers as a ""mutually acceptable way forward"". Solidarity on the PhD picket line University strike: How big is the pension black hole? Union and employers agree university pension deal Student protests held at Scottish universities The deal proposed temporary pension arrangements, with higher contributions from staff and universities, with talks to be re-opened on longer term ways to make the pension sustainable from 2020. There would also have been an independent re-evaluation of the pension scheme - after the union's challenge to University UK's claim of a Â£6.1bn projected deficit. But this agreement has been rejected by a meeting of the union's representatives - with warnings that it was ""completely unacceptable"" after weeks of strikes and loss of earnings. An open letter from staff opposing the deal had argued that it was only postponing long-term decisions about the pension scheme and called for industrial action to continue to ""force a more decisive victory"". Universities UK had warned vice chancellors that if the agreement was not accepted, the previous pensions proposal would be reinstated, with the ""likely outcome"" that there would be more strikes in April and May. The universities minister Sam Gyimah has called for students to be given refunds on fees for lost teaching time.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We are giving Russia until midnight to explain"" Russia will not co-operate with the UK inquiry into how an ex-spy and his daughter were poisoned until it has been given a sample of the substance used, its foreign minister has said. Sergei Lavrov's comments came as police appealed for witnesses who had seen the pair's red BMW car before the attack. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson hailed support from other countries. US President Donald Trump has said he would take Britain's assessment that Russia was behind the attack ""as fact"". Former double agent Mr Skripal, 66, and Yulia, 33, were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury city centre in Wiltshire on 4 March. Police said they remain critically ill in hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill responding to the incident, is in a serious but stable condition. Speaking outside New Scotland Yard, Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said 35 other people had been seen in hospital, of whom 34 had been assessed and discharged, while the condition of one person is being monitored. Russia has been given a midnight deadline by Prime Minister Theresa May to explain why a Russian-made nerve agent was used in the attack in Salisbury on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. But Mr Lavrov described claims of Russian involvement as ""rubbish"" and said it had been refused access to the nerve agent. The UK ambassador to Russia, Laurie Bristow, has met the Russian deputy foreign minister in Moscow. This video can not be played Theresa May: Spy poisoned by ""military-grade nerve agent"" Assistant Commissioner Basu revealed Miss Skripal had flown into Heathrow Airport on 3 March. He appealed for witnesses who saw the pair in her father's car - licence plate number HD09 WAO - between 13:00 and 13.45 GMT on the day of the poisoning. Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu updated reporters outside New Scotland Yard He said the police investigation will take ""many weeks"", with the ""prime focus"" being how the poison was administered. However, he said detectives were ""not declaring a person of interest or suspect at this time"". Police also confirmed Mr Skripal, who came to the UK in 2010 in a ""spy swap"" after he had been convicted by Russia of passing information to MI6, was a British citizen. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the investigation was ""going well"" after chairing another meeting of the government's emergencies committee Cobra. Sheannounced that MI5 and police are to look into claimsthat as many as 14 deaths on UK soil may be linked to Russia. Up to 14 other deaths to be re-examined for Russian links What we know so far Row over Corbyn's Russia spy response Mrs May told the Commons on Monday that the poison used in the attack was a military-grade nerve agent developed by Russia.  She said it was part ofa group of nerve agents known as Novichok. ""Either this was a direct action by the Russian state against our country, or the Russian government lost control of its potentially catastrophically damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others,"" she said. The PM warned that if there was no ""credible response"" by the end of Tuesday, the UK would conclude there has been an ""unlawful use of force"" by Moscow. Mr Trump said he would be speaking to Theresa May later, adding: ""It sounds to me they believe it was Russia based on all the evidence they have"". Answering a separate question by reporters, he added: ""As soon as we get the facts straight, if we agree with them, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be"". Former US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who spoke to Mr Johnson on the phone about the case on Mondaybefore he was sacked, had said the US supported the UK's assessment that Russia was likely responsible. Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said the UK was a ""highly valued ally"" and described the incident as ""of great concern"". He said the use of any nerve agent was ""horrendous and completely unacceptable"" and said Nato had been in touch with the UK authorities. He added: ""We agree that those responsible - both those who committed the crime and those who ordered it - must face appropriately serious consequences. ""We stand in solidarity with our allies in the United Kingdom and will continue to coordinate closely our responses."" German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said any Russian link would be a ""very serious matter"" and Berlin stood ""in solidarity"" with the UK. Mrs May also spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday and the two leaders ""agreed that it would be important to continue to act in concert with allies"" to address what it called ""the wide pattern of aggressive Russian behaviour"", her spokesman said. This video can not be played ""Get to the bottom of it"" - President Putin tells UK it is their responsibility European commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis was among a number of leading EU figures to express ""solidarity"" with the UK. He said: ""We are very much concerned with this situation - also with the findings the UK has so far."" Mrs May said the UK must ""stand ready to take much more extensive measures"" against Russia than it had previously. She said these measures would be set out in the Commons on Wednesday should there be no adequate explanation from Russia. Britain could expel Russian diplomats, as it did after the poisoning of former Russian Federal Security Service operative Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 with radioactive polonium. But many argue that this, and the other measures that were taken after that killing - including visa restrictions on Russian officials - did not go far enough. So what else could the UK do?

"The Treasury could be paving the way for the end of 1p and 2p coins as it seeks views on the future of cash. It is inviting comments on the mix of coins in circulation as consumers move to non-cash payments such as contactless and digital spending. Ministers say there are no current plans to scrap them. But the consultation hints at the growing cost of handling these coins. It also questions the validity of the Â£50 note. Many countries - including Canada, the home of the current Bank of England governor Mark Carney - have ditched their low denomination coins. Australia, Brazil, and Sweden are among many others to do so. The document points to surveys that suggest six in 10 of UK 1p and 2p coins are only used once before being saved in a jar or discarded. In one in 12 of these cases, the coins are thrown in the bin. ""From an economic perspective, having large numbers of denominations that are not in demand, saved by the public, or in long-term storage at cash processors rather than used in circulation does not contribute to an efficient or cost effective cash cycle,"" theTreasury consultation document,externalsays. Pretty penny: considerable sum of money Penny dropped: something was finally understood Penny-dreadful: a cheap, often lurid, book or magazine Penny-pinching: miserly Penny-wise: Careful and thrifty in small matters Source: Collins English Dictionary Penny chews are generally more expensive nowadays Previously, the government and the Royal Mint have needed to produce more than 500 million 1p and 2p coins each year to replace those falling out of circulation. However, the coins are now being used less often and being held in greater numbers by coin processing businesses, as consumers move to non-cash payments. The penny coin: Should we follow Ireland and phase it out? Carney calls for crackdown on crypto-currency 'mania' The value of the 1p coin has also been reduced by inflation so, in effect, the 1p coin is now worth less than the halfpenny when it was abolished in 1984. The 1p coin is legal tender for amounts up to 20p, so it is not permitted to pay debts with a sack full of pennies. The document also questions the need for the Â£50 note, which it suggests is rarely used for purchases. However, there is significant demand from overseas for these notes, where they are saved alongside dollars and euros. ""There is also a perception among some that Â£50 notes are used for money laundering, hidden economy activity, and tax evasion,"" it says. Despite seeking views on the future of cash, the Treasury says that coins still have a vital future in the UK. Research suggests that 2.7 million people in the UK are entirely reliant on cash. ""The government is committed to ensuring that the public's cash needs continue to be met,"" the document says. Have voters changed their minds about Brexit?

"This video can not be played Claims about Trump 'dangerous and false', says ex-CIA director Mike Pompeo was a hardline Republican congressman before President Donald Trump appointed him to direct the CIA and later to lead the US Department of State. The former Tea Party representative from Kansas was handpicked by Mr Trump to be the top US diplomat after he fired former state department chief Rex Tillerson. Hours before Mr Trump announced that he would meet the leader of North Korea, Mr Pompeo was seen in the Oval Office with Mr Trump during a meeting with a South Korean delegation at the White House. In April it was revealed that Mr Pompeo had secretly travelled to Pyongyang over the Easter holiday to meet North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. Mr Pompeo is seen as a Trump loyalist who performed a delicate balancing act at the CIA in managing frayed relations between the spy agency and a commander-in-chief who compared America's intelligence services to Nazis. He has in the past played down findings by the CIA that the Russians attempted to influence last year's US election. But when push comes to shove, he has shown a willingness to contradict the president on the issue. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? After Mr Trump said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin's denials, Mr Pompeo firmly stood by US assessments of Moscow's alleged meddling. Mr Pompeo is seen as more hawkish on the Kremlin than the president, and has previously warned that President Putin is a dangerous leader. This video can not be played Pompeo on Russia, North Korea and Trump During his time in Congress, the 53-year-old former-three-term Republican from Wichita, Kansas, was a vehement critic of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran. He has previously defended the National Security Agency's bulk data collection programme and opposes shutting the prison at Guantanamo Bay. What does the future hold for Guantanamo? After visiting the detention facility in 2013, he remarked that some inmates who had declared a hunger strike looked like they had put on weight. Mr Pompeo also defended the CIA after the 2014 release of a Senate report on torture, which detailed such practices as waterboarding. He declared: ""These men and women are not torturers, they are patriots."" The CIA tactics, he said, ""were within the law, within the constitution"". Mr Pompeo opposes shutting the prison at Guantanamo Bay Mr Pompeo graduated first in his class at West Point and graduated from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of its Law Review. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 with the support of the Republican mega-donors Charles and David Koch. Mr Pompeo became a member of the House intelligence committee and its energy and commerce panel. Before joining Congress, he founded an aviation parts firm and an oilfield supply company. He was accused of Islamophobia for remarks he made following the deadly 2013 Boston marathon bombing. Mr Pompeo had taken to the House floor to suggest some Islamic faith leaders might be tacitly encouraging terrorist attacks. ""When the most devastating terrorist attacks on America in the last 20 years come overwhelmingly from people of a single faith and are performed in the name of that faith a special obligation falls on those that are the leaders of that faith,"" he said. ""Instead of responding, silence has made these Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts and, more importantly still, in those that may well follow."" Mike Pompeo is sworn in as CIA director by Vice President Mike Pence (R) While he was a congressional candidate in 2010, one of his campaign aides sent a tweet linking to an article that labelled his Indian-American Democratic opponent Raj Goyle a ""turban topper"". Mr Pompeo apologised, though his campaign also sent out billboard ads urging everyone to ""vote American"". He also served on the House Select Benghazi Committee, a special panel created in 2014 to investigate the deadly attack two years earlier on a US diplomatic compound in Libya. Democrats described it as a political witch-hunt against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mr Pompeo released a report afterwards accusing her of intentionally misleading Americans about the nature of the attack to help President Barack Obama's re-election bid.

"University staff are now threatening another 14 days of strike action University strikers have turned down an agreement reached by university union leaders and employers to end the pensions dispute. It means the strike will continue - with threats to disrupt final exams and assessments in the summer term. University staff rejected the deal as failing to address their concerns over threats to their pensions. The university strike is in its fourth week and has meant classes being cancelled in over 60 universities. It began over planned changes to the pension, which the University and College Union said could mean a Â£10,000 per year reduction in retirement income. But the dispute has also raised issues of wage stagnation, casualisation and high pay for vice chancellors. An agreement between the UCU and Universities UK, announced after days of negotiations, had offered a deal - but this failed to convince a meeting of university representatives on Tuesday. ""The strike action for this week remains on and we will now make detailed preparations for strikes over the assessment and exam period,"" said Sally Hunt, the leader of the University and College Union. ""We want urgent talks with the universities' representatives to try and find a way to get this dispute resolved."" University staff have been on strike over threats to their pensions The union has threatened a further 14 days of strikes, ""designed to hit the exam and assessment periods between April and June"". A Universities UK spokesman said: ""It is hugely disappointing that students' education will be further disrupted through continued strike action."" He said the deal had been jointly agreed by union and employers as a ""mutually acceptable way forward"". Solidarity on the PhD picket line University strike: How big is the pension black hole? Union and employers agree university pension deal Student protests held at Scottish universities The deal proposed temporary pension arrangements, with higher contributions from staff and universities, with talks to be re-opened on longer term ways to make the pension sustainable from 2020. There would also have been an independent re-evaluation of the pension scheme - after the union's challenge to University UK's claim of a Â£6.1bn projected deficit. But this agreement has been rejected by a meeting of the union's representatives - with warnings that it was ""completely unacceptable"" after weeks of strikes and loss of earnings. An open letter from staff opposing the deal had argued that it was only postponing long-term decisions about the pension scheme and called for industrial action to continue to ""force a more decisive victory"". Universities UK had warned vice chancellors that if the agreement was not accepted, the previous pensions proposal would be reinstated, with the ""likely outcome"" that there would be more strikes in April and May. The universities minister Sam Gyimah has called for students to be given refunds on fees for lost teaching time.

"This video can not be played 'We want you to know change can happen' Survivors and relatives of the Dunblane tragedy have sent a message of support to students affected by the Parkland school shooting in Florida. A letter was sent to Marjory Stoneman Douglas School on the 22nd anniversary of the Dunblane murders. Ten family members of victims and survivorsalso recorded a video message,externalentitled Dunblane Stands With Parkland. Students at the US school have demanded tougher gun laws after17 people were killedin the attack on 14 February. In the message,first published on Buzzfeed News,external, the Dunblane families offered their ""total support"". Jack Crozier, the brother of 5-year-old Emma who was killed in the tragedy, features in the video. He told BBC Scotland the latest US shooting felt different. He said: ""This felt quite different because the reaction afterwards wasn't the same. ""It wasn't the parents and lawmakers speaking out, it is the students who are standing up for themselves this time. ""And the parallels were so apparent - 17 lost at Parkland and 17 lost at Dunblane - it just really struck home and we felt that this time we really had to show support."" Speaking to the BBC, Jack Crozier said the young people of Dunblane are bringing a positive message to the issue of gun control Mr Crozier said he thinks the younger generation in Dunblane is now ready to take on the responsibility for campaigning from their parents. He said: ""I was two years old when Dunblane happened. It was my parents and the parents of the rest of the people involved in Dunblane that campaigned 20 years ago. ""Now it's the young people in America that are standing up and it's the young people in Dunblane that are saying 'we support you', as well as all the parents. ""I've not got the baggage of the campaigns from previous years and the difficult times they all had to go through. ""I've just got the optimism and that's what we hope can shine through."" The video's contributors also include Pamela, Andrew, and Alison Ross, the mother, brother and sister of five-year-old Joanna Ross, one of the children murdered in Dunblane. Dunblane remains the deadliest firearms atrocity ever committed in the UK The message says: ""We have watched and listened with tremendous admiration as you have spoken out for what you believe should happen now, a significant change of attitude towards the availability of guns in your country."" Thomas Hamilton shot and killed 16 children and their teacher in Dunblane Primary School, before turning the gun on himself on 13 March 1996. It remains the deadliest firearms atrocity ever committed in the UK. Students were evacuated following the Parkland school shooting The letter says: ""The gunman owned his four handguns legally, and we knew it had been too easy for him to arm himself with lethal weapons. ""Like you we vowed to do something about it. ""We persuaded British lawmakers not to be swayed by the vested interests of the gun lobby, we asked them to put public safety first and to heed what the majority of the British people wanted. ""Most politicians listened and acted. ""Laws were changed, handguns were banned and the level of gun violence in Britain is now one of the lowest in the world. ""There have been no more school shootings."" Gunman Nikolas Cruz entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and killed 17 students in seven minutes. Two days later, survivor Cameron Kasky became the first person to use the hashtag #NeverAgain on Twitter. A demonstration called March For Our Liveswill take place on 24 March in Washington DC, in which students, including those from Parkland, will demand an end to gun violence in schools. The Dunblane families' message said: ""We want you to know that change can happen. ""It won't be easy, but continue to remind everyone of exactly what happened at your school and of the devastation caused by just one person with one legally-owned gun. ""Tonight we will be lighting 17 candles for those who died in Dunblane and will be remembering the 17 who lost their lives in Parkland. ""Our thoughts will also be with every other victim of gun violence. ""We offer you our total support for the March for Our Lives and sincerely hope you achieve success. It can be done. #NeverAgain.""

"Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh UN investigators have said the use of Facebook played a ""determining role"" in stirring up hatred against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. One of the team probingallegations of genocide in Myanmar,externalsaid Facebook had ""turned into a beast."" About 700,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since Myanmar's military launched an operation in August against ""insurgents"" in Rakhine state. Facebook has said there is ""no place for hate speech"" on its platform. ""We take this incredibly seriously and have worked with experts in Myanmar for several years to develop safety resources and counter-speech campaigns,"" a Facebook spokeswoman told the BBC. ""This work includes a dedicatedSafety Page for Myanmar,external, a locally illustrated version of our Community Standards, and regular training sessions for civil society and local community groups across the country. ""Of course, there is always more we can do and we will continue to work with local experts to help keep our community safe."" The UN's Fact-finding Mission on Myanmar announced the interim findings of its investigation on Monday. During a press conference the chairman of the mission, Marzuki Darusman, said that social media had ""substantively contributed to the level of acrimony"" amongst the wider public, against Rohingya Muslims. ""Hate speech is certainly, of course, a part of that,"" he added. ""As far as the Myanmar situation is concerned, social media is Facebook and Facebook is social media."" A colleague acknowledged that the service had helped people in the country communicate with each other. Yanghee Lee said that Facebook had ""turned into a beast"" But Yanghee Lee, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, added: ""We know that the ultra-nationalist Buddhists have their own Facebooks and are really inciting a lot of violence and a lot of hatred against the Rohingya or other ethnic minorities. ""I'm afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it originally intended."" Myanmar 'militarising' Rohingya villages in Rakhine UN envoy says refugees facing 'forced starvation' Rohingya villages destroyed 'to erase evidence' The interim report is based on more than 600 interviews with human rights abuse victims and witnesses, which were carried out in Bangladesh, Malaysia and Thailand. In addition the team has analysed satellite imagery, photographs and video footage taken within Myanmar. This photo, taken in October 2017, shows burnt villages in Northern Rakhine State ""People died from gunshot wounds, often due to indiscriminate shooting at fleeing villagers,"" the report said. ""Some were burned alive in their homes - often the elderly, disabled and young children. Others were hacked to death."" The government of Myanmar has previously said the UN needs to provide ""clear evidence"" to support allegations of crimes against Rohingya. Officials have claimed that ""clearance operations"" against militants responsible for attacks on police stations ended in September,but that has been disputed. Refugees and human rights organisations, including Amnesty International,have accused the military,externalof carrying out executions, rapes and the burning and bulldozing of hundreds of villages. The UN has said that the government has attempted to block its efforts to carry out an independent investigation. Facebook has previously discussed the problems it has faced trying to tackle hate speech in the country. Last July, itgave the example of policing use,externalof the word ""kalar"", which it said could be used both innocuously and as a slur against Muslims. ""We looked at the way the word's use was evolving, and decided our policy should be to remove it as hate speech when used to attack a person or group, but not in the other harmless use cases,"" it explained. ""We've had trouble enforcing this policy correctly recently, mainly due to the challenges of understanding the context; after further examination, we've been able to get it right. But we expect this to be a long-term challenge."" A final report from the UN team is due to be published in September.

"This video can not be played Victim: I will do whatever it takes to keep Worboys behind bars The Parole Board failed to consider ""critical evidence"" against rapist John Worboys before approving his prison release, a lawyer for two of his victims has told the High Court. The lawyer said the evidence related to ""wider allegations"" of sexual attacks. Police believe that Worboys - jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women in London - had more than 100 victims. Lawyer Phillippa Kaufmann QC said the board was wrong to decide Worboys took ""full responsibility"" for his crimes. Worboys is thought to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in the capital between 2002 and 2008. The 60-year-old, who has changed his name to John Radford, is watching the trial via video link from prison. The court heard he denies any allegation other than the offences he was convicted of. Legal papers submitted to the High Court show that as recently as September last year, the prison authorities believed he posed such a risk that he needed to remain in a Category A prison. Three months later the Parole Board decided that he should be let out with stringent licence conditions, without having been assessed at a less secure prison. Ms Kaufmann said this ""highly exceptional step"" was ""in the face of opposition"" from senior prison managers, prison psychologists, the probation service and the justice secretary. John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women Ms Kaufmann said the claims of Worboys' further crimes ""completely undermined"" the board's decision. She told the court: ""It is obvious, absolutely obvious, that this evidence of wider offending had a central bearing on all of those conclusions that formed the basis of the Parole Board's conclusion that there had been a reduction in risk."" Ms Kaufmann added it would have been fair to consider these allegations as the board did not have to determine whether he had actually committed the crimes. She said it would be ""extraordinary"" to release Worboys straight from a Category A prison, the highest security prison, into the community. At last, the cloak of secrecy surrounding the Parole Board's decision-making in this case has been lifted. Thanks to the judicial review challenge the public, and John Worboys' victims, can find out why the Board ruled it was safe to release him. Its decision was apparently influenced by assessments from three independent psychologists all of whom at some stage had been instructed by Worboys. One expert initially recommended he be moved from HMP Wakefield, a high security jail, to an 'open' prison, which allows inmates more freedom. That's the usual route to eventual release, taken by those serving life or indeterminate sentences. It enables the authorities to test whether prisoners can be trusted in a less secure environment where they're allowed to spend time working in the community. But the psychologist later changed their view and agreed with two other psychologists that the 60-year-old sex offender should be let out straight away - direct from Wakefield jail. To be released from a Category A prison, the court heard, is ""very unusual"".  Nevertheless,  their advice was accepted by the three-member parole panel, resulting in this landmark legal challenge. Ahead of the High Court challenge against the decision to grant him parole, victims said they were not properly informed and warned of risks to women's safety. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has also launched a judicial review against the action to free the former black-cab driver. During the High Court challenge, three judges are hearing evidence over two days from victims and Mr Khan. As the case got under way, Mr Khan said in a statement that Worboys presented a ""significant threat"" to safety. He said: ""I have been clear that he shouldn't be released at the very least until the decision has been properly independently scrutinised and we are reassured that those in positions of power and responsibility are doing everything they can to keep all his victims, and the rest of us, safe."" The Sun newspaper is also part of the legal challenge, after it was granted permission last month to challenge the Parole Board over not publishing its decision. The Parole Boardhas previously apologised to victimswho were not told about the decision but said it was ""confident"" Worboys would not re-offend. The case continues.

"This video can not be played In October, Rex Tillerson responded to a report he called Mr Trump 'a moron' It was no secret in Washington that former US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and President Donald Trump had a difficult working relationship before Mr Trump fired him. In October, Mr Trump criticised the former ExxonMobil executive's efforts to open a dialogue with North Korea, telling him in a tweet that he was ""wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man"". That same month, Mr Tillerson took the remarkable step of holding a press conferenceat the Department of State to deny that he had threatened to quit. But Mr Tillerson notably did not deny reports he had referred to the president as a ""moron"". A week later,Mr Trump publicly predicted he would beat Mr Tillerson in an IQ test. The end of their working relationship, five months later, came abruptly. A day after the Texan cut short a trip to Africa, Mr Trump announced in a tweet that CIA director Mike Pompeo was now America's top diplomat. When Mr Trump nominated Mr Tillerson to head up the Department of State in December 2016, he was effusive in his praise, calling him ""one of the truly great business leaders of the world"". And while the two were careful not to criticise each other publicly, reports soon emerged that they did not see eye to eye. According to media reports, Mr Tillerson believed the president struggled to grasp the basics of foreign policy. Mr Trump, meanwhile, is reported to have been irritated by his chief diplomat's body language in meetings. Mr Tillerson was said to roll his eyes or slouch when he disagreed with his ex-boss' decisions, the New York Times reported. This video can not be played Tillerson faced a grilling from senators before taking up the post During his tenure in Washington, he presided over an unprecedented departure of career US diplomats from the state department. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who served from 1997 to 2001, said that diplomats were leaving at ""dizzying speed"", adding that the vacancies created a US ""national security emergency"". Mr Tillerson defended the departures, saying they were part of his plan to ""reorganise"" the agency, and part of the president's campaign promise to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington bureaucracy. He has pointed to the department's ""reorganisation"" - critics call it ""downsizing"" - as one his most significant achievements in office. The 65-year-old spent his entire career working for the world's most valuable publicly traded oil company, ExxonMobil. He worked his way up to chief executive and later became president of the Boy Scouts of America, during which time the organisation decided to allow gay members to join for the first time. Mr Tillerson was all set for retirement when President Trump tapped him up for one of his new administration's top roles. His nomination came amid revelations that US intelligence agencies suspected Russia of covertly attempting to influence last year's US election. At his confirmation hearing, Mr Tillerson's own links to Moscow, which awarded him the Russian Order of Friendship in 2013, were raked over by senators. During his time at Exxon, he had forged multibillion-dollar deals with Russia's state oil company, Rosneft. Mr Tillerson was also known to be friendly with Igor Sechin, Rosneft's executive chairman, who was formerly Mr Putin's deputy prime minister. Mr Tillerson in his ExxonMobil days (L) with Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) The Texan oilman was narrowly approved for the state department role, with only a handful of Democrats crossing party lines to back him. On the eve of his first state trip to Moscow, Mr Tillerson was notably critical of the Kremlin's role in Syria. But he also publicly spoke out against international sanctions that were placed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea. Mr Tillerson also kept the state department's press corps at arm's length. On his first official visit to Asia in March 2017, he allowed only one reporter from a conservative website to accompany him. ""I'm not a big media press access person,"" Mr Tillerson told the correspondent. ""I personally don't need it."" The married father-of-four - worth a reported $325m - can now enjoy a cosy retirement on his Texan horse farm.

"A new millennial railcard has sold out despite strong demand crashing the website on the first day of sales. The National Railcards website apologised for the problems and said ""we will consider carefully"" the high demand when more cards are issued. The railcard for 26 to 30-year-olds cost Â£30 and offers a third off most fares in England, Wales and Scotland. Only 10,000 cards were released on Tuesday under a trial, but big demand caused website problems for hours. A spokeswoman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the train companies and Network Rail, said: ""This morning, when the 26-30 railcard trial began, the National Railcard website was receiving 12 times the normal number of visitors. We were prepared for demand to be similar to that of previous trial launches. ""Due to the unprecedented demand we have been working with our suppliers throughout the morning to further increase the capacity on the website to create a better experience for our customers. We recommend that customers continue trying the National Railcard website, and keep an eye on @_Railcards Twitter and Facebook pages for updates."" Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond says economic growth forecasts have been revised. Chancellor Philip Hammond has unveiled upgraded projections for growth and predicted falling inflation and borrowing in his Spring Statement. He claimed the UK economy had reached a turning point and there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"". He ruled out an immediate end to austerity but hinted at possible spending rises in the future. Labour accused him of ""astounding complacency"" in the face of the worst ever public sector funding crisis. The chancellor resisted calls from Labour and some Tories to use the extra cash from an unexpected boost in tax receipts to ease the spending squeeze. But he said he would ""set an overall path for public spending for 2020 and beyond"" in his Autumn budget, with a detailed spending review in 2019. Labour: Hammond's 'astounding complacency' Reality Check: Is the chancellor right that debt is shrinking? At-a-glance: The key points The chancellor told MPs growth was forecast to be 1.5% this year, up from 1.4% forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in November, with the forecast for 2019 and 2020 unchanged at 1.3%. In his 26 minute statement he also said debt would be falling as a share of GDP from 2018-19, which would be the start of ""the first sustained fall in debt for 17 years, a turning point in the nation's recovery from the financial crisis of a decade ago"". Mr Hammond told MPs: ""That's the OBR's forecast, Mr Speaker, but forecasts are there to be beaten."" OBR chief Robert Chote said: ""Overall the referendum vote does seem to have weakened the economy as we and most other forecasters expected, but not quite as much as we forecast back in November 2016. ""Having said all this, we are still dealing with the very early drafts of economic history and it's important not to put too much weight on what are still early indicators of economic activity either side of the Brexit vote."" He said the UK was borrowing less than forecast this year thanks to more tax coming in from self-employed workers - revenues are Â£2.9bn higher than predicted. But he added: ""We don't expect much of that good news to push forward into future years."" Ahead of Mr Hammond's statement, the OECD said the UK economy will grow at a slower pace than any other major advanced or emerging nation this year, as it raised its growth forecast to 1.3% in 2018. Reality Check: Is the chancellor right that debt is shrinking? Why is chancellor so bullish about economy? The OBR has calculated that the UK will continue to pay contributions into the EU budget until 2064 - 45 years after the official date of Brexit - with the total ""withdrawal bill"" amounting to Â£37.1bn. The main reason for this is that the government will have an on-going liability for a proportion of EU staff's pensions earned while the UK was a member. Mr Hammond did not have much to say about Brexit in his statement - prompting opposition claims that he knew there would be no ""Brexit dividend"" for the UK economy. Mr Hammond said: ""Our economy does still face uncertainty as we go through the negotiation process with the European Union."" But he added that business confidence would improve as the government delivered ""greater clarity"" about its Brexit plans, adding: ""We beat the forecast in 2017, let's beat it again in 2018."" Reality Check: Brexit cash allocated to departments This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg interviews Philip Hammond Philip Hammond gave the clearest hint yet that he is prepared to increase spending on health, in an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg. The chancellor said he recognises the pressures for more spending in the NHS, local government ""and other areas"" and he hoped the improvement in the public finances ""hinted"" at by the OBR would allow him to increase spending in his Autumn budget. He acknowledged a ""continuous upward pressure"" on NHS spending because of an ageing population and developments in care. Kuenssberg: Hammond looks to next election Hammond's tough hand - Kamal Ahmed Hammond: I recognise pressures on NHS Mr Hammond did not use his Spring Statement as a ""mini-Budget"" as in previous years, and instead unveiled a series of consultations on future policies, including: A reduction in tax on for the least polluting vans to ""help the great British white van driver go green"" A possible tax onsingle use plastic A new'tech tax'looking at how firms like Google and Facebook are taxed A call for evidence ""on whether the use of non-agricultural red diesel tax relief contributes to poor air quality in urban areas"" The future of cash and digital payments, whichcould spell the end for 1p and 2p coins He also said the next revaluation for business rates is being brought forward to 2021, after which the government will move to revaluations every three years and there will be an additional Â£1.7bn to deliver 26,000 affordable homes in London. This video can not be played Speech in full: Hammond sees ""light at the end of tunnel"" This video can not be played Response in full: McDonnell on ""astounding complacency"" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""Does the chancellor really believe the NHS can wait another eight months for the lifesaving funds it needs? How many people have to die waiting in an ambulance before he acts?"" Mr McDonnell also raised concerns over funding for schools, the emergency services and local councils. He said ""austerity was a political choice not an economic necessity"", adding: ""We were never all in this together as they claimed."" The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said: ""The light at the end of the tunnel is a hard Brexit, which is going to cost jobs and prosperity in the this country."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said ""Brexit was dragging the economy down"" and the chancellor had been right not to turn on the public spending taps because there was still ""very little freedom"" in the public finances. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas tweeted: ""Tories celebrate a tiny improvement in growth in today's #SpringStatement, but GDP isn't a real measure of our society. True indicators are people being treated in hospital corridors & foodbank use shooting up. Our economy is designed to fail people - and it needs an overhaul."" Mr Hammond accused Labour of talking the economy down, comparing them to the gloomy character from Winnie the Pooh he has himself been likened to in the past. ""If there are any Eeyores in the chamber they are over there. I meanwhile am at my most positively Tiggerlike today, as I contemplate a country which faces the future with unique strengths."" Labour's shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne joked on Twitter that Mr Hammond was ""talking Pooh"".

"This video can not be played From ""moron"" to ""castration"": a history of Trump v Tillerson bust-ups US President Donald Trump has fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson via Twitter, naming CIA Director Mike Pompeo as his replacement. Mr Tillerson's spokesman said he only learned he was out of a job when he saw the president's tweet thanking him for his service as top US diplomat. The former ExxonMobil chief had a series of public rifts with the White House since he was appointed last year. Mr Trump also named Gina Haspel to become the CIA's first female director. Where it went wrong for Rex Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Tuesday, Mr Trump said his differences with Mr Tillerson came down to personal ""chemistry"". ""We got along actually quite well, but we disagreed on things,"" said the president. ""When you look at the Iran deal, I think it's terrible. I guess he thought it was OK. ""I wanted to either break it or do something and he felt a little bit differently, so we were not really thinking the same.

The Department of State said Mr Tillerson had not spoken to the president and was ""unaware of the reason"" for his firing. Under Secretary Steve Goldstein said: ""The Secretary had every intention of staying because of the critical progress made in national security."" Mr Goldstein himself was fired later on Tuesday by the White House. Mr Tillerson said later in a news conference that he had received a call from the president on Air Force One after midday, about three hours after Mr Trump fired him via tweet. He added he would finish his term on 31 March and would ""return to private life as a private citizen"". According to the Associated Press, White House chief of staff John Kelly called Mr Tillerson on Friday and advised him to watch out for a presidential tweet about him. Mr Kelly did not tell Mr Tillerson when the tweet would be posted or what it might say, reports the news agency. The secretary of state was on an official tour of Africa last week when he was caught unawares by Mr Trump's agreement to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The top US diplomat's team said he was feeling unwell on Saturday and later in the weekend the state department said he would cut short his tour by a day. ""I felt like, look, I just need to get back,"" Mr Tillerson told reporters on his plane home, reports the Washington Post. The 65-year-old arrived back in Washington before dawn on Tuesday to learn he was out of a job a few hours later. Rex Tillerson - Trump's former top diplomat Reaction to his firing Analysis byJon Sopel, BBCNorth America editor The end was a perfect metaphor for the relationship. The odd couple of politics had been yoked together for too long. Men of different temperaments, demeanour and style had reached a parting of the ways. The secretary of state landed back at Joint Base Andrews to have a member of staff inform him that the president had tweeted. Because Mr Tillerson is not on Twitter, the tweet had to be printed out. Fancy being the one tasked with handing that over to the boss. Fired by a tweet. The career of a one-time giant of corporate America had come to an ignominious end. Read Jon's analysis in full This video can not be played Mike Pompeo: Meet America's new top diplomat A US Senate report found that Ms Haspel ran a notorious CIA prison in Thailand, where prisoners were waterboarded in 2002. The CIA deputy director was also accused of destroying dozens of videotapes of interrogations at the camp. Gina Haspel - first female CIA director nominee Mr Pompeo is a former hardline conservative Republican lawmaker from Kansas and a Trump loyalist. In 2014, he defended the CIA officers who waterboarded detainees as ""patriots"". Mike Pompeo - Trump's loyalist new diplomat Both the new secretary of state and CIA director will have to be confirmed by the Senate. Reports had swirled since last year of a schism in the Trump administration between the commander-in-chief and his top diplomat. Last October Mr Tillerson was forced to convene a news conference to deny claims he planned to quit, though he did not address a report that he had referred to his boss as a moron after a Pentagon meeting.

In December, the secretary of state departed from administration talking points when he offered to begin direct talks with Pyongyang without preconditions. Battles ahead after another sacking from Trump Cabinet The White House - which insisted North Korea must first accept any negotiations would be about giving up its nuclear arsenal - distanced itself from his remarks. Mr Tillerson was reported to be astonished at how little Mr Trump grasped the basics of foreign policy. The Republican president, meanwhile, was irritated by Mr Tillerson's body language during meetings, the New York Times reported.

There was plenty of news for US investors to digest. It didn't all go down well. In particular news of Rex Tillerson's departure as Secretary of State and his replacement with Mike Pompeo whose views are closer to President Trump's on matters such as the Iran nuclear deal. At the end of the trading day in the US the Dow Jones Index was 0.68% or 172 points lower at 25,006.68. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.64% or 17 points to 2,765.31. The Nasdaq ended the day 1.02% down or 77 points lower at 7,511.01. The dollar fell against most currencies but gained marginally against the yen, rising 0.1% to 106.51. Shane Smith, co-founder of Vice, is moving aside Vice Media, where executives last year apologised for creating a ""boys club"" culture, will be led by a woman. Vice co-founder Shane Smith is stepping down as chief executive. He will be replaced by Nancy Dubuc, who most recently led A&E Networks. Mr Smith will remain with the company as executive chairman. Vice last year was the subject of a New York Times investigation about sexual harassment. The companyhas also missed,externalkey financial targets. The justification for paying actors different amounts largely boils down to how high profile the actor is and Matt Smith's turn as the eleventh Doctor Who made him a bit of a box office draw. But in part it's also down to how much they've earned on previous projects. It's somethingVanity Fair looked into recently,external. Now though there's a new law in California banning employers from asking potential employees about their previous levels of pay in an effort to close the gender-wage gap. Tune in to see how that resolves. As we wait to see what measures the UK government opts for in response to the poisoning in Salisbury last weekend, critics of Russia are pushing for them to take a tough stance. Foremost among them is American financier Bill Browder, who ran a business in Russia for ten years but fell foul of the authorities. He's been speaking to BBC World Service. Allow Twitter content?

Rex Tillerson's replacement as Secretary of State is being blamed for a slide in the dollar today. The dollar's fallen 0.4 cents against the euro- a fall of 0.51%. One dollar buys 0.8065 euros. It fell a similar amount against sterling to Â£0.7156. Claire Foy was paidan estimated,external$40,000 per episode for playing Queen Elizabeth. But Matt Smith was paid more as Prince Philip. The Crown isn't a series produced on a shoestring budget. It had a budget of $7m per episode, according to Vanity Fair. We don't know how much of a pay rise ""the Queen"" will see, now they've been called out over the discrepancy. But it won't be Foy who benefits. Because the upcoming third series jumps forward in time to the 1970s they're casting a slightly older actor to play the Queen: Olivia Coleman.  A Tigger moment you might have missedfrom the OBR forecast,external. Explaining why there might be increases in productivity over the next five years, it cites the expected rise in interest rates. Why do higher interest rates boost productivity? Because they will force the less productive firms, which the OBR calls ""zombie firms"", out of business. That's cheerful isn't it? It turns out the Queen could do with a pay rise. Well, the actress who plays the Queen in Netflix's popular series The Crown at any rate. Variety Magazine has just discovered that Claire Foy was paid less than her co-star Matt Smith (playing Prince Philip). âThe producers acknowledged that [Smith] did make more due to his Doctor Who fame, but that they would rectify that for the future,âVarietyreported,external. âGoing forward, no one gets paid more than the Queen,â creative director Suzanne Mackie said.  CNBC contributor Larry Kudlow President Trump has told reporters Larry Kudlow has ""a very good chance"" at becoming the next head of his National Economic Council, the position just vacated by Gary Cohn. Mr Kudlow - a contributor on the CNBC business channel - has acted as an informal adviser to Mr Trump during the election campaign. He is a more orthodox Republican than the president; like Cohn he opposed recent steel and aluminium tariffs. But Mr Trump says he can overlook this. ""Larry has been a friend of mine for a long time,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. ""He
backed me very early in the campaign; I think the earliest."" Can this be right? The government's paper which is looking at whether to scrap 1p and 2p coins says: ""Surveys suggest that six in ten 1p and 2p coins are used in a transaction once before they leave the cash cycle. ""They are either saved, or in 8 per cent of cases are thrown away."" Probably not even into the recycling. And then you've got to keep minting more to replace them. Allow Twitter content?

"The chancellor said he was feeling very Tiggerish. And that it was the ""Eeyores of Labour"" who were talking down Britain. But Philip Hammond knows he has a difficult hand to play. Yes, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) did upgrade growth for this year. Global growth is better (which helps the UK, an exporting nation), manufacturing is doing well and exports are strong. But the upgrade was modest. And it suggested that growth will not move above 1.5% over the forecast period, that's until 2022. That is below trend growth of 2% and shows just how difficult a position the economy is in. The OBR actually slightly downgraded growth for 2021 and 2022. Adding to the sense that whatever lights there may be, the ""new normal"" of growth is below where it used to be - the economic speed limit of the economy has fallen. Why is the chancellor so bullish about the economy? Spring Statement - reaction Which raises significant questions about the funding of public services and paying off the national debt. The slower a country's economy grows, the less tax revenue it creates and less income a government has. Which is why, although there was an improvement in the borrowing figures today compared with the grim forecast of last November, again it was modest. And at Â£45.2bn total net borrowing for 2017-18, is still well above where it was expected to be back in 2016. There is good news today. Employment is high, and the OBR said that inflation would fall back to the Bank of England target of 2% by the end of the year. The chancellor said that meant incomes would start rising in real terms by the first three months of next year. That will be an important moment, as the squeeze on incomes is the way millions of people experience the real economy. Mr Hammond opened the door to possible increases in spending on public services such as health and defence in the Budget later in the year. But it was only a crack, given that growth is still struggling. A situation that does not look like changing any time soon. UK economy at turning point - Hammond Why is the chancellor so upbeat?

"A new millennial railcard has sold out despite strong demand crashing the website on the first day of sales. The National Railcards website apologised for the problems and said ""we will consider carefully"" the high demand when more cards are issued. The railcard for 26 to 30-year-olds cost Â£30 and offers a third off most fares in England, Wales and Scotland. Only 10,000 cards were released on Tuesday under a trial, but big demand caused website problems for hours. A spokeswoman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the train companies and Network Rail, said: ""This morning, when the 26-30 railcard trial began, the National Railcard website was receiving 12 times the normal number of visitors. We were prepared for demand to be similar to that of previous trial launches. ""Due to the unprecedented demand we have been working with our suppliers throughout the morning to further increase the capacity on the website to create a better experience for our customers. We recommend that customers continue trying the National Railcard website, and keep an eye on @_Railcards Twitter and Facebook pages for updates."" Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Labour MP: Suspicious package 'part of a pattern' Police are investigating after suspect packages containing anti-Muslim letters and a sticky liquid were sent to four Labour MPs over the past 24 hours. Their Westminster offices were sealed off and three people were taken to hospital as a precaution. The substance was later found to be harmless. The four MPs who received the letters are from South Asian backgrounds. One of the MPs, Ealing Central and Acton's Rupa Huq, said her package was a ""Punish a Muslim"" letter. The three other MPs to receive suspicious items were Bedford MP Mohammad Yasin, Bethnal Green's Rushanara Ali and Afzal Khan, MP for Manchester Gorton. On Tuesday, a Parliamentary spokesman said items of mail containing suspicious substances had been investigated by the Met Police and were not found to be hazardous. ""The affected areas were temporarily cordoned off but no evacuation was necessary,"" the spokesman added. ""One person attended hospital as a precaution."" Parliament has emailed all staff, warning them to ""be on the alert for suspicious items of mail"". Ms Huq tweeted: ""Staffer who went to hospital now discharged. There is a definite pattern. It was the letter that did the rounds at weekend and subject of Parliamentary urgent question yesterday which was received. Normal service now resumed - though scary experience."" She later told the BBC it was worrying the packages had got through security in the House of Commons but ""it was even more worrying that someone out there thinks it is open season on Muslim MPs"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the letters and packages being circulated were ""utterly contemptible"". ""Labour is committed to tackling Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate crime, as well as all other forms of bigotry, racism and xenophobia,"" he said.

"Zoe Ball took up a cycling challenge in Billy Yates' memory Zoe Ball says she is ""getting stronger"" after the death of her partner Billy Yates, who took his own life last year. The BBC Radio 2 presenter has just cycled 350 miles over five days to raise awareness of mental illness. ""I'm a tough old cookie,"" she said. ""My family have been through a lot. ""There are moments when you least expect it when grief catches you. But the main thing is I've found people who have been through this and are doing better. They've found some hope."" She added: ""That's the biggest thing for me, that there is hope. Otherwise what are we doing this for?"" Ball completed her cycling challenge on Friday Ball was inspired to take on the cycling challenge following the death of Yates, a cameraman, last May. She completed her long-distance journey on Friday, raising Â£500,000 for Sport Relief. The 47-year-old told the Radio Times she has moments ""when I can't believe any of this happened"". ""I'm in the middle of this challenge and Billy's gone,"" she said, adding: ""That never leaves you. That and the heartbreak, and the fact you couldn't save them. ""It's true for Billy's mum and dad and his sisters and friends, too. They are all in pain. Especially his male friends. The ripple effect is dangerous. It can happen again. It's scary."" The presenter said she knew Yates had lived with depression but ""didn't know how to help"". She continued: ""And then I have to stop and say, 'Everyone who loved him knew. None of us found an answer, none of us saved him'. Ball's efforts in the challenge will be shown in BBC One documentary titled Zoe's Hardest Road Home on 21 March.

"This video can not be played Victim: I will do whatever it takes to keep Worboys behind bars The Parole Board failed to consider ""critical evidence"" against rapist John Worboys before approving his prison release, a lawyer for two of his victims has told the High Court. The lawyer said the evidence related to ""wider allegations"" of sexual attacks. Police believe that Worboys - jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women in London - had more than 100 victims. Lawyer Phillippa Kaufmann QC said the board was wrong to decide Worboys took ""full responsibility"" for his crimes. Worboys is thought to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in the capital between 2002 and 2008. The 60-year-old, who has changed his name to John Radford, is watching the trial via video link from prison. The court heard he denies any allegation other than the offences he was convicted of. Legal papers submitted to the High Court show that as recently as September last year, the prison authorities believed he posed such a risk that he needed to remain in a Category A prison. Three months later the Parole Board decided that he should be let out with stringent licence conditions, without having been assessed at a less secure prison. Ms Kaufmann said this ""highly exceptional step"" was ""in the face of opposition"" from senior prison managers, prison psychologists, the probation service and the justice secretary. John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women Ms Kaufmann said the claims of Worboys' further crimes ""completely undermined"" the board's decision. She told the court: ""It is obvious, absolutely obvious, that this evidence of wider offending had a central bearing on all of those conclusions that formed the basis of the Parole Board's conclusion that there had been a reduction in risk."" Ms Kaufmann added it would have been fair to consider these allegations as the board did not have to determine whether he had actually committed the crimes. She said it would be ""extraordinary"" to release Worboys straight from a Category A prison, the highest security prison, into the community. At last, the cloak of secrecy surrounding the Parole Board's decision-making in this case has been lifted. Thanks to the judicial review challenge the public, and John Worboys' victims, can find out why the Board ruled it was safe to release him. Its decision was apparently influenced by assessments from three independent psychologists all of whom at some stage had been instructed by Worboys. One expert initially recommended he be moved from HMP Wakefield, a high security jail, to an 'open' prison, which allows inmates more freedom. That's the usual route to eventual release, taken by those serving life or indeterminate sentences. It enables the authorities to test whether prisoners can be trusted in a less secure environment where they're allowed to spend time working in the community. But the psychologist later changed their view and agreed with two other psychologists that the 60-year-old sex offender should be let out straight away - direct from Wakefield jail. To be released from a Category A prison, the court heard, is ""very unusual"".  Nevertheless,  their advice was accepted by the three-member parole panel, resulting in this landmark legal challenge. Ahead of the High Court challenge against the decision to grant him parole, victims said they were not properly informed and warned of risks to women's safety. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has also launched a judicial review against the action to free the former black-cab driver. During the High Court challenge, three judges are hearing evidence over two days from victims and Mr Khan. As the case got under way, Mr Khan said in a statement that Worboys presented a ""significant threat"" to safety. He said: ""I have been clear that he shouldn't be released at the very least until the decision has been properly independently scrutinised and we are reassured that those in positions of power and responsibility are doing everything they can to keep all his victims, and the rest of us, safe."" The Sun newspaper is also part of the legal challenge, after it was granted permission last month to challenge the Parole Board over not publishing its decision. The Parole Boardhas previously apologised to victimswho were not told about the decision but said it was ""confident"" Worboys would not re-offend. The case continues.

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond says economic growth forecasts have been revised. Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted a bright future for the UK in his first Spring Statement - but why was he in such an upbeat and jovial mood? Well, Mr Hammond reported a higher growth forecast for 2018, and a fall in inflation, borrowing and debt. He told MPs: ""We have made solid progress towards building an economy that works for everyone."" Mr Hammond said borrowing was due to fall in each of the next few years, with the 2017 figure of 2.2% of GDP predicted to drop to 0.9% in 2022. As a result, debt as a percentage of GDP is predicted to go down every year up to 2022 - the first sustained drop in 17 years. ""That is a turning point in this nation's recovery from the financial crisis a decade ago,"" said Mr Hammond. ""There is light at the end of the tunnel."" The OBR says inflation will fall to 2% by the end of the year - in line with the Bank of England's target. Mr Hammond said the economy had grown every year since 2010, adding that the Office for Budget Responsibility had confirmed growth of 1.7% was achieved in 2017, higher than its 1.5% forecast in last autumn's Budget. The OBR also revised its growth forecast for 2018 up to 1.5% from 1.4% One reason in the short term for the rise in economic growth is a robust global recovery. The stronger expansion in 2017 also meant the economy carried more of that momentum into 2018. Whileproductivity growth over the last two quarters is the strongest since the 2008 recession, this is not expected to translate to higher growth in later years. Output per working hour rose by 0.8% in the three months to December following a 0.9% rise in the previous quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics. The OBR's growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020 remained unchanged, while those for 2021 and 2022 were reduced slightly. It is a possibility. Despite revealing the smallest budget deficit since 2002, Mr Hammond had already said the national debt was too high and that it would be wrong to put ""every penny"" into more public spending. However, he said that if public finances continued to reflect current improvements by the autumn, then he ""would have capacity to enable further increases in public spending and investment in the years ahead"". Tigger Hammond knows he has a difficult hand UK economy at turning point - Hammond Reality Check: Is the chancellor right that debt is shrinking? Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: ""These forecasts put the UK in a better position to face the moment of truth on Brexit. ""The decision phase of the Brexit talks will shortly be upon us. Stronger public finances give Mr Hammond more firepower to support the economy if the Brexit talks don't go according to plan."" However, he added: ""We should not get carried away. These forecasts are likely to be no less fallible than earlier ones and, despite an improving trend in public borrowing, the burden of debt in the UK is still at its highest in over 50 years."" The OBR spelled out for the first time the likely cost of the Brexit divorce bill. It estimates the total cost of the financial settlement with the EU will be Â£37.1bn. Most of this - about Â£28bn - is due over the next five years. However, pension promises mean the UK will still be paying around Â£2.5bn all the way to 2064. The OBR also estimates that Brexit will free up around Â£3bn a year to spend on other things by 2020-21, rising to Â£5.8bn in 2022-23 after taking account of ""financial settlement transfers"". It assumes that this money will be recycled into extra spending, rather than used to pay down the deficit. However, it warned that this so-called dividend should not be viewed in isolation. It said: ""While this is one of the more direct ways in which leaving the EU impacts upon the public finances, it is unlikely to be the largest one."" The watchdog estimated in November 2016 that a combination of weaker productivity growth, lower net inward migration, and higher inflation would push up borrowing by about Â£15bn a year by the start of the next decade. The government has also signalled that it is willing to pay to remain part of some European regulatory agencies after Brexit, and areas such as science and education. The OBR said spending in these areas was around Â£7bn a year. The Treasury asked the watchdog not to factor this into its calculations because it said ""final decisions"" on spending had not been made. Not really, according to Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. He told the BBC: ""The growth forecasts are about 1.5% growth each year for the next few years which is better than forecasting a recession, but it's an awful lot worse than you might reasonably expect. ""We've got used to growth of 2 to 2.5% a year since the last war really and if you actually look at what other economies around the world are doing, they're mostly doing quite a lot better than the UK economy. ""So overall the British economy is sluggish at best. That means our living standards will grow very slowly at best - it looks like 'not very good' is the new normal.""

"There won't be a red box brandished on the steps of Number 11, a pint won't be up a penny or down a couple, and the chancellor certainly won't have to reach for a stiffener under the despatch box, like some of his predecessors who had a whiskey stashed there for the odd sip or two to get through a marathon Parliamentary statement. What there also will not be in Philip Hammond's spring statement are grand gestures of new spending; no big cheques being signed by Mr Hammond to portion out your money. With the balance of the books improving, the chancellor might sound a bit cheerier than at his last big outing. The public spending numbers appear much healthier than before Christmas. Unless he undergoes a personality transplant overnight, however, he's hardly going to be chucking money about with abandon. Expect instead a focus on paying down the debt and taking a ""balanced approach"" - that's the government's code for carrying on with tight public spending to pay off the public debt. The argument over the deficit may be over, mostly. But the government wants now to focus on the debt. The Hammond case is that we might have cleared the overdraft, but we still have a hefty mortgage that needs to be paid down. But just because Tuesday's spring statement will be skimpy, it doesn't mean there aren't bigger conversations about the future of the public purse going on. In fact, senior figures in government have told me there are discussions going on in government about one of the biggest political priorities of all - the NHS. Several senior sources say that, at the end of January, the cabinet discussed ways of getting more money into the health service in the long term. That included the foreign secretary's by now familiar argument about the hoped-for but disputed Brexit dividend. But more intriguingly for a Conservative government, I'm told that the cabinet discussed the possibility of tax rises to fund more spending for the NHS, even a hypothecated tax,as spelled out by senior MPs like Nick Boles. This does seem to be rather a change of heart. For months last year, and on the general election trail, the prime minister maintained, time and again, that the NHS has the money that it needs - the funds that it requested. With the opposition and senior Tories calling for a long-term look at the levels of cash, the line seemed to stay the same. In January this year, the prime minister repeated that ""we have put money in that was asked for in that review, and we've actually put some extra money in, in the spring statement and the Budget last  year to deal with this. ""You keep talking about the money but actually what you also need to look at is how the NHS works."" Behind closed doors however, that position is shifting. One cabinet minister told me ""most of us accept now that something has to happen - we have to find a way"". Another said: ""It's hard to see how healthcare won't need more money"". A different cabinet minister accepted that ""conversations are very live"" about the best way to make sure that the NHS is getting what it needs. There is no consensus in government yet about the right way to go. Number 10 isn't suddenly about to turn the spending taps on and flood the health service with money. But at the highest levels of government there is a growing acceptance that the NHS will need more cash, even if the government is far from settling when or how.

"This video can not be played McDonnell says Hammond showing ""astounding complacency"" Public services have been ""ignored"" by the Conservatives despite ""a crisis on a scale we have never seen before"", Labour's shadow chancellor has claimed. John McDonnell said the ""complacency"" shown by Chancellor Philip Hammond's Spring Statement was ""astounding"". In his response in the Commons he accused the Tories of not listening to doctors, nurses, teachers or police. But the chancellor dismissed Labour for offering an ""inward-looking, narrow-minded economy"". Spring Statement: UK growth revised upwards by Philip Hammond Live: Spring Statement reaction The exchanges followed Mr Hammond's first Spring Statement, after the Budget was moved to the autumn. Mr McDonnell argued that ""austerity was a political choice not an economic necessity"", adding: ""We were never all in this together as they claimed."" He said to Mr Hammond: ""Your complacency today is astounding. We face - in every public service - a crisis on a scale we've never seen before. ""Haven't you listened to the doctors and nurses, the teachers, the police officers, the carers and even your own councillors? They are telling you they can't wait for the next Budget. They're telling you to act now. ""For eight years they've been ignored by this government. And today - they've been ignored again."" UK growth to be slowest in G20 this year, says OECD Mr Hammond had hailed the forecasts that the UK economy had grown at a slightly faster rate than predicted in November and that borrowing was down. Instead, Mr McDonnell said, growth in the UK economy ""was among the lowest in the G7 and the slowest since 2012"". ""Wages are lower now - in real terms - than they were in 2010 - and they're still falling,"" he told the Commons. He said three million people were ""in insecure work"" and the Resolution Foundation claimed changes to benefits due to come in next month would leave 11m families worse off, with the ""harshest cuts"" falling on disabled people. He said government investment was nearly Â£18bn below 2010 levels, which was part of the reason why ""UK industry is 20 to 30% less productive that in other major economies"". while  R&D funding had been cut by Â£1 billion in real terms. And he accused ministers of channelling five times more transport investment into London than Yorkshire and Humber and the North, while also ""single-handedly destroying our solar industry"" with the loss of 12,000 jobs as a result of subsidy cuts. Ministers talking about how to get more cash into NHS Mr McDonnell said it was ""a bit rich"" for the chancellor to claim the government had reached a turning point on the economy, when ""it has increased the debt by over Â£700bn... the equivalent of an additional Â£22,000 on every household in this country"". Of the government's claims the deficit would be eliminated ""by 2015, then 2016, then 2020"", he said it had instead been shifted on to the shoulders of NHS managers, doctors, nurses and the health secretary. ""NHS Trusts will end this financial year Â£1bn in deficit,"" he said. ""Doctors and nurses are struggling and being asked to do more, while 100,000 NHS posts go unfilled. Do you really believe the NHS can wait another eight months for the life-saving funds it needs? ""How many more people have to die while waiting for an ambulance?"" He said crime was ""rising"" while police officer numbers had been cut and at the same time as nearly 5,000 people were sleeping rough on the streets, ""one million vulnerable older people have no access to the social care they need"". Spring Statement - reaction Accusing the chancellor of ""another missed opportunity"", Mr McDonnell said: ""This isn't a government that's preparing our country for the future - it's a government setting us up to fail."" In response Mr Hammond said: ""Every now and again the mask slips and we get a glimpse of the sinister ideology that lies beneath - an ideology that would wreck our economy if you ever gets anywhere near the controls."" The chancellor said the government had closed the tax gap to one of the lowest in the developed world, while the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expected real wages to rise. He said ""spending on the disabled"" would be higher in every year of the Parliament, while research and development spending was at ""record highs"". At the weekend the shadow chancellor urged Labour MPs to stop appearing on a Kremlin-sponsored TV station. Mr Hammond referred to that as he said: ""You reel out the same old bogus statistics on regional distribution - I think you got the briefing from Russia Today.""

"The UK economy will grow at a slower pace than any other major advanced or emerging nation this year, according to the OECD. Ahead of theSpring Statement, the think-tank raised its UK growth forecast to 1.3% in 2018 amid a strengthening global recovery. This is up from an earlier projection of 1.2%, but is the weakest in the G20. The OECD predicts the fastest world growth since 2011 this year, helped by US tax cuts and spending in Germany. The Paris-based organisation said the world economy was on course to expand at an annual pace of 3.9% over the next two years. This is up from a forecast last November of 3.7% in 2018 and 3.6% in 2019. However, it warned that the recovery risked being undermined by an escalation in trade barriers that would hurt growth and jobs. The OECD saidhigher inflation in the UKwould continue to squeeze household incomes. Weak business investment would also weigh on growth for the next two years amid uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations. It left its prediction for UK growth in 2019 unchanged at 1.1%. This would be the joint-slowest expansion alongside Japan. City and academic economists expect the UK economy to expand at an annual pace of 1.5% over the next two years, andChancellor Philip Hammond is expected to reveal a more optimistic outlookin updated official forecasts on Tuesday. Ãlvaro Pereira, the OECD's acting chief economist, urged the UK to introduce more policies to boost living standards, as well as address regional disparities. ""We do think that it's very important for the UK to invest more in productivity enhancing infrastructure,"" he said. ""A lot of investment happens in London, it doesn't happen in many other areas. More needs to be done to enhancing productivity in the rest of the UK."" TheOECD has been criticised for its pessimistic economic forecastsbefore and after the EU referendum. Three months after the UK voted in June 2016 to leave the EU, it predicted economic growth of just 1% in 2017. However, official figures showthe economy expanded by 1.7% last year. Mr Pereira said the OECD had been ""fairly consistent"" in its forecasts. He said: ""[Ahead of the referendum] we were talking about rates of growth of around 2% for the UK. Right now we are talking about substantially lower rates of growth. We have not changed our view on Brexit."" The OECD's latest economic outlook showed all but one G20 nation - Russia - was set to grow at a faster pace this year than predicted last November. Mr Pereira said global growth would be led by a recovery in investment, while an increase in trade volumes of 5.2% in 2017 was expected to continue in 2018. He said: ""Investment is coming back, and so this is very good news for good new for jobs and growth across the economies."" However, the think-tank warned that trade barriers posed a threat to growth, Last week,President Trump signed controversial orders imposing heavy tariffson steel and aluminium. The European Commission vowed to retaliate if hit by the tariffs. Mr Pereira said a global trade war would be harmful for the global economy. ""Any escalation, any retaliation or a tit-for-tat type of scenario would be very damaging,"" he said. ""I think it is very important to avoid escalation and to initiate a strengthening in the global dialogue to solve not only the problem for steel but to avoid bigger repercussions in terms of trade.""

"This video can not be played From ""moron"" to ""castration"": a history of Trump v Tillerson bust-ups US President Donald Trump has fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson via Twitter, naming CIA Director Mike Pompeo as his replacement. Mr Tillerson's spokesman said he only learned he was out of a job when he saw the president's tweet thanking him for his service as top US diplomat. The former ExxonMobil chief had a series of public rifts with the White House since he was appointed last year. Mr Trump also named Gina Haspel to become the CIA's first female director. Where it went wrong for Rex Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Tuesday, Mr Trump said his differences with Mr Tillerson came down to personal ""chemistry"". ""We got along actually quite well, but we disagreed on things,"" said the president. ""When you look at the Iran deal, I think it's terrible. I guess he thought it was OK. ""I wanted to either break it or do something and he felt a little bit differently, so we were not really thinking the same. This video can not be played Rex Tillerson: ""I will now return to private life"" ""With Mike, Mike Pompeo, we have a very similar thought process. I think it's going to go very well. ""Rex is a very good man, I like Rex a lot."" Mr Tillerson is the latest in a long list of senior officials who have either resigned or been fired since Mr Trump took office.

The Department of State said Mr Tillerson had not spoken to the president and was ""unaware of the reason"" for his firing. Under Secretary Steve Goldstein said: ""The Secretary had every intention of staying because of the critical progress made in national security."" Mr Goldstein himself was fired later on Tuesday by the White House. Mr Tillerson said later in a news conference that he had received a call from the president on Air Force One after midday, about three hours after Mr Trump fired him via tweet. He added he would finish his term on 31 March and would ""return to private life as a private citizen"". According to the Associated Press, White House chief of staff John Kelly called Mr Tillerson on Friday and advised him to watch out for a presidential tweet about him. Mr Kelly did not tell Mr Tillerson when the tweet would be posted or what it might say, reports the news agency. The secretary of state was on an official tour of Africa last week when he was caught unawares by Mr Trump's agreement to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The top US diplomat's team said he was feeling unwell on Saturday and later in the weekend the state department said he would cut short his tour by a day. ""I felt like, look, I just need to get back,"" Mr Tillerson told reporters on his plane home, reports the Washington Post. The 65-year-old arrived back in Washington before dawn on Tuesday to learn he was out of a job a few hours later. Rex Tillerson - Trump's former top diplomat Reaction to his firing Analysis byJon Sopel, BBCNorth America editor The end was a perfect metaphor for the relationship. The odd couple of politics had been yoked together for too long. Men of different temperaments, demeanour and style had reached a parting of the ways. The secretary of state landed back at Joint Base Andrews to have a member of staff inform him that the president had tweeted. Because Mr Tillerson is not on Twitter, the tweet had to be printed out. Fancy being the one tasked with handing that over to the boss. Fired by a tweet. The career of a one-time giant of corporate America had come to an ignominious end. Read Jon's analysis in full This video can not be played Mike Pompeo: Meet America's new top diplomat A US Senate report found that Ms Haspel ran a notorious CIA prison in Thailand, where prisoners were waterboarded in 2002. The CIA deputy director was also accused of destroying dozens of videotapes of interrogations at the camp. Gina Haspel - first female CIA director nominee Mr Pompeo is a former hardline conservative Republican lawmaker from Kansas and a Trump loyalist. In 2014, he defended the CIA officers who waterboarded detainees as ""patriots"". Mike Pompeo - Trump's loyalist new diplomat Both the new secretary of state and CIA director will have to be confirmed by the Senate. Reports had swirled since last year of a schism in the Trump administration between the commander-in-chief and his top diplomat. Last October Mr Tillerson was forced to convene a news conference to deny claims he planned to quit, though he did not address a report that he had referred to his boss as a moron after a Pentagon meeting. This video can not be played Trump says goodbye to Tillerson: 'I like Rex a lot, but we disagreed' Last autumn, Mr Trump publicly undercut the former Texas oilman by tweeting that he was ""wasting his time"" trying to negotiate with North Korea. In December, the secretary of state departed from administration talking points when he offered to begin direct talks with Pyongyang without preconditions. Battles ahead after another sacking from Trump Cabinet The White House - which insisted North Korea must first accept any negotiations would be about giving up its nuclear arsenal - distanced itself from his remarks. Mr Tillerson was reported to be astonished at how little Mr Trump grasped the basics of foreign policy. The Republican president, meanwhile, was irritated by Mr Tillerson's body language during meetings, the New York Times reported. The secretary of state was said to roll his eyes or slouch when he disagreed with Mr Trump's decisions.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We are giving Russia until midnight to explain"" Russia will not co-operate with the UK inquiry into how an ex-spy and his daughter were poisoned until it has been given a sample of the substance used, its foreign minister has said. Sergei Lavrov's comments came as police appealed for witnesses who had seen the pair's red BMW car before the attack. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson hailed support from other countries. US President Donald Trump has said he would take Britain's assessment that Russia was behind the attack ""as fact"". Former double agent Mr Skripal, 66, and Yulia, 33, were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury city centre in Wiltshire on 4 March. Police said they remain critically ill in hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill responding to the incident, is in a serious but stable condition. Speaking outside New Scotland Yard, Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said 35 other people had been seen in hospital, of whom 34 had been assessed and discharged, while the condition of one person is being monitored. Russia has been given a midnight deadline by Prime Minister Theresa May to explain why a Russian-made nerve agent was used in the attack in Salisbury on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. But Mr Lavrov described claims of Russian involvement as ""rubbish"" and said it had been refused access to the nerve agent. The UK ambassador to Russia, Laurie Bristow, has met the Russian deputy foreign minister in Moscow. This video can not be played Theresa May: Spy poisoned by ""military-grade nerve agent"" Assistant Commissioner Basu revealed Miss Skripal had flown into Heathrow Airport on 3 March. He appealed for witnesses who saw the pair in her father's car - licence plate number HD09 WAO - between 13:00 and 13.45 GMT on the day of the poisoning. Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu updated reporters outside New Scotland Yard He said the police investigation will take ""many weeks"", with the ""prime focus"" being how the poison was administered. However, he said detectives were ""not declaring a person of interest or suspect at this time"". Police also confirmed Mr Skripal, who came to the UK in 2010 in a ""spy swap"" after he had been convicted by Russia of passing information to MI6, was a British citizen. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the investigation was ""going well"" after chairing another meeting of the government's emergencies committee Cobra. Sheannounced that MI5 and police are to look into claimsthat as many as 14 deaths on UK soil may be linked to Russia. Up to 14 other deaths to be re-examined for Russian links What we know so far Row over Corbyn's Russia spy response Mrs May told the Commons on Monday that the poison used in the attack was a military-grade nerve agent developed by Russia.  She said it was part ofa group of nerve agents known as Novichok. ""Either this was a direct action by the Russian state against our country, or the Russian government lost control of its potentially catastrophically damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others,"" she said. The PM warned that if there was no ""credible response"" by the end of Tuesday, the UK would conclude there has been an ""unlawful use of force"" by Moscow. Mr Trump said he would be speaking to Theresa May later, adding: ""It sounds to me they believe it was Russia based on all the evidence they have"". Answering a separate question by reporters, he added: ""As soon as we get the facts straight, if we agree with them, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be"". Former US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who spoke to Mr Johnson on the phone about the case on Mondaybefore he was sacked, had said the US supported the UK's assessment that Russia was likely responsible. Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said the UK was a ""highly valued ally"" and described the incident as ""of great concern"". He said the use of any nerve agent was ""horrendous and completely unacceptable"" and said Nato had been in touch with the UK authorities. He added: ""We agree that those responsible - both those who committed the crime and those who ordered it - must face appropriately serious consequences. ""We stand in solidarity with our allies in the United Kingdom and will continue to coordinate closely our responses."" German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said any Russian link would be a ""very serious matter"" and Berlin stood ""in solidarity"" with the UK. Mrs May also spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday and the two leaders ""agreed that it would be important to continue to act in concert with allies"" to address what it called ""the wide pattern of aggressive Russian behaviour"", her spokesman said. This video can not be played ""Get to the bottom of it"" - President Putin tells UK it is their responsibility European commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis was among a number of leading EU figures to express ""solidarity"" with the UK. He said: ""We are very much concerned with this situation - also with the findings the UK has so far."" Mrs May said the UK must ""stand ready to take much more extensive measures"" against Russia than it had previously. She said these measures would be set out in the Commons on Wednesday should there be no adequate explanation from Russia. Britain could expel Russian diplomats, as it did after the poisoning of former Russian Federal Security Service operative Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 with radioactive polonium. But many argue that this, and the other measures that were taken after that killing - including visa restrictions on Russian officials - did not go far enough. So what else could the UK do?

A witness told the BBC that he saw the pair in Zizzi restaurant at about 14:00 GMT. Mr Skripal was found alongside his daughter on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre, a short walk away. At about 16:15 GMT officers were alerted to the incident. Eyewitness Freya Church said she saw a man and a woman looking unwell on a bench. This video can not be played Witness: ""They looked like they'd been taking something quite strong"" Another passer-by, Jamie Paine, said the woman he saw was frothing at the mouth and her eyes ""were wide open but completely white"".

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond says economic growth forecasts have been revised. Chancellor Philip Hammond has unveiled upgraded projections for growth and predicted falling inflation and borrowing in his Spring Statement. He claimed the UK economy had reached a turning point and there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"". He ruled out an immediate end to austerity but hinted at possible spending rises in the future. Labour accused him of ""astounding complacency"" in the face of the worst ever public sector funding crisis. The chancellor resisted calls from Labour and some Tories to use the extra cash from an unexpected boost in tax receipts to ease the spending squeeze. But he said he would ""set an overall path for public spending for 2020 and beyond"" in his Autumn budget, with a detailed spending review in 2019. Labour: Hammond's 'astounding complacency' Reality Check: Is the chancellor right that debt is shrinking? At-a-glance: The key points The chancellor told MPs growth was forecast to be 1.5% this year, up from 1.4% forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in November, with the forecast for 2019 and 2020 unchanged at 1.3%. In his 26 minute statement he also said debt would be falling as a share of GDP from 2018-19, which would be the start of ""the first sustained fall in debt for 17 years, a turning point in the nation's recovery from the financial crisis of a decade ago"". Mr Hammond told MPs: ""That's the OBR's forecast, Mr Speaker, but forecasts are there to be beaten."" OBR chief Robert Chote said: ""Overall the referendum vote does seem to have weakened the economy as we and most other forecasters expected, but not quite as much as we forecast back in November 2016. ""Having said all this, we are still dealing with the very early drafts of economic history and it's important not to put too much weight on what are still early indicators of economic activity either side of the Brexit vote."" He said the UK was borrowing less than forecast this year thanks to more tax coming in from self-employed workers - revenues are Â£2.9bn higher than predicted. But he added: ""We don't expect much of that good news to push forward into future years."" Ahead of Mr Hammond's statement, the OECD said the UK economy will grow at a slower pace than any other major advanced or emerging nation this year, as it raised its growth forecast to 1.3% in 2018. Reality Check: Is the chancellor right that debt is shrinking? Why is chancellor so bullish about economy? The OBR has calculated that the UK will continue to pay contributions into the EU budget until 2064 - 45 years after the official date of Brexit - with the total ""withdrawal bill"" amounting to Â£37.1bn. The main reason for this is that the government will have an on-going liability for a proportion of EU staff's pensions earned while the UK was a member. Mr Hammond did not have much to say about Brexit in his statement - prompting opposition claims that he knew there would be no ""Brexit dividend"" for the UK economy. Mr Hammond said: ""Our economy does still face uncertainty as we go through the negotiation process with the European Union."" But he added that business confidence would improve as the government delivered ""greater clarity"" about its Brexit plans, adding: ""We beat the forecast in 2017, let's beat it again in 2018."" Reality Check: Brexit cash allocated to departments This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg interviews Philip Hammond Philip Hammond gave the clearest hint yet that he is prepared to increase spending on health, in an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg. The chancellor said he recognises the pressures for more spending in the NHS, local government ""and other areas"" and he hoped the improvement in the public finances ""hinted"" at by the OBR would allow him to increase spending in his Autumn budget. He acknowledged a ""continuous upward pressure"" on NHS spending because of an ageing population and developments in care. Kuenssberg: Hammond looks to next election Hammond's tough hand - Kamal Ahmed Hammond: I recognise pressures on NHS Mr Hammond did not use his Spring Statement as a ""mini-Budget"" as in previous years, and instead unveiled a series of consultations on future policies, including: A reduction in tax on for the least polluting vans to ""help the great British white van driver go green"" A possible tax onsingle use plastic A new'tech tax'looking at how firms like Google and Facebook are taxed A call for evidence ""on whether the use of non-agricultural red diesel tax relief contributes to poor air quality in urban areas"" The future of cash and digital payments, whichcould spell the end for 1p and 2p coins He also said the next revaluation for business rates is being brought forward to 2021, after which the government will move to revaluations every three years and there will be an additional Â£1.7bn to deliver 26,000 affordable homes in London. This video can not be played Speech in full: Hammond sees ""light at the end of tunnel"" This video can not be played Response in full: McDonnell on ""astounding complacency"" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""Does the chancellor really believe the NHS can wait another eight months for the lifesaving funds it needs? How many people have to die waiting in an ambulance before he acts?"" Mr McDonnell also raised concerns over funding for schools, the emergency services and local councils. He said ""austerity was a political choice not an economic necessity"", adding: ""We were never all in this together as they claimed."" The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said: ""The light at the end of the tunnel is a hard Brexit, which is going to cost jobs and prosperity in the this country."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said ""Brexit was dragging the economy down"" and the chancellor had been right not to turn on the public spending taps because there was still ""very little freedom"" in the public finances. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas tweeted: ""Tories celebrate a tiny improvement in growth in today's #SpringStatement, but GDP isn't a real measure of our society. True indicators are people being treated in hospital corridors & foodbank use shooting up. Our economy is designed to fail people - and it needs an overhaul."" Mr Hammond accused Labour of talking the economy down, comparing them to the gloomy character from Winnie the Pooh he has himself been likened to in the past. ""If there are any Eeyores in the chamber they are over there. I meanwhile am at my most positively Tiggerlike today, as I contemplate a country which faces the future with unique strengths."" Labour's shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne joked on Twitter that Mr Hammond was ""talking Pooh"".

"This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works The German government says Russia's opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has been poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. The most prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin was airlifted to Berlin for treatment after falling ill during a flight in Russia's Siberia region last month. He has been in a coma since. The name Novichok last made news in 2018, when Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were attacked in the city of Salisbury in the UK. Russia has denied any role in Mr Navalny's predicament - or the Skripals' poisoning. So what do we know about this group of military-grade nerve agents? The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of advanced nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. They were known as fourth-generation chemical weapons and were developed under a Soviet programme codenamed Foliant. Novichok's existence was revealed by chemist Dr Vil Mirzayanov in the 1990s, via Russian media. He later defected to the US, where he published the chemical formula in his book, State Secrets. Alexei Navalny has been in a coma since the alleged attack last month In 1999,defence officials from the US travelled to Uzbekistan to help dismantle and decontaminate one of the former Soviet Union's largest chemical weapons testing facilities,external. According to Dr Mirzayanov, the Soviets used the plant to produce and test small batches of Novichok. These nerve agents were designed to escape detection by international inspectors. Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? What are nerve agents and what do they do? Some variants of Novichok are thought to be five to eight times more toxic than the VX nerve agent. ""This is a more dangerous and sophisticated agent than sarin or VX and is harder to identify,"" says Professor Gary Stephens, a pharmacology expert at the University of Reading. VX agent was the chemical used to kill the half-brother of Kim Jong-un in 2017, according to the US. Experts are divided on how long the nerve agent remains toxic. Dr Mirzayanov says it does not last for months. But Vladimir Uglev, a scientist who claims he invented the Novichok agent used in the Skripals' poisoning, says the substance is ""very stable"". Other experts say the chemicals are designed to be persistent and could last for months or years, particularly if they were kept in containers. ""They [Novichok nerve agents] don't evaporate, they don't break up in water,"" said Andrea Sella, professor of inorganic chemistry at University College London. One difficulty is that Novichok is less well studied and understood than other nerve agents, and there is no official scientific data on how long they last. While some Novichok agents are liquids, others are thought to exist in solid form. This means they could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also reported to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to transport, handle and store. Investigators working near Salisbury where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent. ""One of the main reasons these agents are developed is because their component parts are not on the banned list,"" says Prof Stephens. Novichoks were designed to be more toxic than other chemical weapons, so some versions would begin to take effect rapidly - in the order of 30 seconds to two minutes. The main route of exposure is likely to be through inhalation or ingestion, though they could also be absorbed through the skin. Novichok agents have similar effects to other nerve agents - they act by blocking messages from the nerves to the muscles, causing a collapse of many bodily functions. Dr Mirzayanov said the first sign to look out for was miosis, the excessive constriction of the pupils. A larger dose could cause convulsions and interrupted breathing, he said. ""[Then begins the] continuous convulsions and vomiting, and then a fatal outcome."" Dr Mirzayanov said there were antidotes - atropine and athene - that helped stop the action of the poison, but that they were not a cure. If a person is exposed to the nerve agent, their clothing should be removed and their skin washed with soap and water. Their eyes should be rinsed and they should be given oxygen. Dr Mirzayanov believes Russia had to have been behind the Skripal poisoning ""because Russia is the country that invented it, has the experience, turned it into a weapon... has fully mastered the cycle"". Russia's UN ambassador has said development work on Soviet-era nerve agents stopped in 1992, and that existing stockpiles were destroyed in 2017. In September 2017,the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed the full destruction of the 39,967 metric tons of chemical weapons possessed by Russia.,external But Novichoks were never declared to the OPCW, and the chemicals never formed part of any control regime partly because of uncertainty about their chemical structures, says Prof Alastair Hay at the University of Leeds. This video can not be played Retired Russian scientist Vladimir Uglev says he created a Novichok nerve agent. It is quite likely that some government laboratories made minute quantities and stored their characteristics in databases, so that their identity could be confirmed at a later stage if found as an unknown poison in someone's blood, he said.

"This video can not be played From ""moron"" to ""castration"": a history of Trump v Tillerson bust-ups US President Donald Trump has fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson via Twitter, naming CIA Director Mike Pompeo as his replacement. Mr Tillerson's spokesman said he only learned he was out of a job when he saw the president's tweet thanking him for his service as top US diplomat. The former ExxonMobil chief had a series of public rifts with the White House since he was appointed last year. Mr Trump also named Gina Haspel to become the CIA's first female director.

Rex Tillerson - Trump's former top diplomat Reaction to his firing Analysis byJon Sopel, BBCNorth America editor The end was a perfect metaphor for the relationship. The odd couple of politics had been yoked together for too long. Men of different temperaments, demeanour and style had reached a parting of the ways. The secretary of state landed back at Joint Base Andrews to have a member of staff inform him that the president had tweeted. Because Mr Tillerson is not on Twitter, the tweet had to be printed out. Fancy being the one tasked with handing that over to the boss. Fired by a tweet. The career of a one-time giant of corporate America had come to an ignominious end. Read Jon's analysis in full This video can not be played Mike Pompeo: Meet America's new top diplomat A US Senate report found that Ms Haspel ran a notorious CIA prison in Thailand, where prisoners were waterboarded in 2002. The CIA deputy director was also accused of destroying dozens of videotapes of interrogations at the camp. Gina Haspel - first female CIA director nominee Mr Pompeo is a former hardline conservative Republican lawmaker from Kansas and a Trump loyalist. In 2014, he defended the CIA officers who waterboarded detainees as ""patriots"". Mike Pompeo - Trump's loyalist new diplomat Both the new secretary of state and CIA director will have to be confirmed by the Senate. Reports had swirled since last year of a schism in the Trump administration between the commander-in-chief and his top diplomat. Last October Mr Tillerson was forced to convene a news conference to deny claims he planned to quit, though he did not address a report that he had referred to his boss as a moron after a Pentagon meeting. This video can not be played Trump says goodbye to Tillerson: 'I like Rex a lot, but we disagreed' Last autumn, Mr Trump publicly undercut the former Texas oilman by tweeting that he was ""wasting his time"" trying to negotiate with North Korea. In December, the secretary of state departed from administration talking points when he offered to begin direct talks with Pyongyang without preconditions. Battles ahead after another sacking from Trump Cabinet The White House - which insisted North Korea must first accept any negotiations would be about giving up its nuclear arsenal - distanced itself from his remarks. Mr Tillerson was reported to be astonished at how little Mr Trump grasped the basics of foreign policy. The Republican president, meanwhile, was irritated by Mr Tillerson's body language during meetings, the New York Times reported. The secretary of state was said to roll his eyes or slouch when he disagreed with Mr Trump's decisions.

"This video can not be played 'We want you to know change can happen' Survivors and relatives of the Dunblane tragedy have sent a message of support to students affected by the Parkland school shooting in Florida. A letter was sent to Marjory Stoneman Douglas School on the 22nd anniversary of the Dunblane murders. Ten family members of victims and survivorsalso recorded a video message,externalentitled Dunblane Stands With Parkland. Students at the US school have demanded tougher gun laws after17 people were killedin the attack on 14 February. In the message,first published on Buzzfeed News,external, the Dunblane families offered their ""total support"". Jack Crozier, the brother of 5-year-old Emma who was killed in the tragedy, features in the video. He told BBC Scotland the latest US shooting felt different. He said: ""This felt quite different because the reaction afterwards wasn't the same. ""It wasn't the parents and lawmakers speaking out, it is the students who are standing up for themselves this time. ""And the parallels were so apparent - 17 lost at Parkland and 17 lost at Dunblane - it just really struck home and we felt that this time we really had to show support."" Speaking to the BBC, Jack Crozier said the young people of Dunblane are bringing a positive message to the issue of gun control Mr Crozier said he thinks the younger generation in Dunblane is now ready to take on the responsibility for campaigning from their parents. He said: ""I was two years old when Dunblane happened. It was my parents and the parents of the rest of the people involved in Dunblane that campaigned 20 years ago. ""Now it's the young people in America that are standing up and it's the young people in Dunblane that are saying 'we support you', as well as all the parents. ""I've not got the baggage of the campaigns from previous years and the difficult times they all had to go through. ""I've just got the optimism and that's what we hope can shine through."" The video's contributors also include Pamela, Andrew, and Alison Ross, the mother, brother and sister of five-year-old Joanna Ross, one of the children murdered in Dunblane. Dunblane remains the deadliest firearms atrocity ever committed in the UK The message says: ""We have watched and listened with tremendous admiration as you have spoken out for what you believe should happen now, a significant change of attitude towards the availability of guns in your country."" Thomas Hamilton shot and killed 16 children and their teacher in Dunblane Primary School, before turning the gun on himself on 13 March 1996. It remains the deadliest firearms atrocity ever committed in the UK. Students were evacuated following the Parkland school shooting The letter says: ""The gunman owned his four handguns legally, and we knew it had been too easy for him to arm himself with lethal weapons. ""Like you we vowed to do something about it. ""We persuaded British lawmakers not to be swayed by the vested interests of the gun lobby, we asked them to put public safety first and to heed what the majority of the British people wanted. ""Most politicians listened and acted. ""Laws were changed, handguns were banned and the level of gun violence in Britain is now one of the lowest in the world. ""There have been no more school shootings."" Gunman Nikolas Cruz entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and killed 17 students in seven minutes. Two days later, survivor Cameron Kasky became the first person to use the hashtag #NeverAgain on Twitter. A demonstration called March For Our Liveswill take place on 24 March in Washington DC, in which students, including those from Parkland, will demand an end to gun violence in schools. The Dunblane families' message said: ""We want you to know that change can happen. ""It won't be easy, but continue to remind everyone of exactly what happened at your school and of the devastation caused by just one person with one legally-owned gun. ""Tonight we will be lighting 17 candles for those who died in Dunblane and will be remembering the 17 who lost their lives in Parkland. ""Our thoughts will also be with every other victim of gun violence. ""We offer you our total support for the March for Our Lives and sincerely hope you achieve success. It can be done. #NeverAgain.""

"This video can not be played Labour MP: Suspicious package 'part of a pattern' Police are investigating after suspect packages containing anti-Muslim letters and a sticky liquid were sent to four Labour MPs over the past 24 hours. Their Westminster offices were sealed off and three people were taken to hospital as a precaution. The substance was later found to be harmless. The four MPs who received the letters are from South Asian backgrounds. One of the MPs, Ealing Central and Acton's Rupa Huq, said her package was a ""Punish a Muslim"" letter. The three other MPs to receive suspicious items were Bedford MP Mohammad Yasin, Bethnal Green's Rushanara Ali and Afzal Khan, MP for Manchester Gorton. On Tuesday, a Parliamentary spokesman said items of mail containing suspicious substances had been investigated by the Met Police and were not found to be hazardous. ""The affected areas were temporarily cordoned off but no evacuation was necessary,"" the spokesman added. ""One person attended hospital as a precaution."" Parliament has emailed all staff, warning them to ""be on the alert for suspicious items of mail"". Ms Huq tweeted: ""Staffer who went to hospital now discharged. There is a definite pattern. It was the letter that did the rounds at weekend and subject of Parliamentary urgent question yesterday which was received. Normal service now resumed - though scary experience."" She later told the BBC it was worrying the packages had got through security in the House of Commons but ""it was even more worrying that someone out there thinks it is open season on Muslim MPs"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the letters and packages being circulated were ""utterly contemptible"". ""Labour is committed to tackling Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate crime, as well as all other forms of bigotry, racism and xenophobia,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Juncker tells UKIP MEPs: You'll regret Brexit The UK will come to ""regret"" the decision to leave the EU, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has warned. Addressing the European Parliament, Mr Juncker was cheered by Eurosceptic MEPs as he noted the UK's departure was due on 29 March, 2019. In response he said the time would come ""when you will regret your decision"". MEPs' Brexit representative, Guy Verhofstadt, said the UK had to move beyond the ""slogans and soundbites"". But he said that the UK and EU were ""very near"" to an agreement on citizens' rights post Brexit. Live: European parliament debates Brexit Brexit: All you need to know Mr Juncker told MEPs in Strasbourg there was an ""increasing urgency"" to negotiate the UK's  orderly withdrawal from the EU. He did not want EU citizens to ""fall victim to Brexit"", he said, adding that it was important to secure their rights. Ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage says the UK should abandon plans for a transition period post Brexit Mr Juncker repeated the EU side's line that ""cherry-picking is not going to be possible"" in the future trade relationship between the UK and EU. ""I would rather have preferred Britain not to have decided to leave the European Union, but anyone who leaves the European Union has to know, frankly, what this means,"" he said. ""If you decide to jettison, leave behind, the common agreements and rules, then you have to accept that things cannot remain as they are."" Brexit plans lead to reverse in civil servant cuts in key departments He urged Theresa May to give ""more clarity on how the UK sees its future relationship with the EU"". He called for further British proposals on how to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland, which he calls a ""European issue"" not just an ""Irish issue"". But he was heckled by UKIP's David Coburn, who shouted: ""It is a British issue."" Meanwhile, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage argued that Mrs May should channel US President Donald Trump when she meets EU leaders next week. Referring to the dispute with the US over steel and aluminium tariffs, he said the UK could sign its own trade deal with the US ""in 48 hours"" if it was not a member of the EU. Conservative David Campbell Bannerman says the UK will be the EU's biggest market post Brexit He urged Mrs May to abandon plans for a transition period post Brexit, saying the UK voted ""to leave this organisation"", the customs union and single market. ""So please  Mrs May at this summit next week, do what Trump has done, stand strong against the European Commission, against the unelected bullies,"" he said. Interim UKIP leader Gerard Batten added that the European Commission ""wants unconditional surrender"" from the UK negotiators. He said Mrs May would settle for ""conditional surrender"", but added that ""UKIP's position is no surrender"" and his party would not accept ""subservience"" to the EU in the future relationship. Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder argued that the UK government had ""no plan for Northern Ireland, no plan for its citizens and no plans for its businesses"", adding that ""no clear plan is a dereliction of its duty"". ""Whatever the deal might be, we as Liberal Democrats demand the people have a say on it,"" she told MEPs. ""Or, as my hashtag says 'give us a say Mrs May'."" Conservative MEP David Campbell Bannerman urged European colleagues not to be so negative about Brexit. He said the UK will become ""the largest single market of the EU when we leave, bigger than China, US, Japan, for example"". ""We have a Â£75m deficit with the EU of your goods and we employ 1.5m Germans through cars, etc - and the City of London is very important to funding EU businesses. I've heard none of this today,"" he added.

"Chinese takeaway meals from restaurants and supermarkets should carry health warnings because they are often high in salt, a campaign group says. Action on Salt,externalanalysed more than 150 dishes and found some contained half an adult's recommended 6g (0.2oz) daily allowance of salt. Main courses, such as beef in black bean sauce, topped the salty list. But adding a serving of egg fried rice to your order could deliver anything between an extra 5.3g and 2.3g of salt. While adding side dishes and dipping sauces to your meal could provide nearly another 4g salt per person, the findings reveal. Few of the takeaway restaurant dishes came in at under 2g of salt. Prawn crackers and vegetable spring rolls ranged from 0.8g to 1.4g of salt per portion. Supermarket-bought Chinese meals varied widely in salt content. Spare ribs and crispy aromatic duck were towards the bottom of the list, while saucy rice or noodle-based dishes were higher up. Unsurprisingly, soy sauce, which tastes salty, contains more salt than some other dipping sauces, but sweet ones, such as chilli sauce or plum sauce, may also contain lots. Checking the nutritional values on food packaging can help you check how much salt you will be eating. Of the 141 ready meals analysed, 43% were high in salt, meaning they would typically carry a red notification label on the pack. Too much salt can raise your blood pressure, which puts you at increased risk of health problems such as heart disease and stroke. Most of the salt we eat is already in everyday foods, rather than added at the table. Public Health England has been encouraging the food industry to cut salt levels in food. PHE's chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone said: ""A loaf of bread has 40% less than it used to. ""However, some products are still too high in salt and we know this can be reduced further. ""We've been very clear with the food industry on the importance of meeting the 2017 salt targets. ""We'll report on their progress this year and on any necessary advice to government on the next steps.""

"This video can not be played 'He moved in and I didn't feel safe anymore' A woman whose partner's jail term for stalking her was overturned has revealed it was the fear he might kill someone that drove her to alert police. Bethany Haines, daughter of murdered aid worker David Haines, watched the man who ""stole a year of her life"" walk free from prison in January. Instead of finishing a 21-month jail term, he was released on appeal and will do 200 hours of community service. Bethany has vowed to change the law to protect victims of emotional abuse. At just 20 years old, Bethany has endured more than most. Her aid worker father David was held hostage in Syria for 18 months and then murdered by Islamic State in 2014, when she was just 17. After leaving school early to have her son Aiden, now two, she found herself in an emotionally-abusive relationship in her late teens. In October last year, Andrew Murray was jailed for stalking her and for controlling behaviour, over a six-month period in 2016. Bethany Haines feared her partner would hurt someone if she left him Andrew Murray admitted causing 'fear or alarm' The court was told Bethany had been in an on-off relationship with Murray, who was jealous of her male friends and would accuse her of being unfaithful to him. He was said to have subjected her to a ""degrading and humiliating"" campaign of abuse for six months while they were in a relationship. In one incident, Murray ripped up a ""treasured"" scrapbook dedicated to Bethany's late father because he was jealous of a photograph of her former partner. Murray repeatedly checked her mobile phone and social media messages, and insisted she remove about 50 male friends from her Facebook account. He also tampered with her phone contacts list, changing a friend's number to his own so he received messages sent to the friend by Bethany. The court was told Ms Haines felt ""scared and belittled"". But on 9 January, Murray's jail term was dropped at Perth Sheriff Court after appeal court judges ruled the sentence too severe. Bethany Haines kept a ""treasured scrapbook"" to remember her father, but Murray destroyed it Bethany fled the court in disgust. She said: ""It was my biggest fear realised, my worst fear in coming forward in the first place - that I wouldn't be believed. ""When they brought up the community payback order I had to leave the courtroom because it was as if I wasn't being believed. ""It took a long time for me to come forward and it seems to have been for nothing."" Bethany had not felt brave enough to press charges until she found out Murray had behaved like this before. ""I learned he had done this to a previous partner,"" she said. ""That was the decider because I thought if I left him he would run back to her and do the exact same to her as he'd done to me. ""And his behaviour had escalated so badly in that week I thought if I let him go back he will end up killing someone. ""I decided there and then I was going to walk into the police station and four hours later he was arrested."" Bethany added: ""I had to get my mum to come through - I said: 'You need to take Aiden for the weekend, things are getting really bad here and it's coming to a head and I know I need to leave him. ""'I can't have Aiden in the house when I do it just in case something goes wrong'."" ""It was seeing my mum take my son away, I thought: 'I should never have to do that. It's my job to protect him'."" Bethany said she was told to leave it after Murray was allowed out of prison, that it was the end of the matter. But, horrified that her story might put people off going to the police to report abuse, she decided she had to do something about it. Bethany wants to campaign to raise awareness of the damage emotional abuse and intimidation can do, to try to stop this from happening to anyone else. She said: ""I am going to tell my story more and try to help as many girls and boys as possible in my situation. ""I've had so many messages from girls going through the same and they are too scared to come forward. ""There is an acceptance of zero tolerance for domestic abuse but that message from the police feels a bit empty now in that there's a lot more to domestic abuse than bruises - it's a lot deeper and there's a lot more to it."" Last month, the Scottish Parliament passed a new Domestic Abuse Act which criminalised psychological and emotional abuse as well as violence. Bethany says she hopes victims are more easily believed. ""There is a sense of mistrust when you go into a police station to make a statement,"" she says. ""I would be willing to talk to the Scottish Parliament and tell them my story to help get things changed."" Bethany is now attending college and wants to be a trauma counsellor. Bethany Haines and her son Aiden are moving on with their lives after her abuse ordeal But she is still recovering from the ordeal. She said: ""The hardest thing was getting back to learn how to have a normal life again. ""I had to ask for permission to do everything - coming out of it I was still asking my mum if I could use the toilet, asking if I could get a drink, go out and see a friend. ""I was asking permission to do all these basic needs. It's unbelievable somebody can take away all your freedom like that and think it's okay."" She also hopes her father would be proud she is taking a stand. She said: ""My dad would be proud to see that I've moved on and I want to do something with my life that really matters.""

"There won't be a red box brandished on the steps of Number 11, a pint won't be up a penny or down a couple, and the chancellor certainly won't have to reach for a stiffener under the despatch box, like some of his predecessors who had a whiskey stashed there for the odd sip or two to get through a marathon Parliamentary statement. What there also will not be in Philip Hammond's spring statement are grand gestures of new spending; no big cheques being signed by Mr Hammond to portion out your money. With the balance of the books improving, the chancellor might sound a bit cheerier than at his last big outing. The public spending numbers appear much healthier than before Christmas. Unless he undergoes a personality transplant overnight, however, he's hardly going to be chucking money about with abandon. Expect instead a focus on paying down the debt and taking a ""balanced approach"" - that's the government's code for carrying on with tight public spending to pay off the public debt. The argument over the deficit may be over, mostly. But the government wants now to focus on the debt. The Hammond case is that we might have cleared the overdraft, but we still have a hefty mortgage that needs to be paid down. But just because Tuesday's spring statement will be skimpy, it doesn't mean there aren't bigger conversations about the future of the public purse going on. In fact, senior figures in government have told me there are discussions going on in government about one of the biggest political priorities of all - the NHS. Several senior sources say that, at the end of January, the cabinet discussed ways of getting more money into the health service in the long term. That included the foreign secretary's by now familiar argument about the hoped-for but disputed Brexit dividend. But more intriguingly for a Conservative government, I'm told that the cabinet discussed the possibility of tax rises to fund more spending for the NHS, even a hypothecated tax,as spelled out by senior MPs like Nick Boles. This does seem to be rather a change of heart. For months last year, and on the general election trail, the prime minister maintained, time and again, that the NHS has the money that it needs - the funds that it requested. With the opposition and senior Tories calling for a long-term look at the levels of cash, the line seemed to stay the same. In January this year, the prime minister repeated that ""we have put money in that was asked for in that review, and we've actually put some extra money in, in the spring statement and the Budget last  year to deal with this. ""You keep talking about the money but actually what you also need to look at is how the NHS works."" Behind closed doors however, that position is shifting. One cabinet minister told me ""most of us accept now that something has to happen - we have to find a way"". Another said: ""It's hard to see how healthcare won't need more money"". A different cabinet minister accepted that ""conversations are very live"" about the best way to make sure that the NHS is getting what it needs. There is no consensus in government yet about the right way to go. Number 10 isn't suddenly about to turn the spending taps on and flood the health service with money. But at the highest levels of government there is a growing acceptance that the NHS will need more cash, even if the government is far from settling when or how.

"This video can not be played Labour MP: Suspicious package 'part of a pattern' Police are investigating after suspect packages containing anti-Muslim letters and a sticky liquid were sent to four Labour MPs over the past 24 hours. Their Westminster offices were sealed off and three people were taken to hospital as a precaution. The substance was later found to be harmless. The four MPs who received the letters are from South Asian backgrounds. One of the MPs, Ealing Central and Acton's Rupa Huq, said her package was a ""Punish a Muslim"" letter. The three other MPs to receive suspicious items were Bedford MP Mohammad Yasin, Bethnal Green's Rushanara Ali and Afzal Khan, MP for Manchester Gorton. On Tuesday, a Parliamentary spokesman said items of mail containing suspicious substances had been investigated by the Met Police and were not found to be hazardous. ""The affected areas were temporarily cordoned off but no evacuation was necessary,"" the spokesman added. ""One person attended hospital as a precaution."" Parliament has emailed all staff, warning them to ""be on the alert for suspicious items of mail"". Ms Huq tweeted: ""Staffer who went to hospital now discharged. There is a definite pattern. It was the letter that did the rounds at weekend and subject of Parliamentary urgent question yesterday which was received. Normal service now resumed - though scary experience."" She later told the BBC it was worrying the packages had got through security in the House of Commons but ""it was even more worrying that someone out there thinks it is open season on Muslim MPs"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the letters and packages being circulated were ""utterly contemptible"". ""Labour is committed to tackling Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate crime, as well as all other forms of bigotry, racism and xenophobia,"" he said.

"University staff will decide on Tuesday whether to back the deal announced by unions and employers An agreement has been reached by university union leaders and employers to end the strike over pension cuts. But there have been calls from some strikers to turn down the deal and push for a more ""decisive victory"". If the deal is backed by union representatives meeting on Tuesday, the strike will be suspended. The agreement would mean a new, independent re-evaluation of the pension deficit and temporary arrangements to tackle the funding gap. But an open letter has called the agreement ""completely unacceptable"" and wants university staff to reject the deal reached by the University and College Union's negotiators. Now in its fourth week, the strike has seen classes cancelled in more than 60 universities, with the threat of disruption for end-of-year exams and assessments. The universities minister Sam Gyimah had called for students to be given refunds on fees for lost teaching time. On Monday evening an agreement was announced by the UCU and Universities UK, after talks at the Acas conciliation service. The disputed changes to pensions would be put on hold - and a temporary deal would tackle the deficit, with talks to re-open on long-term pension arrangements from 2020. There would also be an independent re-evaluation of the size of the pension scheme's deficit. The agreement also indicates that universities would be expected to re-schedule classes disrupted by the strike. UCU representatives will meet on Tuesday - and if the deal is accepted, the strike will be suspended from Wednesday. But there have been calls on social media for university staff to reject the deal announced by their union's leadership. An open letter opposing the deal says that it is only postponing long-term decisions about the pension scheme and says university staff should continue to campaign to ""force a more decisive victory"". Universities UK has asked university vice chancellors to say whether they will back the deal by Wednesday afternoon. It seems likely that many university heads would support the deal agreed with the union. But the university representative body has told vice chancellors that if the agreement is not accepted the previous pensions proposal would be reinstated, with the ""likely outcome"" that there would be more strikes in April and May.

"Ahmed Hassan said he had a fantasy about being a fugitive after watching lots of action movies The Iraqi asylum seeker accused of planting a bomb on a Tube train at Parsons Green has said it became a ""fantasy"" for him when he was ""very bored"" over the school holidays. Ahmed Hassan, 18, admitted building the device that partially detonated on the District Line on 15 September 2017. Mr Hassan told the court the ""idea of being chased by police and in Europe by Interpol... was very attractive"". He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. He said the fantasy was about being a fugitive and getting away, rather than the bomb, saying he ""wanted attention"". Mr Hassan added: ""The idea of killing another human being never crossed my mind at all. Never in my life."" When the prosecution asked if he regretted his actions, he said: ""I regret [it] very much every day... and I wish I hadn't done it. I wish I could travel back in time. ""I am very sorry but it can't be undone."" However, prosecutor Alison Morgan said it was ""a very calculated act of anger"". The teenager told the Old Bailey he did not like having time off from school and had not been sleeping because of bad dreams. ""The school holidays were basically my enemy,"" said Mr Hassan. ""I didn't like it because there was nothing to do. I would get very bored."" The restless teenager would then watch lots of action movies and documentaries about fugitives, as well as drinking up to six energy drinks each day. The court also heard he had considered suicide ""many many times"". This video can not be played The court has seen CCTV of the blast which showed what one witness described as a ""rolling fireball"" The court heard how Mr Hassan made TATP explosives two days before the attack from chemicals he had bought, after he had already assembled a timer by following a ""step-by-step"" guide online. He then went on to test the explosive the next day in a fizzy drink can on the kitchen table of his foster home in Sunbury, Surrey. Mr Hassan told jurors: ""I heard a 'whoof' and a very small heat, fire, for a fraction of a second."" He said he was certain that the substance ""would not explode"" and ""it would just burn"". But Ms Morgan said he ""knew precisely"" what TATP was and what would happen. She claimed Mr Hassan had lied about testing the chemical compound on the table as there were no burn marks or traces of explosives found on it. When he refused to watch the CCTV of the explosion in court, she said: ""Well I will tell you then - there's a huge fireball that rips its way through that carriage, and you say that's what you intended to happen?"" Mr Hassan replied: ""I knew it would make a fire as it did in the test."" Ms Morgan asked what an ""acceptable level of injury"" would have been, but he said he had not thought about it. Apologising for his actions, he added: ""I know how hard it is to have trauma... and also for people who cared for me in this country. Now I think this is wrong."" Earlier, Mr Hassan, an Iraqi asylum seeker, denied having any contact with the Islamic State group in Iraq. Prosecutors said that he had told Home Office officials 20 months before the attack that he had been kidnapped by IS and trained to kill. But the teenager told jurors he had lied to improve his case for asylum after being given advice by other migrants he met when he was in the so-called Jungle camp in Calais. ""I came from a wealthy part of Northern Iraq and if I told them that they would have deported me,"" he said. ""In the Jungle in Calais, people used to talk about these things and make up stories. ""I never came across a refugee who said he would tell the truth when he arrived in the country."" Mr Hassan described his journey to the UK, first from Iraq to Turkey, then on to Italy where he claimed he had been ""abused"" by the Italian authorities. He travelled from there to Paris and then to Calais, where he stayed for around two months before entering the UK on a lorry in October 2015. He was then taken to Bay Tree, a Barnardo's home in Horley, Surrey, where he was for about six months, saying it was a ""relief"" after the refugee camp. Mr Hassan was enrolled on a two-year media course at Brooklands College in Weybridge, Surrey, and his ""ultimate goal"" was to become a wildlife photographer, ""like David Attenborough"". The teenager claimed to have won a student of the year prize six times in a row in Iraq, and was awarded another at his college in June 2017. He described himself as a Sunni Muslim and said he prayed five times a day, but when asked if he cared about people being from other faiths, he said: ""Not at all, not in the slightest."" CCTV allegedly showed Ahmed Hassan exiting Putney Bridge, the stop before Parsons Green Mr Hassan also told the jury that both his parents were dead. He said he was too young to remember his mother, but remembered his father, who died ""in an explosion while he was working as a taxi driver."" He added: ""He used to go to work and come back evenings and then he did not come back. ""It was very difficult. I did not understand what was going on. I was in a state of confusion because of fighting, because of bombing."" On Monday, the court heard from the prosecution that Mr Hassan blamed the UK and US for the deaths of his parents, and that he believed his father had been killed by an American bomb. College lecturer Kayte Cable said Ahmed Hassan told her it was ""his duty to hate Britain"" because of what happened to his family. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Victim: I will do whatever it takes to keep Worboys behind bars The Parole Board failed to consider ""critical evidence"" against rapist John Worboys before approving his prison release, a lawyer for two of his victims has told the High Court. The lawyer said the evidence related to ""wider allegations"" of sexual attacks. Police believe that Worboys - jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women in London - had more than 100 victims. Lawyer Phillippa Kaufmann QC said the board was wrong to decide Worboys took ""full responsibility"" for his crimes. Worboys is thought to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in the capital between 2002 and 2008. The 60-year-old, who has changed his name to John Radford, is watching the trial via video link from prison. The court heard he denies any allegation other than the offences he was convicted of. Legal papers submitted to the High Court show that as recently as September last year, the prison authorities believed he posed such a risk that he needed to remain in a Category A prison. Three months later the Parole Board decided that he should be let out with stringent licence conditions, without having been assessed at a less secure prison. Ms Kaufmann said this ""highly exceptional step"" was ""in the face of opposition"" from senior prison managers, prison psychologists, the probation service and the justice secretary. John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women Ms Kaufmann said the claims of Worboys' further crimes ""completely undermined"" the board's decision. She told the court: ""It is obvious, absolutely obvious, that this evidence of wider offending had a central bearing on all of those conclusions that formed the basis of the Parole Board's conclusion that there had been a reduction in risk."" Ms Kaufmann added it would have been fair to consider these allegations as the board did not have to determine whether he had actually committed the crimes. She said it would be ""extraordinary"" to release Worboys straight from a Category A prison, the highest security prison, into the community. At last, the cloak of secrecy surrounding the Parole Board's decision-making in this case has been lifted. Thanks to the judicial review challenge the public, and John Worboys' victims, can find out why the Board ruled it was safe to release him. Its decision was apparently influenced by assessments from three independent psychologists all of whom at some stage had been instructed by Worboys. One expert initially recommended he be moved from HMP Wakefield, a high security jail, to an 'open' prison, which allows inmates more freedom. That's the usual route to eventual release, taken by those serving life or indeterminate sentences. It enables the authorities to test whether prisoners can be trusted in a less secure environment where they're allowed to spend time working in the community. But the psychologist later changed their view and agreed with two other psychologists that the 60-year-old sex offender should be let out straight away - direct from Wakefield jail. To be released from a Category A prison, the court heard, is ""very unusual"".  Nevertheless,  their advice was accepted by the three-member parole panel, resulting in this landmark legal challenge. Ahead of the High Court challenge against the decision to grant him parole, victims said they were not properly informed and warned of risks to women's safety. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has also launched a judicial review against the action to free the former black-cab driver. During the High Court challenge, three judges are hearing evidence over two days from victims and Mr Khan. As the case got under way, Mr Khan said in a statement that Worboys presented a ""significant threat"" to safety. He said: ""I have been clear that he shouldn't be released at the very least until the decision has been properly independently scrutinised and we are reassured that those in positions of power and responsibility are doing everything they can to keep all his victims, and the rest of us, safe."" The Sun newspaper is also part of the legal challenge, after it was granted permission last month to challenge the Parole Board over not publishing its decision. The Parole Boardhas previously apologised to victimswho were not told about the decision but said it was ""confident"" Worboys would not re-offend. The case continues.

"The crash is the worst aviation disaster to hit Nepal in years Survivors and witnesses of a plane crash in Nepal have described the chaotic moments when the aircraft went down, killing at least 49 people. The flight, carrying 71 passengers and crew, crashed while landing at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan airport. Witnesses said there was a loud bang and that the plane shook violently while people wept inside the aircraft and chanted. The cause of the crash remains unclear, and an investigation is under way. The flight data recorder has been retrieved from the wreckage. Did faulty communication cause crash? It is the worst aviation disaster to hit Nepal in years. The Himalayan nation has a chequered history when it comes to air safety, with more than 70 crashes involving planes and helicopters since 1949, the year the first aircraft landed there. Most accidents have been attributed to bad weather, inexperienced pilots and inadequate maintenance. This video can not be played Witnesses describe seeing the plane shaking This aircraft was a 17-year-old Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 turboprop flying from the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka and was being operated by Bangladeshi airline US-Bangla. One survivor recalled the fire, but not how he made his way out of the aircraft. ""After the crash I was trying to [get] out of the plane because it was on fire but I could not, my hand and leg was trapped,"" Keshav Pandey told BBC Nepali. ""I was on the seat by the side of the emergency door, [so] maybe I fell outside when [security came] and they opened the door. After that I don't remember anything, I was unconscious."" Several people were rescued from the wreckage of the plane Another survivor also described the moment of impact to BBC Nepali. ""There was a huge fire outside and smoke gushed into our cabin. Then there was [an] explosion. The fire was extinguished and we were rescued outside,"" Sharin Ahmed, a 29-year old teacher from Bangladesh said. ""All of a sudden the plane shook violently and there was a loud bang,"" Basanta Bohora told reporters from his hospital bed. ""I was seated near a window and was able to break out."" Basanta Bohora, who escaped the plane, is recovering in hospital ""The plane was going up down, right and left, up down. So I thought that was some air traffic only,"" Sanam Shakya, who also escaped through a window, told AFP. Shradha Giri, who was on board a  nearby plane with her daughter, told the BBC: ""There was a lot of chaos out there, lot of security personnel running towards it, a lot of ambulances and fire trucks approaching the site where it had crashed."" ""It was traumatising just to be with my little girl out there...everybody was shaken up because just something like that to happen in front of your eyes."" The general manager of Tribhuvan airport, Raj Kumar Chhetri, also told BBC Nepali that relatives of the victims and survivors are set to arrive in Nepal on Tuesday. Most of those on the plane were Nepalese and Bangladeshis. A number of survivors remain in hospital. It is still not clear what caused the crash. While the airline blames air traffic control, the airport says the plane landed from the wrong direction. The cause of the crash has not been determined A recording of the conversation between the pilot and air traffic control minutes before the plane crashed suggests some misunderstanding over which end of the sole runway the plane was cleared to land on. ""Unfortunately unclear communications have been the cause of past crashes,"" aviation analyst Greg Waldron of Flight Global told the BBC. ""This is true both of ground to air communications, as well as crew communications in the cockpit."" Nepal is seen as one of the world's more dangerous places to fly. In addition to the mountainous terrain, quick-changing weather conditions add to the challenges for the pilots. ""Meteorological data from the time of this crash suggest there were thunderstorms in the vicinity, with a variable crosswind from the west,"" Mr Waldron explains. Monday's crash was the deadliest since a Pakistan International Airlines plane crashed in 1992, killing all 167 on board.

"Qualcomm has already showcased 1Gbps mobile internet speeds using a 5G chip US President Donald Trump has blocked a planned takeover of chipmaker Qualcomm by Singapore-based rival Broadcom on grounds of national security. His order cited ""credible evidence"" that the proposed $140bn (Â£100bn) deal ""threatens to impair the national security of the US"". There were concerns the takeover could have led to China pulling ahead in the development of 5G wireless technology. The deal would have been the biggest technology sector takeover on record. A takeover of Qualcomm by Broadcom would have created the world's third-largest maker of microchips, behind Intel and Samsung. The chipmaking sector is in a race to develop chips for the latest 5G wireless technology and Qualcomm is considered to be a leader in this field, followed by Broadcom and China's telecoms giant Huawei. US blocks sale of Moneygram to China's Ant Financial Huawei's US smartphone deal collapses Analysts say Qualcomm is highly regarded for its commitment to research and development (R&D), particularly in the field of 5G technology. Huawei is equally committed to R&D in the area. However, Broadcom is better known for selling assets and growing through acquisitions, and deemed to be weaker on R&D. With this in mind, analysts have said a deal between Qualcomm and Broadcom could have given Huawei the chance to take over the top spot in years to come - a situation US politicians wanted to prevent given their ongoing security concerns around Chinese telecom firms doing business with US carriers. Others have said Mr Trump's decision was more about competitiveness than security concerns. ""Given the current political climate in the US and other regions around the world, everyone is taking a more conservative view on mergers and acquisitions and protecting their own domains,"" said Mario Morales, vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at global research firm IDC. ""We are all at the start of a race, and you have 5G as a crown jewel that everyone wants to participate in - and every region is racing towards that,"" he told the BBC. ""Semiconductor technology and companies like Qualcomm will be an important weapon in that 5G arms race [and] the US like other nations and regions want to be first."" Is there a pattern emerging in President Trump's use of national security concerns as an international economic weapon? Perhaps, but his predecessor, Barack Obama did use the issue to block takeovers, including a technology acquisition attempted by a Chinese investment fund. The would-be acquirer in the current case is not Chinese, but the concern expressed by the Committee on Foreign Investment was about creating space for an increased Chinese presence in 5G wireless technology. Mr Trump has also invoked security concerns in slapping new tariffs on imported steel and aluminium. There are plenty of people who don't believe it. The EU's Trade Commissioner Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m called it a ""safeguard in disguise"" - a response to a surge in imports that affects a country's own industry. Mr Trump's willingness to grant exemptions, partly on the basis of what he sees as a fair trade relationship with the US, is consistent with the idea that it's not just about security. Broadcom said it was reviewing the order and ""strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns"". The company had been pursuing San Diego-based Qualcomm for about four months. Last week, however,Broadcom's hostile takeover bid was put under investigationby the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), a multi-agency body led by the US Treasury Department. The US company had rejected approaches from its rival on the grounds that the offer undervalued the business, and also that any takeover would face antitrust hurdles. Earlier this year, Chinese telecoms giant Huawei said it hadnot been able to strike a deal to sell its new smartphone via a US carrier, widely believed to be AT&T. The US alsorecently blocked the $1.2bn sale of money transfer firm Moneygram to China's Ant Financial, the digital payments arm of Alibaba.

Lawyer Phillippa Kaufmann QC said the board was wrong to decide Worboys took ""full responsibility"" for his crimes. Worboys is thought to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in the capital between 2002 and 2008. The 60-year-old, who has changed his name to John Radford, is watching the trial via video link from prison. The court heard he denies any allegation other than the offences he was convicted of. Legal papers submitted to the High Court show that as recently as September last year, the prison authorities believed he posed such a risk that he needed to remain in a Category A prison. Three months later the Parole Board decided that he should be let out with stringent licence conditions, without having been assessed at a less secure prison. Ms Kaufmann said this ""highly exceptional step"" was ""in the face of opposition"" from senior prison managers, prison psychologists, the probation service and the justice secretary. John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women Ms Kaufmann said the claims of Worboys' further crimes ""completely undermined"" the board's decision. She told the court: ""It is obvious, absolutely obvious, that this evidence of wider offending had a central bearing on all of those conclusions that formed the basis of the Parole Board's conclusion that there had been a reduction in risk."" Ms Kaufmann added it would have been fair to consider these allegations as the board did not have to determine whether he had actually committed the crimes. She said it would be ""extraordinary"" to release Worboys straight from a Category A prison, the highest security prison, into the community. At last, the cloak of secrecy surrounding the Parole Board's decision-making in this case has been lifted. Thanks to the judicial review challenge the public, and John Worboys' victims, can find out why the Board ruled it was safe to release him. Its decision was apparently influenced by assessments from three independent psychologists all of whom at some stage had been instructed by Worboys. One expert initially recommended he be moved from HMP Wakefield, a high security jail, to an 'open' prison, which allows inmates more freedom. That's the usual route to eventual release, taken by those serving life or indeterminate sentences. It enables the authorities to test whether prisoners can be trusted in a less secure environment where they're allowed to spend time working in the community. But the psychologist later changed their view and agreed with two other psychologists that the 60-year-old sex offender should be let out straight away - direct from Wakefield jail. To be released from a Category A prison, the court heard, is ""very unusual"".  Nevertheless,  their advice was accepted by the three-member parole panel, resulting in this landmark legal challenge. Ahead of the High Court challenge against the decision to grant him parole, victims said they were not properly informed and warned of risks to women's safety. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has also launched a judicial review against the action to free the former black-cab driver. During the High Court challenge, three judges are hearing evidence over two days from victims and Mr Khan. As the case got under way, Mr Khan said in a statement that Worboys presented a ""significant threat"" to safety. He said: ""I have been clear that he shouldn't be released at the very least until the decision has been properly independently scrutinised and we are reassured that those in positions of power and responsibility are doing everything they can to keep all his victims, and the rest of us, safe."" The Sun newspaper is also part of the legal challenge, after it was granted permission last month to challenge the Parole Board over not publishing its decision. The Parole Boardhas previously apologised to victimswho were not told about the decision but said it was ""confident"" Worboys would not re-offend. The case continues.

"Mr Pochin made a daily commute to Ipswich railway station A commuter fed up with ""continually"" delayed trains has won a legal bid for compensation against the rail company. Seph Pochin, of Halesworth, Suffolk, had described the service between his home and Ipswich as ""woeful"", with one train delayed by 100 minutes. A warrant has now been issued for bailiffs to seize Greater Anglia (GA) property after it failed to pay him Â£350 compensation. GA confirmed it was in a legal dispute with Mr Pochin but could not comment. Mr Pochin, an ecologist, who moved to Halesworth a year ago, said he was considering moving to Ipswich to avoid the delays, which he claims added up to almost 28 hours over 12 months. Between February 2017 and February 2018, he made 550 journeys and recorded 183 delays. Greater Anglia has been ordered to pay Seph Pochin compensation According to his figures, the majority of trains were between one and 10 minutes late. Mr Pochin said 26 journeys were late by more than 15 minutes, with the 100-minute delay on a journey last August. GA has a delay-repay scheme, paying out compensation for journeys more than 30 minutes late. Rail delays: How to get your money back How 10,000 Millennials are getting their own railcards Why is my train cancelled in cold weather? Mr Pochin, who corresponded regularly with the firm about the quality of the service, said the 100-minute delay was the last straw. Using the Consumer Rights Act 2016,external, he paid Â£35 to lodge a case at a small claims court ""to highlight the regular deficiencies with the service"". In September, Mr Pochin and the rail company both agreed to mediation to resolve the matter. But after GA failed to provide dates to meet, Mr Pochin applied for a judgement ruling, which he won in December, and the train operator was ordered to pay him Â£350. In February, after failing to get this money, Mr Pochin paid Â£77 for a warrant to be served on GA to seize assets worth Â£350. The courts and tribunal service confirmed a warrant had been issued against GA, which will now have to pay the sum or face the bailiffs. Greater Anglia pays compensation for journeys that are more than 30 minutes late GA admitted 23% of delays were ""directly attributable to Greater Anglia due to incidents such as train faults"". A spokeswoman said the lines Mr Pochin travels on were being upgraded by Network Rail in a Â£68m scheme ""to make the train service more reliable"". The legislation Mr Pochin used gives rail passengers the same legal protection they receive when paying for other goods and services. ""Hopefully, this case will result in train operators making compensation for delays easier to get,"" Stephen Joseph, of the Campaign for Better Transport said. ""However, passengers in general don't want compensation, they want trains that run on time.""

"The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting in November about North Korea's nuclear ambitions A leaked draft of a United Nations report claims two Singapore companies have violated UN sanctions by supplying luxury goods to North Korea. The final report has been submitted to the UN Security Council, and is likely to be published later this week. Singapore's government said it was aware of the cases and had begun investigating where there was ""credible information"" of possible offences. Both the UN and Singapore ban the sale of luxury goods to North Korea. Global sanctions against North Korea have tightened considerably over the last two years as Pyongyang has continued to conduct nuclear tests and launch missiles. Despite the recent development that unprecedented talks between North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump may take place later this year, UN sanctions against North Korea will remain in place. Analysts say the alleged violations by Singapore companies, if proven, raise questions about how widespread such breaches might be across Asia. The leaked UN report highlights two Singapore-based firms, among others in Asia. It alleges the two firms supplied a range of luxury goods to North Korea, including wines and spirits, until as recently as July 2017. Under UN Sanctions,it has been illegal to sell luxury items to North Korea,externalsince 2006.  And Singapore's lawshave banned the sale of these items to North Korea,externalfor several years. A store in Pyongyang displays imported alcohol products - many of which are banned under UN sanctions The two Singapore-based firms under investigation are OCN and T Specialist. They are sister companies and share the same director. Both the companies have denied any wrongdoing. The UN report also claims between 2011 and 2014 ""transactions valued at more than $2m (Â£1.4m)"" - allegedly proceeds from the sale of goods in North Korea - flowed from an account that OCN and T Specialist set up in a North Korean bank, Daedong Credit Bank, to T Specialist's bank accounts in Singapore. Singapore has banned its financial institutions from providing financial assistance or services for facilitating any trade with North Korea, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. T Specialist has testified to the UN that the funds did not come from North Korea but a company registered in Hong Kong, and related to sales before 2012. Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? The political gamble of the 21st Century North Korea-Trump talks in 400 words US-N Korea talks: What could happen now? The two companies are also accused by the UN of having ""long-standing, close ties"" - including ownership ties -  with Ryugyong Commercial Bank,a bank the US put on its sanctions list in 2017,external. The Singaporean companies said they have no interests in the bank. Their lawyer, Edmond Pereira, has confirmed they are under investigation by Singapore authorities, but insisted they did not have any current financial links, interests, or any sort of relationship with entities in North Korea. Mr Pereira acknowledged that his clients ""have done business with North Korean entities... before the UN sanctions came into force"". He added the companies had ""reduced their involvement"" in North Korea but that ""these things take a bit of time"". Lawyers have said part of the problem is these sanctions are expected to be enforced by companies who are often unaware of the changes in the law. Singapore has banned its financial institutions from providing financial assistance or services for facilitating any trade with North Korea It was only in November last year thatSingapore banned trade with North Korea entirely. Before that, some trade was allowed. The UN report claims some of the transactions in the OCN and T Specialist cases appear to have used the Singapore financial system. It also said it was the responsibility of member countries to make sure their banks had a more ""robust scrutiny"" of individuals and companies opening accounts with them. The BBC contacted the two Singapore banks mentioned in the report. Both banks declined to comment, citing Singapore's banking secrecy laws. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) told the BBC it was working closely with the UN on these cases. ""MAS will take stern action against any financial institutions in breach of regulations relating to proliferation financing,"" MAS said in a statement sent to the BBC. The authority also said it expected banks to be aware of ""the use of multi-jurisdictional front companies, shell companies, joint ventures, and complex or opaque ownership structures"". William Newcomb, a former member on the UN Panel of Experts, said it was precisely these financial loopholes North Korea seeks to exploit. ""What they will do is set up a shell company, then establish a company in another location, a bank in a third location, and do business in another location,"" he explained. ""And now you have multiple jurisdictions involved. So it becomes quite complicated, and it's one of the techniques they use to defeat the sanctions."" This video can not be played Was your T-shirt made in North Korea? Financial crime researchers say it is difficult for banks to catch this sort of behaviour. ""You would probably never know that the funds were coming from North Korea,"" said Tim Phillipps, Asia Pacific Leader for Deloitte's Financial Crime Network. He added the problem could be much bigger across South East Asia. ""If you're named in a report in this environment in Singapore, the MAS are highly likely to demand extensive transaction history examination. ""But if you start to look across the other countries in South East Asia, they generally haven't got the maturity of systems to prevent this."" The UN report highlights how easily entities allegedly doing business with North Korea might potentially find loopholes to use  - even in sophisticated financial systems like Singapore's.

"There won't be a red box brandished on the steps of Number 11, a pint won't be up a penny or down a couple, and the chancellor certainly won't have to reach for a stiffener under the despatch box, like some of his predecessors who had a whiskey stashed there for the odd sip or two to get through a marathon Parliamentary statement. What there also will not be in Philip Hammond's spring statement are grand gestures of new spending; no big cheques being signed by Mr Hammond to portion out your money. With the balance of the books improving, the chancellor might sound a bit cheerier than at his last big outing. The public spending numbers appear much healthier than before Christmas. Unless he undergoes a personality transplant overnight, however, he's hardly going to be chucking money about with abandon. Expect instead a focus on paying down the debt and taking a ""balanced approach"" - that's the government's code for carrying on with tight public spending to pay off the public debt. The argument over the deficit may be over, mostly. But the government wants now to focus on the debt. The Hammond case is that we might have cleared the overdraft, but we still have a hefty mortgage that needs to be paid down. But just because Tuesday's spring statement will be skimpy, it doesn't mean there aren't bigger conversations about the future of the public purse going on. In fact, senior figures in government have told me there are discussions going on in government about one of the biggest political priorities of all - the NHS. Several senior sources say that, at the end of January, the cabinet discussed ways of getting more money into the health service in the long term. That included the foreign secretary's by now familiar argument about the hoped-for but disputed Brexit dividend. But more intriguingly for a Conservative government, I'm told that the cabinet discussed the possibility of tax rises to fund more spending for the NHS, even a hypothecated tax,as spelled out by senior MPs like Nick Boles. This does seem to be rather a change of heart. For months last year, and on the general election trail, the prime minister maintained, time and again, that the NHS has the money that it needs - the funds that it requested. With the opposition and senior Tories calling for a long-term look at the levels of cash, the line seemed to stay the same. In January this year, the prime minister repeated that ""we have put money in that was asked for in that review, and we've actually put some extra money in, in the spring statement and the Budget last  year to deal with this. ""You keep talking about the money but actually what you also need to look at is how the NHS works."" Behind closed doors however, that position is shifting. One cabinet minister told me ""most of us accept now that something has to happen - we have to find a way"". Another said: ""It's hard to see how healthcare won't need more money"". A different cabinet minister accepted that ""conversations are very live"" about the best way to make sure that the NHS is getting what it needs. There is no consensus in government yet about the right way to go. Number 10 isn't suddenly about to turn the spending taps on and flood the health service with money. But at the highest levels of government there is a growing acceptance that the NHS will need more cash, even if the government is far from settling when or how.

"This video can not be played Carragher sorry for 'awful behaviour' Former Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher has apologised again for the ""awful"" spitting incident which led to his suspension by Sky Sports. Carragher was filmed spitting from his car towards a girl in another vehicle after Liverpool's 2-1 Premier League loss at Manchester United on Saturday. Sky suspended the pundit, saying it takes the matter ""extremely seriously"". ""Hopefully I'm judged not right now but over a longer period of time,"" the 40-year-old told BBC Sport. ""Hopefully I'm given the opportunity to show people the real me, who they've seen for the last 20 years or so."" Carragher made 737 appearances for Liverpool and won 38 England caps. A Danish television channel has pulled himfrom its coverage of United's Champions League game against Sevilla at Old Trafford on Tuesday. The girl's parents have said they do not want Carragher to be sacked,according to the Mirror,external, with the father saying: ""He seems contrite. Everyone makes mistakes, we are all human."" This video can not be played Jamie Carragher caught on camera 'spitting' from his car In the video obtained bythe Mirror,,externalLiverpudlian Carragher exchanges waves with the girl's dad. Carragher then winds down his window while the girl's dad winds down his passenger-side window. The dad can then be heard shouting: ""Unlucky Jamie lad. Two, one."" Carragher reacts by leaning out of his window and spitting towards the car, hitting the girl, who is sitting in the front passenger seat. Read more: Why is spitting so bad? Listen: Spitting the lowest of the low - Savage He apologised on Twitter on Sunday, and said he was ""goaded three/four times while being filmed"" but there was ""no excuse"". Carragher has been a regular TV pundit since his retirement from football in 2013 Speaking to the BBC on Monday, he said: ""It looks awful and I accept that. It's not something I've done before and not something I'll do again. ""It's a stain on my character and I have to accept that."" Carragher, who has two children, said he would condemn someone else had they behaved in a similar way. ""If I was watching someone do that, I'd be commenting or tweeting about it myself,"" he said. ""There's not a person in the world who can condone spitting no matter what's gone on. ""I knew there was someone else in the car, and I knew it was a female, but I didn't know it was a young girl. ""When I lost it, my rage was focused on the man across me with a camera in his hand, but no matter what he was doing my reaction was unacceptable."" This video can not be played Carragher will 'apologise again' for spitting incident Greater Manchester Police said on Monday they were not investigating the incident, and had received no complaint from the man driving the car Carragher spat at. Carragher, who said he had apologised over the phone to the family involved, said he would accept any consequences. He said: ""I'm in no position to question or disagree if someone wants to have a pop or the police want to speak to me. I've done a bad thing and have to accept whatever comes my way. ""I'm upset for them, my family and everyone involved. It's been something we all could have done without but all I can do now is apologise."" Asked if he had explained the incident to his family yet, Carragher said he had not as he had travelled down to London early on Monday. ""They will be aware of the media storm,"" he said. ""I've let my family down but I've let the family in the car opposite me down. They're my main worry for yesterday and today. ""That family won't be used to the media storm and being dragged into it. ""I got in touch with them last night and today is about going public and apologising to the family and the public watching who were offended and rightly so."" Sky's statement did not say how long Carragher's suspension would last. Asked about his future with the company, he said: ""We've met up today and it was about finding out the facts. ""They're disappointed I've dragged their name through the mud. That's not what they're about and I've let them down big time. ""I love my job and would love the opportunity to stay. ""Hopefully I'll be judged not right now but over a longer period of time and this incident won't cloud all of it but it's a big incident and it won't go away."" Carragher was due to act as a pundit for Danish television channel TV3 Sport - which is part of the Modern Times Group media company - on Tuesday. MTG Sport executive vice-president Peter Norrelund said his company had sent an employee to speak to Carragher before deciding what further action to take. ""I want to listen to his version,"" he said. ""With the impact of the story there was no need to send him to Old Trafford for the game."" Former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville works alongside Carragher for Sky Sports, and believes his colleague should keep his role. ""I've just watched Jamie Carragher say sorry,""he said.,external""No excuses, he's made a big mistake. ""He's massively passionate about football and he's overstepped the mark and shouldn't have reacted. ""I've been on TV for three years with him and, in my opinion, this isolated incident shouldn't stop us working together."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch said Carragher's behaviour was ""disgusting"" and Sky Sports were right to suspend him. ""I think spitting is disgusting full stop,"" she said at the Checkatrade EFL Community Club of the Year Awards. ""I think it's right Sky Sports have taken the action. ""I know he's apologised, he's right to apologise, it was absolutely disgusting. ""He has said himself he's a father and he wouldn't be happy with someone spitting at his daughter.

"Violence erupted in Marseilles ahead of the England-Russia match in June 2016 A Russian man has been taken into custody in Marseille over an attack at the Euro 2016 in which an English football fan was seriously injured. The 31-year-old suspect was handed over to France by Germany, where he was arrested last month. He was not named. If convicted, he could face up to 15 years in jail in for attempted homicide and grievous bodily harm. Police say Andrew Bache, 51, suffered fractured bones and injuries to the brain and lungs on 11 June 2016. Mr Bache, from Portsmouth, suffered severe brain injuries and had to be placed in an induced coma, from which he has since emerged. England and Russia fans clashed both inside and outside the stadium in June 2016 German federal police earlier said the Russian suspect was identified following a joint investigation with British police over the course of almost a year-and-a-half. He was arrested on 21 February during a flight change at Munich airport, while on his way to Bilbao in Spain for a Europa League game. Euro 2016 'not a return to hardcore hooliganism' What Russian fans say about the Marseille violence What motivates Russian hooligans? France jailed both Russia and England fans in the immediate aftermath of the Euro 2016 violence in the southern French city, and deported more than 20 others. The police officer credited with helping to save Mr Bache's life in 2016said people had described the scene as being similar to a zombie film. PC Stuart Dickerson saw ""about 150 Russian hooligans who were clearly trained in fighting"", wearing boxing gloves and gum-shields, and carrying metal bars and other weapons. ""It was like a load of locusts going through a cornfield,"" the British officer - on deployment in France - said. ""They were just randomly assaulting any England fan that was in their path.""

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond says economic growth forecasts have been revised. Chancellor Philip Hammond has unveiled upgraded projections for growth and predicted falling inflation and borrowing in his Spring Statement. He claimed the UK economy had reached a turning point and there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"". He ruled out an immediate end to austerity but hinted at possible spending rises in the future. Labour accused him of ""astounding complacency"" in the face of the worst ever public sector funding crisis. The chancellor resisted calls from Labour and some Tories to use the extra cash from an unexpected boost in tax receipts to ease the spending squeeze. But he said he would ""set an overall path for public spending for 2020 and beyond"" in his Autumn budget, with a detailed spending review in 2019.

At-a-glance: The key points The chancellor told MPs growth was forecast to be 1.5% this year, up from 1.4% forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in November, with the forecast for 2019 and 2020 unchanged at 1.3%. In his 26 minute statement he also said debt would be falling as a share of GDP from 2018-19, which would be the start of ""the first sustained fall in debt for 17 years, a turning point in the nation's recovery from the financial crisis of a decade ago"". Mr Hammond told MPs: ""That's the OBR's forecast, Mr Speaker, but forecasts are there to be beaten."" OBR chief Robert Chote said: ""Overall the referendum vote does seem to have weakened the economy as we and most other forecasters expected, but not quite as much as we forecast back in November 2016. ""Having said all this, we are still dealing with the very early drafts of economic history and it's important not to put too much weight on what are still early indicators of economic activity either side of the Brexit vote."" He said the UK was borrowing less than forecast this year thanks to more tax coming in from self-employed workers - revenues are Â£2.9bn higher than predicted. But he added: ""We don't expect much of that good news to push forward into future years."" Ahead of Mr Hammond's statement, the OECD said the UK economy will grow at a slower pace than any other major advanced or emerging nation this year, as it raised its growth forecast to 1.3% in 2018. Reality Check: Is the chancellor right that debt is shrinking? Why is chancellor so bullish about economy? The OBR has calculated that the UK will continue to pay contributions into the EU budget until 2064 - 45 years after the official date of Brexit - with the total ""withdrawal bill"" amounting to Â£37.1bn. The main reason for this is that the government will have an on-going liability for a proportion of EU staff's pensions earned while the UK was a member. Mr Hammond did not have much to say about Brexit in his statement - prompting opposition claims that he knew there would be no ""Brexit dividend"" for the UK economy. Mr Hammond said: ""Our economy does still face uncertainty as we go through the negotiation process with the European Union."" But he added that business confidence would improve as the government delivered ""greater clarity"" about its Brexit plans, adding: ""We beat the forecast in 2017, let's beat it again in 2018."" Reality Check: Brexit cash allocated to departments This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg interviews Philip Hammond Philip Hammond gave the clearest hint yet that he is prepared to increase spending on health, in an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg. The chancellor said he recognises the pressures for more spending in the NHS, local government ""and other areas"" and he hoped the improvement in the public finances ""hinted"" at by the OBR would allow him to increase spending in his Autumn budget. He acknowledged a ""continuous upward pressure"" on NHS spending because of an ageing population and developments in care. Kuenssberg: Hammond looks to next election Hammond's tough hand - Kamal Ahmed Hammond: I recognise pressures on NHS Mr Hammond did not use his Spring Statement as a ""mini-Budget"" as in previous years, and instead unveiled a series of consultations on future policies, including: A reduction in tax on for the least polluting vans to ""help the great British white van driver go green"" A possible tax onsingle use plastic A new'tech tax'looking at how firms like Google and Facebook are taxed A call for evidence ""on whether the use of non-agricultural red diesel tax relief contributes to poor air quality in urban areas"" The future of cash and digital payments, whichcould spell the end for 1p and 2p coins He also said the next revaluation for business rates is being brought forward to 2021, after which the government will move to revaluations every three years and there will be an additional Â£1.7bn to deliver 26,000 affordable homes in London. This video can not be played Speech in full: Hammond sees ""light at the end of tunnel"" This video can not be played Response in full: McDonnell on ""astounding complacency"" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""Does the chancellor really believe the NHS can wait another eight months for the lifesaving funds it needs? How many people have to die waiting in an ambulance before he acts?"" Mr McDonnell also raised concerns over funding for schools, the emergency services and local councils. He said ""austerity was a political choice not an economic necessity"", adding: ""We were never all in this together as they claimed."" The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said: ""The light at the end of the tunnel is a hard Brexit, which is going to cost jobs and prosperity in the this country."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said ""Brexit was dragging the economy down"" and the chancellor had been right not to turn on the public spending taps because there was still ""very little freedom"" in the public finances. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas tweeted: ""Tories celebrate a tiny improvement in growth in today's #SpringStatement, but GDP isn't a real measure of our society. True indicators are people being treated in hospital corridors & foodbank use shooting up. Our economy is designed to fail people - and it needs an overhaul."" Mr Hammond accused Labour of talking the economy down, comparing them to the gloomy character from Winnie the Pooh he has himself been likened to in the past. ""If there are any Eeyores in the chamber they are over there. I meanwhile am at my most positively Tiggerlike today, as I contemplate a country which faces the future with unique strengths."" Labour's shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne joked on Twitter that Mr Hammond was ""talking Pooh"".

"UK Prime Minister Theresa May has announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats in retaliation for the attack on a former spy and his daughter who were poisoned on British soil with a military-grade nerve agent. ""There is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable,"" Mrs May told Parliament, calling it ""an unlawful use of force"". Russia has denied involvement in the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, on 4 March. The 23 diplomats identified as ""undeclared intelligence officers"" were given one week to leave, in the largest mass expulsion in the UK in more than 30 years. The Russian embassy said the decision was ""unacceptable, unjustified and short-sighted"". Other measures included: Increased checks on private flights, customs and freight The freezing of Russian state assets where there is evidence they may be used to threaten the life or property of UK nationals or residents Ministers and Royal Family members to boycott the World Cup in Russia later this year The suspension of all planned high level bilateral contacts between the UK and Russia Plans to consider new laws to increase defences against ""hostile state activity"". This could come through a British version of the 2012 US Magnitsky act, which punishes Russians involved in corruption and human rights violations with asset freezes and travel bans. MPs have pushed for a Magnitsky amendment to be added to the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill going through Parliament Take some sort of action to bar wealthy Russian oligarchs from accessing their mansions and other luxuries in London, as suggested by Tory MP and House of Commons foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat. One way this could happen is through the use of Unexplained Wealth Orders, which allow government officials to seize assets including property until they have been properly accounted for Taking Russian broadcasters such as RT (formerly Russia Today) off the air.

Current sanctions on Russia that Britain supports,externalare imposed via the European Union, and target Russia's state finances, energy and arms sectors. They were first passed after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 and backed rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine, and include: The exclusion of state banks from raising long-term loans in the EU A ban on exports of dual-use equipment that could be put to military use and a ban on EU-Russia arms deals A ban on exports of a wide range of oil industry technology Asset freezes and travel bans on 150 people and 38 companies This video can not be played Vladimir Putin is challenged by the BBC over the Skripal poisoning EU countries are already divided on the sanctions and some doubt whether Britain could convince the bloc to further toughen its measures, especially as it prepares to leave the union. The bloc will discuss the issue in a meeting next week, European Council President Donald Tusk said, calling it a ""brutal attack inspired most likely by Moscow"". More on EU sanctions Oligarchs in UK told to explain wealth By framing the poisoning as a possible ""unlawful use of force"" by Russia, Theresa May prompted questions as to whether this could be a matter for Nato, the military alliance of 29 countries. The alliance's policy of collective defence - under Article 5 - states that an attack on any one ally is seen as an attack on all. It was invoked for the first and only time by the United States after the 9/11 attacks. This video can not be played Theresa May: Spy poisoned by ""military-grade nerve agent"" But Downing Street has played down suggestions that this is an Article 5 matter. For its part, Nato urged Russia to answer the UK's questions, expressing ""deep concern"" over the ""first offensive use of a nerve agent on alliance territory"" since its foundation. Sergei Skripal - the spy at centre of poison mystery What are Novichok nerve agents? The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting at the UK's request,where British deputy ambassador Jonathan Allen said Russia had used ""a weapon so horrific that it is banned in war"". At the meeting US Ambassador Nikki Haley said: ""The credibility of this council will not survive if we fail to hold Russia accountable."" And US President Donald Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has accused Russia of undermining the security of countries worldwide. Mrs May has had phone discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron, and a statement from the country's embassy said ""there is no other plausible explanation"" than Russian involvement. It added France expressed ""solidarity regarding its ally"". Police guard the Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury where traces of the nerve agent were found The UK has asked Russia to provide a ""full and complete disclosure"" of the Novichok nerve agent programme to an international agency, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

"The crash is the worst aviation disaster to hit Nepal in years Survivors and witnesses of a plane crash in Nepal have described the chaotic moments when the aircraft went down, killing at least 49 people. The flight, carrying 71 passengers and crew, crashed while landing at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan airport. Witnesses said there was a loud bang and that the plane shook violently while people wept inside the aircraft and chanted. The cause of the crash remains unclear, and an investigation is under way. The flight data recorder has been retrieved from the wreckage. Did faulty communication cause crash? It is the worst aviation disaster to hit Nepal in years. The Himalayan nation has a chequered history when it comes to air safety, with more than 70 crashes involving planes and helicopters since 1949, the year the first aircraft landed there. Most accidents have been attributed to bad weather, inexperienced pilots and inadequate maintenance. This video can not be played Witnesses describe seeing the plane shaking This aircraft was a 17-year-old Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 turboprop flying from the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka and was being operated by Bangladeshi airline US-Bangla. One survivor recalled the fire, but not how he made his way out of the aircraft. ""After the crash I was trying to [get] out of the plane because it was on fire but I could not, my hand and leg was trapped,"" Keshav Pandey told BBC Nepali. ""I was on the seat by the side of the emergency door, [so] maybe I fell outside when [security came] and they opened the door. After that I don't remember anything, I was unconscious."" Several people were rescued from the wreckage of the plane Another survivor also described the moment of impact to BBC Nepali. ""There was a huge fire outside and smoke gushed into our cabin. Then there was [an] explosion. The fire was extinguished and we were rescued outside,"" Sharin Ahmed, a 29-year old teacher from Bangladesh said. ""All of a sudden the plane shook violently and there was a loud bang,"" Basanta Bohora told reporters from his hospital bed. ""I was seated near a window and was able to break out."" Basanta Bohora, who escaped the plane, is recovering in hospital ""The plane was going up down, right and left, up down. So I thought that was some air traffic only,"" Sanam Shakya, who also escaped through a window, told AFP. Shradha Giri, who was on board a  nearby plane with her daughter, told the BBC: ""There was a lot of chaos out there, lot of security personnel running towards it, a lot of ambulances and fire trucks approaching the site where it had crashed."" ""It was traumatising just to be with my little girl out there...everybody was shaken up because just something like that to happen in front of your eyes."" The general manager of Tribhuvan airport, Raj Kumar Chhetri, also told BBC Nepali that relatives of the victims and survivors are set to arrive in Nepal on Tuesday. Most of those on the plane were Nepalese and Bangladeshis. A number of survivors remain in hospital. It is still not clear what caused the crash. While the airline blames air traffic control, the airport says the plane landed from the wrong direction. The cause of the crash has not been determined A recording of the conversation between the pilot and air traffic control minutes before the plane crashed suggests some misunderstanding over which end of the sole runway the plane was cleared to land on. ""Unfortunately unclear communications have been the cause of past crashes,"" aviation analyst Greg Waldron of Flight Global told the BBC. ""This is true both of ground to air communications, as well as crew communications in the cockpit."" Nepal is seen as one of the world's more dangerous places to fly. In addition to the mountainous terrain, quick-changing weather conditions add to the challenges for the pilots. ""Meteorological data from the time of this crash suggest there were thunderstorms in the vicinity, with a variable crosswind from the west,"" Mr Waldron explains.

"Qualcomm has already showcased 1Gbps mobile internet speeds using a 5G chip US President Donald Trump has blocked a planned takeover of chipmaker Qualcomm by Singapore-based rival Broadcom on grounds of national security. His order cited ""credible evidence"" that the proposed $140bn (Â£100bn) deal ""threatens to impair the national security of the US"". There were concerns the takeover could have led to China pulling ahead in the development of 5G wireless technology. The deal would have been the biggest technology sector takeover on record. A takeover of Qualcomm by Broadcom would have created the world's third-largest maker of microchips, behind Intel and Samsung. The chipmaking sector is in a race to develop chips for the latest 5G wireless technology and Qualcomm is considered to be a leader in this field, followed by Broadcom and China's telecoms giant Huawei. US blocks sale of Moneygram to China's Ant Financial Huawei's US smartphone deal collapses Analysts say Qualcomm is highly regarded for its commitment to research and development (R&D), particularly in the field of 5G technology. Huawei is equally committed to R&D in the area. However, Broadcom is better known for selling assets and growing through acquisitions, and deemed to be weaker on R&D. With this in mind, analysts have said a deal between Qualcomm and Broadcom could have given Huawei the chance to take over the top spot in years to come - a situation US politicians wanted to prevent given their ongoing security concerns around Chinese telecom firms doing business with US carriers. Others have said Mr Trump's decision was more about competitiveness than security concerns. ""Given the current political climate in the US and other regions around the world, everyone is taking a more conservative view on mergers and acquisitions and protecting their own domains,"" said Mario Morales, vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at global research firm IDC. ""We are all at the start of a race, and you have 5G as a crown jewel that everyone wants to participate in - and every region is racing towards that,"" he told the BBC. ""Semiconductor technology and companies like Qualcomm will be an important weapon in that 5G arms race [and] the US like other nations and regions want to be first."" Is there a pattern emerging in President Trump's use of national security concerns as an international economic weapon? Perhaps, but his predecessor, Barack Obama did use the issue to block takeovers, including a technology acquisition attempted by a Chinese investment fund. The would-be acquirer in the current case is not Chinese, but the concern expressed by the Committee on Foreign Investment was about creating space for an increased Chinese presence in 5G wireless technology. Mr Trump has also invoked security concerns in slapping new tariffs on imported steel and aluminium. There are plenty of people who don't believe it. The EU's Trade Commissioner Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m called it a ""safeguard in disguise"" - a response to a surge in imports that affects a country's own industry. Mr Trump's willingness to grant exemptions, partly on the basis of what he sees as a fair trade relationship with the US, is consistent with the idea that it's not just about security. Broadcom said it was reviewing the order and ""strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns"". The company had been pursuing San Diego-based Qualcomm for about four months. Last week, however,Broadcom's hostile takeover bid was put under investigationby the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), a multi-agency body led by the US Treasury Department. The US company had rejected approaches from its rival on the grounds that the offer undervalued the business, and also that any takeover would face antitrust hurdles. Earlier this year, Chinese telecoms giant Huawei said it hadnot been able to strike a deal to sell its new smartphone via a US carrier, widely believed to be AT&T. The US alsorecently blocked the $1.2bn sale of money transfer firm Moneygram to China's Ant Financial, the digital payments arm of Alibaba.

"Mr Pochin made a daily commute to Ipswich railway station A commuter fed up with ""continually"" delayed trains has won a legal bid for compensation against the rail company. Seph Pochin, of Halesworth, Suffolk, had described the service between his home and Ipswich as ""woeful"", with one train delayed by 100 minutes. A warrant has now been issued for bailiffs to seize Greater Anglia (GA) property after it failed to pay him Â£350 compensation. GA confirmed it was in a legal dispute with Mr Pochin but could not comment. Mr Pochin, an ecologist, who moved to Halesworth a year ago, said he was considering moving to Ipswich to avoid the delays, which he claims added up to almost 28 hours over 12 months. Between February 2017 and February 2018, he made 550 journeys and recorded 183 delays. Greater Anglia has been ordered to pay Seph Pochin compensation According to his figures, the majority of trains were between one and 10 minutes late. Mr Pochin said 26 journeys were late by more than 15 minutes, with the 100-minute delay on a journey last August. GA has a delay-repay scheme, paying out compensation for journeys more than 30 minutes late. Rail delays: How to get your money back How 10,000 Millennials are getting their own railcards Why is my train cancelled in cold weather? Mr Pochin, who corresponded regularly with the firm about the quality of the service, said the 100-minute delay was the last straw. Using the Consumer Rights Act 2016,external, he paid Â£35 to lodge a case at a small claims court ""to highlight the regular deficiencies with the service"". In September, Mr Pochin and the rail company both agreed to mediation to resolve the matter. But after GA failed to provide dates to meet, Mr Pochin applied for a judgement ruling, which he won in December, and the train operator was ordered to pay him Â£350. In February, after failing to get this money, Mr Pochin paid Â£77 for a warrant to be served on GA to seize assets worth Â£350. The courts and tribunal service confirmed a warrant had been issued against GA, which will now have to pay the sum or face the bailiffs. Greater Anglia pays compensation for journeys that are more than 30 minutes late GA admitted 23% of delays were ""directly attributable to Greater Anglia due to incidents such as train faults"". A spokeswoman said the lines Mr Pochin travels on were being upgraded by Network Rail in a Â£68m scheme ""to make the train service more reliable"". The legislation Mr Pochin used gives rail passengers the same legal protection they receive when paying for other goods and services. ""Hopefully, this case will result in train operators making compensation for delays easier to get,"" Stephen Joseph, of the Campaign for Better Transport said. ""However, passengers in general don't want compensation, they want trains that run on time.""

"Violence erupted in Marseilles ahead of the England-Russia match in June 2016 A Russian man has been taken into custody in Marseille over an attack at the Euro 2016 in which an English football fan was seriously injured. The 31-year-old suspect was handed over to France by Germany, where he was arrested last month. He was not named. If convicted, he could face up to 15 years in jail in for attempted homicide and grievous bodily harm. Police say Andrew Bache, 51, suffered fractured bones and injuries to the brain and lungs on 11 June 2016. Mr Bache, from Portsmouth, suffered severe brain injuries and had to be placed in an induced coma, from which he has since emerged. England and Russia fans clashed both inside and outside the stadium in June 2016 German federal police earlier said the Russian suspect was identified following a joint investigation with British police over the course of almost a year-and-a-half. He was arrested on 21 February during a flight change at Munich airport, while on his way to Bilbao in Spain for a Europa League game. Euro 2016 'not a return to hardcore hooliganism' What Russian fans say about the Marseille violence What motivates Russian hooligans? France jailed both Russia and England fans in the immediate aftermath of the Euro 2016 violence in the southern French city, and deported more than 20 others. The police officer credited with helping to save Mr Bache's life in 2016said people had described the scene as being similar to a zombie film. PC Stuart Dickerson saw ""about 150 Russian hooligans who were clearly trained in fighting"", wearing boxing gloves and gum-shields, and carrying metal bars and other weapons. ""It was like a load of locusts going through a cornfield,"" the British officer - on deployment in France - said. ""They were just randomly assaulting any England fan that was in their path.""

"This video can not be played Footage of the site where the US-Bangla plane came to rest A plane carrying 71 passengers and crew has crashed on landing at Nepal's Kathmandu airport, killing 49 people, according to police. Rescuers pulled bodies from the charred wreckage of the plane, operated by Bangladeshi airline US-Bangla, after a raging fire was put out. The airline has blamed air traffic control, but the airport says the plane approached from the wrong direction. Flight BS211 veered off the runway while landing on Monday afternoon. The exact cause of the crash remains unclear and Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli promised an immediate investigation. However, a recording of the conversation between the pilot and air traffic control minutes before the plane crashed suggests some misunderstanding over which end of the sole runway the plane was cleared to land on. Air disasters timeline Moments before the plane crash-landed, an air traffic controller is heard in the recording obtained by the BBC from air traffic monitor LiveATC telling the pilot: ""I say again, turn!"" Twenty-two people are being treated in hospital for injuries, police spokesperson Manoj Neupane told the BBC's Nepali service. The plane, which was flying from the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 turboprop and was 17 years old. The plane landed at 14:20 local time (08:35 GMT),according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24,external. A survivor said the plane had begun to behave strangely as it approached Kathmandu ""The aircraft was permitted to land from the southern side of the runway flying over Koteshwor, but it landed from the northern side,"" Sanjiv Gautam, director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, was quoted as saying by the Kathmandu Post. ""We are yet to ascertain the reason behind the unusual landing."" However, US-Bangla Airlines chief executive Imran Asif blamed Kathmandu air traffic control. ""There were wrong directions from the tower. Our pilot was not at fault,"" he told reporters at his office in Dhaka. ""Our pilot is an instructor of this Bombardier aircraft. His flight hours are over 5,000. There was a fumble from the control tower."" Airport general manager Raj Kumar Chettri told Reuters news agency that the plane hit the airport fence before touching ground. ""The plane should have come from the right direction,"" he said. Basanta Bohora, who escaped the plane, is recovering in hospital One of the survivors, Nepalese travel agent Basanta Bohora, described from his hospital bed what he had experienced. After a normal take-off from Dhaka, the plane had begun to behave strangely as it approached Kathmandu, he said. ""All of a sudden the plane shook violently and there was a loud bang afterwards,"",externalhe was quoted as saying by the Kathmandu Post. ""I was seated near the window and was able to break out of the window,"" he added. ""I have no recollection after I got out of the plane, someone took me to Sinamangal hospital, and from there my friends brought me to Norvic [hospital]. I have injuries to my head and legs, but I am fortunate that I survived."" The plane was carrying 67 passengers and four crew. It is now known that 33 of the passengers were Nepalis, 32 were Bangladeshi, one was Chinese and one was from the Maldives. Among the 22 people injured, some are in a critical condition. An airline worker said he saw two or three people fall or jump from the windows of the burning plane. Its airline companies are banned from flying within the European Union. The plane reportedly hit a fence before touching down and crashing There have been many aviation incidents in Nepal, but this is the deadliest since a Pakistan International Airlines plane crashed on approach in September 1992, killing all 167 on board. Earlier that same year, a Thai Airways plane crashed near the airport, leaving 113 people dead. Pilots say that landing at Kathmandu airport can be challenging because of the mountainous landscape. Recent aviation incidents in Nepal include: February 2016:Twenty-three people were killed when a small passenger plane crashed in mountainous western Nepal March 2015:Lucky escape for passengers after plane skids off runway in fog in Kathmandu February 2014: Bodies of all 18 people recovered after small plane crashes in western Nepal September 2012:Plane heading for Everest region crashes on the outskirts of Kathmandu, killing all 19 on board May 2012: Fifteen people die when a plane carrying Indian pilgrims crashes in northern Nepal September 2010:Sightseeing flight crashes into a hillside near Kathmandu September 2006:All 24 people on board a WWF helicopter die when it crashes in eastern Nepal The carrier launched in July 2014 and its slogan is ""Fly Fast, Fly Safe"". Its first international flight was in May 2016 - to Kathmandu. It now flies to airports in South and South East Asia and the Middle East.

"The former Nazi guard said he felt ""moral guilt"" for his actions at Auschwitz - but never served a day of his sentence A former Nazi SS guard who was known as the ""Bookkeeper of Auschwitz"" has died aged 96, German media report. In 2015 Oskar GrÃ¶ning was sentenced to four years' imprisonment, but never began his prison sentence due to a series of appeals. He died in a hospital on Friday, according to Spiegel Online. The pensioner was convicted of being an accessory to the murder of 300,000 Jews at the camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. His job at Auschwitz was to itemise money and valuables taken from new arrivals, who were then killed or subjected to slave labour. Though a court doctor found that he was fit for prison with appropriate medical supervision, his jail term was repeatedly delayed by ill-health and requests for clemency. Convicted Auschwitz guard asks for mercy Profile: Oskar GrÃ¶ning, 'bookkeeper of Auschwitz' Auschwitz inmate's notes from hell finally revealed The former Nazi officer began work at Auschwitz at the age of 21. During his trial, he said he had witnessed mass killings, but denied any direct role in the genocide. Addressing the judges, he said: ""I ask for forgiveness. I share morally in the guilt - but whether I am guilty under criminal law, you will have to decide."" This video can not be played Auschwitz: Drone footage from Nazi concentration camp He was convicted although there was no evidence linking him to specific killings. Presiding Judge Franz Kompisch said GrÃ¶ning was part of the ""machinery of death"" that helped the camp function smoothly. GrÃ¶ning's trial was considered a landmark case for Germany, where many former SS officers have walked free because there was no evidence linking them to individual deaths. German broadcaster DW says GrÃ¶ning will probably prove the last Nazi war criminal to have faced trial. Fewer than 50 of the estimated 6,500 Auschwitz guards who survived the war were ever convicted. Dr Efraim Zuroff, chief Nazi-hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center - a Holocaust research group - said GrÃ¶ning's death was ""unfortunate, at least on a symbolic level"". ""Without at least symbolic justice, these trials - as important as they are - lose an important part of their significance,"" he said. ""Their victims never had any appeals, nor did their tormentors have any mercy. Consequently these perpetrators don't deserve either."" Convicted SS guard Hanning dies before prison The Tattooist of Auschwitz - and his secret love The Holocaust: Who are the missing million? GrÃ¶ning was born in 1921 in Lower Saxony in Germany, and his mother died when he was four. His father was a proud nationalist, angry about the way Germany was treated under the peace settlement signed after World War One. That resentment increased when his textile business went bankrupt in 1929. GrÃ¶ning joined the Hitler Youth, and at 17 began training as a bank clerk. When war broke out, he wanted to follow in his grandfathers' footsteps and join an ""elite"" German army unit. He signed up to the Waffen SS and arrived in Auschwitz in 1942. It is estimated that 1.1 million people, most of them European Jews, died at Auschwitz When the war was over, GrÃ¶ning slipped into a quiet life in LÃ¼neburg Heath, Lower Saxony, where he worked in a glass-making factory. Decades later, when he heard people denying the Holocaust had ever happened, he was moved to break his silence. He was one of very few former concentration camp guards to do so. ""I saw the gas chambers. I saw the crematoria,"" he told the BBC in the 2005 documentary Auschwitz: the Nazis and the ""Final Solution"".

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond says economic growth forecasts have been revised. Chancellor Philip Hammond has unveiled upgraded projections for growth and predicted falling inflation and borrowing in his Spring Statement. He claimed the UK economy had reached a turning point and there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"". He ruled out an immediate end to austerity but hinted at possible spending rises in the future. Labour accused him of ""astounding complacency"" in the face of the worst ever public sector funding crisis. The chancellor resisted calls from Labour and some Tories to use the extra cash from an unexpected boost in tax receipts to ease the spending squeeze. But he said he would ""set an overall path for public spending for 2020 and beyond"" in his Autumn budget, with a detailed spending review in 2019. Labour: Hammond's 'astounding complacency' Reality Check: Is the chancellor right that debt is shrinking? At-a-glance: The key points The chancellor told MPs growth was forecast to be 1.5% this year, up from 1.4% forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in November, with the forecast for 2019 and 2020 unchanged at 1.3%. In his 26 minute statement he also said debt would be falling as a share of GDP from 2018-19, which would be the start of ""the first sustained fall in debt for 17 years, a turning point in the nation's recovery from the financial crisis of a decade ago"". Mr Hammond told MPs: ""That's the OBR's forecast, Mr Speaker, but forecasts are there to be beaten."" OBR chief Robert Chote said: ""Overall the referendum vote does seem to have weakened the economy as we and most other forecasters expected, but not quite as much as we forecast back in November 2016. ""Having said all this, we are still dealing with the very early drafts of economic history and it's important not to put too much weight on what are still early indicators of economic activity either side of the Brexit vote."" He said the UK was borrowing less than forecast this year thanks to more tax coming in from self-employed workers - revenues are Â£2.9bn higher than predicted. But he added: ""We don't expect much of that good news to push forward into future years."" Ahead of Mr Hammond's statement, the OECD said the UK economy will grow at a slower pace than any other major advanced or emerging nation this year, as it raised its growth forecast to 1.3% in 2018. Reality Check: Is the chancellor right that debt is shrinking? Why is chancellor so bullish about economy? The OBR has calculated that the UK will continue to pay contributions into the EU budget until 2064 - 45 years after the official date of Brexit - with the total ""withdrawal bill"" amounting to Â£37.1bn. The main reason for this is that the government will have an on-going liability for a proportion of EU staff's pensions earned while the UK was a member. Mr Hammond did not have much to say about Brexit in his statement - prompting opposition claims that he knew there would be no ""Brexit dividend"" for the UK economy. Mr Hammond said: ""Our economy does still face uncertainty as we go through the negotiation process with the European Union."" But he added that business confidence would improve as the government delivered ""greater clarity"" about its Brexit plans, adding: ""We beat the forecast in 2017, let's beat it again in 2018."" Reality Check: Brexit cash allocated to departments This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg interviews Philip Hammond Philip Hammond gave the clearest hint yet that he is prepared to increase spending on health, in an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg. The chancellor said he recognises the pressures for more spending in the NHS, local government ""and other areas"" and he hoped the improvement in the public finances ""hinted"" at by the OBR would allow him to increase spending in his Autumn budget. He acknowledged a ""continuous upward pressure"" on NHS spending because of an ageing population and developments in care. Kuenssberg: Hammond looks to next election Hammond's tough hand - Kamal Ahmed Hammond: I recognise pressures on NHS Mr Hammond did not use his Spring Statement as a ""mini-Budget"" as in previous years, and instead unveiled a series of consultations on future policies, including: A reduction in tax on for the least polluting vans to ""help the great British white van driver go green"" A possible tax onsingle use plastic A new'tech tax'looking at how firms like Google and Facebook are taxed A call for evidence ""on whether the use of non-agricultural red diesel tax relief contributes to poor air quality in urban areas"" The future of cash and digital payments, whichcould spell the end for 1p and 2p coins He also said the next revaluation for business rates is being brought forward to 2021, after which the government will move to revaluations every three years and there will be an additional Â£1.7bn to deliver 26,000 affordable homes in London. This video can not be played Speech in full: Hammond sees ""light at the end of tunnel"" This video can not be played Response in full: McDonnell on ""astounding complacency"" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""Does the chancellor really believe the NHS can wait another eight months for the lifesaving funds it needs? How many people have to die waiting in an ambulance before he acts?"" Mr McDonnell also raised concerns over funding for schools, the emergency services and local councils. He said ""austerity was a political choice not an economic necessity"", adding: ""We were never all in this together as they claimed."" The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said: ""The light at the end of the tunnel is a hard Brexit, which is going to cost jobs and prosperity in the this country."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said ""Brexit was dragging the economy down"" and the chancellor had been right not to turn on the public spending taps because there was still ""very little freedom"" in the public finances. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas tweeted: ""Tories celebrate a tiny improvement in growth in today's #SpringStatement, but GDP isn't a real measure of our society. True indicators are people being treated in hospital corridors & foodbank use shooting up. Our economy is designed to fail people - and it needs an overhaul."" Mr Hammond accused Labour of talking the economy down, comparing them to the gloomy character from Winnie the Pooh he has himself been likened to in the past. ""If there are any Eeyores in the chamber they are over there. I meanwhile am at my most positively Tiggerlike today, as I contemplate a country which faces the future with unique strengths."" Labour's shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne joked on Twitter that Mr Hammond was ""talking Pooh"".

"The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting in November about North Korea's nuclear ambitions A leaked draft of a United Nations report claims two Singapore companies have violated UN sanctions by supplying luxury goods to North Korea. The final report has been submitted to the UN Security Council, and is likely to be published later this week. Singapore's government said it was aware of the cases and had begun investigating where there was ""credible information"" of possible offences. Both the UN and Singapore ban the sale of luxury goods to North Korea. Global sanctions against North Korea have tightened considerably over the last two years as Pyongyang has continued to conduct nuclear tests and launch missiles. Despite the recent development that unprecedented talks between North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump may take place later this year, UN sanctions against North Korea will remain in place. Analysts say the alleged violations by Singapore companies, if proven, raise questions about how widespread such breaches might be across Asia. The leaked UN report highlights two Singapore-based firms, among others in Asia. It alleges the two firms supplied a range of luxury goods to North Korea, including wines and spirits, until as recently as July 2017. Under UN Sanctions,it has been illegal to sell luxury items to North Korea,externalsince 2006.  And Singapore's lawshave banned the sale of these items to North Korea,externalfor several years. A store in Pyongyang displays imported alcohol products - many of which are banned under UN sanctions The two Singapore-based firms under investigation are OCN and T Specialist. They are sister companies and share the same director. Both the companies have denied any wrongdoing. The UN report also claims between 2011 and 2014 ""transactions valued at more than $2m (Â£1.4m)"" - allegedly proceeds from the sale of goods in North Korea - flowed from an account that OCN and T Specialist set up in a North Korean bank, Daedong Credit Bank, to T Specialist's bank accounts in Singapore. Singapore has banned its financial institutions from providing financial assistance or services for facilitating any trade with North Korea, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. T Specialist has testified to the UN that the funds did not come from North Korea but a company registered in Hong Kong, and related to sales before 2012. Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? The political gamble of the 21st Century North Korea-Trump talks in 400 words US-N Korea talks: What could happen now? The two companies are also accused by the UN of having ""long-standing, close ties"" - including ownership ties -  with Ryugyong Commercial Bank,a bank the US put on its sanctions list in 2017,external. The Singaporean companies said they have no interests in the bank. Their lawyer, Edmond Pereira, has confirmed they are under investigation by Singapore authorities, but insisted they did not have any current financial links, interests, or any sort of relationship with entities in North Korea. Mr Pereira acknowledged that his clients ""have done business with North Korean entities... before the UN sanctions came into force"". He added the companies had ""reduced their involvement"" in North Korea but that ""these things take a bit of time"". Lawyers have said part of the problem is these sanctions are expected to be enforced by companies who are often unaware of the changes in the law. Singapore has banned its financial institutions from providing financial assistance or services for facilitating any trade with North Korea It was only in November last year thatSingapore banned trade with North Korea entirely. Before that, some trade was allowed. The UN report claims some of the transactions in the OCN and T Specialist cases appear to have used the Singapore financial system. It also said it was the responsibility of member countries to make sure their banks had a more ""robust scrutiny"" of individuals and companies opening accounts with them. The BBC contacted the two Singapore banks mentioned in the report. Both banks declined to comment, citing Singapore's banking secrecy laws. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) told the BBC it was working closely with the UN on these cases. ""MAS will take stern action against any financial institutions in breach of regulations relating to proliferation financing,"" MAS said in a statement sent to the BBC. The authority also said it expected banks to be aware of ""the use of multi-jurisdictional front companies, shell companies, joint ventures, and complex or opaque ownership structures"". William Newcomb, a former member on the UN Panel of Experts, said it was precisely these financial loopholes North Korea seeks to exploit. ""What they will do is set up a shell company, then establish a company in another location, a bank in a third location, and do business in another location,"" he explained. ""And now you have multiple jurisdictions involved. So it becomes quite complicated, and it's one of the techniques they use to defeat the sanctions."" This video can not be played Was your T-shirt made in North Korea? Financial crime researchers say it is difficult for banks to catch this sort of behaviour. ""You would probably never know that the funds were coming from North Korea,"" said Tim Phillipps, Asia Pacific Leader for Deloitte's Financial Crime Network. He added the problem could be much bigger across South East Asia. ""If you're named in a report in this environment in Singapore, the MAS are highly likely to demand extensive transaction history examination. ""But if you start to look across the other countries in South East Asia, they generally haven't got the maturity of systems to prevent this."" The UN report highlights how easily entities allegedly doing business with North Korea might potentially find loopholes to use  - even in sophisticated financial systems like Singapore's.

"This video can not be played Watch: Some of Givenchy's most iconic designs through the decades French fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy, who created famous looks for Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly and Jackie Kennedy, has died at the age of 91. His partner Philippe Venet, a former couture designer, confirmed the news. The enduring appeal of Givenchy was showcased at this year's Oscars, where Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman wore a custom design. But the designer is best known for the ""little black dress"" worn by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's. ""It was... an enormous help to know that I looked the part... Then the rest wasn't so tough anymore. Givenchy's lovely simple clothes [gave me] the feeling of being whoever I played,"" Hepburn said of their partnership. Audrey Hepburn's black sheath dress became a byword for elegant simplicity The friendship between Givenchy and Hepburn endured for 40 years, and helped cement his place in fashion - and cinema - history. She became his muse, and he designed her suits and woollen dresses for the musical Funny Face in 1957, and the light-hearted heist caper How to Steal a Million in 1966. Givenchy: A career in pictures The enduring appeal of Audrey Hepburn Audrey Hepburn collection up for grabs Givenchy came from an aristocratic background, and worked alongside the then unknown Pierre Balmain and Christian Dior after World War Two. He was employed by the avant-garde designer Elsa Schiaparelli before leaving to found his own fashion house in 1952. There he introduced the concept of ""separates"" - blouse, skirt, jacket and trouser combinations that could be mixed and matched. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris Hubert de Givenchy was the most aristocratic of French designers, renowned for his own personal elegance and impeccable manners. He was born into a noble French family, and destined initially for the law. But at the end of World War Two, he persuaded his family to let him pursue his passion for clothes. Fame came in the 1950s, and for three decades, he dressed some of the most beautiful women in the world. He's credited with introducing the notion of separates to give women greater freedom to choose, and with being one of the first clothes designers to create his own perfume. In 1988, he sold his fashion house to the luxury brand LVMH, and a few years later he retired to a life of comfortable discretion. He came from a world of fashion which he acknowledged has now all but disappeared - an age of elegance, where clothes were created out of a unique personal relationship between client and couturier. The designer, who stood at a towering 1.98m (6ft 6in), won instant acclaim for his first collection at the age of 24. ""These dresses remind you of that first, best, glass of champagne,"" one admiring British fashion writer declared. Givenchy's friendship with Hepburn, who died in 1993, lasted for 40 years Givenchy swiftly ventured into menswear, and moved to New York to consolidate his success. There, his celebrity customers included US First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who wore one of his designs to President John F Kennedy's funeral in 1963. Screen legend Grace Kelly, who would become princess of Monaco, was another famous client. This Givenchy coat was made for Jacqueline Kennedy in 1959 In 1970, Givenchy branched out into furnishing fabrics, and designed interiors for hotels and even a Ford Continental car. A series of world-famous designers have held the creative reins at the fashion house since its founder retired in 1995. They included talented mavericks John Galliano and Alexander McQueen, and - from 2005 - Italian designer Riccardo Tisci, who introduced a more subversive aesthetic. In March 2017, Clare Waight Keller became the first woman to be named the brand's artistic director. Givenchy remains a popular choice for actors seeking awards season glamour - including Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot, who chose a gown from the label's Haute Couture collection for the 2018 Oscars. Wonder Woman actress Gal Gadot in Givenchy couture at the Oscars Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman in custom Givenchy, also at the Oscars ""Hubert de Givenchy was a symbol of Parisian elegance for more than half a century,"" his label said on Monday. French business magnate Bernard Arnault, head of the luxury goods company LVMH which now owns Givenchy, called the designer ""one of the creators who put Paris at the summit of world fashion in the 1950s"". The designer had asked that his friends and admirers make a donation to the children's charity Unicef in his memory, instead of sending flowers. Allow Twitter content?
