"The Petya ransomware makes a computer unusable until a ransom is paid One of the strange features of cybercrime is how much of it is public. A quick search will turn up forums and sites where stolen goods, credit cards and data are openly traded. But a glance into those places may not give you much idea about what is going on. ""Everyone can join as long as you speak Russian,"" said Anton, a malware researcher at security firm SentinelOne, who has inhabited this underground world for more than 20 years. ""By Russian I mean the USSR, so there is Ukrainians, there is Kazakhstan, there is Belarus. The Romanians are doing all the dirty work like spam and maintenance so they are not really involved in developing malware,"" he said. ""But, today, is it mainly Russian? Yes."" Those vibrant underground marketplaces have a long history and Anton adds that he tracks the malware makers to gain insights into what they might do next. ""I was there from the very early stages,"" Anton told the BBC. ""I guess I started at about the age of 12, when there was not much online community. ""Instead it was many channels where hackers exchanged information and exploits and kind of stuff like that,"" he said. In those early days few wanted to break the law, he said. ""Back then there was not much money involved at all,"" he said. ""It was only about sharing knowledge, sharing information, sharing various scripts or downloading warez - which is pirated content."" ""It gives us an insight into the directions these communities are taking. ""We have to monitor these to understand what they are doing, the success they are having and what they are about to do next. ""You have to be prepared rather than just sit back and wait for it to happen to you. It's essential for us to have this kind of contact because without it we are blind."" Responsibilities are divided up among different groups on underground forums ""There's a lot of criminality going on on the open web, particularly when you get into the Russian federation. They do not need to be on the dark web. Some are quite brazen and quite public whereas others have a much higher level of operational security. ""If we are tracking a criminal location and we find chatter about our clients that can be of value,"" he said. ""In the longer term it's what's coming over the horizon. What are they dialling up next? ""It's not trivial to do something like that, it's definitely not easy to do although I think there's definitely value in working out what they are doing."" The underground changed after the millennium turned and e-commerce took off. Forums popped up that talked about how to cash in via spam, phishing, malware and web attacks. There was another big shift in 2007-08, said Anton, as the criminals sought a way to fleece people that gave better returns than the cruder techniques. The first wave, which started the modern era of cybercrime, used fake anti-virus software. ""They installed some really, really poorly written software on your machine,"" he said, explaining the scam. ""It looked like anti-virus but it actually does nothing. ""It tells you: 'We just scanned your PC and we have found many problems. You need to fix it now, you need to buy this software. It only costs $35-40 (Â£28-32)',"" he said. This worked better than earlier scams, said Anton, but it took a lot of effort to catch people out and get them to pay. Often, he said, when people paid via a credit card they reversed the transaction once they found out they had been tricked. Conversion rates, meaning the number of victims who handed over cash, stayed low. ""This meant they must do something better, something more scary."" Frightened people pay up, said Anton, adding that this drove the next evolution: lockers. ""What they do is they attack your browser and put up a big page on your main desktop, saying you were found with illegal child pornography or something very, very scary,"" he said. The early days on the underground were all about swapping code ""People got afraid saying 'OK, maybe one of my kids did it, maybe, I'm not sure, I'll pay',"". The one-page attacks asked for more money, up to $200 (Â£160), and proved so successful that many police forces issued warnings that urged people not to pay. The success, and also the publicity, forced the next stage of crimeware - ransomware, Anton explained. ""I call it an evolution because the same people that did the fake anti-virus before are doing ransomware now. And they were doing the fake police page in the years between 2010 and 2013,"" he said. Ransomware has the best conversion rate, he said, because victims cannot ignore its effects. ""It's real damage so that you can see that your files are no longer working. And that's the best proof for the user that he must pay,"" he said. Its rise has also been helped by the advent of virtual currency Bitcoin, because it has few of the drawbacks of credit cards or other payment systems. ""Today you cannot talk about ransomware without mentioning Bitcoin because that's what made this evolution come,"" said Anton. The damage is not just limited to the amount people pay. Estimates from the FBI suggest that the 992 cases of ransomware carrier Cryptowall reported during a 14-month period cost victims $18m (Â£14.4m). Some of the cost was in the ransom, up to $10,000 (Â£8,000), but this was multiplied by lost productivity, legal fees and work done to remove the infections. It is popular, he said, because of another shift in the way that the underground is organised. In the past the groups writing the malware sent the spam, analysed the results and fleeced the victims. The advent of Bitcoin virtual cash has driven the rise of ransomware Not any more, he said. Now, many groups writing ransomware run it as a service. ""They will give you the software with your affiliate ID so if you spread it they will know that it's from you and you will get a payout,"" he said. ""You will get 70% and they will get the 30% out of each payment."" Competition among ransomware writers means some other groups give better returns. But, he said, those groups may be producing poorly-written malware that struggles to get past the digital defences people and businesses use. The evolution of the underground has hit a peak with ransomware and Bitcoin, said Anton, and their combined success has kicked off a gold rush. ""It's getting more and more people attracted to it, like from the criminal side. More and more people are starting to spread it."" They will not stop, either, he said. ""I think if you get easy money and it just keeps coming, why not continue it, right? It's obvious.""

"It's no secret that the Russians have long tried to plant ""sleeper agents"" in the US - men and women indistinguishable from normal Americans, who live - on the surface - completely normal lives. But what happens when one of them doesn't want to go home? Jack Barsky died in September 1955, at the age of 10, and was buried in the Mount Lebanon Cemetery in the suburbs of Washington DC. His name is on the passport of the man sitting before me now - a youthful 67-year-old East German, born Albert Dittrich. The passport is not a fake. Albert Dittrich is Jack Barsky in the eyes of the US government. The story of how this came to be is, by Barsky's own admission, ""implausible"" and ""ridiculous"", even by the standards of Cold War espionage. But as he explains in a new memoir, Deep Undercover, it has been thoroughly checked out by the FBI. As far as anyone can tell, it is all true. It began in the mid-70s, when Dittrich, destined at the time to become a chemistry professor at an East German university, was talent-spotted by the KGB and sent to Moscow for training in how to behave like an American. His mission was to live under a false identity in the heart of the capitalist enemy, as one of an elite band of undercover Soviet agents known as ""illegals"". ""I was sent to the United States to establish myself as a citizen and then make contact, to the extent possible, at the highest levels possible of decision makers - particularly political decision makers,"" he says. This ""idiotic adventure,"" as he now calls it, had ""a lot of appeal to an arrogant young man, a smart young man"" intoxicated by the idea of foreign travel and living ""above the law"". This video can not be played ""This kind of double life wears on you"" He arrived in New York in the Autumn of 1978, at the age of 29, posing as a Canadian national, William Dyson. Dyson, who had travelled via Belgrade, Rome, Mexico City and Chicago, ""immediately vanished into thin air"", having served his purpose. And Dittrich began his new life as Jack Barsky. He was a man with no past and no identification papers - except for a birth certificate obtained by an employee of the Soviet embassy in Washington, who had kept his eyes open during a walk in the Mount Lebanon cemetery. Barsky had supreme self-confidence, a near-flawless American accent, and $10,000 in cash. He also had a ""legend"" to explain why he did not have a social security number. He told people he had had a ""tough start in life"" in New Jersey and had dropped out of high school. He had then worked on a remote farm for years before deciding ""to give life another chance and move back to New York city"". He rented a room in a Manhattan hotel and set about the laborious task of building a fake identity. Over the next year, he parlayed Jack Barsky's birth certificate into a library card, then a driver's licence and, finally, a social security card. But without qualifications in Barsky's name, or any employment history, his career options were limited. Rather than rubbing shoulders with the upper echelons of American society, as his KGB handlers had wanted, he initially found himself delivering parcels to them, as a cycle courier in the smarter parts of Manhattan. The young KGB agent arrived in New York in the late 1970s ""By chance it turned out that the messenger job was actually really good for me to become Americanised because I was interacting with people who didn't care much where I came from, what my history was, where I was going,"" he says. ""Yet I was able to observe and listen and become more familiar with American customs. So for the first two, three years I had very few questions that I had to answer."" The advice from his handlers on blending in - gleaned from Soviet diplomats and resident agents in the US - ""turned out to be, at minimum, weak but, at worst, totally false"", he says. ""I'll give you an example. One of the things I was told explicitly was to stay away from the Jews. Now, obviously, there is anti-Semitism in there, but secondly, the stupidity of that statement is that they sent me to New York. There are more Jews in New York than in Israel, I think."" Barsky would later use his handlers' prejudices and ignorance of American society against them. But as a ""rookie"" agent he was eager to please and threw himself into the undercover life. He spent much of his free time zig-zagging across New York on counter-surveillance missions designed to flush out any enemy agents who might be following him. He would update Moscow Centre on his progress in weekly radio transmissions, or letters in secret writing, and deposit microfilm at dead drop sites in various New York parks, where he would also periodically pick up canisters stuffed with cash or the fake passports he needed for his trips back to Moscow for debriefing. He would return the to the East every two years, where he would be reunited with his German wife Gerlinde, and young son Matthias, who had no idea what he had been up to. They thought he was doing top secret but very well-paid work at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Barsky's handlers were delighted with his progress except for one thing - he could not get hold of an American passport. This failure weighed heavily on him. On one early trip to the passport office in New York an official asked him to fill out a questionnaire which asked, among other things, the name of the high school he had attended. ""I had a legend but it could not be verified,"" he says. ""So if somebody went to check on that they would have found out that I wasn't real."" Terrified that his cover might be blown, he scooped up any documents with his name on them and marched out of the office in a feigned temper at all this red tape. The real Jack Barsky is buried in a Washington DC cemetery Without a passport, Barsky was limited to low-level intelligence work and his achievements as a spy were, by his own account, ""minimal"". He profiled potential recruits and compiled reports on the mood of the country during events such as the 1983 downing of a Korean Airlines flight by a Soviet fighter, which ratcheted up tensions between the US and the Soviet Union. On one occasion, he flew to California to track down a defector (he later learned, to his immense relief, that the man, a psychology professor, had not been assassinated). He also carried out some industrial espionage, stealing software from his office - all of it commercially available - which was spirited away on microfilm to aid the floundering Soviet economy. But it often seemed the very fact of him being in the US, moving around freely without the knowledge of the authorities, was enough for Moscow. ""They were very much focused on having people on the other side just in case of a war. Which I think, in hindsight, was pretty stupid. That indicated very old thinking."" The myth of the ""Great Illegals"" - heroic undercover agents who had helped Russia defeat the Nazis and gather vital pre-war intelligence in hostile countries - loomed large over the Soviet intelligence agencies, who spent a lot of time and effort during the Cold War trying to recapture these former glories, with apparently limited success. Barsky later found out that he was part of a ""third wave"" of Soviet illegals in the US - the first two waves having failed. And we now know that illegals continued to be infiltrated in the 1980s and beyond. He believes about ""10 to 12"" agents were trained up at the same time as him. Some, he says, could still be out there, living undercover in the United States, though he finds it hard to believe that anyone exposed to life in the US would retain an unwavering communist faith for long. He is scathing about his KGB handlers, who were ""very smart"" and the ""cream of the crop"" but who seemed chiefly concerned with making his mission appear a success to please their bosses. ""The expectations of us, of me - I didn't know anybody else - were far, far too high. It was just really wishful thinking,"" he now says of his mission. On the other hand, the KGB's original plan for him might actually have worked, he says. ""I am glad it didn't work out because I could have done some damage. ""The idea was for me to get genuine American documentation and move to Europe, say to a German-speaking country, where the Russians were going to set me up with a flourishing business. And they knew how to do that. ""And so I would become quite wealthy and then go back to the United States without having to explain where the money came from. At that point, I would have been in a situation to socialise with people that were of value."" This plan fell through because of his failure to get a passport, so the KGB reverted to Plan B. This was for Barsky was to study for a degree and gradually work his way up the social order to the point where he could gather useful intelligence - a mission he describes as ""nearly impossible"". The degree part was relatively straightforward. He was, after all, a university professor in his former life. He graduated top of his class in computer systems at Baruch College, which enabled him to get a job as a programmer at Met Life insurance in New York. Like many undercover agents before him, he began to realise that much of what he had been taught about the West - that it was an ""evil"" system on the brink of economic and social collapse - was a lie. Barsky (fourth right) felt at home with co-workers at Met Life ""There was a way to rationalise that because we were taught that the West was doing so well because they took all the riches out of the Third World,"" he says. But, he adds, ""what eventually softened my attitude"" was the ""normal, nice people"" he met in his daily life. ""[My] sense was that the enemy was not really evil. So I was always waiting to eventually find the real evil people and I didn't even find them in the insurance company."" Met Life almost felt like home, he says, ""because it was a very paternalistic, 'we take care of you' kind of a culture"". ""There was nothing like we were taught. Nothing that I expected. I wanted to really hate the people and the country and I couldn't bring myself to hate them. Not even dislike them."" But he was keeping a far bigger secret from his KGB bosses than his wavering commitment to communism. In 1985, he had married an illegal immigrant from Guyana he had met through a personal ad in the Village Voice newspaper - and they now had a daughter together. He now had two families to go with his two identities, and he knew the time would come when he had to choose between them. It finally happened in 1988, when after 10 years undercover he was suddenly ordered to return home immediately. Moscow was in a panic, believing the FBI was on to him. To do anything other than run as ordered - grab his emergency Canadian birth certificate and driver's licence and get out of the US - would be potentially suicidal. He dithered and stalled for a week. Could he really leave his beloved baby daughter Chelsea behind forever? But the KGB was losing patience. One morning, on a subway platform a resident agent delivered a chilling message: ""You have got to come home or else you're dead."" This video can not be played The Americans producers: 'Here was someone who lived it' It was time for some lateral thinking. From discussions with his handlers in Moscow, Barsky had come to believe the Soviet hierarchy feared three things about America. He already knew about their anti-Semitism and their fear of Ronald Reagan, who they saw as an unpredictable religious zealot who might launch a nuclear strike to ""accelerate"" the Biblical ""end times"". But he also remembered their ""morally superior"" attitude to the Aids epidemic - their belief that it ""served the Americans right"" and their determination to protect the motherland from infection. Barsky stalled a bit more and then hatched a plan. ""I wrote this letter, in secret writing, that I wouldn't come back because I had contracted Aids, and the only way for me to get treatment would be in the United States. ""I also told the Russians in the same letter that I would not defect, I would not give up any secrets. I would just disappear and try to get healthy."" To begin with Barsky lived in constant fear for his life, remembering that threat on the subway platform. But after a few months, he began to breathe more easily. ""I started thinking 'I think I got away with this.' The FBI had not knocked on the door. The KGB had not done anything."" He gradually let his guard down and settled into the life of a typical middle-class American in a comfortable new home in upstate New York. While he had fallen for the American Dream and the trappings of the consumer society, he still had some conflicting feelings. ""My loyalties to communism and the homeland and Russia, they were still pretty strong. My resignation, you can also call it a 'soft defection' - that was triggered by having this child here. It was not ideological. It would be easy to claim that. But it wasn't true."" Playing at the back of his mind was always the question of whether his past would catch up with him. And, finally, one day, it did. The man who exposed him was a KGB archivist, Vasili Nikitich Mitrokhin, who defected to the West in 1992 - after the fall of communism - with a vast trove of Soviet secrets, including the true identity of Jack Barsky. The FBI watched him for more than three years, even buying the house next door to his as they tried to figure out whether he really was a KGB agent and, if so, whether he was still active. The Soviet Union began using ""illegal"" agents, living in Europe under false identities, as early as 1919 Unlike ""resident agents"", who are in the country legally as diplomats, they are not immune from prosecution if caught The first illegal was sent to the US in 1921, according to the Mitrokhin archive Famous illegals include Rudolf Abel, unmasked as a Soviet spy in the US in 1957, and Richard Sorge, who posed as a Nazi journalist in Japan during the war In 2010, 10 Russian ""sleeper agents"" on a long-term mission to spy on US policy makers were exposed - including Anna Chapman (pictured) In the end, Barsky himself gave the game away, during an argument with his wife, Penelope, that was picked up by the FBI's bugs. ""I was trying to repair a marriage that was slowly falling apart. I was trying to tell my wife the 'sacrifice' I had made to stay with Chelsea and her. So in the kitchen I told her, 'By the way, this is what I did. I am a German. I used to work for the KGB and they told me to come home and I stayed here with you and it was quite dangerous for me. This is what I sacrificed.' ""And that completely backfired. Instead of bringing her over to my side, she said: 'What does that mean for me if they ever catch you?'"" It was the evidence the FBI needed to pick him up. In a meticulously planned operation, Barsky was pulled over by a Pennsylvania state trooper as he drove away from a toll booth on his way home from work one evening. After stepping out of his car, he was approached by a man in civilian clothes, who held up a badge and said in a calm voice: ""Special agent Reilly, FBI. We would like to talk with you."" The colour drained from Barsky's face. ""I knew the gig was up,"" he says. But with characteristic bravado he asked the FBI man: ""What took you so long?"" He kidded around with Joe Reilly and the other agents who interrogated him, and tried to give them as much information about the KGB's operations as he could. But inside he was panicking that he would be sent to jail and that his American family, which he had been trying to hold together, would be broken up. In fact, luck was on his side. After passing a lie-detector test he was told that he was free to go and, even more remarkably, that the FBI would help him fulfil his dream of becoming an American citizen. Reilly, who went on to become Barsky's best friend and golfing partner, even visited the elderly parents of the real Jack Barsky, who agreed not to reveal that their son's identity had been stolen. ""I was so lucky and so was my family that the decision-makers were nice enough to say, 'Well, you were so well-established, we don't want to disrupt your life,'"" he says. ""It required some interesting gymnastics to make me legal because one thing I didn't have was proof of entry into the country. I came here on documentation that was fraudulently obtained, so it took 10-plus years to finally become a citizen. And when it did, it felt good."" Barsky's coveted American passport Barsky is now married for a third time and has a young daughter. He has also found God, completing his journey from a hardline communist and atheist to a churchgoing, all-American patriot. He has even managed to reconnect with the family he left behind in Germany, although his first wife, Gerlinde, is still not speaking to him. ""I have a very good relationship with Matthias, my son, and his wife. And I am now a grandfather. When we talk about things like Americans playing soccer against Germans, I say 'us'. I mean the Americans. I am not German any more. The metamorphosis is complete."" The final act in his story came two years ago when he revealed the secret of his extraordinary double life on the US current affairs programme, 60 Minutes. He had long wanted to share his story with the world, but his bosses at the New York electricity company where he worked as a software developer were less than impressed to find they had a former KGB agent on the payroll, and promptly fired him. Barsky says he has no regrets. He knows how fortunate he has been. ""This kind of double life wears on you. And most people can't handle it. I am not saying that I lived a charmed life but I got away with it. ""I am in good health. I have had some issues with alcohol that I have overcome and I got another chance to have a good family life. And another child. And I am finally getting to live the life that I should have lived a long time ago. I am really lucky."" Perhaps the supreme irony of Jack Barsky's story is that he was only able to complete the mission the KGB had set him - to obtain an American passport and citizenship - with the help of the FBI. He cannot resist a smile at the thought of telling his KGB handlers that he has not been such a failure after all. ""I wouldn't mind meeting one or two of those fellows I worked with and saying 'Hey, see I did it!'""

"This video can not be played Rainbow babies offer 'hope and light' A rainbow baby is a baby born to a mother who has previously lost a child due to miscarriage, still birth or neonatal death. It stems from the idea that a rainbow, symbolising hope and comfort, follows the storm of grief caused by a baby loss. BBC News spoke to some of the mothers who use the rainbow symbol to celebrate their children and remember the babies they lost. Cheryl Lotherington, 38, had four miscarriages before her daughter Bo (named for being a rainbow baby) was born. She and her then partner, now husband, Grant started trying for a baby after being together for two years. She fell pregnant after six months. ""Everything seemed great,"" she says. ""We had an early scan and saw the baby and heard the heartbeat. ""At 10 weeks I unexpectedly started bleeding. A scan confirmed that there was no heartbeat. ""The next night I miscarried at home. The pain was horrendous both physically and emotionally."" The couple, who live near Leeds, had experienced an earlierchemical pregnancy,externalbut after the first miscarriage they suffered two more losses at around 11 weeks before being referred for tests which came back clear. ""Western medicine couldn't give us any answers and my arms ached [from the injections],"" she says. They decided to get married, booked their wedding and agreed to start trying to conceive again thinking it would take about six months, but she fell pregnant straight away. ""We were scanned every week. It was a really worrying time right until she was placed in my arms."" She says her daughter, who is now four, loves colourful clothing especially anything with a rainbow on it. ""Bo tells everyone that she is a rainbow baby. If a rainbow appears she thinks it's for her. I think about the babies we have lost and how lucky we are now."" Claire Todd and her husband frequently dress their two sons in rainbow clothing to celebrate them and remember the babies they lost. Ms Todd, 37, from Sheffield, says: ""My husband and I have lost seven babies in all, one for each colour of the rainbow, and have two beautiful sons. ""I love to dress them in bright colours/rainbows where possible as to me rainbows symbolise that no matter how bad things get, there is always something to hope for."" She said while they do not choose rainbow outfits all the time when they do wear bright colours they ""make me smile and burst with happiness"". Pregnancy loss expressed as numbers per day*: 2,127 babies were born 10 babies were stillborn 684 babies were miscarried including as a result ofectopic pregnancy,external 152 babies were born preterm *Based on 2014 UK figures from pregnancy research charity Tommy's Read more: The lifeline for dads coping with the loss of a child Treasured items kept by parents who have lost a baby The choices you have if your baby dies Due to fertility problems it took Nicole Lord and her husband two years to conceive their son. She had lost a pregnancy nine years ago. She says: ""We live rainbows, everywhere, everyday. But that's because they're cool as well as my son being a rainbow. ""My little man is very special to us. I don't ovulate and the usual drugs the NHS can offer don't work on me, so the fact we have a baby is remarkable."" The 25-year-old, from March, in Cambridgeshire, has a rainbow tattoo in tribute to her son. ""Even when he's big and [has] got babies of his own, I'll have this to remember the good that can come from the pain of loss."" Orion was dressed in rainbow colours for his going home from hospital outfit (left) Tasha Adams, from Brentford, in London, had 16 miscarriages and two stillbirths before she had her rainbow baby. She says: ""My first loss was Honey, she was stillborn in May 2007 at 36+6 [weeks], I then had seven miscarriages between June 2008 and September 2010. ""Riley Rae was stillborn at 24+3 in April 2011 and then I went on to have nine more miscarriages between June 2011 and Feb 2014."" After seven years of trying she gave birth to her son Orion Rudi Beau in June 2015. She says: ""He has the middle name Beau, because he's our Rainbow."" 'She is and always will be such an important part of our family' Frankie Brunker, from Hertfordshire, lost her daughter Esme when her heart stopped beating at just over 38 weeks in September 2013. The 33-year-old then went on to conceive again. She says: ""I was overjoyed and terrified in equal measure to get pregnant soon after our devastating loss. ""The pregnancy was problem-free like Esme's had been, but I couldn't help be filled with anxiety."" She was supported through her pregnancy by rainbow baby charity JOEL the Complete Package. Emma Pearson, 35, from Worksop, founded the charity along with her husband Matthew after they lost their twins Noel and James in 2011. The charity runs aFacebook group,externaland sends support packs out with advice sections for mums, dads, grandparents and siblings. Ms Pearson says they focus on providing support for both mums and dads. She says: ""I think a lot of people ignore the fact that dads have to be that strong figure that's got to hold everything together when they've just been through something absolutely devastating. ""They're grieving exactly the same as a mum would but also they have seen their wife or partner going through labour and seeing everything that's happened is something that's really upsetting so it's important that people support them too."" Ms Brunker said the support she received helped her ""stay hopeful and sane"" until her son Jago was born healthy in October 2014. She says: ""We chose Jago's name partly because it means 'to follow in the footsteps of' (it's from the Hebrew name Jacob), and his middle name as Toby (the name we had picked out for Esme had she been a boy), both in tribute to his big sister. ""We don't want him to live in the shadow of Esme, but she is and always will be such an important part of our family."" 'She continues to help heal our hearts every single day' Clockwise from top left: Suzanne Lowe's brother Paul, Suzanne with her mum, baby Willow-Paul, baby Ruby Suzanne Lowe says her daughter Ruby helped to heal her family after the loss of both her brother and her first baby. The 33-year-old from Middleton, Manchester, lost her brother Paul in 2010 five weeks after he was diagnosed with leukaemia. Then in 2011 she discovered she was pregnant. She says: ""We were all so very happy as it had been a very hard time. I remember thinking ""the light at the end of our dark tunnel""."" But a scan revealed the devastating news her son hadPotter's Syndrome,externalmeaning he had very little kidney function and a poor chance of survival. Determined to give her son a chance she continued with the pregnancy but was admitted to hospital in March 2012 when she noticed her baby's movements had decreased. She says: ""Willow-Paul Winnard Lowe was born 13:24 at 36+1 weeks. He only managed to take a breath. They worked on him but couldn't save him. Our world just crumbled. ""We got to meet this beautiful 7lb 13oz beauty that we made. He looked so perfect on the outside."" A year later Suzanne received more heartbreaking news when her mum was rushed to hospital and diagnosed with ovarian cancer, something she is still being treated for with chemotherapy. Then in 2014 the family finally had good news when Suzanne took a pregnancy test and the result was positive. She says: ""I thought I'd be as cool as a cucumber and keep it all together when in fact I didn't. ""Our 20 week scan was a big one for us. I didn't want to know the sex like most parents do - I wanted to know that all her organs were working and could be seen. To my relief they were."" In December 2014 her daughter Ruby was born. She says: ""It felt so surreal, finally after such a long time we got to meet our rainbow baby. ""She brought so much colour back into our lives, although things are still tough going at times Ruby had helped in more ways than she will ever know. ""She continues to help heal our hearts every single day. She is so precious and so loved.""

"Ella (pictured, centre) has made two lifelong friends thanks to her late mother's organ donations When her mother died in 2013, Ella decided her organs should be donated in the hope of saving the lives of others. It has led to several successful transplants and two wonderful friendships. Now Ella is hoping to donate to one of the same women as her mother. Ella Murtha had always hoped the recipients of her late mother's organs would contact her, and that it might bring some form of closure. But she never expected to gain such strong friendships. ""I hoped I'd hear something when I agreed to be contacted [by the recipients], but I didn't know,"" she tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Her mother Tish died unexpectedly in 2013 following a ruptured brain aneurysm, aged 56. Despite her not being on the organ donor list, Ella felt that it was right for her organs to be passed on. Tish's heart, kidney, pancreas, liver, eye tissue and lungs were all donated, leading to successful transplants that doctors said saved the lives of four women and the eyesight of four men. Ella's mother Tish died in 2013 Many organ donors never have the opportunity to meet the person, or people, whose lives they have changed for the better. The recipient's identity remains confidential, although a thank-you letter can often be passed on via a transplant co-ordinator. For six months Ella, from Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, heard nothing back. But then two letters arrived on her doorstep in the same week. Teresa Saunders, from Reading, was one of those who decided to write, wanting to express her gratitude for receiving a kidney and pancreas. Three years earlier her diabetes had caused her kidneys to fail when she became pregnant, and she had been placed on a waiting list. Ella with her mother After the operation Teresa waited about five months before writing to Ella, in order ""to fully recover and make sure I was well and the organs were OK"". Jane Holmes, of Hornsea, East Yorkshire, also decided to write. She was in a wheelchair and had struggled to breathe since being diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. ""I wanted Ella to know what her decision had gone on to do - to help save a mum with four children,"" she explains. ""Initially it's like the lungs came off the shelf - it's clinical and you don't attach people to it. ""But when you start getting better you want to thank people for it, and you think you visualise the person."" The pair exchanged letters, but their friendship began to blossom when Jane's daughter Maisie sent Ella a Christmas card. Aged eight at the time, Maisie had thought Ella might be lonely without her mother, and wrote a card that read: ""Thank you for letting your mum save my mum's life."" Maisie sent a letter to Ella, thanking her for helping to save her mother's life On the anniversary of Jane receiving her new lungs, the three women decided to meet, saying it felt like a natural progression. ""It sounds funny but we are like sisters because we have this bond - even like I'd known them for years,"" Teresa said. ""I feel really lucky,"" Ella said. ""It's so hard to explain it because I see them like family, but almost special friends that my mum has introduced me to. ""Teresa and Jane share my mum's organs and that's a special bond as well. For whatever reason, we're meant to be in each other's life."" The women speak almost every day, but the connection between them may yet grow stronger. Teresa's new kidney is deteriorating, meaning she will require a replacement. About 3,000 kidney transplants are carried out each year In up to 90% of cases, a kidney transplant lasts for five or more years. In this instance doctors believe Teresa needs a replacement kidney from a living donor - and Ella hopes to follow in her mother's footsteps by donating her own organ. She has undertaken tests to see if their tissue types are compatible. It may not be possible for Ella to donate, but Teresa says she is ""overwhelmed"" by her kindness and knows she can rely on Ella's emotional support. The three friends are currently fundraising for Jane's daughter Maisie, who has cerebral palsy, to have an operation to help her walk.

"This video can not be played US ""at boiling point"": Town halls target Trump's agenda Republican politicians are returning to their home districts to a barrage of criticism, as many constituents demand to know how they'll hold President Trump to account. There's never a good time to talk politics, but democracy starts early in the state of Iowa. By 7:30 am, as the morning fog was still lifting and the sun was starting to appear, the meeting room in the Iowa Falls Fire department was already at full capacity. A few hundred people had travelled from across the state to attend a town hall meeting, filling every chair and corner, and spilling into the hallway. Town halls are traditionally a forum for constituents to discuss their concerns with elected officials, face to face. But in the Trump era, they've taken on a new purpose - with many aggrieved voters seeing them as a way to put pressure on President Trump, by ensuring their members of Congress hold him to account. Republican officials across the country have found themselves on the receiving end of questions and demands from voters. This video can not be played Angry protesters harangue Republicans over Trump Many, but not all, of those attending are Democrats, some from progressive groups who are organising around these events to ensure people show up. But others are simply frustrated residents, who want their voices heard. All are represented by Senator Chuck Grassley. The vast majority of the crowd at the fire station was older, in their fifties or above. Some of them came with handwritten protest signs, others clutched pieces of paper with their questions written on them. ""I'm new at this,"" a woman named Ingrid told me. She said Trump's victory made her angry. ""I felt I had to come. I'm hoping our voices get larger and that we can make sure Republicans don't just vote along party lines and listen to their constituents."" And listen is exactly what Senator Grassley did, even if some felt he didn't quite answer all of their concerns. As the seven-term senator entered the room, he began by asking the group which topics they'd like to cover. As hands flew in the air, and people jostled for his attention, a range of topics were raised - everything from Russia to guns, healthcare to education. Senator Grassley wrote the questions down in a small notebook, promising to answer them in the order they were asked. A large majority of questions were about President Obama's healthcare law - the Affordable Care Act. The questions on this were impassioned, as people talked of their personal experiences of Obamacare, and their fears they could lose coverage under a Trump presidency. One elderly man attended on behalf of a friend whose son was seriously ill. He told the senator of how ""his parents will probably have to face bankruptcy just as they face retirement"". Other testimonies reflected the extent people here rely on government subsidised health insurance. ""I'm on Obamacare, if it wasn't for Obamacare we wouldn't be able to afford insurance,"" said Chris Petersen, an insulin dependent diabetic who runs a farm more than an hour away. ""I got a present for you,"" he told the senator, as he held up a box of Tums, a medicine used to relieve heartburn, ""you're going to need them in the next few years."" When a bespectacled man in a grey sweater asked a question about the national debt, things got testy. As Senator Grassley answered referencing President Trump's taxation plans people began to heckle. ""Raise Trump's taxes,"" yelled a man at the back of the room. ""Everything is going to a pittance,"" shouted a woman. As she did the questioner got angry. ""I asked him, not you, so shut your hole,"" he said, as he jabbed his finger in her direction. At other times the mood in the room was calmer. When Zalmay Naizy, an Afghan who'd been an interpreter for the US army, asked a question, the room fell near silent. ""I'm a Muslim in this country, who's going to save me here? This video can not be played Senator Grassley is one of many Republicans facing angry questions at town hall meetings ""I've been shot two times, I've been roadside bombed once, nobody cares about me. But I was with the US."" The room erupted in cheers, and while the senator didn't address his question right away, choosing to move onto another question about trade deals, he returned to it later, promising to help Zalmay, as he stood by his side. This town hall was held in a county which voted for Donald Trump by a large margin. Senator Grassley prides himself on holding meetings in every county in the state every year through his ""99 county"" pledge, but not all are town halls. He's faced criticism for holding most of those in solidly Republican areas. The event at the fire station was one of two on the same day. Later, in the basement of the Hancock County Sheriff's jail, another crowd gathered. Once again many were waiting outside as the room was at capacity. The mood was tense. ""I want impeachment,"" shouted one man from the back. ""Why are you against government healthcare, but take it yourself?"" asked another. Obamacare dominated the agenda here too, with more personal stories. There was the mother, a former Republican voter, who was concerned about losing healthcare for her son who has disabilities. The veteran worried about treatment of the military. And Jamet, an immigrant from Chile, told the senator ""we're already making this country great"" and asked ""How will you stand up for immigrants?"" ""We need people to stand up for the ordinary working person,"" said Chris Petersen, the farmer with the Tums, who I'd met at the first town hall. His sentiment is not that different to the views of Donald Trump supporters, who told me during the campaign time and time again, that politicians don't represent them. Chris Petersen offered Grassley antacids Some who voted for him were at Senator Grassley's town halls, in a show of solidarity.  Jim Carson accused Democrats at the events of ""trying to obstruct the good policies of Mr Trump."" When I asked Senator Grassley if the anger expressed at the town halls would mean he was more likely to confront the president over his agenda, he told me the focus for him was taking these concerns back to his colleagues on capitol hill. ""I don't think you should see it as challenging Trump I think you should see it as Congress doing its job and the president doing his job."" It was a popular grassroots movement that helped sow the seeds of a Trump presidency, now another is trying to challenge it. For some voters, the only way to get to President Trump is by applying pressure on congress. Senators like Chuck Grassley have to balance their support for the Republican agenda, with the grievances of the voters who keep them in office. Even a small number of people attending town halls can be enough to keep elected officials on edge. These scenes we are seeing at these meetings across America are reminiscent of the early days of the Obama administration, when conservatives attended packed town halls to lobby their congressional representatives on healthcare, in what became known as the Tea Party movement. ""America is starting to boil,"" Chris Petersen told me as I met him afterwards at his farm. As liberals try to exert pressure on their senators and representatives, it's clear that a new progressive movement is brewing.

"Britain's anxiety about immigration has long been that there is far too much of it.  Concerns about the record number of foreign arrivals were a key factor in the vote for Brexit, and the national debate in Parliament and the press has tended to focus on who has got the best policies to reduce it as quickly as possible. So one would thinkstatistics suggesting a fall in net migrationand a big drop on EU workers coming from the eight so-called accession countries (A8) like Poland would be a cause for rejoicing.  Well, not entirely. Nothing has changed at the UK Border since the Brexit vote  - this isn't about Britain ""taking control"". What has happened is that more than 100,000 EU citizens have left Britain - 17% more than in the previous year.  And arrivals from the A8 countries have fallen sharply. The number of new registered workers from Poland is down 16% year on year, Hungary is down 14%, Slovakia down 20% and Lithuania down 6%. More workers have come from Romania and Bulgaria, up 11% and 8% respectively, but this may be because free movement from those countries came in much more recently. Some may have packed their bags fearing the brief window allowing them access to Britain might soon close. For most European nationals, though, uncertainty over the status of EU citizens in a post-Brexit Britain, and the sharp fall in the pound, has made the UK a much less attractive prospect. Some British employers are very worried. The growth of our hugely profitable tourism and hospitality sector, for instance, has relied upon importing foreign labour. I recently went to York, where the tourist industry is booming.  In that city alone it is now worth an astonishing Â£500m a year and supports more than 20,000 jobs. But the expansion could not have happened without immigration.  The city has close to full employment - there are estimated to be fewer than a thousand local job seekers. The news of a fall in migrant workers from countries which have traditionally filled tourist jobs makes grim reading for York's hoteliers, restaurateurs and bar owners. If the numbers continue to fall, some fear the worst. ""It would create a staffing crisis,"" says Graham Usher, who heads York's Hoteliers' Association.  ""If we get to the point where we can't fill vacancies with European workers then there's a big gap that we just can't fill."" What about using British workers? I ask. ""There just aren't enough of them around.  York only has about 700 unemployed people and that is it."" A quarter of hospitality businesses across Britain say they currently have vacancies they are struggling to fill and the sector has been holding urgent talks with government officials on how to deal with the shortage of workers. It is not just the tourism and hospitality sector, of course.  Britain's record employment rate means there is often no immediate domestic alternative to migrant labour for many businesses looking to expand or simply survive. Poskitt's Carrots is a Â£35m a year business in the East Riding of Yorkshire, supplying vegetables to many of Britain's big supermarkets. In the shed where 50,000 tonnes of carrots are washed and packed, 80% of the staff are Eastern Europeans. ""If we didn't have access to non-UK labour we just could not run this business,"" says managing director Guy Poskitt.  ""I wouldn't even attempt to try and run it.  Take away 80% of my workforce how can I operate?"" Guy Poskitt doesn't want to be reliant on migrant labour, but argues that there just aren't the domestic workers available from the rural communities nearby. Some argue that Britain needs to rid itself of its addiction to cheap migrant labour, that employers should do more to train and recruit home-grown workers. Many sectors are now thinking how they might adapt to Britain becoming a lower immigration economy. Health ministers hope that universities will expand the number of training places for nurses in England to reduce the reliance on foreign staff. The government recently lifted the cap on state-funded bursaries, but replaced them with student loans.  Since the announcement, the number of applicants for nurse training in England has fallen 23%. Britain's creative industries, which are worth more to the UK economy than the finance sector, are often collaborative ventures involving highly skilled but relatively low paid workers from around the world. From ballet companies to computer gaming firms, there is concern that an inability to attract or employ foreign staff will damage their international standing and profitability. The social care sector is also extremely concerned about the lack of suitable domestic staff to replace foreign workers who, in parts of the country make up the majority of employees. Earlier this week the Brexit Secretary David Davies told an audience in Estonia that in sectors requiring low-skilled labour including hospitality, agriculture and social care ""it will be years and years before we get British citizens to do those jobs"". ""Don't expect just because we're changing who makes the decision on the policy, the door will suddenly shut: It won't,"" he said. What the figures remind us, however, is that immigration works both ways. We may not suddenly shut the door, but that doesn't mean foreigners will choose to walk through it.

"Sara Bennett (l) won her Oscar for her work on Ex Machina (centre) and Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy won for her documentary films Oscars season is all about the stars: who said what, which gowns rocked the red carpet, and of course, who won. But for women behind the camera, it takes a lot more to get noticed. Female nominations for technical work are rare - blink and you can miss them. From the outside, it looks like a man's world - but is that how it feels? Three women - two of them 2016 Oscar winners - tell us what it's really like. Oscars 2017: Full coverage Sara Bennett was the first female VFX supervisor to win an Academy Award ""I loved film growing up - I watched a lot of horror and I loved prosthetics, so my natural thought was to get into that,"" saysSara Bennett,external, who won an Oscar for her work on 2015 sci-fi drama Ex Machina. The film brought to life the female robot Ava, played by Alicia Vikander, whose body had humanoid features but with a transparent skull, limbs and torso. As thefirst female VFX supervisor to win an Oscar,external, Sara broke new ground at 2016's ceremony. It was only the third time in 89 years that a woman had been nominated for visual effects. The last winner? Suzanne Benson for Aliens - back in 1987. Technology genius Nathan Bateman, played by Oscar Isaac, holds a robot ""brain"" created by Sara Bennett in Ex Machina Sara said she had to create an ""organic"" look for the ""brain"" Despite being such rarity, Sara says she's never felt outnumbered. ""Until last year's Oscar nomination, I'd never really thought about it being male-dominated,"" she says. ""The hard time for me was learning the craft and moving up, as opposed to dealing with men in my industry."" She grins. ""Being a woman probably went in my favour, to be honest."" Sara, whose back catalogue includes Sherlock, The Martian and the first four Harry Potter films, says she loves the variety her work gives her. Her passion for her work is infectious, and she says it was ""amazing"" winning the Oscar - she couldn't quite believe it when her name was read out. But she also mixes it up by managing a team, mentoring young women and leading children's workshops. Having trained in prosthetics and make-up, she became a runner during the 1990s, working as a general assistant on film sets before switching to VFX. Sara's credits also include Sherlock episode The Abominable Bride As a compositor, she learned how to combine several visual elements into a believable on-screen image, gaining her first credit in 1998 for Babe, Pig in the City. Although aspiring VFX specialists can now learn through YouTube tutorials, software and courses, Sara's adamant that the best experience is found in the workplace. ""Until you're working flat out and your eyes are bleeding at four in the morning, that horrible feeling - that's when you really learn about the job,"" she laughs, talking about the pressures of working to tight deadlines. Sara won her Oscar alongside fellow VFX artists Mark Williams Ardington, Paul Norris and Andrew Whitehurst Three years ago she set up London and Cardiff-based visual effects company Milk with four male colleagues, after their section in another VFX studio, The Mill, was closed down. Sara now sees more women moving through the ranks, and says with delight: ""When I was younger it was about 80/20 men to women in VFX, but now it's closer to 60/40."" But even if more women want creative positions in the film industry, they're not at the top table just yet. Research,externalfrom the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film says women made up just 17% of ""behind-the-scenes employment"" on the top 100, 250 and 500 films of 2016. The study,The Celluloid Ceiling,external, states this is a drop of two percentage points on 2015, putting the figures on a par with 1998. These statistics, combined with this year's all-male VFXOscar nominations, make those rare female wins look even more stark. Fie Tholander says it is ""cool to have a job where you do magic"" with VFX So when's this going to change? Sara says it will take a while. ""There's so many women doing VFX. Maybe they're not doing the big A-List films, but they're out there doing it all."" Fie Tholander, 31, has been inspired by Sara, working for her as a VFX compositor at Milk. ""I've always been drawn to magic, to fairy tale stories,"" she says, citing David Bowie fantasy drama Labyrinth (1986) as an inspiration. She's single-mindedly pursued her career since she was 15 and is now creating aliens for the upcoming Doctor Who series. She also worked on the brains in jars with eyeballs which featured in last year's Christmas special. She worked on last year's Doctor Who Christmas episode As a Danish high school student, she already knew she wanted to work in VFX, studying art atAnimation Workshop,externalbefore heading for London, with an internship atThe Mill,external. It was there that she met Sara, who became her mentor. ""Having Sara as a role model makes women realise they can actually do it,"" she says. ""VFX is portrayed as a technical thing, which isn't always the case. I'm not a technical person, I'm more creative."" Fie thinks women need to be more assertive: ""I think women in general hold back, we're afraid to ask, and men are a bit more bold with their careers."" Amy Adams is the lead in the Oscar-nominated film Arrival Has she ever hit a glass, even a celluloid, ceiling? Nope. ""Sexism isn't something I've come across. If I want something I have to ask for it - no one will give it to me."" But Fie does think the industry's progressing, with more women applying to work in her profession. She's also convinced that the film world is changing. ""With all the movies coming out, we're getting female role models who aren't princesses, which is great."" Recent films such as Arrival have seen Amy Adams star as an expert linguist communicating with aliens, while Star Wars movie Rogue One has Felicity Jones as its lead. But it's not just VFX and sci-fi where women are breaking through. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy started out as a print journalist before switching to documentaries Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, 37,made history last year as Pakistan's only double Oscar winner. She won her second best documentary Oscar for A Girl in the River - The Price of Forgiveness, about honour killings in Pakistan. This video can not be played Oscar-winning Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy on why being a female film-maker is an asset Her first, in 2012, was for Saving Face, about a plastic surgeon treating those scarred by acid attacks. Starting out as a print journalist in Pakistan, Sharmeen decided aged 21 to switch to documentaries, so she could tell her stories visually. There are hundreds of so-called ""honour killings"" in Pakistan each year She pitched her first film proposal to about 80 global organisations. ""I was pretty much turned down by everyone,"" she says. ""But I've always believed that if a door doesn't open for you, it's because you haven't knocked hard enough."" Undeterred, she asked the New York Times, who'd just set up a TV unit. They agreed to fund her first film, about Afghan refugee children on the streets of Pakistan. Her career went upwards from there - she's also won two Emmys (in 2010 and 2013) and the Hilal-e-Imtiaz (Crescent of Distinction), Pakistan's second-highest civilian award. For Sharmeen, her Oscar wins made a huge difference. ""It amplifies your voice and the voices of all of those people you are making a film about. ""After A Girl in the River, there was legislation about honour killing installed in Parliament in Pakistan. The win at the Oscars gave it the final push it needed to get it passed."" She deliberately multi-tasks by producing and directing because ""it allows me the freedom to tell the type of stories I want to tell"". ""I've always said that making a film is like having a baby. You have a long period of time where something is inside of you, and when you send it out into the world, you want the world to appreciate it."" She has also won two Emmys Well aware of the high numbers of men working in the film industry, she says she's at an advantage in her field. ""Whereas Hollywood will tell you fewer women are getting the opportunities to be directors or play key roles in film, in documentary work, women in greater numbers are coming up behind the camera, winning Academy Awards."" And for her, being a female filmmaker is an ""asset"". ""I've been able to get into places where a man would seldom be able to get into,"" she says. ""If I was a man perhaps I wouldn't be standing here today. I'm looked upon as less of a threat because I'm a woman.""

"Sam Allardyce has won two of his 11 games at Palace in all competitions Historically, if you need a manager to make a quick impact at a club, Big Sam tends to be your man. Sam Allardyce has enjoyed impressive starts to life at previous clubs, including Bolton, Newcastle, Blackburn and West Ham. So when Crystal Palace decided Alan Pardew was no longer needed in December, it made sense that the Londoners turned to the quick-fixer in their bid to remain in the Premier League. In a BBC Sport poll, 52% of voters think that Allardyce will not be able to keep Crystal Palace up this season. It was a swift return to the familiarity of club football for Allardyce, 62, who had suffered the ignominy of seeing his spell as England boss end after one game. So why have the Eagles, now 19th in the table and two points from safety, not benefited from the traditional Big Sam bounce? Sam Allardyce's Premier League record Games Win Draw Loss Win % Bolton 226 80 66 80 35.4 Newcastle 21 7 5 9 33.33 Blackburn 76 26 21 29 34.21 West Ham 114 35 28 51 30.7 Sunderland 30 9 9 12 30 Palace 8 1 1 6 12.5 Total 475 158 130 187 33.26 Allardyce has a reputation for achieving positive results when he joins a club mid-season and, similarly, clubs generally see a downturn in results if he leaves in mid-season. In fact, Palace are the first team where that pattern has not continued for Allardyce. His first eight league games in charge at Selhurst Park have produced an average of 0.5 points, the exact same average of his predecessor Pardew's last eight games before he was sacked. Overall, this is one of the worst starts Allardyce has ever made at a new club. Allardyce's first 10 league games at new clubs in England. He is on course for one of his worst starts at a new club Aside from Notts County, whom he failed to steer away from relegation to League Two in 1996-97 (although they were promoted again by March the next year), Allardyce is on course for his lowest points average from his first 10 league games. Allardyce's average of 0.5 points from his eight Premier League matches at Palace is 0.4 points lower than the average for his first 10 games at Sunderland and way below the 1.8 average of his start at West Ham. There is hope for Eagles fans, though, as Allardyce has guided the last two clubs he joined in mid-season away from the drop zone - Blackburn in 2008-09 and Sunderland in 2015-16, the latter despite eight defeats in his first 10 games. Where Allardyce's teams finish when he joins mid-season Club Division Joined Position when joined Position at end of season Notts County League One January 1997 22nd 24th Bolton Championship October 1999 12th 6th Blackburn Premier League December 2008 19th 15th Sunderland Premier League October 2015 19th 17th Palace Premier League December 2016 17th (Currently 19th) One argument could be that Allardyce has not been his usual cunning self in his first transfer window. Allardyce spent Â£34.6m in January - more than he has spent in any of his first transfer windows at new clubs - and that outlay was splurged on just four players: Jeffrey Schlupp (Â£11.7m), Luka Milivojevic (Â£10.8m), Patrick van Aanholt (Â£10m) and Mamadou Sakho (loan fee of Â£1.9m). In the 2007 summer transfer window at Newcastle, he spent a comparable Â£30.8m, but that was on nine players. And his most successful start at a club - West Ham in 2011 - coincided with the mass influx of 12 new players during the summer window It should be noted that clubs generally bring in fewer players in winter windows, and have less time to line up signings. But Allardyce managed to bring in six players at a cost of Â£17.6m at Sunderland in January 2016, and went on to save the club from relegation. Alternatively, perhaps a change in tactics is the source of Allardyce's struggles? Renowned for his preference for a pragmatic, long-ball style of play, Allardyce seems to have forgone that approach in an attempt to play a more compact version of the game. Only 18% of his side's passes have been long passes (defined as a pass over 35 yards with an intended target) - lower than at Newcastle, Blackburn and Sunderland. And what about the old cliche that Allardyce's sides are the masters of the set-piece? Allardyce has become associated with well-drilled teams when it comes to the dead ball - a threat at the opposition end and organised in their own box. Well, Allardyce does seem to have firmed Palace up at the back in that respect, conceding from just 24% of defensive set-pieces (three of 14) since his arrival, compared with 47% (15 from 32) under Pardew this term. But the same effect has yet to register at the other end, Palace scoring from 25% of their attacking set plays (1/4) compared with 43% (12/28) under Pardew this season. Phil McNulty, BBC Sport's chief football writer Crystal Palace assumed they were appointing a guarantee of Premier League safety when Sam Allardyce was hastily ushered through the door at Selhurst Park to replace sacked Alan Pardew in December. Allardyce was the impact manager and arch-pragmatist whose record had never been stained by relegation from the Premier League, proving his ability to navigate a route out of danger at Sunderland last season, a task he performed with such success it landed him the job as England manager. Briefly. To say the move has yet to have the desired effect is an understatement, with Palace now in a far more perilous plight than when he arrived after a home defeat by Chelsea that left them lying 17th. Allardyce's tried and trusted methods have so far failed miserably, despite inheriting a squad that looked built for his favoured method of using wide players and a powerful striker, with Christian Benteke a disappointment, Wilfried Zaha's role reduced by his presence at the Africa Cup Of Nations with the Ivory Coast and Andros Townsend out of favour. But is the real problem with Allardyce himself? Has the man whose concrete-clad self-confidence in everything he did been scarred by his calamitous one-match, 67-day reign as England manager, which ended after he was caught in a newspaper sting? Certainly Allardyce has not seemed the bullish, brash operator of old. The England job was meant to be the pinnacle of his career, the job he had craved for more than a decade, not an embarrassing ""blink and you'll miss it"" interlude before another Premier League relegation battle. Is the man who prides himself on breathing life into his squad battling to motivate himself to the old levels? It is hard to imagine but the loss of his managerial life's dream will have had a devastating impact, even on an experienced campaigner such as Allardyce. There was a brief flash of the old Allardyce when he danced in front of Crystal Palace's mascot before the home game with Sunderland - but the music soon stopped as his side were 4-0 down to their relegation rivals by half-time. It was a result that snuffed out the brief optimism of his only league win, a 2-0 victory at Bournemouth. Palace's fans are unimpressed with Allardyce and his methods, but more significantly by his results. Palace and Allardyce simply cannot wait any longer to get their act together - they must start getting results to move out of trouble and for their manager to prove he has not arrived at Selhurst Park as badly damaged goods.

"Wayne Rooney's agent Paul Stretford is in China to see if he can negotiate a deal for the forward to leave Manchester United. There are no guarantees of success and it is thought a deal remains highly unlikely before the Chinese transfer window closes on 28 February. But the fact Stretford has travelled to China is a clear indication United boss Jose Mourinho would let Rooney, 31, go. In a BBC Sport poll, 30% of voters think that Wayne Rooney's next move should be to move to China. And if he does not leave this month it seems certain he will go in the summer. Rooney has fallen down the pecking order at United under Mourinho. Rooney should stay - Phil Neville Mourinho not ruling out Rooney exit Would a China move work for Rooney? The England captain has been made aware of interest in him from the Chinese Super League for some time, although it is not known which clubs Stretford has spoken to. However, two of the three clubs who looked the most likely options for Rooney have ruled themselves out. Beijing Guoan, believed to be the favourite team of Chinese President Xi, had been seen as one of the favourites to sign Rooney but sources close to the club have told BBC Sport they are not interested in signing him. The England captain's representatives have already spoken to Tianjin Quanjian and their coach, Fabio Cannavaro, said talks did not progress, while sources close to Jiangsu Suning also dismissed speculation over a transfer. On Tuesday, Mourinho said he did not know whether Rooney, who has only just returned to training after a hamstring injury, would still be at Old Trafford in a week's time. It is not known whether this latest development will affect Rooney's chances of being involved in Sunday's EFL Cup final against Southampton. They had appeared to have increased afterHenrikh Mkhitaryan limped outof Wednesday's1-0 Europa League win against Saint-Etienne. If Rooney follows former team-mate Carlos Tevez to the Chinese Super League, it would almost certainly cost him any chance of making the seven appearances he needs to become England's most capped player. Rooney's preference is understood to be to remain with United for the rest of his contract, whichexpires in 2019, but a lack of time on the pitch is forcing him to consider alternatives. Rooney is United'srecord goalscorerand has won five Premier League titles and a Champions League trophy since joining them as an 18-year-old for Â£27m from Everton in 2004. The forward, who has started only three games since 17 December, has said he would not play for an English club other thanUnited or Everton,external. Hong Kong-based player representative Christopher Atkins The big difference between Chinese Super League clubs' transfer process and their Premier League counterparts is the preparation. English top-flight clubs have extensive scouting departments with links around the world. They identify players months in advance, watch many live games and base their decision on an extensive process. Oscar moved to Shanghai SIPG from Chelsea in a Â£60m deal in December and scored on his debut for his new club In CSL, the process is more agent-led. Most of the clubs are approached with recommendations for a position they are recruiting in, rather than seeking out players themselves. Foreign players coming in on large fees are commanding three-, four-, five-year deals, even at the end of their career. They have the upper hand in negotiations and wouldn't leave European football without long-term financial guarantees. However, the Chinese government is concerned about capital leaving the country and it is difficult for these big transactions to exist while they are trying to crack down in other areas. I think we will see a levelling out in fees. The Â£15m-Â£20m transfers will continue to happen for the next few years, but maybe we won't see the likes ofthe Â£60m deal that brought Oscar to China.

"Rumours are rife about Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari's health - and grip on power As Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari was beginninghis latest visit to London more than a month ago, a new series of Big Brother Nigeria was getting under way. A former military ruler known for his no-nonsense style would appear to have little in common with a reality TV show where contestants engage in attention-seeking behaviour. But both subjects were soon generating headlines for the same reason - neither of them were in Nigeria. It turned out that Big Brother was actually being filmed in South Africa  - a decision that led Nigeria's information minister to launch an investigation. While the howls of protests from outraged Big Brother fans soon died down, the clamour over Nigeria's leader's extended medical stay in London is not going away. President Buhari's absence comes as Africa's most populous nation is gripped by its worst economic crisis in decades, and faces the threat of famine in north-east Nigeria, which has been devastated by the Boko Haram insurgency. And unlike Big Brother, there are no constant updates - in fact, President Buhari, 74, has not given a single interview since arriving in the UK. Instead, the Nigerian public is relying on pictures - posted on Twitter - of their leader meeting senior UK officials as proof that he still is alive. Thelatest statement issued by the government,externalsaid there was ""no cause for worry"" about the president's health but his medical leave was being extended. Nigerians have now heard their leader's voice for the first time since he left for the UK after atelephone conversation with the governor of the northern state of Kanowas played out loud at a prayer meeting. His month-long stay so far has angered some Nigerians afterhe promised to crack down on ""medical tourism"" by officials. Last June, President Buhari spent nearly two weeks in London receiving treatment for an ear infection. But the bigger issue this time is that officials have repeatedly refused to disclose his illness and are not saying when he will return to Nigeria. In a country where rumours are rife, the presidential statements have done little to dampen the speculation about the leader's health. Nigerians are acutely sensitive to leaders travelling abroad for medical reasons afterPresident Umaru Yar'Adua died while in office in 2010,external. For months, the public was kept in the dark while he received treatment in Saudi Arabia. The period of uncertainty created deep political instability in the country. The current president's supporters say that is emphatically not the case this time. They point to the fact that President Buhari constitutionally handed over power to his vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo, as he has done on previous trips, rather than governing from afar. He did take one phone call while in London, however, from the US President Donald Trump - the first between the two leaders. ""There is no vacuum at the top,"" says political analyst Jibrin Ibrahim. ""President Buhari takes his constitutional role seriously, and has not personalised power, unlike other African leaders. ""My chief criticism is that his government has been acting like it has all the time in the world, when in fact urgent decisions needed to be made in regard to the economy."" But, perhaps, one of the most striking things about President Buhari's absence has been the go-getting style of the acting leader. President Buhari has formally handed over his power to vice-president Yemi Osinbajo Yemi Osinbajo is preparing to launch an economic recovery plan. He also led a high-profile delegation to the Niger Delta to voice support for a government agreement with local militants groups that have seriously disrupted the region's oil production. But critics say that despite all his activity, the vice-president has no real authority. ""He cannot perform because ministers and other political appointments are not obliged to be loyal to him as he didn't appoint them,"" said Isuwa Dogo, a political analyst, and a member of the opposition party. ""President Buhari is a public figure and there is no need for him to hide behind his health issues. ""I want him to be back in the county. If there are successes, he will get the credit. If there are failures, he will get the blame."" So, while Big Brother fans will know in April who has been crowned the series winner, for now, no-one seems to know when Nigeria's president will come back home. Where is Nigeria's president?

"This video can not be played US ""at boiling point"": Town halls target Trump's agenda Republican politicians are returning to their home districts to a barrage of criticism, as many constituents demand to know how they'll hold President Trump to account. There's never a good time to talk politics, but democracy starts early in the state of Iowa. By 7:30 am, as the morning fog was still lifting and the sun was starting to appear, the meeting room in the Iowa Falls Fire department was already at full capacity. A few hundred people had travelled from across the state to attend a town hall meeting, filling every chair and corner, and spilling into the hallway. Town halls are traditionally a forum for constituents to discuss their concerns with elected officials, face to face. But in the Trump era, they've taken on a new purpose - with many aggrieved voters seeing them as a way to put pressure on President Trump, by ensuring their members of Congress hold him to account. Republican officials across the country have found themselves on the receiving end of questions and demands from voters. This video can not be played Angry protesters harangue Republicans over Trump Many, but not all, of those attending are Democrats, some from progressive groups who are organising around these events to ensure people show up. But others are simply frustrated residents, who want their voices heard. All are represented by Senator Chuck Grassley. The vast majority of the crowd at the fire station was older, in their fifties or above. Some of them came with handwritten protest signs, others clutched pieces of paper with their questions written on them. ""I'm new at this,"" a woman named Ingrid told me. She said Trump's victory made her angry. ""I felt I had to come. I'm hoping our voices get larger and that we can make sure Republicans don't just vote along party lines and listen to their constituents."" And listen is exactly what Senator Grassley did, even if some felt he didn't quite answer all of their concerns. As the seven-term senator entered the room, he began by asking the group which topics they'd like to cover. As hands flew in the air, and people jostled for his attention, a range of topics were raised - everything from Russia to guns, healthcare to education. Senator Grassley wrote the questions down in a small notebook, promising to answer them in the order they were asked. A large majority of questions were about President Obama's healthcare law - the Affordable Care Act. The questions on this were impassioned, as people talked of their personal experiences of Obamacare, and their fears they could lose coverage under a Trump presidency. One elderly man attended on behalf of a friend whose son was seriously ill. He told the senator of how ""his parents will probably have to face bankruptcy just as they face retirement"". Other testimonies reflected the extent people here rely on government subsidised health insurance. ""I'm on Obamacare, if it wasn't for Obamacare we wouldn't be able to afford insurance,"" said Chris Petersen, an insulin dependent diabetic who runs a farm more than an hour away. ""I got a present for you,"" he told the senator, as he held up a box of Tums, a medicine used to relieve heartburn, ""you're going to need them in the next few years."" When a bespectacled man in a grey sweater asked a question about the national debt, things got testy. As Senator Grassley answered referencing President Trump's taxation plans people began to heckle. ""Raise Trump's taxes,"" yelled a man at the back of the room. ""Everything is going to a pittance,"" shouted a woman. As she did the questioner got angry. ""I asked him, not you, so shut your hole,"" he said, as he jabbed his finger in her direction. At other times the mood in the room was calmer. When Zalmay Naizy, an Afghan who'd been an interpreter for the US army, asked a question, the room fell near silent. ""I'm a Muslim in this country, who's going to save me here? This video can not be played Senator Grassley is one of many Republicans facing angry questions at town hall meetings ""I've been shot two times, I've been roadside bombed once, nobody cares about me. But I was with the US."" The room erupted in cheers, and while the senator didn't address his question right away, choosing to move onto another question about trade deals, he returned to it later, promising to help Zalmay, as he stood by his side. This town hall was held in a county which voted for Donald Trump by a large margin. Senator Grassley prides himself on holding meetings in every county in the state every year through his ""99 county"" pledge, but not all are town halls. He's faced criticism for holding most of those in solidly Republican areas. The event at the fire station was one of two on the same day. Later, in the basement of the Hancock County Sheriff's jail, another crowd gathered. Once again many were waiting outside as the room was at capacity. The mood was tense. ""I want impeachment,"" shouted one man from the back. ""Why are you against government healthcare, but take it yourself?"" asked another. Obamacare dominated the agenda here too, with more personal stories. There was the mother, a former Republican voter, who was concerned about losing healthcare for her son who has disabilities. The veteran worried about treatment of the military. And Jamet, an immigrant from Chile, told the senator ""we're already making this country great"" and asked ""How will you stand up for immigrants?"" ""We need people to stand up for the ordinary working person,"" said Chris Petersen, the farmer with the Tums, who I'd met at the first town hall. His sentiment is not that different to the views of Donald Trump supporters, who told me during the campaign time and time again, that politicians don't represent them. Chris Petersen offered Grassley antacids Some who voted for him were at Senator Grassley's town halls, in a show of solidarity.  Jim Carson accused Democrats at the events of ""trying to obstruct the good policies of Mr Trump."" When I asked Senator Grassley if the anger expressed at the town halls would mean he was more likely to confront the president over his agenda, he told me the focus for him was taking these concerns back to his colleagues on capitol hill. ""I don't think you should see it as challenging Trump I think you should see it as Congress doing its job and the president doing his job."" It was a popular grassroots movement that helped sow the seeds of a Trump presidency, now another is trying to challenge it. For some voters, the only way to get to President Trump is by applying pressure on congress. Senators like Chuck Grassley have to balance their support for the Republican agenda, with the grievances of the voters who keep them in office. Even a small number of people attending town halls can be enough to keep elected officials on edge. These scenes we are seeing at these meetings across America are reminiscent of the early days of the Obama administration, when conservatives attended packed town halls to lobby their congressional representatives on healthcare, in what became known as the Tea Party movement. ""America is starting to boil,"" Chris Petersen told me as I met him afterwards at his farm. As liberals try to exert pressure on their senators and representatives, it's clear that a new progressive movement is brewing.

"Opposite-sex couples in 11 European territories can enter civil partnership People in the UK have been wondering where in Europe opposite-sex couples can choose civil partnership over marriage after a British heterosexual couple lost their legal fight to choose civil union. Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidanlost their casein the Court of Appeal to have a civil partnership. Although the judges acknowledged there was a potential breach of the couple's human rights, they argued that the government should have more time to decide the future of civil partnership in the UK. BBC readers asked which countries permit civil partnership for a man and a woman. We looked into it - and the answer is that there are 11 places in Europe where opposite-sex couples can choose civil partnership in one form or another. Rights can vary for heterosexual couples in Europe in civil partnerships Legally recognised union between a same-sex couple. Couples in a civil partnership receive equal legal treatment including inheritance and next-of-kin arrangements Partnership ceremonies can be conducted in private, whereas marriage ceremonies must be public and can be conducted by clergy Failed partnerships require dissolution, like divorce Some couples choose civil partnership instead of marriage because they reject the historical or religious associations of marriage such as links to patriarchy or property. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the famously liberal Netherlands was the first country in Europe to allow heterosexual couples to enter a civil partnership. Portuguese citizens or legal foreign residents who have lived together for at least two years can enter a civil union. Rights for opposite-sex couples in a civil union are largely the same as for married couples. France introduced the Civil Solidarity Pact or PACS to give legal status to both heterosexual and same-sex couples. Although a PACS does not give the same rights as marriage, it is nonetheless popular with couples. While the number of marriages hasdeclined,externaleach year since 2000, the number of couples choosing a civil solidarity pact has increased, by up to 25% in some years. Hot on the heels of their neighbours, Belgian citizens in opposite-sex relationships have been able to choose a civil union or ""statutory cohabitation"" over marriage since 2000. The French PACS model also influenced Luxembourg. The partnerships provide many of the same rights as marriage. However, couples are not permitted to jointly adopt children. It is more popular among younger couples - and anyone who declares a civil union can take a six-day holiday from work. Opposite-sex couples have been able to obtain the status of ""stable union of a couple"" since 2005. The Greek parliament followed in the steps of France's example, and in 2008 introduced civil unions for opposite-sex couples. However, few Greeks have taken up the opportunity - in the year after the law was introduced, just 161 couples joined in civil union. Couples in the British territory can choose civil partnership, which grants most of the rights of marriage. Although the legislation permits both opposite-sex and same-sex couples to have civil union, the first couple to take advantage were Nadine and Alicia Muscat, who tied the knot in May 2014 after being together for 20 years. Heterosexual and same-sex couples can enter a civil union in Malta which gives the same rights and responsibilities as marriage, including the right to joint adoption. The Estonian parliament passed a law by amargin of two,externalto permit heterosexual and same-sex couples to enter civil partnership in 2014. Unlike the majority of countries on this list, Estonian citizens did not back their representatives - asurvey,externalfound that 60% of respondents were not in favour of the legislation. Nevertheless, the law came into force on 1 January 2016. Men and women in Britain hoping to one day have a civil partnership can be inspired by the Isle of Man, which is a British Crown Dependency. The island passed the law in August 2016. In October, Adelina Cosson and Kieran Hodgson were thefirst heterosexual couplein the British Isles to take advantage of the new law. One week later, Claire Beale and Martin Loat flew from London to become thefirst heterosexual couple in the UKto enter a civil partnership.

"Scotland's back row for the visit of Wales: John Barclay, Ryan Wilson and John Hardie Six Nations: Scotland v Wales Venue:Murrayfield, EdinburghDate:Saturday, 25 FebruaryKick-off:14:25 GMT Coverage:Live on BBC One, S4C, BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru & BBC Sport website and BBC Sport app, plus live text commentary John Barclay will captain a Scotland side featuring five changes for the Six Nations encounter at home to Wales. Barclay, 30, is skipper in the absence of Greig Laidlaw, who misses the rest of the campaign with an ankle injury. Ali Price replaces Laidlaw at scrum-half, with Sean Maitland dropping out and Tim Visser starting on the wing. Gordon Reid is in for Allan Dell in the front row, while John Hardie replaces Hamish Watson and Ryan Wilson steps in for Josh Strauss at number eight. ""John has played a vital role in our leadership group and has led by example throughout this and previous campaigns,"" said head coach Vern Cotter of his new captain. Glasgow Warriors scrum-half Ali Price comes in to the team to earn his third cap ""It was disappointing to lose Greig Laidlaw. However, we continue to develop a system of shared leadership in this squad, which has supported the transition. It'll be a proud moment for John and one which he thoroughly deserves."" The Scarlets loose forward took over the captaincy temporarily when Laidlaw sustained his injury in the gruelling22-16 defeat by Francein Paris two weeks ago.

"Rich Donovan worked as a trader for 10 years on Wall Street It's a fast-paced, risk-taking industry glamorised by Hollywood and writers alike, but when one Wall Street trader left the floor he identified a huge market being ignored by the business world. Canada-based businessman Rich Donovan worked as a trader for Merrill Lynch for 10 years after he graduated from the prestigious Columbia Business School. It was competitive enough, but with cerebral palsy he felt he had more to prove. ""I was told to my face that I would never be a trader. They were wrong, but that's just the reality of having a disability. You figure out how to work around it."" He says he was asked at every job interview, ""Can you physically do this job?"" His answer was always the same: ""I don't know, but we're going to find out."" Donovan was offered every job he went for and says there was ""never a time that I hit a barrier, largely because I was 10 steps ahead of what I needed to be"". It is this attitude that has led him to identify a market worth $8 trillion (Â£6.4tn) and brimming with untapped talent: the disability market. After he left the trading floor, Donovan set up theReturn on Disability Group,external(ROD). The firm helps companies improve their products, customer experience and recruitment for disabled clients, as well as alerting investors to companies that target that market. Its slogan is ""translate different into value"". The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange He estimates the market comprises about 1.3 billion people with disabilities worldwide, plus an additional 2.42 billion people once their friends and family are taken into account, which Donovan describes as ""huge"". It seems hard to believe that such a market could be overlooked, but he says it has largely gone unseen because people look at it from the wrong angle. The key, he says, is not to consider disability a niche market, but as an ""emerging market"" - and to challenge the conventional because ""companies and governments have no clue how to convert that size into value"". Donovan says traditional government schemes to get more disabled people into work or bespoke products made for disabled people fail to properly utilise the market. For that, you need to think beyond lunches and motivational talks and remember business is always about money. ""Most companies think they need to be perfectly ready to provide an 'accessible' space for disabled workers. The reality is disabled people know what they need to be successful. Companies only need to listen and adjust to those needs,"" he says. Rich Donovan with his team from Return on Disability ""Quotas and equity laws do not cause hiring, it's the promise of future profits that does. Companies, by their very nature, act in their shareholders' best interests, doing what will grow revenue in the fastest way possible."" Therefore, Donovan says, companies should ""attack the market"" as they would any other. ""Find out the desires of disabled consumers as they relate to your profitable enterprise, adjust your product and messaging to attract their business then execute this in line with your company's process and culture."" Donovan believes mistakes are often made when companies try to ""disable"" their business or do just enough to comply with regulations. Rich Donovan spoke to BBC Business Daily about the disability market from a studio in Toronto Listen to Business Dailyon the BBC World Service to hear about the daily drama of money and work from the BBC with a special programme for the Disability Works season. ""Disabled people don't want 'special' products,"" he says. ""But they are hungry to be included in the mainstream consumer experience. ""Most companies today look at this as a government regulatory mandate; they're not looking at this as a profitability opportunity, they're not looking at this as an innovation opportunity to improve products for users. ""They're looking at this as a charity effort,"" he says. Donovan believes the key to cracking this market is to flip the disabled consumer experience to ultimately benefit the mainstream audience. ""We've learnt that people with disabilities use things very harshly, they use them in extreme ways, and if you can learn how they use things and use that information it makes that core product better for everyone. That way the returns really take off."" The former trader says there is one company that already does this: Google. Google has developed a self-driving car which turned conventional ideas on their head ""The core of what they do is innovation and in most of their products there is some disability component. It's at the very core of what they do. ""Look at the Google [self-driving] car - you can imagine the head engineer walking into his team and saying 'OK, build me a car that a blind guy can drive' and that's exactly what they did. ""They're very focused on leveraging disability to make the core product experience better for everyone."" Donovan says the disability market has only really existed within the past decade continues to develop. ""They're still grappling with what that looks like and that process historically takes a few years,"" he says. ""You look back at women and race and it takes a little bit of time to adjust to that reality and disability has just started to do that."" But it is not just the disability market that Donovan's company has been tasked with growing. His clients have also asked him to apply the same ideas to sexuality and poverty. Donovan's ambition is to move away from government regulations and to help companies serve non-traditional markets with the aim of ultimately increasing profitability - a process he describes as ""figuring out how to 'eat that elephant'"".

"Many of today's papers report on the murder of the children's author Helen Bailey, by her partner Ian Stewart. The Times says Stewart drugged Ms Bailey over a period of months,lacing her morning scrambled eggs,externalwith a powerful sedative which left her tired and vulnerable. Helen Bailey chatted to Ian Stewart online before going out on dates and starting a relationship The Guardian reports that Stewart beganstealing money from his victim,externaljust hours after her death, raiding her savings account and attempting to sell one of her properties. While the Daily Express says Stewart made aseries of blunders,externalfollowing the murder, including keeping Ms Bailey's phone and referring to her in the past tense. The Daily Telegraph reports that thegovernment is under pressure,externalto prove that none of the Â£20m paid to British terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay ended up in the hands of the so-called Islamic State group. The calls have been sparked by the case of Jamal al Harith - an IS suicide bomber who received up to Â£1m in compensation after being freed from the prison camp. The Daily Mail has come out fighting after Tony Blair accused the paper of hypocrisy over its coverage of the case. The former prime minister pointed out that The Mail had led a huge media campaign for Harith's release. But calling Mr Blair""increasingly delusional"" and ""mendacious"",external, the paper says that while it had condemned Guantanamo Bay, it had never claimed the detainees weren't ""very bad men"". Britain is wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on afailed green energy project,externalaccording to the Times. It reports the government has given huge subsidies to power stations to burn wood pellets, which it says do more harm to the environment than the coal they replaced. The paper says the scheme was championed by former MP Chris Huhne when he was in the coalition government, adding that he now works for an American company that supplies wood pellets.  Mr Huhne has denied any conflict of interest to the paper. Cressida Dick, the first woman to become the chief constable of the Metropolitan police, makes a number of the front pages. The Guardian quotes a former senior Met officer who says Ms Dick""inspires confidence"",externaland can operate in tough, predominantly male situations as well as working with senior politicians.

"Priest Gary Bradley and Zubeir Hassam share a cup of tea before buying each other kneepads in the Amazon Prime ad A man who played an imam in a popular Christmas advert has been asked to work with the government to promote harmony between Islam and other faiths. In the Amazon commercial, Zubeir Hassam and priest Gary Bradley buy each other kneepads to help with the discomfort of kneeling while praying. Mr Hassam said it had turned him into a celebrity, with people stopping him in the street for selfies. He is even set to meet the Queen when she visits Leicester in April. Since the ad was released in the UK in November to promote the Amazon Prime delivery service, it has been viewed millions of times around the world. More on this story and other news in Leicestershire Mr Hassam addressing a Human Relief Foundation conference in Manchester Mr Hassam, principal of the Muslim School, in Oadby, Leicestershire, said he was pleased with its positive message, which promotes friendship between Muslims and Christians. ""The message that went to the world and the community at large was of peace,"" he said. But he said he never thought it would become so popular and he now gets stopped for selfies, including one occasion at an airport in Turkey, where he was recognised by a family travelling to Mecca. ""It was so amazing to see them all, the sisters and brothers in ihram [where men wear all white for the pilgrimage] and yet they wanted a picture with me,"" he said. He was given a taste of celebrity life when he was invited to a world peace conference in Abu Dhabi and put up in a five-star hotel. ""I'm not royalty but I feel I've reached that level,"" he joked. But there is a serious side to the attention the advert has garnered and the government has asked him to work with them on promoting harmony between faiths, he said. Although he has met the Queen three times before the advert aired, he has been invited to dine with her when she visits Leicester on Maundy Thursday.

"Protesters have called for Mexicans to stand in ""unity"" against Mr Trump's immigration policies Three separate political events in as many days last week laid bare the differences over the US-Mexico relationship, as the new US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, arrives for his first visit to the country. The first was theDay Without Immigrants. Held in towns and cities across the United States, it was a timely reminder of the importance of the immigrant community to the US economy. From Washington DC to Detroit, from LA to New York, restaurants, coffee shops and convenience stores closed their doors as part of a nationwide immigrant-rights solidarity movement. Restaurants were closed in several major cities across the US It is estimated that about seven million immigrants work in the restaurant industry alone, not to mention sectors such as construction, healthcare, food production and manufacturing. The participants wanted to send a clear message to the Trump administration about its hard-line stance on deportations and the border wall. The next significant political event was the following dayin an aircraft hangar in Melbourne, Florida. A rally by President Trump saw him, in effect, back on the campaign stump, making a speech that sounded as though the election was just days away, not recently won. President Trump used his speech in Melbourne to reiterate his plans to deport large numbers of ""bad hombres"" In the media storm that followedthe president's confusing reference to Sweden, his comments on Mexico were largely lost. Again he mentioned the ""bad hombres"" from the southern side of the border, on this occasion explicitly calling them ""gang members, bad, bad people"". His administration, he assured his supporters, would soon be deporting large numbers of undocumented immigrants with criminal records. ""I said [from] day one, they're going out. Or they're being put in prison, but for the most part, get them the hell out of here. Bring them back to where they came from,"" he said, to huge applause. This week, that promise has been backed up by tough new guidelines on deportations. Civil rights groups such as the ACLU fear the move will target immigrants who have spent years living and working in the shadows in the US, and now face being deported over parking violations or minor infractions. However, the Trump administration says the step will strengthen existing rules and ""take the shackles off"" the relevant law enforcement agencies. The final event was in Mexico itself. On Sunday,tens of thousands took to the streets of the capital, Mexico City,as part of what the organisers called Vibra Mexico. Demonstrators unite in a call for Mr Trump to respect the Mexican people The placards being held up made it clear against whom the ire in Mexico was directed. ""Stop Trump!"" read a huge banner in English, although ""Fuera Pena!"" - meaning ""Pena Out"" - was equally prominent. The Mexican President, Enrique Pena Nieto is facing the lowest approval ratings of any Mexican leader since the 1994 peso crash, which left the Mexican economy on its knees. His handling of Donald Trump, combined with a controversial fuel price hike known as the ""gasolinazo"", has infuriated ordinary Mexicans, and for many the end of his controversial presidential term can't come around soon enough. Besides the anger at the two presidents, the other noticeable feature of Vibra Mexico was the call for national unity in the face of what people here perceive as unfettered aggression by the Trump administration. ""Something amazing that Trump has accomplished, is a sort of 'rally-around-the-flag' phenomenon in Mexico,"" says Dr Eric Magar, political scientist at the ITAM institute in Mexico City. Even Mr Pena Nieto experienced a short-lived bump in popularity when he chosenot to travel to Washington DC for a bilateral meeting at the White House. ""Pena Nieto, even if he's a very weak leader and indecisive, has been receiving the applause of the Mexican elite,"" says Dr Magar. Protestors have criticised the president's handling of the fuel price crisis Not, though, that of most of the Mexican electorate, who are furious at the clumsy way the government has dealt with the economic crisis. For example, the Finance Ministry announced last week that the cost of a litre of petrol would go down at the pumps. Amid the pain of the ""gasolinazo"", it sounded like welcome news for consumers. However it didn't take long to realise this wasn't the bold economic gesture many had been calling for. It was two cents cheaper. That's not two US cents, but two cents of a Mexican peso - a price reduction so infinitesimally small that many considered it a mockery. As one political commentator put it: ""If it weren't so humiliating, we'd be laughing"". It immediately prompted a new hashtag to appear on social media in Mexico: #GobiernoDeA2Centavos, meaning ""Two Cent Government"". Currently, that is about as much as many voters think Mr Pena Nieto's administration is worth. Add to this economic malaise President Trump's protectionist policies, the detested border wall and his insistence that Mexico will pay for it, plus the insulting tone and very public nature of the debate being conducted via Twitter, and the new US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, arrives in Mexico City amid some hostility. Accompanied by the head of the Department of Homeland Security, John Kelly, the two men have an unenviable task: building bridges where their boss has been building a wall. This video can not be played How will President Trump deliver on border wall promise? ""The wall is the symbolic part,"" says Dr Magar, ""but the important part is the trade war that is looming. That will hurt us more."" ""A huge part of our prosperity is based on trading with the US. Any plan to cut ties with Mexico would hurt us very much. So pain is on its way."" It is against that background that the Mexican flags turned out in force for Vibra Mexico and the handmade signs urging ""unidad y dignidad"" - unity and dignity - among Mexicans. For Jesus Silva-Herzog Marquez, renowned Mexican essayist and political commentator, the calls for unity are misguided. Writing in the national newspaper, Reforma, he called instead for ""visible and noisy disunity"". ""Diversity doesn't make us vulnerable,"" he wrote. ""We are not facing a military invasion. The challenges we face are very different and can't be faced if we choose to postpone our disagreements."" The new US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, has no previous diplomatic experience Many analysts see those challenges in two key areas: migration and trade. ""Both endeavours require the opposite of union: real conflict over the rights and interests,"" said Mr Silva-Herzog, urging public and open debate in Mexico. Either way, as the question of renegotiating the Nafta trade agreement looms, Mr Tillerson's Mexican counterpart, Luis Videgaray, made a plea for unity of his own during a trip to the other Nafta member, Canada. ""The true benefit of Nafta is not economic, it's cultural,"" he said in flawless English at a panel discussion in Toronto. ""Our relationship is fundamentally a true friendship between two societies. We should do more not only to be closer but also to feel closer."" The Trump administration's envoys might also carry a more conciliatory message than their president - but given recent events, they face a tough time delivering it to most Mexicans.

"Heathrow expansion can only be justified if the government proves it will not breach laws on climate change and pollution, MPs say. Ministers say a third runway will not exceed environment limits. However, the Commons Environmental Audit Committee has accused the government of ""magical thinking"" - wishing the problem away without a proper solution. They say ministers must show the expansion will not fuel climate change. Committee chair Mary Creagh told BBC News: ""There's plenty of talk about how the government wants to solve environmental problems at Heathrow, but a total absence of any policy guarantees. ""The implication of this is that they think other sectors of the economy like energy and industry are going to have to cut their carbon emissions even more so people can fly more - but the government's been told by its own advisors (the Committee on Climate Change) that's not possible."" Heathrow expansion: Why is it taking so long? How the cost of delays stacks up Heathrow's death sentence for villages The MPs also criticised the government's reliance on a projected increase in electric vehicles on the roads to keep local air pollution within safe limits. ""The government has missed already its targets for electric vehicles,"" Ms Creagh said. ""Our committee has no confidence it will meet its target for 2020 or 2030. Ministers have got to put proper policies in place instead of relying on magical thinking."" What are your solutions for air pollution? The committee previously urged a step change in the way the government tackles environmental issues at Heathrow, but says there is little evidence this has happened. The UK has already breached EU limits in London for the pollutant NO2 for 2017. The committee says a new air quality strategy is urgently needed to ensure that airport expansion does not harm public health. The government has said after Brexit that EU environmental laws will be imported wholesale into the UK, but the MPs say they have seen no guarantees that the government will keep pace with future EU air quality laws. The report calls on the ministers to implement an alert system for nearby residents who are especially vulnerable to short-term exposure to air pollution. On climate change, the MPs complain that international aviation emissions from an expanded Heathrow will be 15% higher than the level previously set for 2028-32. They say the government must show how the slack will be taken up by other sectors of the economy, which are already struggling to meet their own emissions targets. They say measures on noise lack ambition, with no precision on the timing of a night flight ban and little evidence that predictable respite can be achieved. The report was welcomed by John Stewart, the chair of HACAN, the campaign group that opposes Heathrow expansion. ""The government and Heathrow Airport have got to up their game big-time if they are to have any chance of getting a third runway,"" he said. ""They have got to prove they can deliver on noise, climate and air pollution - not just say they can."" The report comes just weeks after the government launched a public consultation on a third runway, which ends on 25 May. Later this year or early next year MPs are expected to be asked to vote on the runway. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""We take our air quality commitments extremely seriously and have been very clear that the new runway will not get the go-ahead unless air quality requirements can be met."" The spokesman said the government has no plans to ""water down"" its ambitions on cutting aviation emissions and remains committed to meeting emission reductions targets under the Climate Change Act.

"Rumours are rife about Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari's health - and grip on power As Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari was beginninghis latest visit to London more than a month ago, a new series of Big Brother Nigeria was getting under way. A former military ruler known for his no-nonsense style would appear to have little in common with a reality TV show where contestants engage in attention-seeking behaviour. But both subjects were soon generating headlines for the same reason - neither of them were in Nigeria. It turned out that Big Brother was actually being filmed in South Africa  - a decision that led Nigeria's information minister to launch an investigation. While the howls of protests from outraged Big Brother fans soon died down, the clamour over Nigeria's leader's extended medical stay in London is not going away. President Buhari's absence comes as Africa's most populous nation is gripped by its worst economic crisis in decades, and faces the threat of famine in north-east Nigeria, which has been devastated by the Boko Haram insurgency. And unlike Big Brother, there are no constant updates - in fact, President Buhari, 74, has not given a single interview since arriving in the UK. Instead, the Nigerian public is relying on pictures - posted on Twitter - of their leader meeting senior UK officials as proof that he still is alive. Thelatest statement issued by the government,externalsaid there was ""no cause for worry"" about the president's health but his medical leave was being extended. Nigerians have now heard their leader's voice for the first time since he left for the UK after atelephone conversation with the governor of the northern state of Kanowas played out loud at a prayer meeting. His month-long stay so far has angered some Nigerians afterhe promised to crack down on ""medical tourism"" by officials. Last June, President Buhari spent nearly two weeks in London receiving treatment for an ear infection. But the bigger issue this time is that officials have repeatedly refused to disclose his illness and are not saying when he will return to Nigeria. In a country where rumours are rife, the presidential statements have done little to dampen the speculation about the leader's health. Nigerians are acutely sensitive to leaders travelling abroad for medical reasons afterPresident Umaru Yar'Adua died while in office in 2010,external. For months, the public was kept in the dark while he received treatment in Saudi Arabia. The period of uncertainty created deep political instability in the country. The current president's supporters say that is emphatically not the case this time. They point to the fact that President Buhari constitutionally handed over power to his vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo, as he has done on previous trips, rather than governing from afar. He did take one phone call while in London, however, from the US President Donald Trump - the first between the two leaders. ""There is no vacuum at the top,"" says political analyst Jibrin Ibrahim. ""President Buhari takes his constitutional role seriously, and has not personalised power, unlike other African leaders. ""My chief criticism is that his government has been acting like it has all the time in the world, when in fact urgent decisions needed to be made in regard to the economy."" But, perhaps, one of the most striking things about President Buhari's absence has been the go-getting style of the acting leader. President Buhari has formally handed over his power to vice-president Yemi Osinbajo Yemi Osinbajo is preparing to launch an economic recovery plan. He also led a high-profile delegation to the Niger Delta to voice support for a government agreement with local militants groups that have seriously disrupted the region's oil production. But critics say that despite all his activity, the vice-president has no real authority. ""He cannot perform because ministers and other political appointments are not obliged to be loyal to him as he didn't appoint them,"" said Isuwa Dogo, a political analyst, and a member of the opposition party. ""President Buhari is a public figure and there is no need for him to hide behind his health issues. ""I want him to be back in the county. If there are successes, he will get the credit. If there are failures, he will get the blame."" So, while Big Brother fans will know in April who has been crowned the series winner, for now, no-one seems to know when Nigeria's president will come back home. Where is Nigeria's president?

"Katy Perry brought the house down There were puppets. There were pyrotechnics. And a house fell down. All in all, it was a pretty eventful Brit Awards. David Bowie won the biggest prizes, while The 1975 and Beyonce also took home trophies. But the winners are only half the story. Who surpassed themselves? Who embarrassed themselves? These were the real winners and losers at the O2 arena. When Little Mix won best single, they took so long to find the podium that organisers had to play their intro music twice. ""I'm sorry it took so long to get up here,"" said a taken aback Perrie Edwards. ""We didn't know where to go because we didn't think we were going to get it,"" explained Jade Thirlwall. ""We were just sitting chinwagging."" Katy Perry sang her new single surrounded by dancers dressed as white houses, while skeletal mannequins of Theresa May and Donald Trump stalked across the stage. As the song reached its climax, one of the houses missed their footing and fell off the stage on to a spectator below. Yes, she brought the house down. Brit Awards 2017 as it happened David Bowie dominates, grime loses out Simon Neil of Biffy Clyro arrived in a bright red cape that immediately made us think of the Emperor's Royal Guards in Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi. ""The Emperor's Guards? I'll take that,"" he laughed. ""I'd also take 'Red Carpet Man' or 'Red Riding Dude.'"" The winner, for the eighteenth consecutive year, was ""any road vehicle"". An accident in the Blackwall tunnel left dozens of pop stars scrambling to get to the O2 arena on time.

Here's what we got: Welcome to the Heavy Entertainment Show. I Love My Life. Mixed Signals. The three remaining members of Wham! appearing on stage to pay tribute to George Michael was tough to watch.

Chris Martin's performance of A Different Corner was equally moving. And what a nice touch to include a clip of Prince - an artist who supported George throughout his battles with Sony - in the video montage during the song. Ed Sheeran and Stormzy were the only act who managed to get the music industry executives up on their feet at the O2 Arena. The unlikely duo were premiering a remix of Ed's Shape Of You - currently the UK's number one single. After the performance, Ed announced the duet would get an official release this Friday. Stormzy seemed pretty pleased about the performance,tweeting,external: ""One of the greatest days of my life thank you all love you all love you bro @edsheeran â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ #BRITs2017."" Bono-in-training Chris Martin jumped off the stage into a baying crowd of Brit School students during an ebullient performance of the new Chainsmokers / Coldplay collaboration Something Just Like This. Of course, the problem with stage diving in the smartphone era is everyone's so busy trying to get a selfie that no-one bothers to catch you, as Chris soon discovered. Wiley, the Godfather of Grime, was on cloud nine as he walked the Brits red carpet, happily chatting to anyone who crossed his path. ""Oh, man. It's an honour to be here,"" he said. ""I watch it on telly usually. But right now, I'm here."" The star was over the moon to see fellow grime stars Skepta, Kano and Stormzy nominated, but he was equally bowled over by all the pop acts - telling the BBC about Katy Perry's work ethic (""she's like bam, bam, bam; jet after jet after jet"") before declaring his devotion to Little Mix. ""I love Little Mix... Little Mix arecrazy. They're sick. ""I listen to everything. Have to, have to. I used to watch Top of the Pops thoroughly. So I like Kylie and Jason, too."" Brooklyn Beckham arrived with approximately 25% too much coat. The son of David and Victoria Beckham used the statement jacket to hide his sling after breaking his collarbone during a snowboarding holiday. Bradley Walsh - yes, that Bradley Walsh, the one who hosts ITV gameshow The Chase - had last year's biggest-selling debut album. Chasing Dreams, a collection of songbook classics, outsold the likes of Zayn Malik and Jack Garratt... begging the question, will there be a sequel? ""I'm sitting on Sony Music's table tonight, so I'm going to find out if I get a second album there,"" he told the BBC. ""They're my bosses, so I've got to go and sit in there and make sure I eat with the right cutlery and all that stuff"". But fans of the star's distinctly old-school tunes might be in for a surprise if Sony do greenlight that record. ""Wiley just came over and gave me a big hug. And then Stormzy came up and put his arms around me and said, 'Great to see you, man. I love you.' ""So I'm now going to release a grime album. That is what I'm going to do."" France's Christine and the Queens - aka Heloise Letissier -  had one of the breakout pop albums of last year, earning her a nomination in the best International female category alongside Rihanna and the two Knowles sisters, Beyonce and Solange. She (correctly) predicted she would lose to one of them. But she felt a familial bond with her fellow nominees. ""If they can adopt me, I wouldn't be against it,"" she said. ""I would probably be the weird cousin at the table but why not? I'm up for it."" ""I just bumped into Katy Perry,"" Bastille's Dan Smith told the BBC. ""That's not your everyday thing.

"Sara Bennett (l) won her Oscar for her work on Ex Machina (centre) and Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy won for her documentary films Oscars season is all about the stars: who said what, which gowns rocked the red carpet, and of course, who won. But for women behind the camera, it takes a lot more to get noticed. Female nominations for technical work are rare - blink and you can miss them. From the outside, it looks like a man's world - but is that how it feels? Three women - two of them 2016 Oscar winners - tell us what it's really like. Oscars 2017: Full coverage Sara Bennett was the first female VFX supervisor to win an Academy Award ""I loved film growing up - I watched a lot of horror and I loved prosthetics, so my natural thought was to get into that,"" saysSara Bennett,external, who won an Oscar for her work on 2015 sci-fi drama Ex Machina. The film brought to life the female robot Ava, played by Alicia Vikander, whose body had humanoid features but with a transparent skull, limbs and torso. As thefirst female VFX supervisor to win an Oscar,external, Sara broke new ground at 2016's ceremony. It was only the third time in 89 years that a woman had been nominated for visual effects. The last winner? Suzanne Benson for Aliens - back in 1987. Technology genius Nathan Bateman, played by Oscar Isaac, holds a robot ""brain"" created by Sara Bennett in Ex Machina Sara said she had to create an ""organic"" look for the ""brain"" Despite being such rarity, Sara says she's never felt outnumbered. ""Until last year's Oscar nomination, I'd never really thought about it being male-dominated,"" she says. ""The hard time for me was learning the craft and moving up, as opposed to dealing with men in my industry."" She grins. ""Being a woman probably went in my favour, to be honest."" Sara, whose back catalogue includes Sherlock, The Martian and the first four Harry Potter films, says she loves the variety her work gives her. Her passion for her work is infectious, and she says it was ""amazing"" winning the Oscar - she couldn't quite believe it when her name was read out. But she also mixes it up by managing a team, mentoring young women and leading children's workshops. Having trained in prosthetics and make-up, she became a runner during the 1990s, working as a general assistant on film sets before switching to VFX. Sara's credits also include Sherlock episode The Abominable Bride As a compositor, she learned how to combine several visual elements into a believable on-screen image, gaining her first credit in 1998 for Babe, Pig in the City. Although aspiring VFX specialists can now learn through YouTube tutorials, software and courses, Sara's adamant that the best experience is found in the workplace. ""Until you're working flat out and your eyes are bleeding at four in the morning, that horrible feeling - that's when you really learn about the job,"" she laughs, talking about the pressures of working to tight deadlines. Sara won her Oscar alongside fellow VFX artists Mark Williams Ardington, Paul Norris and Andrew Whitehurst Three years ago she set up London and Cardiff-based visual effects company Milk with four male colleagues, after their section in another VFX studio, The Mill, was closed down. Sara now sees more women moving through the ranks, and says with delight: ""When I was younger it was about 80/20 men to women in VFX, but now it's closer to 60/40."" But even if more women want creative positions in the film industry, they're not at the top table just yet. Research,externalfrom the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film says women made up just 17% of ""behind-the-scenes employment"" on the top 100, 250 and 500 films of 2016. The study,The Celluloid Ceiling,external, states this is a drop of two percentage points on 2015, putting the figures on a par with 1998. These statistics, combined with this year's all-male VFXOscar nominations, make those rare female wins look even more stark. Fie Tholander says it is ""cool to have a job where you do magic"" with VFX So when's this going to change? Sara says it will take a while. ""There's so many women doing VFX. Maybe they're not doing the big A-List films, but they're out there doing it all."" Fie Tholander, 31, has been inspired by Sara, working for her as a VFX compositor at Milk. ""I've always been drawn to magic, to fairy tale stories,"" she says, citing David Bowie fantasy drama Labyrinth (1986) as an inspiration. She's single-mindedly pursued her career since she was 15 and is now creating aliens for the upcoming Doctor Who series. She also worked on the brains in jars with eyeballs which featured in last year's Christmas special. She worked on last year's Doctor Who Christmas episode As a Danish high school student, she already knew she wanted to work in VFX, studying art atAnimation Workshop,externalbefore heading for London, with an internship atThe Mill,external. It was there that she met Sara, who became her mentor. ""Having Sara as a role model makes women realise they can actually do it,"" she says. ""VFX is portrayed as a technical thing, which isn't always the case. I'm not a technical person, I'm more creative."" Fie thinks women need to be more assertive: ""I think women in general hold back, we're afraid to ask, and men are a bit more bold with their careers."" Amy Adams is the lead in the Oscar-nominated film Arrival Has she ever hit a glass, even a celluloid, ceiling? Nope. ""Sexism isn't something I've come across. If I want something I have to ask for it - no one will give it to me."" But Fie does think the industry's progressing, with more women applying to work in her profession. She's also convinced that the film world is changing. ""With all the movies coming out, we're getting female role models who aren't princesses, which is great."" Recent films such as Arrival have seen Amy Adams star as an expert linguist communicating with aliens, while Star Wars movie Rogue One has Felicity Jones as its lead. But it's not just VFX and sci-fi where women are breaking through. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy started out as a print journalist before switching to documentaries Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, 37,made history last year as Pakistan's only double Oscar winner. She won her second best documentary Oscar for A Girl in the River - The Price of Forgiveness, about honour killings in Pakistan. This video can not be played Oscar-winning Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy on why being a female film-maker is an asset Her first, in 2012, was for Saving Face, about a plastic surgeon treating those scarred by acid attacks. Starting out as a print journalist in Pakistan, Sharmeen decided aged 21 to switch to documentaries, so she could tell her stories visually. There are hundreds of so-called ""honour killings"" in Pakistan each year She pitched her first film proposal to about 80 global organisations. ""I was pretty much turned down by everyone,"" she says. ""But I've always believed that if a door doesn't open for you, it's because you haven't knocked hard enough."" Undeterred, she asked the New York Times, who'd just set up a TV unit. They agreed to fund her first film, about Afghan refugee children on the streets of Pakistan. Her career went upwards from there - she's also won two Emmys (in 2010 and 2013) and the Hilal-e-Imtiaz (Crescent of Distinction), Pakistan's second-highest civilian award. For Sharmeen, her Oscar wins made a huge difference. ""It amplifies your voice and the voices of all of those people you are making a film about. ""After A Girl in the River, there was legislation about honour killing installed in Parliament in Pakistan. The win at the Oscars gave it the final push it needed to get it passed."" She deliberately multi-tasks by producing and directing because ""it allows me the freedom to tell the type of stories I want to tell"". ""I've always said that making a film is like having a baby. You have a long period of time where something is inside of you, and when you send it out into the world, you want the world to appreciate it."" She has also won two Emmys Well aware of the high numbers of men working in the film industry, she says she's at an advantage in her field. ""Whereas Hollywood will tell you fewer women are getting the opportunities to be directors or play key roles in film, in documentary work, women in greater numbers are coming up behind the camera, winning Academy Awards."" And for her, being a female filmmaker is an ""asset"". ""I've been able to get into places where a man would seldom be able to get into,"" she says. ""If I was a man perhaps I wouldn't be standing here today. I'm looked upon as less of a threat because I'm a woman."" Sharmeen says it is an ""asset"" being a female filmmaker Sharmeen is keen to see more young women working in film, and tells them: ""You always need to believe in yourself. You need to go out and kick open those doors and you should never take no for an answer. Anything is possible. ""Chase your dreams and you never know, you may find yourself up on stage telling the stories you want to tell - and getting an accolade for it."" Sara's words of advice are all about being resilient. She adds: ""If you get knocked back just get back up again - keep trying, make sure you enjoy it, put a big smile on your face - don't give up.""

"It's no secret that the Russians have long tried to plant ""sleeper agents"" in the US - men and women indistinguishable from normal Americans, who live - on the surface - completely normal lives. But what happens when one of them doesn't want to go home? Jack Barsky died in September 1955, at the age of 10, and was buried in the Mount Lebanon Cemetery in the suburbs of Washington DC. His name is on the passport of the man sitting before me now - a youthful 67-year-old East German, born Albert Dittrich. The passport is not a fake. Albert Dittrich is Jack Barsky in the eyes of the US government. The story of how this came to be is, by Barsky's own admission, ""implausible"" and ""ridiculous"", even by the standards of Cold War espionage. But as he explains in a new memoir, Deep Undercover, it has been thoroughly checked out by the FBI. As far as anyone can tell, it is all true. It began in the mid-70s, when Dittrich, destined at the time to become a chemistry professor at an East German university, was talent-spotted by the KGB and sent to Moscow for training in how to behave like an American. His mission was to live under a false identity in the heart of the capitalist enemy, as one of an elite band of undercover Soviet agents known as ""illegals"". ""I was sent to the United States to establish myself as a citizen and then make contact, to the extent possible, at the highest levels possible of decision makers - particularly political decision makers,"" he says. This ""idiotic adventure,"" as he now calls it, had ""a lot of appeal to an arrogant young man, a smart young man"" intoxicated by the idea of foreign travel and living ""above the law"". This video can not be played ""This kind of double life wears on you"" He arrived in New York in the Autumn of 1978, at the age of 29, posing as a Canadian national, William Dyson. Dyson, who had travelled via Belgrade, Rome, Mexico City and Chicago, ""immediately vanished into thin air"", having served his purpose. And Dittrich began his new life as Jack Barsky. He was a man with no past and no identification papers - except for a birth certificate obtained by an employee of the Soviet embassy in Washington, who had kept his eyes open during a walk in the Mount Lebanon cemetery. Barsky had supreme self-confidence, a near-flawless American accent, and $10,000 in cash. He also had a ""legend"" to explain why he did not have a social security number. He told people he had had a ""tough start in life"" in New Jersey and had dropped out of high school. He had then worked on a remote farm for years before deciding ""to give life another chance and move back to New York city"". He rented a room in a Manhattan hotel and set about the laborious task of building a fake identity. Over the next year, he parlayed Jack Barsky's birth certificate into a library card, then a driver's licence and, finally, a social security card. But without qualifications in Barsky's name, or any employment history, his career options were limited. Rather than rubbing shoulders with the upper echelons of American society, as his KGB handlers had wanted, he initially found himself delivering parcels to them, as a cycle courier in the smarter parts of Manhattan. The young KGB agent arrived in New York in the late 1970s ""By chance it turned out that the messenger job was actually really good for me to become Americanised because I was interacting with people who didn't care much where I came from, what my history was, where I was going,"" he says. ""Yet I was able to observe and listen and become more familiar with American customs. So for the first two, three years I had very few questions that I had to answer."" The advice from his handlers on blending in - gleaned from Soviet diplomats and resident agents in the US - ""turned out to be, at minimum, weak but, at worst, totally false"", he says. ""I'll give you an example. One of the things I was told explicitly was to stay away from the Jews. Now, obviously, there is anti-Semitism in there, but secondly, the stupidity of that statement is that they sent me to New York. There are more Jews in New York than in Israel, I think."" Barsky would later use his handlers' prejudices and ignorance of American society against them. But as a ""rookie"" agent he was eager to please and threw himself into the undercover life. He spent much of his free time zig-zagging across New York on counter-surveillance missions designed to flush out any enemy agents who might be following him. He would update Moscow Centre on his progress in weekly radio transmissions, or letters in secret writing, and deposit microfilm at dead drop sites in various New York parks, where he would also periodically pick up canisters stuffed with cash or the fake passports he needed for his trips back to Moscow for debriefing. He would return the to the East every two years, where he would be reunited with his German wife Gerlinde, and young son Matthias, who had no idea what he had been up to. They thought he was doing top secret but very well-paid work at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Barsky's handlers were delighted with his progress except for one thing - he could not get hold of an American passport. This failure weighed heavily on him. On one early trip to the passport office in New York an official asked him to fill out a questionnaire which asked, among other things, the name of the high school he had attended. ""I had a legend but it could not be verified,"" he says. ""So if somebody went to check on that they would have found out that I wasn't real."" Terrified that his cover might be blown, he scooped up any documents with his name on them and marched out of the office in a feigned temper at all this red tape. The real Jack Barsky is buried in a Washington DC cemetery Without a passport, Barsky was limited to low-level intelligence work and his achievements as a spy were, by his own account, ""minimal"". He profiled potential recruits and compiled reports on the mood of the country during events such as the 1983 downing of a Korean Airlines flight by a Soviet fighter, which ratcheted up tensions between the US and the Soviet Union. On one occasion, he flew to California to track down a defector (he later learned, to his immense relief, that the man, a psychology professor, had not been assassinated). He also carried out some industrial espionage, stealing software from his office - all of it commercially available - which was spirited away on microfilm to aid the floundering Soviet economy. But it often seemed the very fact of him being in the US, moving around freely without the knowledge of the authorities, was enough for Moscow. ""They were very much focused on having people on the other side just in case of a war. Which I think, in hindsight, was pretty stupid. That indicated very old thinking."" The myth of the ""Great Illegals"" - heroic undercover agents who had helped Russia defeat the Nazis and gather vital pre-war intelligence in hostile countries - loomed large over the Soviet intelligence agencies, who spent a lot of time and effort during the Cold War trying to recapture these former glories, with apparently limited success. Barsky later found out that he was part of a ""third wave"" of Soviet illegals in the US - the first two waves having failed. And we now know that illegals continued to be infiltrated in the 1980s and beyond. He believes about ""10 to 12"" agents were trained up at the same time as him. Some, he says, could still be out there, living undercover in the United States, though he finds it hard to believe that anyone exposed to life in the US would retain an unwavering communist faith for long. He is scathing about his KGB handlers, who were ""very smart"" and the ""cream of the crop"" but who seemed chiefly concerned with making his mission appear a success to please their bosses. ""The expectations of us, of me - I didn't know anybody else - were far, far too high. It was just really wishful thinking,"" he now says of his mission. On the other hand, the KGB's original plan for him might actually have worked, he says. ""I am glad it didn't work out because I could have done some damage. ""The idea was for me to get genuine American documentation and move to Europe, say to a German-speaking country, where the Russians were going to set me up with a flourishing business. And they knew how to do that. ""And so I would become quite wealthy and then go back to the United States without having to explain where the money came from. At that point, I would have been in a situation to socialise with people that were of value."" This plan fell through because of his failure to get a passport, so the KGB reverted to Plan B. This was for Barsky was to study for a degree and gradually work his way up the social order to the point where he could gather useful intelligence - a mission he describes as ""nearly impossible"". The degree part was relatively straightforward. He was, after all, a university professor in his former life. He graduated top of his class in computer systems at Baruch College, which enabled him to get a job as a programmer at Met Life insurance in New York. Like many undercover agents before him, he began to realise that much of what he had been taught about the West - that it was an ""evil"" system on the brink of economic and social collapse - was a lie. Barsky (fourth right) felt at home with co-workers at Met Life ""There was a way to rationalise that because we were taught that the West was doing so well because they took all the riches out of the Third World,"" he says. But, he adds, ""what eventually softened my attitude"" was the ""normal, nice people"" he met in his daily life. ""[My] sense was that the enemy was not really evil. So I was always waiting to eventually find the real evil people and I didn't even find them in the insurance company."" Met Life almost felt like home, he says, ""because it was a very paternalistic, 'we take care of you' kind of a culture"". ""There was nothing like we were taught. Nothing that I expected. I wanted to really hate the people and the country and I couldn't bring myself to hate them. Not even dislike them."" But he was keeping a far bigger secret from his KGB bosses than his wavering commitment to communism. In 1985, he had married an illegal immigrant from Guyana he had met through a personal ad in the Village Voice newspaper - and they now had a daughter together. He now had two families to go with his two identities, and he knew the time would come when he had to choose between them. It finally happened in 1988, when after 10 years undercover he was suddenly ordered to return home immediately. Moscow was in a panic, believing the FBI was on to him. To do anything other than run as ordered - grab his emergency Canadian birth certificate and driver's licence and get out of the US - would be potentially suicidal. He dithered and stalled for a week. Could he really leave his beloved baby daughter Chelsea behind forever? But the KGB was losing patience. One morning, on a subway platform a resident agent delivered a chilling message: ""You have got to come home or else you're dead."" This video can not be played The Americans producers: 'Here was someone who lived it' It was time for some lateral thinking. From discussions with his handlers in Moscow, Barsky had come to believe the Soviet hierarchy feared three things about America. He already knew about their anti-Semitism and their fear of Ronald Reagan, who they saw as an unpredictable religious zealot who might launch a nuclear strike to ""accelerate"" the Biblical ""end times"". But he also remembered their ""morally superior"" attitude to the Aids epidemic - their belief that it ""served the Americans right"" and their determination to protect the motherland from infection. Barsky stalled a bit more and then hatched a plan. ""I wrote this letter, in secret writing, that I wouldn't come back because I had contracted Aids, and the only way for me to get treatment would be in the United States. ""I also told the Russians in the same letter that I would not defect, I would not give up any secrets. I would just disappear and try to get healthy."" To begin with Barsky lived in constant fear for his life, remembering that threat on the subway platform. But after a few months, he began to breathe more easily. ""I started thinking 'I think I got away with this.' The FBI had not knocked on the door. The KGB had not done anything."" He gradually let his guard down and settled into the life of a typical middle-class American in a comfortable new home in upstate New York. While he had fallen for the American Dream and the trappings of the consumer society, he still had some conflicting feelings. ""My loyalties to communism and the homeland and Russia, they were still pretty strong. My resignation, you can also call it a 'soft defection' - that was triggered by having this child here. It was not ideological. It would be easy to claim that. But it wasn't true."" Playing at the back of his mind was always the question of whether his past would catch up with him. And, finally, one day, it did. The man who exposed him was a KGB archivist, Vasili Nikitich Mitrokhin, who defected to the West in 1992 - after the fall of communism - with a vast trove of Soviet secrets, including the true identity of Jack Barsky. The FBI watched him for more than three years, even buying the house next door to his as they tried to figure out whether he really was a KGB agent and, if so, whether he was still active. The Soviet Union began using ""illegal"" agents, living in Europe under false identities, as early as 1919 Unlike ""resident agents"", who are in the country legally as diplomats, they are not immune from prosecution if caught The first illegal was sent to the US in 1921, according to the Mitrokhin archive Famous illegals include Rudolf Abel, unmasked as a Soviet spy in the US in 1957, and Richard Sorge, who posed as a Nazi journalist in Japan during the war In 2010, 10 Russian ""sleeper agents"" on a long-term mission to spy on US policy makers were exposed - including Anna Chapman (pictured) In the end, Barsky himself gave the game away, during an argument with his wife, Penelope, that was picked up by the FBI's bugs. ""I was trying to repair a marriage that was slowly falling apart. I was trying to tell my wife the 'sacrifice' I had made to stay with Chelsea and her. So in the kitchen I told her, 'By the way, this is what I did. I am a German. I used to work for the KGB and they told me to come home and I stayed here with you and it was quite dangerous for me. This is what I sacrificed.' ""And that completely backfired. Instead of bringing her over to my side, she said: 'What does that mean for me if they ever catch you?'"" It was the evidence the FBI needed to pick him up. In a meticulously planned operation, Barsky was pulled over by a Pennsylvania state trooper as he drove away from a toll booth on his way home from work one evening. After stepping out of his car, he was approached by a man in civilian clothes, who held up a badge and said in a calm voice: ""Special agent Reilly, FBI. We would like to talk with you."" The colour drained from Barsky's face. ""I knew the gig was up,"" he says. But with characteristic bravado he asked the FBI man: ""What took you so long?"" He kidded around with Joe Reilly and the other agents who interrogated him, and tried to give them as much information about the KGB's operations as he could. But inside he was panicking that he would be sent to jail and that his American family, which he had been trying to hold together, would be broken up. In fact, luck was on his side. After passing a lie-detector test he was told that he was free to go and, even more remarkably, that the FBI would help him fulfil his dream of becoming an American citizen. Reilly, who went on to become Barsky's best friend and golfing partner, even visited the elderly parents of the real Jack Barsky, who agreed not to reveal that their son's identity had been stolen. ""I was so lucky and so was my family that the decision-makers were nice enough to say, 'Well, you were so well-established, we don't want to disrupt your life,'"" he says. ""It required some interesting gymnastics to make me legal because one thing I didn't have was proof of entry into the country. I came here on documentation that was fraudulently obtained, so it took 10-plus years to finally become a citizen. And when it did, it felt good."" Barsky's coveted American passport Barsky is now married for a third time and has a young daughter. He has also found God, completing his journey from a hardline communist and atheist to a churchgoing, all-American patriot. He has even managed to reconnect with the family he left behind in Germany, although his first wife, Gerlinde, is still not speaking to him. ""I have a very good relationship with Matthias, my son, and his wife. And I am now a grandfather. When we talk about things like Americans playing soccer against Germans, I say 'us'. I mean the Americans. I am not German any more. The metamorphosis is complete."" The final act in his story came two years ago when he revealed the secret of his extraordinary double life on the US current affairs programme, 60 Minutes. He had long wanted to share his story with the world, but his bosses at the New York electricity company where he worked as a software developer were less than impressed to find they had a former KGB agent on the payroll, and promptly fired him. Barsky says he has no regrets. He knows how fortunate he has been. ""This kind of double life wears on you. And most people can't handle it. I am not saying that I lived a charmed life but I got away with it. ""I am in good health. I have had some issues with alcohol that I have overcome and I got another chance to have a good family life. And another child. And I am finally getting to live the life that I should have lived a long time ago. I am really lucky."" Perhaps the supreme irony of Jack Barsky's story is that he was only able to complete the mission the KGB had set him - to obtain an American passport and citizenship - with the help of the FBI. He cannot resist a smile at the thought of telling his KGB handlers that he has not been such a failure after all. ""I wouldn't mind meeting one or two of those fellows I worked with and saying 'Hey, see I did it!'""

"Opposite-sex couples in 11 European territories can enter civil partnership People in the UK have been wondering where in Europe opposite-sex couples can choose civil partnership over marriage after a British heterosexual couple lost their legal fight to choose civil union. Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidanlost their casein the Court of Appeal to have a civil partnership. Although the judges acknowledged there was a potential breach of the couple's human rights, they argued that the government should have more time to decide the future of civil partnership in the UK. BBC readers asked which countries permit civil partnership for a man and a woman. We looked into it - and the answer is that there are 11 places in Europe where opposite-sex couples can choose civil partnership in one form or another. Rights can vary for heterosexual couples in Europe in civil partnerships Legally recognised union between a same-sex couple. Couples in a civil partnership receive equal legal treatment including inheritance and next-of-kin arrangements Partnership ceremonies can be conducted in private, whereas marriage ceremonies must be public and can be conducted by clergy Failed partnerships require dissolution, like divorce Some couples choose civil partnership instead of marriage because they reject the historical or religious associations of marriage such as links to patriarchy or property. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the famously liberal Netherlands was the first country in Europe to allow heterosexual couples to enter a civil partnership. Portuguese citizens or legal foreign residents who have lived together for at least two years can enter a civil union. Rights for opposite-sex couples in a civil union are largely the same as for married couples. France introduced the Civil Solidarity Pact or PACS to give legal status to both heterosexual and same-sex couples. Although a PACS does not give the same rights as marriage, it is nonetheless popular with couples. While the number of marriages hasdeclined,externaleach year since 2000, the number of couples choosing a civil solidarity pact has increased, by up to 25% in some years. Hot on the heels of their neighbours, Belgian citizens in opposite-sex relationships have been able to choose a civil union or ""statutory cohabitation"" over marriage since 2000. The French PACS model also influenced Luxembourg. The partnerships provide many of the same rights as marriage. However, couples are not permitted to jointly adopt children. It is more popular among younger couples - and anyone who declares a civil union can take a six-day holiday from work. Opposite-sex couples have been able to obtain the status of ""stable union of a couple"" since 2005. The Greek parliament followed in the steps of France's example, and in 2008 introduced civil unions for opposite-sex couples. However, few Greeks have taken up the opportunity - in the year after the law was introduced, just 161 couples joined in civil union. Couples in the British territory can choose civil partnership, which grants most of the rights of marriage. Although the legislation permits both opposite-sex and same-sex couples to have civil union, the first couple to take advantage were Nadine and Alicia Muscat, who tied the knot in May 2014 after being together for 20 years. Heterosexual and same-sex couples can enter a civil union in Malta which gives the same rights and responsibilities as marriage, including the right to joint adoption. The Estonian parliament passed a law by amargin of two,externalto permit heterosexual and same-sex couples to enter civil partnership in 2014. Unlike the majority of countries on this list, Estonian citizens did not back their representatives - asurvey,externalfound that 60% of respondents were not in favour of the legislation. Nevertheless, the law came into force on 1 January 2016. Men and women in Britain hoping to one day have a civil partnership can be inspired by the Isle of Man, which is a British Crown Dependency. The island passed the law in August 2016. In October, Adelina Cosson and Kieran Hodgson were thefirst heterosexual couplein the British Isles to take advantage of the new law. One week later, Claire Beale and Martin Loat flew from London to become thefirst heterosexual couple in the UKto enter a civil partnership.

"When the Metropolitan Police Service's newly appointed commissioner, Cressida Dick, begins work at the force's impressive new headquarters on the Embankment, she might like to take a moment to admire the view overlooking the River Thames. But only a moment. Ms Dick won't have time for much more than that. The new commissioner will find that when it comes to leading the Met, there's no off-switch. It's a policing organisation like no other in the UK, with a budget of Â£3bn, a workforce of 43,000 and responsibility for keeping everyone in London - from Barking to Buckingham Palace, from West Norwood to Westminster - safe. The leader of Britain's biggest and most influential police force will come under pressure to make early decisions: on whether to roll out controversial spit-guards, on how to police the Notting Hill Carnival and if Tasers should be extended to all officers. She'll face intense scrutiny from the media, which has a tendency to escalate stories of local difficulties into ones of national importance. And she'll be expected to provide regular updates to the London Assembly, MPs on the home affairs committee, the mayor of London and the home secretary. For Ms Dick there's also an added dimension: the need to stamp her authority on a police force that for over five years has bent to the will of Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, whose no-nonsense style was respected but not universally liked. Indeed, Sir Bernard's retirement may tempt officers who didn't always agree with him to speak out, to adopt a different approach, to do things their own way. And that could spell trouble for Cressida Dick as she sets out to make her mark. One of the key issues the new commissioner will have to grapple with is how to shore up the confidence of firearms officers. In Sir Bernard's final major speech last week, he said there was a ""very shallow pool"" of people wanting to do the job partly because they were increasingly ""portrayed as suspects"" when someone was shot. The problems may come to a head within weeks, when the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decides whether or not to charge a policeman over the death of Jermaine Baker in Wood Green in December 2015. Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe to retire Hogan-Howe in cuts warning Met Police chief calls for 'more trust' in armed officers The officer who fired the fatal shot was arrested, interviewed under criminal caution and bailed by police pending the CPS decision, which is seen as pivotal in the Met's efforts to recruit 600 more specialist armed officers. The move to boost police firearms capacity was sparked by concerns about the threat from terrorism - in particular, the possibility of a marauding gun attack. For Ms Dick, who will have national responsibility for counter-terrorism as well as for protecting London, a complicating factor in the security picture is the political turbulence caused by the election in the US of Donald Trump - and Brexit. The result of the EU referendum sparked a rise in hate crime which police will need to remain on the alert for, while Britain's departure from the EU means the Met and other forces will have to forge new relationships over law enforcement with their European counterparts. As for President Trump, his state visit to the UK, expected to be this year, will present the commissioner with a huge policing challenge. Protests have already taken place in London and are likely to continue, sometimes at very short notice. Many commissioners judge their success in terms of crime. Has it gone up or down? Since the mid-1990s the overall trend has been downwards, due mainly to large falls in acquisitive crimes such as car theft and burglary. For the past three years, however, offences recorded by the Met Police have been on the increase. In 2016, there were 761,998 crimes, 3.5% up on the year before, prompting Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe to remark that the ""warning lights are flashing"". Although the rise in crimes such as sexual offences and domestic abuse is driven by a greater willingness on the part of victims to come forward, what'll most worry the new incumbent are the year-on-year increases of 6% in violence, 17% in knife crime and 22% in firearms offences. Understanding what's behind this apparent upsurge and finding ways to tackle it will be a priority for the commissioner. Her task will undoubtedly be made harder by the tough financial climate. Over the past six years the Met has saved about Â£600m on its annual budget, chiefly by selling police buildings and cutting civilian staff posts. Making further cutbacks - which Sir Bernard and Sadiq Khan, London's mayor, both anticipate if the government changes the way constabularies are funded in England and Wales - are almost certain to entail a reduction in the number of officers. So far, that's been avoided, with 32,000 currently in post. Over the past few months, the outgoing Met commissioner has issued a number of warnings about the impact of cutting officers in a city whose population is becoming bigger and more diverse. If recruitment slows or freezes, efforts to broaden the ethnic mix of the force so it better reflects the people of London will grind to a halt At present 13% of officers are black, Asian or from a minority ethnic background, compared to 40% of those living in the capital. The issue of officer numbers and possible budget cuts is likely to be the biggest and most immediate political challenge facing Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe's replacement. Will she be as bold in confronting the problem as he's been? Or will she take a more diplomatic approach? However calm the Thames may look from her vantage point in New Scotland Yard, Cressida Dick will know that choppy waters lie ahead.

"The claim:The government's figures on business rates are misleading because they exclude inflation and an appeals adjustment. Reality Check verdict:The figures do exclude both those things, but government publications specify that they do. The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome. The government has produced tables showing how much business rates would rise or fall in the coming year, broken down by region of the country and type of business. The overall effect of all the changes comes to zero, which means that the policy is revenue neutral. But there is a key caveat at the bottom of the table, which is that the figures are: ""Before inflation and the adjustment to the multiplier for future appeal outcomes."" The inflation part is widely known. The measure of inflation used will become CPI (Consumer Price Index) instead of RPI (Retail Price Index), which will usually mean the increase is smaller, but that change will not happen until 2020. Increasing rates for RPI will add about 2% per year. But the other part is a bit more complicated - it is the adjustment required to make sure that the changes in rates are revenue neutral even after some businesses have appealed against the rated value of their premises and won. Analysis from the property consultants Gerald Eve suggested that the adjustment would be between four and five percentage points. They did that by working out how much business rates would change across the country to find out what adjustment would then be needed to make the policy revenue neutral again. They add that including both the inflation and the appeals adjustment means that business rates will fall in 135 of the 326 local authorities in England, not 259 as the government claimed. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has strongly disputed suggestions that it has misled people with its figures, but has not disputed the suggestion that the appeals adjustment is between four and five percentage points. Speaking on the Today Programme, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said he thought the figures provided, ""might not be giving the picture that businesses in the real world are going to get when they get their bills"". This is certainly true. The DCLG has been clear that its figures are before inflation and the appeals adjustment. The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.

"The first ban was met by protests in airports across the US - in Dallas, Muslims prayed in protest The US Supreme Court has upheld President Donald Trump's revised travel ban and overruled legal challenges from lower courts. This is the government's third version of a controversial policy since Mr Trump took office in January. The latest presidential proclamation,external- which was issued in September - bans nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the US. It also covers travellers from North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela. But lower courts had already allowed those provisions to take effect. Chad was removed from the list in April. This third version of the travel ban has been in operation since December, when the Supreme Court allowed it to go into force as legal challenges went on. The 5-4 ruling at the highest court in the US reverses a series of lower court decisions that had said the ban was unconstitutional. It hands a major victory to President Trump, who made immigration a central plank of his campaign and introduced the first version of his travel ban just one week into office. Why did a US veteran give his medal to a stranger? Is Trump's bleak vision of America justified? The Canadian town feeling refugee burden Chief Justice John Roberts gave the landmark opinion and the court's other four conservative judges also ruled in favour of the president. The four liberal justices dissented. Theoriginal order,externalissued in January 2017 barred people from seven majority-Muslim countries - Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya - from entering the US for 90 days. It also halted refugee resettlement for 120 days and banned Syrian refugees indefinitely. Chaos ensued at airports, where there was some confusion about enforcement. That travel ban was later blocked by federal courts. Therevised order,externalin March removed Iraq from the list, after it agreed to boost co-operation with the US, and it also lifted the indefinite ban on Syrian refugees. It was also struck down but in June 2017, the Supreme Court allowed that version of the policy to take partial effect, against travellers without close links to the US. A third version of the ban was issued in September, taking Sudan off the list but adding Chad, North Korea and Venezuelan government officials. The latest travel ban says that the countries ""remain deficient at this time with respect to their identity-management and information-sharing capabilities, protocols, and practices.  In some cases, these countries also have a significant terrorist presence within their territory"". Critics have noted that major attacks such as the 9/11 New York attacks, the Boston marathon bombing and the Orlando nightclub attack were carried out by people from countries not on the list, such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kyrgyzstan, or by US-born attackers. This was a crucial question in the legal battle, as six out of eight countries on the list are predominantly Muslim. This video can not be played Muslim students on Trump ban: 'I don't belong here' In one early challenge, a US district judge in Virginiaruled the first order was unconstitutionalbecause it had religious bias at its heart  - an appeals court in the same state ruled along the same lines on the second ban too. Ruling on the second version, the Hawaii court also dismissed the government's argument that the ban is not anti-Muslim because it targets all individuals from the six countries, regardless of religion, and the countries themselves represent only a small fraction of the world's Muslim population. ""The illogic of the government's contentions is palpable. The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed,"" the court ruling said, pointing out that the countries' populations were between 90% and 99% Muslim. The court also cited statements made by Mr Trump, such as a 2015 press release calling for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"". But the Department of Justice has said a distinction should be made between things said as a candidate and as president.

"A November news conferences featuring the two fighters descended into chaos David Haye has called for a physical barrier to be placed between him and heavyweight rival Tony Bellew before their London fight on 4 March. The pair have traded insults before the O2 Arena bout and will be face-to-face at media commitments next week. ""There needs to be protection, a human being isn't enough,"" said Haye, 36. ""Whatever it is, glass or whatever."" At a November news conference,Haye threw a punch at Bellew,who publicly called his opponent out in October. Listen: Tony Bellew's Â£1,000 sparring challenge Haye's attempted punch came almost five years after he brawled with Dereck Chisora at a news conference, and six years after Bellew, 34, had to be separated from Nathan Cleverly at another. Haye (left) threw a left hand at Bellew after the latter shoved him during a head-to-head At another media gathering, Haye - who has conducted much of his training in Miami - repeatedlyargued with Bellew's promoter Eddie Hearn.,external ""When tensions are high and when guys are scared they do crazy things,"" added former WBA heavyweight champion Haye. ""I'm going to make sure he is not in striking distance. I'd love to have confidence that he will keep his hands to himself but I don't have any confidence in him, in his mental state. Hopefully there will be some sort of precautions put in place."" During his in-ring verbal attack on Haye after victory over American BJ Flores in October, Bellew mocked his rival's hairstyle and ridiculed the two opponents Haye has faced since returning to the sport in 2016 after over three years out of the ring. Bellew, the WBC world champion at cruiserweight, will campaign at heavyweight for the first time, completing a two-division jump after competing at light-heavyweight as recently as 2013. He holds a record of 28 wins and a draw from 31 fights, with Haye boasting the same number of wins from 30 contests. I can fight and knock out Haye - Bellew.

"The Petya ransomware makes a computer unusable until a ransom is paid One of the strange features of cybercrime is how much of it is public. A quick search will turn up forums and sites where stolen goods, credit cards and data are openly traded. But a glance into those places may not give you much idea about what is going on. ""Everyone can join as long as you speak Russian,"" said Anton, a malware researcher at security firm SentinelOne, who has inhabited this underground world for more than 20 years. ""By Russian I mean the USSR, so there is Ukrainians, there is Kazakhstan, there is Belarus. The Romanians are doing all the dirty work like spam and maintenance so they are not really involved in developing malware,"" he said. ""But, today, is it mainly Russian? Yes."" Those vibrant underground marketplaces have a long history and Anton adds that he tracks the malware makers to gain insights into what they might do next. ""I was there from the very early stages,"" Anton told the BBC. ""I guess I started at about the age of 12, when there was not much online community. ""Instead it was many channels where hackers exchanged information and exploits and kind of stuff like that,"" he said. In those early days few wanted to break the law, he said. ""Back then there was not much money involved at all,"" he said. ""It was only about sharing knowledge, sharing information, sharing various scripts or downloading warez - which is pirated content."" ""It gives us an insight into the directions these communities are taking. ""We have to monitor these to understand what they are doing, the success they are having and what they are about to do next. ""You have to be prepared rather than just sit back and wait for it to happen to you. It's essential for us to have this kind of contact because without it we are blind."" Responsibilities are divided up among different groups on underground forums ""There's a lot of criminality going on on the open web, particularly when you get into the Russian federation. They do not need to be on the dark web. Some are quite brazen and quite public whereas others have a much higher level of operational security. ""If we are tracking a criminal location and we find chatter about our clients that can be of value,"" he said. ""In the longer term it's what's coming over the horizon. What are they dialling up next? ""It's not trivial to do something like that, it's definitely not easy to do although I think there's definitely value in working out what they are doing."" The underground changed after the millennium turned and e-commerce took off. Forums popped up that talked about how to cash in via spam, phishing, malware and web attacks. There was another big shift in 2007-08, said Anton, as the criminals sought a way to fleece people that gave better returns than the cruder techniques. The first wave, which started the modern era of cybercrime, used fake anti-virus software. ""They installed some really, really poorly written software on your machine,"" he said, explaining the scam. ""It looked like anti-virus but it actually does nothing. ""It tells you: 'We just scanned your PC and we have found many problems. You need to fix it now, you need to buy this software. It only costs $35-40 (Â£28-32)',"" he said. This worked better than earlier scams, said Anton, but it took a lot of effort to catch people out and get them to pay. Often, he said, when people paid via a credit card they reversed the transaction once they found out they had been tricked. Conversion rates, meaning the number of victims who handed over cash, stayed low. ""This meant they must do something better, something more scary."" Frightened people pay up, said Anton, adding that this drove the next evolution: lockers. ""What they do is they attack your browser and put up a big page on your main desktop, saying you were found with illegal child pornography or something very, very scary,"" he said. The early days on the underground were all about swapping code ""People got afraid saying 'OK, maybe one of my kids did it, maybe, I'm not sure, I'll pay',"". The one-page attacks asked for more money, up to $200 (Â£160), and proved so successful that many police forces issued warnings that urged people not to pay. The success, and also the publicity, forced the next stage of crimeware - ransomware, Anton explained. ""I call it an evolution because the same people that did the fake anti-virus before are doing ransomware now. And they were doing the fake police page in the years between 2010 and 2013,"" he said. Ransomware has the best conversion rate, he said, because victims cannot ignore its effects. ""It's real damage so that you can see that your files are no longer working. And that's the best proof for the user that he must pay,"" he said. Its rise has also been helped by the advent of virtual currency Bitcoin, because it has few of the drawbacks of credit cards or other payment systems. ""Today you cannot talk about ransomware without mentioning Bitcoin because that's what made this evolution come,"" said Anton. The damage is not just limited to the amount people pay. Estimates from the FBI suggest that the 992 cases of ransomware carrier Cryptowall reported during a 14-month period cost victims $18m (Â£14.4m). Some of the cost was in the ransom, up to $10,000 (Â£8,000), but this was multiplied by lost productivity, legal fees and work done to remove the infections. It is popular, he said, because of another shift in the way that the underground is organised. In the past the groups writing the malware sent the spam, analysed the results and fleeced the victims. The advent of Bitcoin virtual cash has driven the rise of ransomware Not any more, he said. Now, many groups writing ransomware run it as a service. ""They will give you the software with your affiliate ID so if you spread it they will know that it's from you and you will get a payout,"" he said. ""You will get 70% and they will get the 30% out of each payment."" Competition among ransomware writers means some other groups give better returns. But, he said, those groups may be producing poorly-written malware that struggles to get past the digital defences people and businesses use. The evolution of the underground has hit a peak with ransomware and Bitcoin, said Anton, and their combined success has kicked off a gold rush. ""It's getting more and more people attracted to it, like from the criminal side. More and more people are starting to spread it."" They will not stop, either, he said. ""I think if you get easy money and it just keeps coming, why not continue it, right? It's obvious.""

"This video can not be played Rainbow babies offer 'hope and light' A rainbow baby is a baby born to a mother who has previously lost a child due to miscarriage, still birth or neonatal death. It stems from the idea that a rainbow, symbolising hope and comfort, follows the storm of grief caused by a baby loss. BBC News spoke to some of the mothers who use the rainbow symbol to celebrate their children and remember the babies they lost. Cheryl Lotherington, 38, had four miscarriages before her daughter Bo (named for being a rainbow baby) was born. She and her then partner, now husband, Grant started trying for a baby after being together for two years. She fell pregnant after six months. ""Everything seemed great,"" she says. ""We had an early scan and saw the baby and heard the heartbeat. ""At 10 weeks I unexpectedly started bleeding. A scan confirmed that there was no heartbeat. ""The next night I miscarried at home. The pain was horrendous both physically and emotionally."" The couple, who live near Leeds, had experienced an earlierchemical pregnancy,externalbut after the first miscarriage they suffered two more losses at around 11 weeks before being referred for tests which came back clear. ""Western medicine couldn't give us any answers and my arms ached [from the injections],"" she says. They decided to get married, booked their wedding and agreed to start trying to conceive again thinking it would take about six months, but she fell pregnant straight away. ""We were scanned every week. It was a really worrying time right until she was placed in my arms."" She says her daughter, who is now four, loves colourful clothing especially anything with a rainbow on it. ""Bo tells everyone that she is a rainbow baby. If a rainbow appears she thinks it's for her. I think about the babies we have lost and how lucky we are now."" Claire Todd and her husband frequently dress their two sons in rainbow clothing to celebrate them and remember the babies they lost. Ms Todd, 37, from Sheffield, says: ""My husband and I have lost seven babies in all, one for each colour of the rainbow, and have two beautiful sons. ""I love to dress them in bright colours/rainbows where possible as to me rainbows symbolise that no matter how bad things get, there is always something to hope for."" She said while they do not choose rainbow outfits all the time when they do wear bright colours they ""make me smile and burst with happiness"".

The 25-year-old, from March, in Cambridgeshire, has a rainbow tattoo in tribute to her son. ""Even when he's big and [has] got babies of his own, I'll have this to remember the good that can come from the pain of loss."" Orion was dressed in rainbow colours for his going home from hospital outfit (left) Tasha Adams, from Brentford, in London, had 16 miscarriages and two stillbirths before she had her rainbow baby. She says: ""My first loss was Honey, she was stillborn in May 2007 at 36+6 [weeks], I then had seven miscarriages between June 2008 and September 2010. ""Riley Rae was stillborn at 24+3 in April 2011 and then I went on to have nine more miscarriages between June 2011 and Feb 2014."" After seven years of trying she gave birth to her son Orion Rudi Beau in June 2015. She says: ""He has the middle name Beau, because he's our Rainbow."" 'She is and always will be such an important part of our family' Frankie Brunker, from Hertfordshire, lost her daughter Esme when her heart stopped beating at just over 38 weeks in September 2013. The 33-year-old then went on to conceive again. She says: ""I was overjoyed and terrified in equal measure to get pregnant soon after our devastating loss. ""The pregnancy was problem-free like Esme's had been, but I couldn't help be filled with anxiety."" She was supported through her pregnancy by rainbow baby charity JOEL the Complete Package. Emma Pearson, 35, from Worksop, founded the charity along with her husband Matthew after they lost their twins Noel and James in 2011. The charity runs aFacebook group,externaland sends support packs out with advice sections for mums, dads, grandparents and siblings. Ms Pearson says they focus on providing support for both mums and dads. She says: ""I think a lot of people ignore the fact that dads have to be that strong figure that's got to hold everything together when they've just been through something absolutely devastating. ""They're grieving exactly the same as a mum would but also they have seen their wife or partner going through labour and seeing everything that's happened is something that's really upsetting so it's important that people support them too."" Ms Brunker said the support she received helped her ""stay hopeful and sane"" until her son Jago was born healthy in October 2014. She says: ""We chose Jago's name partly because it means 'to follow in the footsteps of' (it's from the Hebrew name Jacob), and his middle name as Toby (the name we had picked out for Esme had she been a boy), both in tribute to his big sister. ""We don't want him to live in the shadow of Esme, but she is and always will be such an important part of our family."" 'She continues to help heal our hearts every single day' Clockwise from top left: Suzanne Lowe's brother Paul, Suzanne with her mum, baby Willow-Paul, baby Ruby Suzanne Lowe says her daughter Ruby helped to heal her family after the loss of both her brother and her first baby. The 33-year-old from Middleton, Manchester, lost her brother Paul in 2010 five weeks after he was diagnosed with leukaemia. Then in 2011 she discovered she was pregnant. She says: ""We were all so very happy as it had been a very hard time. I remember thinking ""the light at the end of our dark tunnel""."" But a scan revealed the devastating news her son hadPotter's Syndrome,externalmeaning he had very little kidney function and a poor chance of survival. Determined to give her son a chance she continued with the pregnancy but was admitted to hospital in March 2012 when she noticed her baby's movements had decreased. She says: ""Willow-Paul Winnard Lowe was born 13:24 at 36+1 weeks. He only managed to take a breath. They worked on him but couldn't save him. Our world just crumbled. ""We got to meet this beautiful 7lb 13oz beauty that we made. He looked so perfect on the outside."" A year later Suzanne received more heartbreaking news when her mum was rushed to hospital and diagnosed with ovarian cancer, something she is still being treated for with chemotherapy. Then in 2014 the family finally had good news when Suzanne took a pregnancy test and the result was positive. She says: ""I thought I'd be as cool as a cucumber and keep it all together when in fact I didn't. ""Our 20 week scan was a big one for us. I didn't want to know the sex like most parents do - I wanted to know that all her organs were working and could be seen. To my relief they were."" In December 2014 her daughter Ruby was born. She says: ""It felt so surreal, finally after such a long time we got to meet our rainbow baby. ""She brought so much colour back into our lives, although things are still tough going at times Ruby had helped in more ways than she will ever know. ""She continues to help heal our hearts every single day. She is so precious and so loved.""

"Ella (pictured, centre) has made two lifelong friends thanks to her late mother's organ donations When her mother died in 2013, Ella decided her organs should be donated in the hope of saving the lives of others. It has led to several successful transplants and two wonderful friendships. Now Ella is hoping to donate to one of the same women as her mother. Ella Murtha had always hoped the recipients of her late mother's organs would contact her, and that it might bring some form of closure. But she never expected to gain such strong friendships. ""I hoped I'd hear something when I agreed to be contacted [by the recipients], but I didn't know,"" she tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Her mother Tish died unexpectedly in 2013 following a ruptured brain aneurysm, aged 56. Despite her not being on the organ donor list, Ella felt that it was right for her organs to be passed on. Tish's heart, kidney, pancreas, liver, eye tissue and lungs were all donated, leading to successful transplants that doctors said saved the lives of four women and the eyesight of four men. Ella's mother Tish died in 2013 Many organ donors never have the opportunity to meet the person, or people, whose lives they have changed for the better. The recipient's identity remains confidential, although a thank-you letter can often be passed on via a transplant co-ordinator. For six months Ella, from Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, heard nothing back. But then two letters arrived on her doorstep in the same week. Teresa Saunders, from Reading, was one of those who decided to write, wanting to express her gratitude for receiving a kidney and pancreas. Three years earlier her diabetes had caused her kidneys to fail when she became pregnant, and she had been placed on a waiting list. Ella with her mother After the operation Teresa waited about five months before writing to Ella, in order ""to fully recover and make sure I was well and the organs were OK"". Jane Holmes, of Hornsea, East Yorkshire, also decided to write. She was in a wheelchair and had struggled to breathe since being diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. ""I wanted Ella to know what her decision had gone on to do - to help save a mum with four children,"" she explains. ""Initially it's like the lungs came off the shelf - it's clinical and you don't attach people to it. ""But when you start getting better you want to thank people for it, and you think you visualise the person."" The pair exchanged letters, but their friendship began to blossom when Jane's daughter Maisie sent Ella a Christmas card. Aged eight at the time, Maisie had thought Ella might be lonely without her mother, and wrote a card that read: ""Thank you for letting your mum save my mum's life."" Maisie sent a letter to Ella, thanking her for helping to save her mother's life On the anniversary of Jane receiving her new lungs, the three women decided to meet, saying it felt like a natural progression. ""It sounds funny but we are like sisters because we have this bond - even like I'd known them for years,"" Teresa said. ""I feel really lucky,"" Ella said. ""It's so hard to explain it because I see them like family, but almost special friends that my mum has introduced me to. ""Teresa and Jane share my mum's organs and that's a special bond as well. For whatever reason, we're meant to be in each other's life."" The women speak almost every day, but the connection between them may yet grow stronger. Teresa's new kidney is deteriorating, meaning she will require a replacement. About 3,000 kidney transplants are carried out each year In up to 90% of cases, a kidney transplant lasts for five or more years. In this instance doctors believe Teresa needs a replacement kidney from a living donor - and Ella hopes to follow in her mother's footsteps by donating her own organ. She has undertaken tests to see if their tissue types are compatible. It may not be possible for Ella to donate, but Teresa says she is ""overwhelmed"" by her kindness and knows she can rely on Ella's emotional support. The three friends are currently fundraising for Jane's daughter Maisie, who has cerebral palsy, to have an operation to help her walk.

"Renan Keraudran says it is easy to talk business while on a run If you are looking to boost your career, perhaps all you need to do is put on a pair of trainers and start jogging. Once considered a rather solitary pursuit, running has in recent years become an increasingly sociable affair. Aided by social media allowing people to connect far more easily, an ever-growing number of running clubs and events are springing up around the world. And as more people travel overseas for business, or move abroad, the sport is becoming a popular way for people to make new contacts around the planet, or even secure a new job. ""With running, a lot of people think it's something that's just about you and yourself, and that's it, but that's not actually the case,"" says Renan Keraudran. The 28-year-old Frenchman works in marketing, and often travels overseas. When he is working abroad he joins up with a local running club, most recently the Canadian group East Laurier, which is based in Montreal. ""We had a run and a beer together, and they introduced me to some more people,"" says Mr Keraudran. ""You start talking about running, and then you start talking about business, and of course with some people you even get a true friendship."" Bridge The Gap is an informal global movement of likeminded runners Mr Keraudran was speaking at a windswept beachfront bar in Barcelona, where more than 100 runners from across Europe were chatting over plates of steaming seafood paella the night before the city's recent 17,000-participant half marathon. The dinner was organised by members of Bridge The Gap (BTG), an informal global movement that brings together urban running groups from around the world through parties and Instagram hashtags. Founded in 2011 by New York club NYC Bridge Runners and London's Run Dem Crew, people who attend BTG events typically work in creative or lifestyle industries, such as music, media, fashion, or sport and fitness. ""It started out as a way to make people that thought running wasn't cool change their perspective, and get some balance in their lives,"" says Cedric Hernandez, co-captain of NYC Bridge Runners. ""We didn't know all this would happen, but we've even had marriages through the movement. ""We've had people putting each other up for free in their apartments all over the world, and on the business side we've had photographers get signed up, people have gotten digital work or video [commissions], or even jobs with corporate brands as ambassadors, where they get paid to travel to different cities."" While global estimates of recreational runners are hard to come by, it is fast becoming one of the most popular forms of exercise in many countries. In Englandalmost seven million people,externalnow run at least twice a month, while the number of Americans participating in running eventsquadrupled between 1990 and 2013.,external A growing number of people are participating in running events Alongside the BTG movement, there are also more formal organisations co-ordinating events around the world, for a wide range of abilities. Parkrun, which launched in a suburban London park in 2004, now hosts free 5km (three mile) runs on Saturday mornings in 15 countries, marshalled by volunteers. Most major sports brands also organise free regular training sessions alongside competitive races. Nike's online running community, Nike+, has almost 17 million Facebook followers worldwide. Samuel Hedberg, a programme director at Swedish training and business support firm Hyper Island, says that running ""rallies people to come together"" in an age when they are otherwise just chatting over social media. ""Running is a community that brings people together for real,"" he says. Bridge the Gap members also hold social events He argues that while traditional business networking events can be elitist, such as business breakfasts or golf afternoons, running is far more down-to-earth and informal, and as a result can better facilitate a more open dialogue between potential new contacts, both at home and abroad. ""There is a sense of vulnerability when you run with someone,"" says Mr Hedberg. ""You are put on equal levels, and you are out doing something together that doesn't have necessarily any status involved in it."" He adds that running also holds a special place in an age when growing numbers of people are going freelance and embracing the""gig economy"", or becoming adigital nomadwho works around the world. ""So I think that the trend is really supporting making new business connections over running, you just need a pair of shoes."" Stockholm-based Australian fitness entrepreneur Dan Paech is among those seeking to benefit financially from the large numbers of people looking to jog with likeminded people when they are working abroad. Dan Paech is establishing running clubs in cities around the world His business, Run With Me Stockholm, organises paid running tours for people visiting the Swedish capital. ""These days people want to do the activities they do at home when they are away,"" says Mr Paech, who adds that a large proportion of his customers are business travellers on tight schedules. With a franchise now open in Singapore, and one on the way in Melbourne, Mr Paech hopes to create a global network. Back at the pre-half marathon dinner in Barcelona, a Hamburg-based event planner is explaining how running friends are helping her to find new clients in Amsterdam, while a British man mulling a relocation to Berlin is working the room for useful contacts. However, Renan Keraudran says there is much more to being a part of BTG or other running movements than just networking and keeping fit. ""People might think we're just a bunch of people showing off on social media,"" he says. ""But we are a family.""

"Priest Gary Bradley and Zubeir Hassam share a cup of tea before buying each other kneepads in the Amazon Prime ad A man who played an imam in a popular Christmas advert has been asked to work with the government to promote harmony between Islam and other faiths. In the Amazon commercial, Zubeir Hassam and priest Gary Bradley buy each other kneepads to help with the discomfort of kneeling while praying. Mr Hassam said it had turned him into a celebrity, with people stopping him in the street for selfies. He is even set to meet the Queen when she visits Leicester in April. Since the ad was released in the UK in November to promote the Amazon Prime delivery service, it has been viewed millions of times around the world. More on this story and other news in Leicestershire Mr Hassam addressing a Human Relief Foundation conference in Manchester Mr Hassam, principal of the Muslim School, in Oadby, Leicestershire, said he was pleased with its positive message, which promotes friendship between Muslims and Christians. ""The message that went to the world and the community at large was of peace,"" he said. But he said he never thought it would become so popular and he now gets stopped for selfies, including one occasion at an airport in Turkey, where he was recognised by a family travelling to Mecca. ""It was so amazing to see them all, the sisters and brothers in ihram [where men wear all white for the pilgrimage] and yet they wanted a picture with me,"" he said. He was given a taste of celebrity life when he was invited to a world peace conference in Abu Dhabi and put up in a five-star hotel. ""I'm not royalty but I feel I've reached that level,"" he joked. But there is a serious side to the attention the advert has garnered and the government has asked him to work with them on promoting harmony between faiths, he said. Although he has met the Queen three times before the advert aired, he has been invited to dine with her when she visits Leicester on Maundy Thursday. ""I'm sure she'll [ask] me are you the Amazon imam? And I'll say, 'yes I am',"" he said.

The back injury he sustained paralysed him from the waist down and impaired the use of his hands. ""When I came out of hospital I wanted to get back into what I was doing before, such as taking up new sports,"" he says. ""But I was struggling to grip items in the gym with my poor hand function so I developed something to enable me to do that on my own."" Smith tried many prototypes until he developed Active Hands, a grip-aid which goes over the hand and straps around the item that needs to be picked up. Using a system of straps the Active Hand can help someone to grip an item ""A lot of the guys I was playing wheelchair rugby with at the time saw what I'd made and said 'that's really good can you make one for me?' So we started making a few more and that's how it developed."" So popular was the gadget that more than 100 Paralympians used it during the 2016 Games and about half of stock is sold overseas. This year's turnover is expected to be Â£250,000. Smith says: ""It really does empower disabled people and helps them to become more active and to get more access to activities that would otherwise just be impossible because of their weak hand function.

He says he found his ataxic cerebral palsy - which affects hand-to-eye co-ordination - stressful in the pressurised environment. ""I started off as a banqueting chef in the Hilton, doing maybe 200 covers a night. ""The way my ataxic cerebral palsy affected me was that it was actually slowing me down. ""I couldn't chop things quick enough. I couldn't do the manual work quick enough which was then creating pressure upon myself."" Anthony left his job and opened the business which he describes as ""not your usual bakery"" focusing only on rustic, handmade, breads and steering clear of the ""really pretty breads"". All of the bread made in the Loaf and Ladder Secret Bakery is handmade ""They're rustic and they're more in tune with the way my brain will allow my hands to work,"" he says. After spending some time unemployed Anthony said making the leap from benefits to business-owner was difficult. ""Once I hit a threshold of Â£73 a week they start drastically reducing the housing benefit which effectively means I'm not taking a salary and I'm having to rely on my tax credits to basically feed me and keep the house warm."" He says the financial reality of running his artisan bakery comes with some tough decisions in the future which he hopes he doesn't have to make.

"Product designer Sophie Morgan (right) is trying to make a change on the High Street New research shows that access to the High Street for disabled people remains ""slow"", according to a new survey by DisabledGo. The most recent investigation from the not-for-profit disability organisation reveals almost a quarter of all fashion retailers have no step-free access, with only 10% offering hearing loops to help deaf shoppers. When compared to a wider survey carried out in 2014, the results show a similar or in places poorer performance than before. It's been two years since DisabledGo shocked the government with evidence that highlighted the inaccessibility of the British High Street for disabled people. In 2014, the accessibility information providers visited over 25,000 shops and restaurants in person. It was one of the largest assessments of its kind in the UK. But fast-forward to 2017 and their most recent snapshot of 1,295 fashion retailers shows that not much has changed. The BBC's business and economics unit is looking at how businesses work with people with disabilities and how disabled people have made business work for them A range of stories will feature across online, TV and radio from 20-24 February 2017 On Twitter and Facebook you can follow the hashtag #DisabilityWorks and at the end of the week you can download theOuch podcast Disability Works: Breaking down barriers in business More Disability stories Speaking about the findings, Anna Nelson, executive director of DisabledGo.com, says: ""progress has been slow"". ""We were hoping the survey would show improvement over the past two years, but sadly this is not the case."" This week I'm looking into disability and the fashion industry, as part of the BBC's Disability Works week and have been given these exclusive figures. Of the 1,295 fashion retailers DisabledGo visited, over 60% didn't provide staff with any disability awareness training - a slight improvement on the 2014 audit. However, fewer retailers were able to provide a hearing loop, and the situation for wheelchair users was also slightly worse. Of the 1,295 fashion retailers DisabledGo visited: 23% did not have access for wheelchair users 96% were able to provide somewhere to sit and rest Only 10% had a hearing loop available for shoppers with hearing aids Only 38% gave staff disability awareness training The latest figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show the collective spending power of disabled people, often referred to as the ""purple pound"", has risen to Â£249bn. ""You would think that this together with the legal obligations for every retailer to make reasonable adjustments would have been a catalyst for change,"" says DisabledGo.com's Anna Nelson. ""To us, providing great service to disabled people should just be about providing great customer service."" This video can not be played The power of the ""purple pound"" explained The Equality Act 2010 is meant to ensure disabled people have equal access in all areas of life. This may mean changing the way in which services are delivered, providing extra equipment and/or removing physical barriers. But when it comes to fashion, the barriers facing disabled people don't just stop at physical access. According to the disability charity Scope, the representation of disability on the High Street is ""simply not up to scratch"". Yet there are signs that the government is now recognising this issue. In a statement to the BBC, Penny Mordaunt, the Minister of State for Disabled People, said: ""Our shop windows, magazine pages and catwalks should reflect the diversity of our society, and I want to see businesses making a real effort to be open to everyone. ""That's why this week I've announcednew champions to address the issues faced by disabled consumers, from buying clothes to travelling abroad. They'll highlight the importance of being inclusive, whilst tapping into the Â£249bn spending power of disabled consumers."" This video can not be played Wheelchair user creates mannequin to target disabled consumers One woman on a mission to change things is Channel 4 presenter and product designer Sophie Morgan. In 2010 she designed and developed the ""mannequal"", a wheelchair for a sitting mannequin. Having modelled in the past, Sophie is passionate about fashion being ""for every body"". Around 2012 she managed to get her mannequal in the shop front of a large High Street store. Her product was used as part of a campaign during the London Paralympics. But as soon as the Games came to an end, so did the campaign and Sophie's mannequal. Disillusioned by the endless obstacles, Sophie put her mannequal to bed. But now, she feels it's the right time to try again. Mannequal developer Sophie Morgan says the High Street is being slow to embrace equality I met Sophie in London to see her product, fresh off the production line. It's the first time she's seen it in a shop front in nearly five years. ""Fashion designers are opening up to the creative opportunity of diversity. But while the public and the press recognise and celebrate equality on the catwalk, this has yet to filter down to the High Street. ""The product itself is just a small thing. We've got to make a push so that retailers actually go, 'yeah, OK, we'll listen,'"" says Sophie. ""This chair is just one small thing in the bigger picture, but I feel that's why I did it, it was like taking baby steps and see what happens. And this is that step."" Responding to the findings of the latest survey, the British Retail Consortium said retailers were working hard to ensure stores were as accessible as possible. ""For example, many have wide aisles, offer ramps as alternatives to stairs and have members of staff on hand to provide any additional assistance if required. ""Unfortunately retailers can be restricted on what reasonable adjustments can be made due to the age or design of a building but will have other policies in place to help access to that service."" Away from the High Street, British design duo Teatum Jones have taken a giant step forward at this year's London Fashion Week. The casting of Kelly Knox, who was born without the lower half of her left arm, and amputee Jack Eyers is a first for London Fashion Week. Kelly Knox on the catwalk, modelling Teatum Jones during London Fashion Week But this is not a stunt, nor is it a campaign. Catherine Teatum and Rob Jones are thinking about disabled people when they design - something they don't feel is particularly revolutionary. ""They [disabled people] have a spending power that no one seems to be interested in tapping into. So that's a big enough reason to be honest, to begin with,"" they say. ""We haven't adapted anything for this collection, we approached the styling and the casting of this collection as we would any other collection. The main key message for us, is I feel like we are all the same. ""Why should someone with perhaps a seated disabilityâ¦ have any less desire for luxury fashion?""

"Christine Lewis took medical retirement at 48 but felt she had more to give Some 600,000 people with arthritis are missing out on the opportunity to work, according to the charity Arthritis Research UK. BBC presenter Julian Worricker, who has psoriatic arthritis, spoke to people trying to juggle staying in work with a painful and debilitating condition. Britain is a nation of ""put up and shut up"" when it comes to workplace health. That's according to leading charity Arthritis Research UK. This isn't just based on anecdotal evidence - before Christmas the charity questioned more than 2,000 people about their attitudes and experience regarding health and the workplace. One theme arose time and time again - people's willingness to suffer in silence. The survey's key findings were: 20% worried they wouldn't be fit enough to work the following year 39% didn't feel confident discussing their health with their employer 33% thought that colleagues wouldn't understand the impact of their arthritis Nearly a fifth, 17%, have lied about why they took sick leave I have arthritis. Not rheumatoid, but another inflammatory form of the disease - psoriatic arthritis. It's linked to the common skin complaint, psoriasis. I'm lucky in that I've rarely had serious flare-ups. I'm now taking a drug that dramatically improves my symptoms, and at work I can think of only a handful of occasions when I've been hampered, discomforted or forced to make adjustments for any nagging pain I may have been experiencing. But for thousands of other people in the UK it's a very different story. Osteoarthritis - which makes movement more difficult - is the most common form of arthritis Arthritis is a condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint. It affects around 10 million people in the UK The most common types of arthritis are rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, although there are around 200 different musculoskeletal conditions Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, most commonly developing in adults in their 40s or older. It initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint, making movement more difficult than usual leading to pain and stiffness Rheumatoid arthritis can affect people of any age (although often starts when a person is between 40 and 50) and occurs when the body's immune system targets affected joints, leading to pain and swelling Source: Arthritis Research UK Sarah Dillingham is a case in point. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in her 20s when she was working in a high-pressure corporate environment. Some people at work didn't understand the severity of Sarah's health issues, she says During bad flare-ups she had to cope with extreme fatigue and intense pain. Everyday tasks, even holding a pen, were difficult. Commuting, or as Sarah put it ""being bashed about on the tube"", really took it out of her. Over 10 years she struggled to control her symptoms. ""My world became all about my job because in order to go in and deliver I could only do that if I got up early to deal with the pain. I didn't have any social life. Your world does shrink in quite an unhealthy way,"" she says. She experienced the best and the worst from the people she worked alongside. She tells me: ""A fantastic colleague used to help by writing on the white board for me during presentations when I couldn't lift my arms up."" But one boss made it very clear that Sarah's health issues were not something to be considered important, forcing her to try and act as if there was no problem at all. ""Being bashed about on the tube"" on her daily commute was one of the things that made working difficult, says Sarah Dillingham Christine Lewis's story taps into some of the same narrative. She was a nurse when she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, but daily work tasks became too much for her and she switched her career to banking. Initially her new employers were very receptive to her needs, but as time went on they became less supportive. ""They employed someone to come and assess me. She assessed my working environment and made various recommendations."" They suggested minor changes to her desk and workstation, Christine told me. ""They said that things don't happen very quickly in business. A year later, still nothing,"" she says. Sarah's and Christine's stories diverge at this point. Sarah is now her own boss, works mainly from home, and can manage her travel so that it rarely coincides with the London rush hour. Christine Lewis, pictured here with Julian, says employers are missing out on a ""wealth of experience."" She now volunteers for the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society As an employer, partly as a result of what she went through as an employee, she's a believer in what she calls ""sensible flexibility"". She says: ""I absolutely understand the importance of hiring people who will give 100%. ""At the same time pretty much everyone has something in their life, whether that's a long-term medical condition, or young children or having to care for someone. ""It can be as simple as being able to hold meetings over Skype, or an ergonomic mouse which is very cheap."" Christine, by contrast, took medical retirement at the age of 48. She feels she still had a number of good working years ahead of her but, without the necessary adjustments being made in the office to help her manage, she felt she had no choice but to give up her job. ""Employers are missing out on the wealth of experience that people have,"" she says. ""Being that bit older, I've got a house. I've had children, I've been a housewife and all that actually is quite a lot of experience that employers should tap into."" The Department for Work and Pensions told us that funding is available through the government's Access to Work scheme to pay for equipment or support that a disabled person might need in the workplace. Stories like those of Sarah and Christine might well influence the government's thinking in the coming months. The BBC's business and economics unit is looking at how businesses work with people with disabilities and how disabled people have made business work for them A range of stories will feature across online, TV and radio this week On Twitter and Facebook you can follow the hashtag#DisabilityWorks,externaland at the end of the week you can download theOuch podcast Disability Works: Breaking down barriers in business More Disability stories It says it wants to halve what's known as the disability gap - that's the difference between employment rates of disabled and non-disabled people - and it's been consulting on how best to do that. The Labour MP, Frank Field, chairs the parliamentary work and pensions committee. A lot of evidence about work and disability has come before him in recent months. ""Nobody doubts the will of the government wishing to do this. What's worrying is whether they've really thought about how hard this objective is to achieve,"" he says. One suggestion is to encourage employers using incentives. ""One should have, in this coming Budget, a reduction in national insurance contributions to those employers who say I'm taking [disabled] people onto my payroll,"" he says. During our conversation Mr Field highlighted one statistic that put into perspective what the government wants to do: according to the Learning and Work Institute, halving that disability gap will take - at current rates - 200 years. According to the Equality Act 2010 (which doesn't apply in Northern Ireland) you are disabled if your arthritis has, or is expected to have, a serious negative affect on your daily activities for at least 12 months Your rights are also covered under the Equality Act. You must be treated fairly and without discrimination if your employer knows, or could be expected to know, you're disabled An employer must make reasonable adjustments to enable you to work if you are disabled. This could include providing equipment or support or altering working arrangements An employer must not ask questions about health or disability unless they need to know you can carry out a vital function of the job with reasonable adjustments in place. But you have a duty to tell an employer about a health condition if it might present a health and safety risk to yourself or other colleagues Source: Arthritis Care Julian Worricker presents a mini-series about arthritis on You & Yours, from Wednesday 22 February to Friday 24 February at 12.15GMT on BBC Radio 4.

"Rich Donovan worked as a trader for 10 years on Wall Street It's a fast-paced, risk-taking industry glamorised by Hollywood and writers alike, but when one Wall Street trader left the floor he identified a huge market being ignored by the business world. Canada-based businessman Rich Donovan worked as a trader for Merrill Lynch for 10 years after he graduated from the prestigious Columbia Business School. It was competitive enough, but with cerebral palsy he felt he had more to prove. ""I was told to my face that I would never be a trader. They were wrong, but that's just the reality of having a disability. You figure out how to work around it."" He says he was asked at every job interview, ""Can you physically do this job?"" His answer was always the same: ""I don't know, but we're going to find out."" Donovan was offered every job he went for and says there was ""never a time that I hit a barrier, largely because I was 10 steps ahead of what I needed to be"". It is this attitude that has led him to identify a market worth $8 trillion (Â£6.4tn) and brimming with untapped talent: the disability market. After he left the trading floor, Donovan set up theReturn on Disability Group,external(ROD). The firm helps companies improve their products, customer experience and recruitment for disabled clients, as well as alerting investors to companies that target that market. Its slogan is ""translate different into value"". The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange He estimates the market comprises about 1.3 billion people with disabilities worldwide, plus an additional 2.42 billion people once their friends and family are taken into account, which Donovan describes as ""huge"". It seems hard to believe that such a market could be overlooked, but he says it has largely gone unseen because people look at it from the wrong angle. The key, he says, is not to consider disability a niche market, but as an ""emerging market"" - and to challenge the conventional because ""companies and governments have no clue how to convert that size into value"". Donovan says traditional government schemes to get more disabled people into work or bespoke products made for disabled people fail to properly utilise the market. For that, you need to think beyond lunches and motivational talks and remember business is always about money. ""Most companies think they need to be perfectly ready to provide an 'accessible' space for disabled workers. The reality is disabled people know what they need to be successful. Companies only need to listen and adjust to those needs,"" he says. Rich Donovan with his team from Return on Disability ""Quotas and equity laws do not cause hiring, it's the promise of future profits that does. Companies, by their very nature, act in their shareholders' best interests, doing what will grow revenue in the fastest way possible."" Therefore, Donovan says, companies should ""attack the market"" as they would any other. ""Find out the desires of disabled consumers as they relate to your profitable enterprise, adjust your product and messaging to attract their business then execute this in line with your company's process and culture."" Donovan believes mistakes are often made when companies try to ""disable"" their business or do just enough to comply with regulations. Rich Donovan spoke to BBC Business Daily about the disability market from a studio in Toronto Listen to Business Dailyon the BBC World Service to hear about the daily drama of money and work from the BBC with a special programme for the Disability Works season. ""Disabled people don't want 'special' products,"" he says. ""But they are hungry to be included in the mainstream consumer experience. ""Most companies today look at this as a government regulatory mandate; they're not looking at this as a profitability opportunity, they're not looking at this as an innovation opportunity to improve products for users. ""They're looking at this as a charity effort,"" he says. Donovan believes the key to cracking this market is to flip the disabled consumer experience to ultimately benefit the mainstream audience. ""We've learnt that people with disabilities use things very harshly, they use them in extreme ways, and if you can learn how they use things and use that information it makes that core product better for everyone. That way the returns really take off."" The former trader says there is one company that already does this: Google. Google has developed a self-driving car which turned conventional ideas on their head ""The core of what they do is innovation and in most of their products there is some disability component. It's at the very core of what they do. ""Look at the Google [self-driving] car - you can imagine the head engineer walking into his team and saying 'OK, build me a car that a blind guy can drive' and that's exactly what they did. ""They're very focused on leveraging disability to make the core product experience better for everyone."" Donovan says the disability market has only really existed within the past decade continues to develop. ""They're still grappling with what that looks like and that process historically takes a few years,"" he says. ""You look back at women and race and it takes a little bit of time to adjust to that reality and disability has just started to do that."" But it is not just the disability market that Donovan's company has been tasked with growing. His clients have also asked him to apply the same ideas to sexuality and poverty. Donovan's ambition is to move away from government regulations and to help companies serve non-traditional markets with the aim of ultimately increasing profitability - a process he describes as ""figuring out how to 'eat that elephant'"".

"Heathrow expansion can only be justified if the government proves it will not breach laws on climate change and pollution, MPs say. Ministers say a third runway will not exceed environment limits. However, the Commons Environmental Audit Committee has accused the government of ""magical thinking"" - wishing the problem away without a proper solution. They say ministers must show the expansion will not fuel climate change. Committee chair Mary Creagh told BBC News: ""There's plenty of talk about how the government wants to solve environmental problems at Heathrow, but a total absence of any policy guarantees. ""The implication of this is that they think other sectors of the economy like energy and industry are going to have to cut their carbon emissions even more so people can fly more - but the government's been told by its own advisors (the Committee on Climate Change) that's not possible."" Heathrow expansion: Why is it taking so long? How the cost of delays stacks up Heathrow's death sentence for villages The MPs also criticised the government's reliance on a projected increase in electric vehicles on the roads to keep local air pollution within safe limits. ""The government has missed already its targets for electric vehicles,"" Ms Creagh said. ""Our committee has no confidence it will meet its target for 2020 or 2030. Ministers have got to put proper policies in place instead of relying on magical thinking."" What are your solutions for air pollution? The committee previously urged a step change in the way the government tackles environmental issues at Heathrow, but says there is little evidence this has happened. The UK has already breached EU limits in London for the pollutant NO2 for 2017. The committee says a new air quality strategy is urgently needed to ensure that airport expansion does not harm public health. The government has said after Brexit that EU environmental laws will be imported wholesale into the UK, but the MPs say they have seen no guarantees that the government will keep pace with future EU air quality laws. The report calls on the ministers to implement an alert system for nearby residents who are especially vulnerable to short-term exposure to air pollution. On climate change, the MPs complain that international aviation emissions from an expanded Heathrow will be 15% higher than the level previously set for 2028-32. They say the government must show how the slack will be taken up by other sectors of the economy, which are already struggling to meet their own emissions targets. They say measures on noise lack ambition, with no precision on the timing of a night flight ban and little evidence that predictable respite can be achieved. The report was welcomed by John Stewart, the chair of HACAN, the campaign group that opposes Heathrow expansion. ""The government and Heathrow Airport have got to up their game big-time if they are to have any chance of getting a third runway,"" he said. ""They have got to prove they can deliver on noise, climate and air pollution - not just say they can."" The report comes just weeks after the government launched a public consultation on a third runway, which ends on 25 May. Later this year or early next year MPs are expected to be asked to vote on the runway. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""We take our air quality commitments extremely seriously and have been very clear that the new runway will not get the go-ahead unless air quality requirements can be met."" The spokesman said the government has no plans to ""water down"" its ambitions on cutting aviation emissions and remains committed to meeting emission reductions targets under the Climate Change Act.

"Protesters have called for Mexicans to stand in ""unity"" against Mr Trump's immigration policies Three separate political events in as many days last week laid bare the differences over the US-Mexico relationship, as the new US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, arrives for his first visit to the country. The first was theDay Without Immigrants. Held in towns and cities across the United States, it was a timely reminder of the importance of the immigrant community to the US economy. From Washington DC to Detroit, from LA to New York, restaurants, coffee shops and convenience stores closed their doors as part of a nationwide immigrant-rights solidarity movement. Restaurants were closed in several major cities across the US It is estimated that about seven million immigrants work in the restaurant industry alone, not to mention sectors such as construction, healthcare, food production and manufacturing. The participants wanted to send a clear message to the Trump administration about its hard-line stance on deportations and the border wall. The next significant political event was the following dayin an aircraft hangar in Melbourne, Florida. A rally by President Trump saw him, in effect, back on the campaign stump, making a speech that sounded as though the election was just days away, not recently won. President Trump used his speech in Melbourne to reiterate his plans to deport large numbers of ""bad hombres"" In the media storm that followedthe president's confusing reference to Sweden, his comments on Mexico were largely lost. Again he mentioned the ""bad hombres"" from the southern side of the border, on this occasion explicitly calling them ""gang members, bad, bad people"". His administration, he assured his supporters, would soon be deporting large numbers of undocumented immigrants with criminal records. ""I said [from] day one, they're going out. Or they're being put in prison, but for the most part, get them the hell out of here. Bring them back to where they came from,"" he said, to huge applause. This week, that promise has been backed up by tough new guidelines on deportations. Civil rights groups such as the ACLU fear the move will target immigrants who have spent years living and working in the shadows in the US, and now face being deported over parking violations or minor infractions. However, the Trump administration says the step will strengthen existing rules and ""take the shackles off"" the relevant law enforcement agencies. The final event was in Mexico itself. On Sunday,tens of thousands took to the streets of the capital, Mexico City,as part of what the organisers called Vibra Mexico. Demonstrators unite in a call for Mr Trump to respect the Mexican people The placards being held up made it clear against whom the ire in Mexico was directed. ""Stop Trump!"" read a huge banner in English, although ""Fuera Pena!"" - meaning ""Pena Out"" - was equally prominent. The Mexican President, Enrique Pena Nieto is facing the lowest approval ratings of any Mexican leader since the 1994 peso crash, which left the Mexican economy on its knees. His handling of Donald Trump, combined with a controversial fuel price hike known as the ""gasolinazo"", has infuriated ordinary Mexicans, and for many the end of his controversial presidential term can't come around soon enough. Besides the anger at the two presidents, the other noticeable feature of Vibra Mexico was the call for national unity in the face of what people here perceive as unfettered aggression by the Trump administration. ""Something amazing that Trump has accomplished, is a sort of 'rally-around-the-flag' phenomenon in Mexico,"" says Dr Eric Magar, political scientist at the ITAM institute in Mexico City. Even Mr Pena Nieto experienced a short-lived bump in popularity when he chosenot to travel to Washington DC for a bilateral meeting at the White House. ""Pena Nieto, even if he's a very weak leader and indecisive, has been receiving the applause of the Mexican elite,"" says Dr Magar. Protestors have criticised the president's handling of the fuel price crisis Not, though, that of most of the Mexican electorate, who are furious at the clumsy way the government has dealt with the economic crisis. For example, the Finance Ministry announced last week that the cost of a litre of petrol would go down at the pumps. Amid the pain of the ""gasolinazo"", it sounded like welcome news for consumers. However it didn't take long to realise this wasn't the bold economic gesture many had been calling for. It was two cents cheaper. That's not two US cents, but two cents of a Mexican peso - a price reduction so infinitesimally small that many considered it a mockery. As one political commentator put it: ""If it weren't so humiliating, we'd be laughing"". It immediately prompted a new hashtag to appear on social media in Mexico: #GobiernoDeA2Centavos, meaning ""Two Cent Government"". Currently, that is about as much as many voters think Mr Pena Nieto's administration is worth. Add to this economic malaise President Trump's protectionist policies, the detested border wall and his insistence that Mexico will pay for it, plus the insulting tone and very public nature of the debate being conducted via Twitter, and the new US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, arrives in Mexico City amid some hostility. Accompanied by the head of the Department of Homeland Security, John Kelly, the two men have an unenviable task: building bridges where their boss has been building a wall. This video can not be played How will President Trump deliver on border wall promise? ""The wall is the symbolic part,"" says Dr Magar, ""but the important part is the trade war that is looming. That will hurt us more."" ""A huge part of our prosperity is based on trading with the US. Any plan to cut ties with Mexico would hurt us very much. So pain is on its way."" It is against that background that the Mexican flags turned out in force for Vibra Mexico and the handmade signs urging ""unidad y dignidad"" - unity and dignity - among Mexicans. For Jesus Silva-Herzog Marquez, renowned Mexican essayist and political commentator, the calls for unity are misguided. Writing in the national newspaper, Reforma, he called instead for ""visible and noisy disunity"". ""Diversity doesn't make us vulnerable,"" he wrote. ""We are not facing a military invasion. The challenges we face are very different and can't be faced if we choose to postpone our disagreements."" The new US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, has no previous diplomatic experience Many analysts see those challenges in two key areas: migration and trade. ""Both endeavours require the opposite of union: real conflict over the rights and interests,"" said Mr Silva-Herzog, urging public and open debate in Mexico. Either way, as the question of renegotiating the Nafta trade agreement looms, Mr Tillerson's Mexican counterpart, Luis Videgaray, made a plea for unity of his own during a trip to the other Nafta member, Canada. ""The true benefit of Nafta is not economic, it's cultural,"" he said in flawless English at a panel discussion in Toronto. ""Our relationship is fundamentally a true friendship between two societies. We should do more not only to be closer but also to feel closer."" The Trump administration's envoys might also carry a more conciliatory message than their president - but given recent events, they face a tough time delivering it to most Mexicans.

"Rumours are rife about Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari's health - and grip on power As Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari was beginninghis latest visit to London more than a month ago, a new series of Big Brother Nigeria was getting under way. A former military ruler known for his no-nonsense style would appear to have little in common with a reality TV show where contestants engage in attention-seeking behaviour. But both subjects were soon generating headlines for the same reason - neither of them were in Nigeria. It turned out that Big Brother was actually being filmed in South Africa  - a decision that led Nigeria's information minister to launch an investigation. While the howls of protests from outraged Big Brother fans soon died down, the clamour over Nigeria's leader's extended medical stay in London is not going away. President Buhari's absence comes as Africa's most populous nation is gripped by its worst economic crisis in decades, and faces the threat of famine in north-east Nigeria, which has been devastated by the Boko Haram insurgency. And unlike Big Brother, there are no constant updates - in fact, President Buhari, 74, has not given a single interview since arriving in the UK. Instead, the Nigerian public is relying on pictures - posted on Twitter - of their leader meeting senior UK officials as proof that he still is alive. Thelatest statement issued by the government,externalsaid there was ""no cause for worry"" about the president's health but his medical leave was being extended. Nigerians have now heard their leader's voice for the first time since he left for the UK after atelephone conversation with the governor of the northern state of Kanowas played out loud at a prayer meeting. His month-long stay so far has angered some Nigerians afterhe promised to crack down on ""medical tourism"" by officials. Last June, President Buhari spent nearly two weeks in London receiving treatment for an ear infection. But the bigger issue this time is that officials have repeatedly refused to disclose his illness and are not saying when he will return to Nigeria. In a country where rumours are rife, the presidential statements have done little to dampen the speculation about the leader's health. Nigerians are acutely sensitive to leaders travelling abroad for medical reasons afterPresident Umaru Yar'Adua died while in office in 2010,external. For months, the public was kept in the dark while he received treatment in Saudi Arabia. The period of uncertainty created deep political instability in the country. The current president's supporters say that is emphatically not the case this time. They point to the fact that President Buhari constitutionally handed over power to his vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo, as he has done on previous trips, rather than governing from afar. He did take one phone call while in London, however, from the US President Donald Trump - the first between the two leaders. ""There is no vacuum at the top,"" says political analyst Jibrin Ibrahim. ""President Buhari takes his constitutional role seriously, and has not personalised power, unlike other African leaders. ""My chief criticism is that his government has been acting like it has all the time in the world, when in fact urgent decisions needed to be made in regard to the economy."" But, perhaps, one of the most striking things about President Buhari's absence has been the go-getting style of the acting leader. President Buhari has formally handed over his power to vice-president Yemi Osinbajo Yemi Osinbajo is preparing to launch an economic recovery plan. He also led a high-profile delegation to the Niger Delta to voice support for a government agreement with local militants groups that have seriously disrupted the region's oil production. But critics say that despite all his activity, the vice-president has no real authority. ""He cannot perform because ministers and other political appointments are not obliged to be loyal to him as he didn't appoint them,"" said Isuwa Dogo, a political analyst, and a member of the opposition party. ""President Buhari is a public figure and there is no need for him to hide behind his health issues. ""I want him to be back in the county. If there are successes, he will get the credit. If there are failures, he will get the blame."" So, while Big Brother fans will know in April who has been crowned the series winner, for now, no-one seems to know when Nigeria's president will come back home. Where is Nigeria's president?

"Many of today's papers report on the murder of the children's author Helen Bailey, by her partner Ian Stewart. The Times says Stewart drugged Ms Bailey over a period of months,lacing her morning scrambled eggs,externalwith a powerful sedative which left her tired and vulnerable. Helen Bailey chatted to Ian Stewart online before going out on dates and starting a relationship The Guardian reports that Stewart beganstealing money from his victim,externaljust hours after her death, raiding her savings account and attempting to sell one of her properties. While the Daily Express says Stewart made aseries of blunders,externalfollowing the murder, including keeping Ms Bailey's phone and referring to her in the past tense. The Daily Telegraph reports that thegovernment is under pressure,externalto prove that none of the Â£20m paid to British terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay ended up in the hands of the so-called Islamic State group. The calls have been sparked by the case of Jamal al Harith - an IS suicide bomber who received up to Â£1m in compensation after being freed from the prison camp. The Daily Mail has come out fighting after Tony Blair accused the paper of hypocrisy over its coverage of the case. The former prime minister pointed out that The Mail had led a huge media campaign for Harith's release. But calling Mr Blair""increasingly delusional"" and ""mendacious"",external, the paper says that while it had condemned Guantanamo Bay, it had never claimed the detainees weren't ""very bad men"". Britain is wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on afailed green energy project,externalaccording to the Times. It reports the government has given huge subsidies to power stations to burn wood pellets, which it says do more harm to the environment than the coal they replaced. The paper says the scheme was championed by former MP Chris Huhne when he was in the coalition government, adding that he now works for an American company that supplies wood pellets.  Mr Huhne has denied any conflict of interest to the paper. Cressida Dick, the first woman to become the chief constable of the Metropolitan police, makes a number of the front pages. The Guardian quotes a former senior Met officer who says Ms Dick""inspires confidence"",externaland can operate in tough, predominantly male situations as well as working with senior politicians. The Daily Telegraph calls her""the first lady of the Met"",externaland congratulates her on the appointment but says unlike some of her predecessors she ""must chase criminals, not headlines"". If you struggle to eat five portions of fruit or vegetables every day, the Guardian hasbad news for you,external. It says scientists are recommending 10 portions a day.  A team at Imperial College London believes that eating more fruit and vegetables would prevent about 7.8 million premature deaths across the world. And ""from rags to Â£14m lotto riches"" is the Daily Mirror's headline about Britain'snewest lottery winner,external.  Beverley Doran, who gave up work to care for her autistic children, and told the paper that she had dressed in ""rags"" as all her money went on her family. Now she has moved out of her council house in West Yorkshire and is staying in a hotel while she looks for a luxury home. But, the paper adds, Ms Doran won't be celebrating with the usual bottle of champagne, as she is allergic to it.
