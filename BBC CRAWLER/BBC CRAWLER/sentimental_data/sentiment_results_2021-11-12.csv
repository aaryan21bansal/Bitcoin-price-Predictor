"The COP26 conference ended at 18:00 on Friday but negotiators have stayed on to hammer out a deal Alok Sharma is hopeful a climate agreement can be reached at Glasgow's COP26 on Saturday. The summit president said that a revised text would be released by about 08:00 with the aim to finish negotiations by ""Saturday pm"". Negotiators talked through the night on Thursday with anew draft deal produced on Friday morning Mr Sharma called on countries for a ""final injection of that can-do spirit"" to get a deal over the line. The climate talks had been due to end at 18:00. Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday evening that she was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the outcome and that there were signs a deal was ""inching forward"" in the right direction as negotiations moved beyond the deadline.

She told COP26 leaders ""don't fail"" and said she wanted negotiators to be able to ""look the next generation in the eye"" with an agreement that would increase global temperatures by no more than 1.5C and urged them not to leave until a good deal had been achieved. The first minister said there had been ""big concessions"", including from the United States on adaptation funding for developing countries. Climate talks into overtime as nations near deal She told BBC Scotland the final agreement would depend on the political will, determination and leadership that is shown in the hours ahead. On the last scheduled day of the 13-day summit, hundreds of delegates walked out of COP26 to join a protest outside the UN blue zone. Hundreds of delegates walked out of the COP26 venue Activists took to the stage to express frustration at a lack of results. Members of environmental groups and trade unions were among those who sang ""power to the people"" as they left the arena to join hundreds of protesters in the street outside the blue zone. New draft climate deal seeks more urgent action Fear of failure as climate talks enter final day What's been agreed at COP26 so far? The latest draft agreement has watered-down commitments to end the use of coal and other fossil fuels. While the language around fossil fuels has been softened, the inclusion of the commitment in a final deal would be seen as a landmark moment. Protests, however, took place throughout the day with campaigners claiming the summit was falling far short of what is required. Following a ""People's Plenary"" session in one of the main halls organised by the Cop26 Coalition, activists from around the world marched through the venue with a group of indigenous activists leading the procession. They carried banners and red ribbons to represent the red lines crossed by negotiators. Hundreds attended the protest in the streets outside the venue At a rally next to the COP26 venue, campaigners gathered for a street disco which turned sombre as speakers who came from inside the blue zone addressed the crowd. One of the speakers, a 15-year-old from Chad, told how Lake Chad has dried up by 95% since the 1950s. But despite being accredited for the summit the teenager said she has been excluded from key meetings. She added: ""No one is listening. No one is doing anything."" Another speaker alluded to the weather and praised those who have braved the wet conditions. She told the audience: ""I hope you leave drenched in hope."" Extinction Rebellion activist Sarah (left) said she believed that COP had failed Sarah, 29, an Extinction Rebellion activist from Glasgow, was helping to hold up sign outside the UN blue zone which read: ""A Giant COP Up"". She told the BBC: ""We are here today because COP has failed. ""COP has essentially been a giant trade show in which the fossil fuel executives have a bigger presence than delegates from countries most affected by climate change. ""It has shown that leaders, such as our own government, are content to let people suffer and let people die rather than take the action that is required."" Sarah said solutions to the climate crisis lie outside the barricaded SEC and on the streets, where some of the most affected groups had gathered to make their voice heard. Two people were led away after trying to climb the venue fence The atmosphere outside the UN blue zone was good natured, with activists even taking part in a mass Macarena dance. Around midday they were joined by delegates who filed out of the Scottish Event Campus. The rally that followed featured contributions from a diverse range of international speakers and a common theme - politicians are not doing enough to address the climate crisis. The event was on a much smaller scale than the colourful protests which snaked through the city last Friday and Saturday. But shortly after 14:15, as I was taking pictures of the distinctive Extinction Rebellion red dancers, I heard a commotion to my left. I looked round to see a man attempting to scale the barrier. He was immediately grabbed by three police officers and pinned to the ground. Seconds later, a few yards away, another protestor took advantage of the chaos and also tried to climb over the fence. He got his right leg over it before he was also hauled onto the road. Dr Caroline Palmer and husband Malcolm Redford took a train from Lancashire to make their voices heard Dr Caroline Palmer travelled to Glasgow for the day from Colne, Lancashire, with her husband Malcolm Redford. The retired GP, 67, said: ""I have got grandchildren and I feel very worried about what life is going to be like for them. It is our duty to do what we can to hold our government to account. ""They keep making promises but what we need is action. It's getting critical now."" Mr Redford, 68, wants to see an end to the extraction of fossil fuels and more affordable electric cars. The former teacher said: ""We need to make real choices to keep 1.5 alive otherwise we have lost."" Nayara Castiglioni Amaral is among the largest delegation of Brazilian activists to ever attend a COP Nayara Castiglioni Amaral has been in Scotland for the last fortnight as part of a delegation from a Brazilian youth organisation. Carrying a cardboard cut-out of the country's environment minister she expressed concern about the impact of her government's policy on indigenous communities. The 29-year-old said: ""We need more ambitious goals and we need to protect our tribal people as they take care of our environment."" Nayara said one of the highlights of her trip was last Saturday's march which organisers sayattracted 100,000 people. She added: ""It was one of the biggest protests that we have ever seen and it was beautiful. It was really powerful to be there.""

"Britney Spears has described the termination of a legal arrangement that controlled many aspects of her life for 13 years as ""the best day ever"". ""I think I'm gonna cry,"" she told her 35 million Instagram followers. A judge in Los Angeles on Friday ended the conservatorship set up by the 39-year-old singer's father in 2008 with immediate effect. Fans had gathered outside the LA court to support Spears, who had described the guardianship as abusive. Her father Jamie earlier said it was ""necessary"", butagreed it was time for her ""to re-take control of her life"". ""Her life was in shambles and she was in physical, emotional, mental and financial distress,"" lawyers representing Jamie Spears said in earlier court filings. The conservatorship had power over her finances and career decisions plus major personal matters, such as her visits to her teenage sons and whether she can get remarried. The Britney Spears conservatorship case explained Britney Spears: Everything she said in court On Friday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny ruled in favour of the singer's request to end it, which was not opposed by any of the parties involved.

Addressing the crowd outside the court, Spears' lawyer Mathew Rosengart praised the singer's ""courage"" throughout the court hearings. He said he was proud that she had shone ""a light on conservatorships from California to New York"", and that as a result of her testimony, new legislation had been passed ""to try to ensure that conservatorships like this... do not happen again"".

"Scientists say extreme weather events, such as severe flooding, are becoming more frequent because of climate change The president of the COP26 climate summit said the talks had reached a ""moment of truth for our planet"". As the meeting entered its final hours, he urged delegates to agree to a draft agreement aimed at averting dangerous global warming. But he faced late objections from India and others to a clause on cutting fossil fuels, and calls for more financial help for developing nations. It's still not clear what needs to happen for these issues to be resolved. ""You all know that the world is willing us on to be bold - to be ambitious"" said the UK's Alok Sharma, who is chairing the talks. ""So much rests on the decisions we collectively take today,"" he told delegates, urging them to get on board with the draft plan published earlier on Saturday. The key achievements of the draft so far are the inclusion of a commitment to phase-out coal, re-visiting emissions-cutting plans on a more regular basis and increased financial help for developing countries. But India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav told the meeting that ""consensus remains elusive"". EXPLAINER:A really simple guide to climate change CONTEXT:How do we know climate change is caused by humans? In an apparent reference to coal, he said: ""Targeting any particular sector is uncalled for. Every country will arrive at net zero as per its national circumstances."" ""Developing countries have a right to their fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels,"" he added. He also objected to proposals to end ""inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"" - financial benefits provided to producers of oil, gas and coal. China, which is understood to have earlier raised concerns about the wording, said it hoped that ""all parties will show excellent flexibility"" and said it now wanted only small edits to the text. South Africa's negotiator backed objections over the section on fossil fuels saying: ""We don't feel that one size fits all is a good approach."" But Mr Sharma said the text was a ""balanced package"". US climate envoy John Kerry said: ""If it's a good negotiation all the parties are uncomfortable. And this, I think, has been a good negotiation."" Fires and other extreme weather phenomena can become the norm if temperature rises are not capped Lia Nicholson, from Antigua and Barbuda's delegation, and speaking on behalf of small island states, said they were ""extremely disappointed"" by the lack of progress on loss and damage - the principle that richer countries, which bear the main responsibility for the global warming, should pay compensation to poorer ones because of climate impacts. She said: ""We will express our grievances in due course,"" but added: ""We implore all parties to support our common outcome and move forward."" Promises in Glasgow will not be enough to limit global warming to 1.5C. It is a key part of the 2015 Paris agreement that most countries signed up to. Scientists say that limiting temperature rise to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels will protect us from the most dangerous impacts of climate change. Meeting the goal requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by 2050. One example of the impact of global temperature rise above 2C is the death of virtually all tropical coral reefs, scientists say. One estimate by the Climate Action Tracker calculated that the planet is stillset to warm by 2.4C if the current pledges are all met. At COPs, it often all comes down to a huddle. Inside the main Plenary Room, the days of negotiations turn into a face-to-face discussion, like merchants in a souk. Around them, delegates cluster, keen to be there at the moment when key differences between the groups or countries are resolved. This afternoon, US climate envoy John Kerry and chief US negotiator Sue Biniaz stood toe-to-toe with Ahmadou Sebory Toure, the delegate from Guinea, who also represents the G77 group of nations, a large part of the developing world. At stake, how much money the developed world may have to pay to the developing world to compensate for the loss and damage done to developing countries because of climate change. Interest in that ends when Mr Kerry sweeps across the room to talk to the UK President of the COP, Alok Sharma and his chief negotiator, Archie Young. Then, all eyes move to the EU's chief negotiator, Frans Timmermans, as his team work out the repercussions of the G77 huddle. Eventually, the COP chairman decides enough is enough and further discussions must take place elsewhere. The session ends and so do the huddles. For now. But experts say the 1.5C target is still achievable: at COP15 in Copenhagen more than a decade ago, estimates suggested the world was heading for between 3.5 and 4.2C of warming. If the references to phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies remain in the final deal, it would be an historic moment in climate negotiations. Gabriela Bucher, Oxfam's international executive director, said: ""Clearly some world leaders think they aren't living on the same planet as the rest of us. It seems no amount of fires, rising sea levels or droughts will bring them to their senses to stop increasing emissions at the expense of humanity. ""The world's poorest have done the least to cause the climate emergency, yet are the ones left struggling to survive while also footing the bill. Climate finance, or the money promised by richer countries to poorer countries to fight climate change, continues to be one of the most contentious points. In 2009, developed nations pledged to provide $100bn per year to emerging economies by 2020. But this target was not met.

"This has not been a good week for Boris Johnson. The Conservative Party has been battered by allegations that some of its MPs are on the take. The way the prime minister has reacted to the situation has been publicly criticised, and privately slammed by many on his own side. Even some of Boris Johnson's most stalwart backers in parts of the Conservative press have called foul. But if you think this has been bumpy, it's not impossible that the government might find itself in a much more dramatic and risky situation with much further-reaching consequences for us all. What is Article 16 and why does it matter? Triggering Article 16 'would provoke instability' EU warns of consequences if UK triggers Article 16 It sounds harmless enough: Article 16, an obscure set of three paragraphs agreed as part of the Brexit withdrawal deal between the UK and EU. So first off, it's important to understand it is part and parcel of the agreement that both sides grappled to achieve, and then signed up to in October 2019. You might remember that the Brexit arrangements left Northern Ireland, of course part of the UK, essentially in the EU's huge trading bloc for goods. This meant that goods could go backwards and forwards over the land border on the island of Ireland without hassle. That sorted out one aspect of the geographic reality - but it also meant that there would be checks and controls on goods going into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. From the off, that created an inbuilt difference between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Both sides were perfectly aware that these arrangements might be tricky in practice, so the deal included Article 16. The Article gives either side the ability to cry foul and take their own ""safeguard measures"" if it's all going wrong - if trade is going haywire, or the deal is causing real suffering. Either the UK or the EU has the right to take its own action, after giving a month's notice. Boris Johnson celebrates his Brexit trade deal with the cabinet in December 2020 That could mean, for example, the UK stopping checks on goods that are being sent across the Irish Sea, intended only for use in Northern Ireland. In other words, if something's made in Bolton, but sold in Belfast, it wouldn't go through customs checks. But the actions could be more dramatic, suspending more of the deal the two sides agreed, whether that's product standards, customs checks, or VAT rules. Working out how far to go, and what is justified, is a hard first step. As one cabinet minister told me: ""The mechanics aren't controversial, the difficult decision is how far you want to go."" Article 16 could be used to carry out a few tweaks, or to tear through the existing agreements. In turn, that would also have an impact on how the EU reacts. Why though would the UK want to go down that road in any case, whether using it as a big bazooka or just trying to fiddle around with a few elements? Some in the Nationalist community had a message for the PM on a 2019 visit One diplomat told me that triggering Article 16 would be ""lose, lose, lose"", and could cause a ""total breakdown of trust, and a deep freeze in relations"" between the EU and the UK. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major, who it's fair to say is no fan of the current occupant of Downing Street, has said it would be ""absurd"". The main opposition parties would likely condemn the move. But for months, the UK government has been saying the impact of the arrangements and how they are being implemented can't last, even though, as things stand, the part of the deal relating to Northern Ireland - known as the protocol - is certainly not being implemented in full. But its effects have already caused lots of different concerns - whether that would be, as one source describes it, companies being ""buried under mountains of new paperwork"", warnings over shortages of medicines, difficulties moving pets around, or the issue that's taken up most column inches, the so-called ""sausage wars"" over the sale of chilled meats. The UK believes the EU adopted an overly vigorous approach to pursuing the rules, when a lighter touch would do. In turn of course, the EU says the UK signed up to the deal, why are they surprised when Brussels insists its followed in full? Dominic Cummings claims the government always intended to ditch the parts they didn't like As ever in high-tension diplomatic spats like this, the situation is not binary, and both sides have reasons for frustration. Of course, intense politics are at play here too. Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland largely can't stand the protocol, and have deep concerns about being able to keep a lid on tensions. One source warns ""if the government doesn't move and show a bit of teeth, things could implode"". The DUP leader has even said if there isn't movement he could pull his support. With an election due by May 2022, they are pushing for action as soon as possible. There's political mistrust between the UK and the EU side too over Boris Johnson's original attitude to the deal, and whether he ever intended to stick to the legal promises he made. That was stoked by his controversial former adviser, Dominic Cummings, who said publicly the government had always intended to ""ditch"" the bits they didn't like. Another source familiar with the negotiations told me ""Article 16 was the route we thought we would go down from the beginning"", adding: ""it was always clear that unless the EU was willing to back down, we wouldn't be able to stick with it long term"". Now it is not exactly unusual for political deals to leave ambiguities, and some issues unresolved. Given that the European Court did retain a role in supervising the protocol, that source suggests it was never likely to be ""compatible with the autonomy of the UK"". But the admission that Boris Johnson's team believed there was something seriously up with the deal to start with has not exactly put the EU in the mood for compromise. And what Brussels has been willing to budge on so far has not been nearly enough to satisfy No 10. For political and practical reasons therefore, it seems almost inevitable that unless the European Union changes its position in a significant way, and soon, that the UK will trigger Article 16. Lord Frost is still in talks with EU counterpart MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ Talks are continuing, and while one source says, ""it's not definite"", they acknowledge that ""optimism has been waning"". In fact, the UK has said publicly since July that the conditions for the trigger to be pulled have indeed been met. Since then, the UK view is clearly that ""the EU solution is just not good enough"". But on the other side, there's sceptism over the UK's desire even to find a way out. Lord Frost, the PM's Brexit lieutenant, is ""in problem-finding, not problem- solving mode"", one source said. I'm told that diplomats were reassured by government that the action wouldn't be taken this week, after the talks between that will take place between the two sides on Friday. But I'm told there have been discussions about starting the process, even early next week. Don't panic, this does not seem to have yet been resolved. Some in government are arguing for more explanation of the case to the public before drastic action is taken. One insider described a ""reasonableness test"". Another said that the UK government wanted to build an ""evidence base"" to demonstrate why they felt the action had to be taken, before going public. Some of the smart money is on the bust-up not coming until December, with one government source suggesting on Thursday: ""We're going to see a bit more time pass before it happens."" The border at the centre of the dispute Whatever the moment, unless something very unexpected happens, or the negotiators and politicians on both sides have personality transplants, it seems like Article 16 will be introduced before too long. The likely impact of the move seems less certain than whether Boris Johnson and Lord Frost take the decision. It hasn't happened before, so there is no real precedent. And there are different schools of thought. First, it's important to understand that triggering Article 16 is starting a dispute process. It's not one moment, but the start of many. One source says some Brexiteer MPs ""think you trigger it and everyone starts singing Rule Britannia - no one is asking themselves what happens after you trigger"". Theoretically, the process begins with a month of intense technical talks to try to resolve the dispute. If that doesn't work, there would probably then be an emergency meeting of EU leaders, to take the decision up to prime ministers, not just the EU Commission. There could be different forms of restrictions on trade, specific sanctions, or they could give notice that they would tear up the whole trade agreement, which Ireland warned might happen this week. Without getting too technical, the trigger could end up with grumpy talks dragging on over many months with lots of politicking but not much changing practically. Both sides could, in a genuine way, join together to try to work things out. Or the trigger could, as one observer warned, boil over into a ""full scale trade war that undermines the UK and the EU's post-Covid economic recovery"". The economic consequences of that could be profound for us all, if the argument really went that far. And what would Number 10 do in the end, if the UK didn't get what it wanted? If, as another source suggests, Boris Johnson ""triggers the process, it finds against the UKâ¦.and ultimately the European Court says you must comply - he's snookered"". As explained here, the UK may well want to strip the European Court of Justice of its role overseeing the Protocol. Technically, the Article 16 process itself does not come directly under the European Court. But if, as some fear is likely, the argument tips into a wider dispute about the application of EU law then the European Court would end up as the final arbiter. At the risk of hammering the point, the UK could try to reduce the European Court's influence on Northern Ireland by starting a huge legal argument, but actually end up with its influence being confirmed. Mid-November has been pencilled in for several months, as the moment when an actual decision was going to have to be made. That final conclusion has not yet been reached. And given what could be at stake, both sides would still, in theory, like the negotiations to work. But we are approaching a moment where Downing Street may decide that the huge political and economic risks of triggering Article 16 are worth it, that the downsides of the protocol are no longer tolerable, and efforts to find a compromise have run their course. Yet the potential outcomes might make the last stormy seven days look like a moment of deep calm.

"A deal has been reached at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow after nearly two weeks of negotiations Boris Johnson calls it a ""big step forward"" but says there is a huge amount of work still to be done India and China asked for a crucial last minute-change to the agreement, calling for the ""phase-down"" not the ""phase-out"" of coal power Alok Sharma says it was important to get a deal done - but many countries voiced serious disappointment The deal is receiving a mixed reaction - Greenpeace says it keeps the 1.5C goal ""only just alive"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres meanwhile says: ""It's an important step but it's not enough"" The summit's overall goal was to chart a path to keep warming limited to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We are closing our coverage of the climate summit for today. Todayâs editors were
Lauren Turner, Tiffany Wertheimer and Kevin Ponniah. Our writers in London and Glasgow over a very long day were Georgina
Rannard, Matt Murphy, Becky Morton, Paul McLaren, Adam Durbin, Sam
Cabral, Dulcie Lee, Doug Faulkner and Mal Siret. After two long weeks of diplomatic back-and-forth, the Glasgow Climate Pact has been agreed. It has been labelled everything from historic and aggressive to fragile and disappointing. The measures are some of the strongest seen in the past 30 years of climate talks. Rich nations agreed to double the amount of cash they'll offer to vulnerable countries, and for the first time fossil fuels were mentioned in a COP agreement. But even if every government sticks to its promises, the world will still face a temperature rise of about 2C, which would lead to devastating impacts all over the globe. The overall consensus from delegates was that it was better to have an imperfect deal than no deal at all. Before we say goodbye - here are some of the most memorable moments from the past fortnight: Climate activist Greta Thunberg was mobbed as she arrived in Glasgow Day one started off with hundreds of people having to wait in long queues to get into the venue Former US President Barack Obama brought some star power to the summit, and called on young activists to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was pictured maskless and resting his eyes inside the hall And was his US counterpart, President Joe Biden, asleep or just resting his eyes? The Queen and other royals delivered powerful messages to the delegates Boris Johnson had to apologise to Israeli minister Karine Elharrar after she wasn't able to get into the venue in her wheelchair Thousands of climate activists protested in Glasgow - and cities around the world - during the summit China and the US issued a surprise joint statement vowing to boost climate co-operation There was a massive Earth hanging from the ceiling, which Greenpeace flew a ""not for sale"" banner up to on the last day, using helium balloons David ShukmanBBC News Science Editor, reporting from Glasgow Our science editor David Shukman has been reporting on climate change for nearly 20 years. This is his 10th COP summit - and here's his view on what we've seen agreed tonight: These conferences tend, at best, to produce incremental
progress not dramatic breakthroughs. And as US envoy John Kerry told me yesterday, this one was
never going to halt global warming on its own. So the hope is that agreeing to pick up the pace of climate
diplomacy, and packing the diary with more reviews and meetings, will make it
harder for governments to dodge the issue. Another hope is that the shame heaped on the richest nations for
failing to keep their word on climate aid to the poorest - together with new
arrangements - will lead to much-needed cash actually getting delivered. The initiatives by groups of countries on deforestation,
methane and fossil fuels do at least indicate a willingness to head in a new
direction, even if theyâre not verifiable. But is the goal of limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5C really
alive? Yes, if youâre really optimistic that the promises made here
will be kept and that the real world is embracing renewable energy, electric
cars and all the rest rapidly enough. As you can imagine, reaction is continuing to pour in to the Glasgow deal. EU leader Ursula von der Leyen has shared a statement on Twitter praising today's agreement as ""a step in the right direction"". She says that the deal ""sends a clear message time is up for fossil
fuel subsidies and unabated coal"". (That means coal produced without carbon capture technology.) ""If all long-term commitments announced in Glasgow will be
implemented, we should keep global warming under 2C,"" she adds. ""So we need to work further â so that next yearâs climate
conference in Egypt puts us firmly on track for 1.5C."" The difference between a world that warms by 2C instead of 1.5C in terms of climate impacts is significant. At the higher figure, many more people would face extreme heat, all coral reefs would be destroyed and flooding would be even worse. Allow Twitter content?

Asked how he will convince critics that the agreement represent urgent action, the US climate envoy says they should read it first, before saying it's a failure. ""The reality is that whatâs
happened here is significant,"" he says. ""Did I appreciate that we
had to adjust something tonight in an
unusual way? No,"" he adds, talking about the change to a line in the agreement about coal, which was pushed for by China and India. ""But you have to make tough decisions in this business sometimes."" US climate envoy John Kerry says the majority of the 20 largest economies in the world - which are responsible for 80% of emissions - are committed to reaching the 1.5C global warming target. He says Glasgow gives a clear blueprint for ""what we need to do"" from now until 2050. He admits some people ""may have wanted even stronger language"" but says the text that has been agreed to has the first ever mention of coal. Kerry goes on to say that this ""is the beginning of a 10-year sprint"". On the US-China agreement announced earlier in the week - which contained few concrete measures - he says it was announced ""with a view to producing a reduction in emissions"". ""We are the two largest economies in the world and we are going to work together to raise climate ambition in this decade,"" he says. There's been a lot of reporting on how India pushed for the language on coal to be weakened, but China was very strongly pushing for it behind the scenes, our reporters in Glasgow say. Helen BriggsEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow After a day of high emotion, tension and drama, at times,
the mood has lightened here. Thereâs a frenzy of activity as delegates spill out of the
plenary hall and journalists furiously file pieces to camera. Others are packing up their kit, knowing weâre meant to
leave within a few hours of the gavel falling for the last time. This slice of UN territory â for the fortnight the
conference lasted â is quickly being returned to Scottish soil. Staff are
cleaning, packing up boxes, and moving tables and chairs. On the way in this morning, everyone was taking pictures,
wondering if this would be the last day. Itâs hard to believe it is â and
that the Glasgow Climate Pact has finally become a reality. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst in Glasgow This outcome is good and bad. First the good: The measures taken are the strongest seen in 30 years of climate talks. Polluting nations agreed they hadnât done enough tocut emissions, and said theyâd do more over the next year. Rich nations also agreed todouble the amount of cashtheyâll offer for vulnerable countries to adapt to worsening weather. And after years of pressure theyâve accepted there should be a fund to actuallycompensate poor nationshit by extreme events. Fossil fuelswere mentioned too, for the first time at a COP, although India watered down the deal. There was also an innovation from the UK to seek separate agreements between governments, businesses and civil society onmethane, forests and innovation. The UK was also praised for itsdiplomacy. Thatâs the good news. The bad news is that if every government does everything it promises, the world will still face a catastrophic temperature rise of around 2C. This video can not be played COP26: 'Paris built the arena, Glasgow starts the race' - Kerry We're now hearing from US climate envoy John Kerry, hot on the heels of Alok Sharma. He says it was always unlikely that the summit in Glasgow would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"". âParis built build the arena, and Glasgow started the race.
Tonight the starting gun was fired,"" he says, referring to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. ""As a result of what took place here... nations that have
never considered having the word 'coal' in a plan... it's on the books â it's part
of the decision."" He adds that ""you have to phase-down coal before you can end coal"". ""This is the beginning of something,"" he says. When asked about the ""heartbreaking"" stories of poorer and island nations and how they are being affected by climate change, Sharma says he understands their disappointment with parts of the agreement. ""What was important was
to get a deal over the line, and that all the hard work... was not going to
dissipate,"" he says, defending the late compromises. Asked about the tense and seemingly fraught discussions in the summit's final hours, Sharma declines to go into detail about the back and forth that took place between negotiators. But he adds: ""Anyone who has seen footage of the conversations can make up their own minds about how I felt."" I'm sorry we couldn't hold the original language on coal, but nevertheless we do have language on coal and I think that is a start."" Alok Sharma, COP president In response to a question, Alok Sharma, who has led this summit, says he wishes the 11th hour watering down of the agreement on coal had not happened. But he says, ""we do have language on coal, on phase-down"" and that no-one would have thought that line would have been retained at all earlier in the summit. The line calling for the ""phase-down of unabated coal"" and an end to ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies is unprecedented in a COP agreement, experts say, even if it was weakened. Alok Sharma calls the agreement a ""fragile win"" and says that the hard work starts now. ""We have kept 1.5C alive â that was our overarching objective... But I would
still say that the pulse of 1.5C is weak."" He was asked about the moment he became emotional during the formal plenary. ""Iâve had about six hours
sleep in the last three days,"" he says, adding ""it is emotional, collectively
as a team we have achieved what many people doubted."" It's been a long, long day and the COP president is now facing the press. He says he's had six hours sleep in the last few days. Stay with us for updates. Georgina RannardBBC News Sohanur Rahman, 25, is a founding member of Bangladeshâs Friday for Future movement, leading youth activists in the country as they face the dire effects of rising sea levels and flooding. As the Glasgow agreement was gavelled, he told me that youth were recognised for the first time at COP, but âthe end result is nothingâ. He feels helpless and betrayed going back to Bangladesh with this agreement and says the ""empty pledges"" won't protect anyone from the climate crisis. He does not believe it will limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C, despite what politicians say. ""We have no scope to hold them accountable,"" he explains. He welcomes the good news on loss and damage - an acknowledgment from rich countries that poor nations need support paying for impacts of climate change they can't adapt to. But the voices of the most affected people were silenced, he says - âthe interest of the fossil fuel corporations have been clearly pandered to by the UK COP presidency.â This video can not be played COP26 deal changes 'a real blow' - Marshall Islands Tina Stege, climate envoy for Marshall Islands, has sent us her reaction to the deal. Her highly vulnerable Pacific Island country is at risk of being wiped out by climate change. She says last-minute changes to the wording on coal and the weakened language on loss and damage are ""blows"". There was a conversation we were not a part of and it was a real blow.. We had been told that there would be no further changes to the text and we had already swallowed some changes that were difficult to swallow."" Tina Stege But the ""real progress made"" in Glasgow is a ""lifeline"" for her country and it should not be discounted, she argues. Stege is pleased that money on climate finance was secured. And she says it's positive that countries are being called on to submit new targets to reduce emissions next year. Disappointment being expressed with the final pact is ""understandable"" after key issues were ""watered down in the final hours"", Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. However, the SNP politician adds there ""can be no doubt"" the negotiations in Glasgow have led to improvement on some key areas. While there has been much positive progress, there is no escaping the fact that COP26 has not delivered as much as global south countries, activists and campaigners rightly demanded and I firmly believe that the leaders of the rich developed countries must go further."" Nicola Sturgeon UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has posted a short statement on Twitter praising the deal reached by leaders in Glasgow - but says there is more work to be done.  We asked nations to come together for our planet at @COP26, and they have answered that call. I want to thank the leaders, negotiators and campaigners who made this pact happen â and the people of Glasgow who welcomed them with open arms.  I also want particularly to thank COP President Alok Sharma who has worked incredibly hard to bring countries together.  Today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5C.  I hope that we will look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change, and I will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal.""  While he may not be enthused with the deal, Shadow business minister  - and former Labour leader - Ed Miliband has nothing but praise for  Alok Sharma. He says Sharma, a Tory MP and minister of state at the cabinet office, has shown himself to be a ""person of decency, integrity and commitment"". Throughout the afternoon, the COP26 president has been seen flitting between various delegations, discussing the text and working to get the deal across the line. Allow Twitter content?

COP President Alok Sharma is still inside the conference hall, but he is expected to give a news conference when the official proceedings are done. The lectern is ready, flags and all, along with 100 journalists waiting for him outside the hall. India, along with China, pushed for the last-minute change to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal. But why? India - the world's third-largest emitter of fossil fuels - still relies heavily on coal, which makes up 70% of the country's energy production. A big part of their position can be summed up by comments from India's environment and climate minister Bhupender Yadav earlier. He asked how anyone could expect developing countries to make promises on phasing out coal when they have still to deal with their development agendas and eradicating poverty. On top of that, four million people are employed in India's coal industry - and in the last decade the country's coal consumption has nearly doubled. It  continues to import large quantities of coal and is planning to open dozens of new mines in the coming years despite pledges to invest massively in renewable energy. An average Indian still consumes far less power than a Brit or an American. Â© 2025 BBC.

He asked how anyone could expect developing countries to make promises on phasing out coal when they have still to deal with their development agendas and eradicating poverty. On top of that, four million people are employed in India's coal industry - and in the last decade the country's coal consumption has nearly doubled. It  continues to import large quantities of coal and is planning to open dozens of new mines in the coming years despite pledges to invest massively in renewable energy. An average Indian still consumes far less power than a Brit or an American. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A deal has been reached at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow after nearly two weeks of negotiations Boris Johnson calls it a ""big step forward"" but says there is a huge amount of work still to be done India and China asked for a crucial last minute-change to the agreement, calling for the ""phase-down"" not the ""phase-out"" of coal power Alok Sharma says it was important to get a deal done - but many countries voiced serious disappointment The deal is receiving a mixed reaction - Greenpeace says it keeps the 1.5C goal ""only just alive"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres meanwhile says: ""It's an important step but it's not enough"" The summit's overall goal was to chart a path to keep warming limited to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We are closing our coverage of the climate summit for today. Todayâs editors were
Lauren Turner, Tiffany Wertheimer and Kevin Ponniah. Our writers in London and Glasgow over a very long day were Georgina
Rannard, Matt Murphy, Becky Morton, Paul McLaren, Adam Durbin, Sam
Cabral, Dulcie Lee, Doug Faulkner and Mal Siret. After two long weeks of diplomatic back-and-forth, the Glasgow Climate Pact has been agreed. It has been labelled everything from historic and aggressive to fragile and disappointing. The measures are some of the strongest seen in the past 30 years of climate talks. Rich nations agreed to double the amount of cash they'll offer to vulnerable countries, and for the first time fossil fuels were mentioned in a COP agreement. But even if every government sticks to its promises, the world will still face a temperature rise of about 2C, which would lead to devastating impacts all over the globe. The overall consensus from delegates was that it was better to have an imperfect deal than no deal at all. Before we say goodbye - here are some of the most memorable moments from the past fortnight: Climate activist Greta Thunberg was mobbed as she arrived in Glasgow Day one started off with hundreds of people having to wait in long queues to get into the venue Former US President Barack Obama brought some star power to the summit, and called on young activists to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was pictured maskless and resting his eyes inside the hall And was his US counterpart, President Joe Biden, asleep or just resting his eyes? The Queen and other royals delivered powerful messages to the delegates Boris Johnson had to apologise to Israeli minister Karine Elharrar after she wasn't able to get into the venue in her wheelchair Thousands of climate activists protested in Glasgow - and cities around the world - during the summit China and the US issued a surprise joint statement vowing to boost climate co-operation There was a massive Earth hanging from the ceiling, which Greenpeace flew a ""not for sale"" banner up to on the last day, using helium balloons David ShukmanBBC News Science Editor, reporting from Glasgow Our science editor David Shukman has been reporting on climate change for nearly 20 years. This is his 10th COP summit - and here's his view on what we've seen agreed tonight: These conferences tend, at best, to produce incremental
progress not dramatic breakthroughs. And as US envoy John Kerry told me yesterday, this one was
never going to halt global warming on its own. So the hope is that agreeing to pick up the pace of climate
diplomacy, and packing the diary with more reviews and meetings, will make it
harder for governments to dodge the issue. Another hope is that the shame heaped on the richest nations for
failing to keep their word on climate aid to the poorest - together with new
arrangements - will lead to much-needed cash actually getting delivered. The initiatives by groups of countries on deforestation,
methane and fossil fuels do at least indicate a willingness to head in a new
direction, even if theyâre not verifiable. But is the goal of limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5C really
alive? Yes, if youâre really optimistic that the promises made here
will be kept and that the real world is embracing renewable energy, electric
cars and all the rest rapidly enough. As you can imagine, reaction is continuing to pour in to the Glasgow deal. EU leader Ursula von der Leyen has shared a statement on Twitter praising today's agreement as ""a step in the right direction"". She says that the deal ""sends a clear message time is up for fossil
fuel subsidies and unabated coal"". (That means coal produced without carbon capture technology.) ""If all long-term commitments announced in Glasgow will be
implemented, we should keep global warming under 2C,"" she adds. ""So we need to work further â so that next yearâs climate
conference in Egypt puts us firmly on track for 1.5C."" The difference between a world that warms by 2C instead of 1.5C in terms of climate impacts is significant. At the higher figure, many more people would face extreme heat, all coral reefs would be destroyed and flooding would be even worse. Allow Twitter content?

Asked how he will convince critics that the agreement represent urgent action, the US climate envoy says they should read it first, before saying it's a failure. ""The reality is that whatâs
happened here is significant,"" he says. ""Did I appreciate that we
had to adjust something tonight in an
unusual way? No,"" he adds, talking about the change to a line in the agreement about coal, which was pushed for by China and India. ""But you have to make tough decisions in this business sometimes."" US climate envoy John Kerry says the majority of the 20 largest economies in the world - which are responsible for 80% of emissions - are committed to reaching the 1.5C global warming target. He says Glasgow gives a clear blueprint for ""what we need to do"" from now until 2050. He admits some people ""may have wanted even stronger language"" but says the text that has been agreed to has the first ever mention of coal. Kerry goes on to say that this ""is the beginning of a 10-year sprint"". On the US-China agreement announced earlier in the week - which contained few concrete measures - he says it was announced ""with a view to producing a reduction in emissions"". ""We are the two largest economies in the world and we are going to work together to raise climate ambition in this decade,"" he says. There's been a lot of reporting on how India pushed for the language on coal to be weakened, but China was very strongly pushing for it behind the scenes, our reporters in Glasgow say. Helen BriggsEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow After a day of high emotion, tension and drama, at times,
the mood has lightened here. Thereâs a frenzy of activity as delegates spill out of the
plenary hall and journalists furiously file pieces to camera. Others are packing up their kit, knowing weâre meant to
leave within a few hours of the gavel falling for the last time. This slice of UN territory â for the fortnight the
conference lasted â is quickly being returned to Scottish soil. Staff are
cleaning, packing up boxes, and moving tables and chairs. On the way in this morning, everyone was taking pictures,
wondering if this would be the last day. Itâs hard to believe it is â and
that the Glasgow Climate Pact has finally become a reality. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst in Glasgow This outcome is good and bad. First the good: The measures taken are the strongest seen in 30 years of climate talks. Polluting nations agreed they hadnât done enough tocut emissions, and said theyâd do more over the next year. Rich nations also agreed todouble the amount of cashtheyâll offer for vulnerable countries to adapt to worsening weather. And after years of pressure theyâve accepted there should be a fund to actuallycompensate poor nationshit by extreme events. Fossil fuelswere mentioned too, for the first time at a COP, although India watered down the deal. There was also an innovation from the UK to seek separate agreements between governments, businesses and civil society onmethane, forests and innovation. The UK was also praised for itsdiplomacy. Thatâs the good news. The bad news is that if every government does everything it promises, the world will still face a catastrophic temperature rise of around 2C. This video can not be played COP26: 'Paris built the arena, Glasgow starts the race' - Kerry We're now hearing from US climate envoy John Kerry, hot on the heels of Alok Sharma. He says it was always unlikely that the summit in Glasgow would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"". âParis built build the arena, and Glasgow started the race.
Tonight the starting gun was fired,"" he says, referring to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. ""As a result of what took place here... nations that have
never considered having the word 'coal' in a plan... it's on the books â it's part
of the decision."" He adds that ""you have to phase-down coal before you can end coal"". ""This is the beginning of something,"" he says. When asked about the ""heartbreaking"" stories of poorer and island nations and how they are being affected by climate change, Sharma says he understands their disappointment with parts of the agreement. ""What was important was
to get a deal over the line, and that all the hard work... was not going to
dissipate,"" he says, defending the late compromises. Asked about the tense and seemingly fraught discussions in the summit's final hours, Sharma declines to go into detail about the back and forth that took place between negotiators. But he adds: ""Anyone who has seen footage of the conversations can make up their own minds about how I felt."" I'm sorry we couldn't hold the original language on coal, but nevertheless we do have language on coal and I think that is a start."" Alok Sharma, COP president In response to a question, Alok Sharma, who has led this summit, says he wishes the 11th hour watering down of the agreement on coal had not happened. But he says, ""we do have language on coal, on phase-down"" and that no-one would have thought that line would have been retained at all earlier in the summit. The line calling for the ""phase-down of unabated coal"" and an end to ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies is unprecedented in a COP agreement, experts say, even if it was weakened. Alok Sharma calls the agreement a ""fragile win"" and says that the hard work starts now. ""We have kept 1.5C alive â that was our overarching objective... But I would
still say that the pulse of 1.5C is weak."" He was asked about the moment he became emotional during the formal plenary. ""Iâve had about six hours
sleep in the last three days,"" he says, adding ""it is emotional, collectively
as a team we have achieved what many people doubted."" It's been a long, long day and the COP president is now facing the press. He says he's had six hours sleep in the last few days. Stay with us for updates. Georgina RannardBBC News Sohanur Rahman, 25, is a founding member of Bangladeshâs Friday for Future movement, leading youth activists in the country as they face the dire effects of rising sea levels and flooding. As the Glasgow agreement was gavelled, he told me that youth were recognised for the first time at COP, but âthe end result is nothingâ. He feels helpless and betrayed going back to Bangladesh with this agreement and says the ""empty pledges"" won't protect anyone from the climate crisis. He does not believe it will limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C, despite what politicians say. ""We have no scope to hold them accountable,"" he explains. He welcomes the good news on loss and damage - an acknowledgment from rich countries that poor nations need support paying for impacts of climate change they can't adapt to. But the voices of the most affected people were silenced, he says - âthe interest of the fossil fuel corporations have been clearly pandered to by the UK COP presidency.â This video can not be played COP26 deal changes 'a real blow' - Marshall Islands Tina Stege, climate envoy for Marshall Islands, has sent us her reaction to the deal. Her highly vulnerable Pacific Island country is at risk of being wiped out by climate change. She says last-minute changes to the wording on coal and the weakened language on loss and damage are ""blows"". There was a conversation we were not a part of and it was a real blow.. We had been told that there would be no further changes to the text and we had already swallowed some changes that were difficult to swallow."" Tina Stege But the ""real progress made"" in Glasgow is a ""lifeline"" for her country and it should not be discounted, she argues. Stege is pleased that money on climate finance was secured. And she says it's positive that countries are being called on to submit new targets to reduce emissions next year. Disappointment being expressed with the final pact is ""understandable"" after key issues were ""watered down in the final hours"", Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. However, the SNP politician adds there ""can be no doubt"" the negotiations in Glasgow have led to improvement on some key areas. While there has been much positive progress, there is no escaping the fact that COP26 has not delivered as much as global south countries, activists and campaigners rightly demanded and I firmly believe that the leaders of the rich developed countries must go further."" Nicola Sturgeon UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has posted a short statement on Twitter praising the deal reached by leaders in Glasgow - but says there is more work to be done.  We asked nations to come together for our planet at @COP26, and they have answered that call. I want to thank the leaders, negotiators and campaigners who made this pact happen â and the people of Glasgow who welcomed them with open arms.  I also want particularly to thank COP President Alok Sharma who has worked incredibly hard to bring countries together.  Today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5C.  I hope that we will look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change, and I will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal.""  While he may not be enthused with the deal, Shadow business minister  - and former Labour leader - Ed Miliband has nothing but praise for  Alok Sharma. He says Sharma, a Tory MP and minister of state at the cabinet office, has shown himself to be a ""person of decency, integrity and commitment"". Throughout the afternoon, the COP26 president has been seen flitting between various delegations, discussing the text and working to get the deal across the line. Allow Twitter content?

The lectern is ready, flags and all, along with 100 journalists waiting for him outside the hall. India, along with China, pushed for the last-minute change to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal. But why?

"Scott Sutherland pleaded guilty to two counts of theft and two of burglary A paramedic who stole thousands of pounds worth of defibrillators from an ambulance service and sold them on eBay has been jailed for three years. Scott Sutherland stole the equipment while working at North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) in 2017 and 2018. The 48-year-old then returned to steal more in 2020, after he had transferred to South Western Ambulance Service, Liverpool Crown Court heard. Judge David Potter said Sutherland's ""fall from grace had been spectacular"". He had received a commendation in 2012 for his work with other paramedics to save someone's life with the use of a defibrillator. The judge said: ""If ever there needed to be evidence of the value of defibrillator equipment, the efforts you and others put into saving that man's life with the use of a defibrillator proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt."" Sutherland, who worked for NWAS from 1996 to 2019, went to ambulance stations in Bootle and Kirkby in Merseyside and in Runcorn, Cheshire, overnight on 11 February 2020, wearing a paramedic uniform and using a pin code to gain access, the court heard. He took three defibrillators and a battery-charging pack worth a total of more than Â£30,000 and as a result some ambulances had to be taken off the road. CCTV footage from Runcorn Ambulance Station captured Scott Sutherland dressed in NWAS uniform Police found emails showing he had been communicating with a man called Norbert Simon, based in the Czech Republic, about the purchase of defibrillators. Transactions worth more than Â£60,000 were made between Mr Simon and Sutherland and his wife's PayPal accounts between 2017 and 2020, the court heard. The court heard Sutherland had several eBay accounts selling medical equipment and between 2013 and 2019 he sold more than Â£108,000 of goods, including two defibrillators confirmed to have been stolen from NWAS. Sutherland, of Pearse Gardens in Modbury, Devon pleaded guilty to two counts of theft and two of burglary. Martine Snowdon, defending, said the father-of-five had chosen a ""challenging and selfless career"" which put him at the ""forefront"" of trauma. She said: ""Over many years of doing that, not just to a competent standard but to an exceptional standard, it has taken its toll on him."" She said Sutherland had been impacted by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and there was evidence he and his family were in ""dire straits"" financially by the end of 2019. Roger Jones, head of service for NWAS in Merseyside and Cheshire, said it was ""incredibly disappointing"" that a former employees ""would take advantage of his position to steal these life-saving pieces of equipment"".

"Clashes occurred as the prime minister was announcing the new restrictions Police in the Netherlands have used water cannon on protesters opposed to a new partial lockdown imposed amid record coronavirus infections and rising intensive care cases. Three weeks of restrictions for shops, sport and catering were announced by Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday. Much of Europe is facing a surge in cases, blamed partly on low vaccine take-up in several countries. Austria is expected to back a lockdown for unvaccinated people this weekend. Restrictions are to be be imposed first in the two provinces of Upper Austria and Salzburg from Monday, according to Health Minister Wolfgang MÃ¼ckstein. Denmark, which had downgraded coronavirus as no longer a ""socially critical"" disease, has re-instated a Covid pass that was phased out in September. The government wants to push through a law allowing workplaces to require the pass for staff. Covid passes set to stay as Europe heads for winter The Dutch prime minister said that fortunately the vast majority of people in the Netherlands had been vaccinated. But he said the three-week partial lockdown would start on Saturday evening: Non-essential shops will have to shut at 18:00 (17:00 GMT) and supermarkets, cafes, restaurants and hotels at 20:00 Professional and amateur sport will continue, but behind closed doors That includes the Netherlands' football World Cup qualifier against Norway on 16 November The 18:00 closure applies to casinos and saunas as well as hairdressers and sex workers A maximum of four guests aged over 13 will be allowed at people's homes As many people should work from home as possible Cinemas and theatres will stay open. Social distancing of 1.5m (5ft) is being reintroduced where Covid passes are not in operation. The caretaker cabinet is also working on a change in the law to allow businesses to choose whether they want to limit entry to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered. The catering industry has reacted angrily to the news; a spokesman told public broadcaster NOS the government had ""crossed a line"". Last weekend, thousands of protesters marched through The Hague in anger at existing Covid restrictions. Latest daily figures on Saturday showed 13,902 new Covid cases - the third-highest daily rate since the start of the pandemic - and 33 deaths. Dutch vaccination rates are relatively high, with 82.4% of over-12s having two doses, or 73% of the total population. Police said they had taken action to ""restore public order"" Protesters took to the streets in The Hague after Mr Rutte's announcement. Police fired water cannon after some of the crowd started throwing stones and fireworks at them. InAustria, vaccine take-up is at 65% and Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg says he will talk to provincial governors on Sunday before the green light is given for a national lockdown for the unvaccinated. ""The situation in Austria is worrying and infection numbers are rising rapidly, especially in Upper Austria and Salzburg,"" the health minister warned. The two provinces have a combined population of more than two million. Upper Austria governor Thomas Stelzer says people who have not been vaccinated will be able to leave home only for essential reasons such as going to work, buying food or to exercise. It is unclear how that would be enforced. Germany,which has also seen record Covid numbers this week, declared Austria a high-risk area on Friday, so that anyone visiting who has not been vaccinated or recovered from Covid will have to quarantine for 10 days. Eastern European countries have for weeks been fighting record infection rates, as they grapple with the lowest vaccine rates on the continent: Russiaannounced another 40,123 cases and 1,235 deaths in the past 24 hours on Friday Ukrainerecorded 24,058 more infections and 750 deaths Romania recorded another 307 deaths,external, involving 286 unvaccinated people, but case numbers are down Sloveniahas a record 215 Covid patients in intensive care, a relatively high figure for a population of more than two million Czechdaily Covid infections have topped 10,000 for the third time this week; the government is set to announce tighter restrictions *Deaths per 100,000 people Please update your browser to see full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals for each country. ** The past data for new cases is a three day rolling average.

"AstraZeneca has started to move away from providing its Covid-19 vaccine to countries on a not-for-profit basis. The drugs giant has signed a series of for-profit agreements for next year, and expects to make a modest income from the vaccine, it said. The company had previously said it would only start to make money from the vaccine when Covid-19 was no longer a pandemic. Its chief executive Pascal Soriot said the disease was becoming endemic. The jab will continue to be supplied on a not-for-profit basis to poorer countries. Mr Soriot had said previously: ""We decided to provide it at no profit, because our top priority was to protect global health."" He told the BBC he had ""absolutely no regrets"" about not making a profit when competitors had been, despite having to deal with political criticism in various countries. He said the vaccine, which was developed with the University of Oxford, had saved a million lives around the world. ""I absolutely don't regret it,"" Mr Soriot said. ""We are proud as a company of the impact we have had - we've saved millions of hospitalisations. The [AstraZeneca] team continues to do a stellar job."" Covid jab to be compulsory for England's NHS staff Covid-resistant people inspire new vaccine tactic He said that the contracts that had been signed are for next year, adding: ""The virus is becoming endemic which means we have to learn to live with it. ""We started this to help, but we said we would transition [to making a profit on the vaccine],"" he said. ""It's not something we see as a huge profit-earner."" There will be tiered pricing for countries to make sure the vaccine is affordable, Mr Soriot said. By the end of the year AstraZeneca expects to have supplied 250 million doses of its vaccine to the Covax programme for developing countries. Covid vaccines: Will drug companies make bumper profits? Other vaccine manufacturers including Pfizer and Moderna have been making profits from their vaccines. A normal profit margin in the drugs industry is about 20%, but Mr Soriot said AstraZeneca, which charges about $5 per shot for the Covid vaccine at cost price, would not be making as much profit as that. However, Nick Dearden, director of campaign group Global Justice Now, said AstraZeneca's decision to start profiting from the vaccine while the coronavirus pandemic was continuing ""shows the utter folly of giving away publicly-funded science to big pharma"". ""This moment was always going to come - and it's exactly why public health experts have demanded a waiver of intellectual property on Covid-19 vaccines,"" he said. In its latest financial results,external, AstraZeneca said: ""The company is now expecting to progressively transition the vaccine to modest profitability as new orders are received. ""Covid-19 vaccine sales in [the fourth quarter of 2021] are expected to be a blend of the original pandemic agreements and new orders, with the large majority coming from pandemic agreements."" By the end of September, AstraZeneca and its sub-licensees had supplied 1.5 billion doses. The company reported revenues for the first nine months of the year of $25.4bn (Â£19bn), but said its overall profit margins had declined, mainly due to providing the Covid-19 vaccine at cost price. AstraZeneca said a rise in profits in the fourth quarter from the Covid-19 vaccine would balance out costs related to developing a Covid-19 antibody treatment, as it kept its overall profit forecast for the year the same. Shares in the drugs giant fell more than 4% on Friday. Meanwhile, another company that has developed a Covid vaccine, US giant Johnson & Johnson, said on Friday that it would split its consumer healthcare division, which makes products including Baby Powder and Listerine, from its drugs and medical devices businesses. ""The new Johnson & Johnson and the new consumer health company would each be able to more effectively allocate resources to deliver for patients and consumers, drive growth and unlock significant value,"" said Joaquin Duato, who is expected to become chief executive in January.

"Clashes occurred as the prime minister was announcing the new restrictions Police in the Netherlands have used water cannon on protesters opposed to a new partial lockdown imposed amid record coronavirus infections and rising intensive care cases. Three weeks of restrictions for shops, sport and catering were announced by Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday. Much of Europe is facing a surge in cases, blamed partly on low vaccine take-up in several countries. Austria is expected to back a lockdown for unvaccinated people this weekend. Restrictions are to be be imposed first in the two provinces of Upper Austria and Salzburg from Monday, according to Health Minister Wolfgang MÃ¼ckstein. Denmark, which had downgraded coronavirus as no longer a ""socially critical"" disease, has re-instated a Covid pass that was phased out in September. The government wants to push through a law allowing workplaces to require the pass for staff. Covid passes set to stay as Europe heads for winter The Dutch prime minister said that fortunately the vast majority of people in the Netherlands had been vaccinated. But he said the three-week partial lockdown would start on Saturday evening: Non-essential shops will have to shut at 18:00 (17:00 GMT) and supermarkets, cafes, restaurants and hotels at 20:00 Professional and amateur sport will continue, but behind closed doors That includes the Netherlands' football World Cup qualifier against Norway on 16 November The 18:00 closure applies to casinos and saunas as well as hairdressers and sex workers A maximum of four guests aged over 13 will be allowed at people's homes As many people should work from home as possible Cinemas and theatres will stay open. Social distancing of 1.5m (5ft) is being reintroduced where Covid passes are not in operation. The caretaker cabinet is also working on a change in the law to allow businesses to choose whether they want to limit entry to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered. The catering industry has reacted angrily to the news; a spokesman told public broadcaster NOS the government had ""crossed a line"". Last weekend, thousands of protesters marched through The Hague in anger at existing Covid restrictions. Latest daily figures on Saturday showed 13,902 new Covid cases - the third-highest daily rate since the start of the pandemic - and 33 deaths. Dutch vaccination rates are relatively high, with 82.4% of over-12s having two doses, or 73% of the total population. Police said they had taken action to ""restore public order"" Protesters took to the streets in The Hague after Mr Rutte's announcement. Police fired water cannon after some of the crowd started throwing stones and fireworks at them. InAustria, vaccine take-up is at 65% and Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg says he will talk to provincial governors on Sunday before the green light is given for a national lockdown for the unvaccinated. ""The situation in Austria is worrying and infection numbers are rising rapidly, especially in Upper Austria and Salzburg,"" the health minister warned. The two provinces have a combined population of more than two million. Upper Austria governor Thomas Stelzer says people who have not been vaccinated will be able to leave home only for essential reasons such as going to work, buying food or to exercise. It is unclear how that would be enforced. Germany,which has also seen record Covid numbers this week, declared Austria a high-risk area on Friday, so that anyone visiting who has not been vaccinated or recovered from Covid will have to quarantine for 10 days. Eastern European countries have for weeks been fighting record infection rates, as they grapple with the lowest vaccine rates on the continent: Russiaannounced another 40,123 cases and 1,235 deaths in the past 24 hours on Friday Ukrainerecorded 24,058 more infections and 750 deaths Romania recorded another 307 deaths,external, involving 286 unvaccinated people, but case numbers are down Sloveniahas a record 215 Covid patients in intensive care, a relatively high figure for a population of more than two million Czechdaily Covid infections have topped 10,000 for the third time this week; the government is set to announce tighter restrictions *Deaths per 100,000 people Please update your browser to see full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals for each country. ** The past data for new cases is a three day rolling average.

"The COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh has been billed as a ""watershed moment"" for climate change. What are some key things countries need to do to tackle the problem? Burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and especially coal, releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, trapping heat and raising global temperatures. It's an issue which has to be tackled at government level if temperature rises are to be limited to 1.5C - the level considered the gateway to dangerous climate change. However, a recentUN report,external, has said the ongoing use of fossil fuels means remaining below this temperature rise is now unlikely. The alternative to fossil fuels is renewable energy such as wind or solar. The World Resources Institute (WRI) State of the Climate report 2022 revealed that from 2019 to 2021, solar energy generation grew by 47 percent and wind by 31 percent. But some countries have recently had to use more coaland liquified Natural Gas (LNG)- the most polluting fossil fuels - due to a shortage in gas energy supply arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Are countries on track to meet the climate goals from Glasgow? A 2021UN report,externalsuggested that reducing emissions of methane could make an important contribution to tackling the planetary emergency. Researchers have found that changing cows' diets can reduce the methane they produce A substantial amount of methane is released from ""flaring"" - the burning of natural gas during oil extraction - and could be stopped with technical fixes. What is gas flaring and why is it a problem? Finding better ways of disposing of rubbish is also important, because landfill sites are another big methane source. At COP26 in 2021 in Glasgow,nearly 100 countries agreed to cut methane emissions,in a deal spearheaded by the US and the EU. The Global Methane Pledge aims to limit methane emissions by 30% compared with 2020 levels. We'll also need to change the way we power the vehicles we use to get around on land, sea and in the air. Ditching petrol and diesel cars and switching to electric vehicles will be critical. Lorries and buses could be powered by hydrogen fuel, ideally produced using renewable energy. And scientists are working on new, cleaner fuels for aircraft, although campaigners are also urging people to reduce the number of flights they take. Why electric cars will take over sooner than you think The UN's body of climate scientists, the IPCC, said in 2018, that to have a realistic chance of keeping the global temperature rise under 1.5C, we will have to remove CO2 from the air. Forests are excellent at soaking it up from the atmosphere - one reason why campaigners and scientists emphasise the need to protect the natural world by reducing deforestation. Programmes of mass tree-planting are seen as a way of offsetting CO2 emissions. Trees are likely to be important as countries wrestle with their net zero targets, because once emissions have been reduced as much as possible, remaining emissions could be ""cancelled out"" by carbon sinks such as forests. But theUK Forestry Commission also says,externalit is important to plant trees in the ""right place and for the right reasons"" - to make sure they are suitable for the environment and provide wider benefits to our ecosystems. World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030 Emerging technologies that artificially remove CO2 from the atmosphere, or stop it being released in the first place, could play a role. A number ofdirect-air capture facilitiesare being developed, including plants built by Carbon Engineering in Texas and Climeworks in Switzerland. They work by using huge fans to push air through a chemical filter that absorbs CO2. Climeworks' first direct-air capture plant opened in 2017 and it now has 15 machines in operation around the world Another method is carbon capture and storage, which captures emissions at ""point sources"" where they are produced, such as at coal-fired power plants. The CO2 is then buried deep underground. However, the technology is expensive - and controversial, because it is seen by critics as helping perpetuate a reliance on fossil fuels. The device that reverses CO2 emissions At the Copenhagen COP summit in 2009, rich countries pledged to provide $100bn (Â£88bn) in financing by 2020, designed to help developing countries fight and adapt to climate change. That target date was not met but is expected to be reached in 2023. The plan also estimated that developed countries would need to mobilise more than $100 billion per year each year through to 2025. Countries such as Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean are on the front line of the effects of global warming Many coal-dependent nations have shown interest in moving away from coal. However, they need support to construct and establish new renewable energy. Experts believe poorer nations will need continuing financial support to help them move towards greener energy. For instance, the US, EU and UK last yearprovided $8.5bn to help South Africa phase out coal use. What do the poorest countries want from climate summit?

The first minister said there had been ""big concessions"", including from the United States on adaptation funding for developing countries. Climate talks into overtime as nations near deal She told BBC Scotland the final agreement would depend on the political will, determination and leadership that is shown in the hours ahead. On the last scheduled day of the 13-day summit, hundreds of delegates walked out of COP26 to join a protest outside the UN blue zone. Hundreds of delegates walked out of the COP26 venue Activists took to the stage to express frustration at a lack of results. Members of environmental groups and trade unions were among those who sang ""power to the people"" as they left the arena to join hundreds of protesters in the street outside the blue zone. New draft climate deal seeks more urgent action Fear of failure as climate talks enter final day What's been agreed at COP26 so far? The latest draft agreement has watered-down commitments to end the use of coal and other fossil fuels. While the language around fossil fuels has been softened, the inclusion of the commitment in a final deal would be seen as a landmark moment. Protests, however, took place throughout the day with campaigners claiming the summit was falling far short of what is required. Following a ""People's Plenary"" session in one of the main halls organised by the Cop26 Coalition, activists from around the world marched through the venue with a group of indigenous activists leading the procession. They carried banners and red ribbons to represent the red lines crossed by negotiators. Hundreds attended the protest in the streets outside the venue At a rally next to the COP26 venue, campaigners gathered for a street disco which turned sombre as speakers who came from inside the blue zone addressed the crowd. One of the speakers, a 15-year-old from Chad, told how Lake Chad has dried up by 95% since the 1950s. But despite being accredited for the summit the teenager said she has been excluded from key meetings. She added: ""No one is listening. No one is doing anything."" Another speaker alluded to the weather and praised those who have braved the wet conditions. She told the audience: ""I hope you leave drenched in hope."" Extinction Rebellion activist Sarah (left) said she believed that COP had failed Sarah, 29, an Extinction Rebellion activist from Glasgow, was helping to hold up sign outside the UN blue zone which read: ""A Giant COP Up"". She told the BBC: ""We are here today because COP has failed. ""COP has essentially been a giant trade show in which the fossil fuel executives have a bigger presence than delegates from countries most affected by climate change. ""It has shown that leaders, such as our own government, are content to let people suffer and let people die rather than take the action that is required."" Sarah said solutions to the climate crisis lie outside the barricaded SEC and on the streets, where some of the most affected groups had gathered to make their voice heard. Two people were led away after trying to climb the venue fence The atmosphere outside the UN blue zone was good natured, with activists even taking part in a mass Macarena dance. Around midday they were joined by delegates who filed out of the Scottish Event Campus. The rally that followed featured contributions from a diverse range of international speakers and a common theme - politicians are not doing enough to address the climate crisis. The event was on a much smaller scale than the colourful protests which snaked through the city last Friday and Saturday. But shortly after 14:15, as I was taking pictures of the distinctive Extinction Rebellion red dancers, I heard a commotion to my left. I looked round to see a man attempting to scale the barrier. He was immediately grabbed by three police officers and pinned to the ground. Seconds later, a few yards away, another protestor took advantage of the chaos and also tried to climb over the fence. He got his right leg over it before he was also hauled onto the road. Dr Caroline Palmer and husband Malcolm Redford took a train from Lancashire to make their voices heard Dr Caroline Palmer travelled to Glasgow for the day from Colne, Lancashire, with her husband Malcolm Redford. The retired GP, 67, said: ""I have got grandchildren and I feel very worried about what life is going to be like for them. It is our duty to do what we can to hold our government to account. ""They keep making promises but what we need is action. It's getting critical now."" Mr Redford, 68, wants to see an end to the extraction of fossil fuels and more affordable electric cars. The former teacher said: ""We need to make real choices to keep 1.5 alive otherwise we have lost.""

Nayara said one of the highlights of her trip was last Saturday's march which organisers sayattracted 100,000 people.

"Growing numbers of very vulnerable children in England are being detained in temporary accommodation under special court orders described as ""draconian"" by one senior judge. In a rare move, the BBC has been given access to court proceedings and documents, which reveal the everyday impact these orders have on young people. Holiday lets, caravans and canal boats, are just some of the temporary locations being used to house children - because there aren't enough suitable places in registered children's homes. Not only are these unsuitable, they are now illegal - unless a court rules otherwise. Since September, any home for under 16s in care - either permanent or temporary - needs to be Ofsted registered. But because there aren't enough registered places available, councils looking for a way to keep the children in unregistered accommodation without breaking the law, are turning to the family courts to issue Deprivation of Liberty orders. These can allow children to be kept behind locked doors and windows, and even permit the use of medication without consent as a means of restraint. Here are the stories of a number of teenagers. She's an ""exceptionally intelligent and articulate 15-year-old girl"" reads one legal report before the Family Court. The girl can't be named, but is known to legal teams by the initials FJ. The past year has been traumatic for her. FJ, who has been diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder, went into care 11 months ago after having self-harmed, attempted to take her own life, and having run away from her family home. She was first placed in a registered children's home, but then made another suicide attempt. Her local authority, the City of York, tried hard to find a safe place for her close to her family home but it was difficult. The council approached 225 other placements, but none would take her. She has since been housed in three locations, including a secure unit and a holiday cottage with staff. She's currently in a property where she is watched over by two members of staff day and night. It's not registered with Ofsted - so because of September's change in the law, a Deprivation of Liberty order is needed. If it was registered, managers would have to be approved, staff checked and buildings inspected. Children's movements can be restricted in a children's home - particularly if it's a secure unit, but the terms of a Deprivation of Liberty order can be far more stringent. The orders vary from case to case, but generally they restrict a child's freedom and confine them to one location. They could also stop them having contact with a family member or access to a mobile phone. In extreme cases, it could allow them to be sedated. The orders are not new, but local authorities are increasingly turning to them to accommodate vulnerable children. FJ's order means she cannot meet her friends without an adult present - or freely access the internet. Despite having obtained the deprivation order, the council is obliged to try to get any property FJ is living in registered as a children's home as soon as possible. But that can be a complex process. And there is further uncertainty for FJ. York wants to move her soon to another placement which is closer to family and school but the dates for that keep shifting. FJ feels the local authority is ""just not bothering"" according to a court document expressing some of her personal feelings. The situation is creating a ""heightened state of anxiety, instability and frustration"" for her, due to her feelings being ""out of control"". Although she has made progress learning to manage those feelings, the document states that future uncertainty is heightening ""the risk to herself such as self-injury through cutting, biting, misuse of medication or running away. She can become angry and impulsive which leads to incidents of aggression with others."" There are scores of vulnerable teenagers in care, who like FJ, are detained in temporary or unregistered accommodation across England and subject to Deprivation of Liberty orders. Data from the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service - Cafcass - shows numbers of applications for such orders have increased starkly in recent years. These figures are likely to be an under-estimate, according to those familiar with these cases. Judges are concerned about the number of applications appearing before them - and the lack of suitable places for these children. High Court Judge, Sir Alistair MacDonald, has been hearing FJ's case along with others. It has been his job to decide whether to grant what he describes as these ""truly draconian"" orders, which have a ""profound impact"" on each young person. ""These cases are overwhelming the Family Division,"" warned Mr Justice MacDonald at one hearing. Another case being heard by him involves a 15-year-old boy from Plymouth - known as QV. His Deprivation of Liberty order has allowed him to be held in a holiday lodge some distance from the city. Like FJ, he has autism. He also has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Tourette's syndrome. Since being taken into care at the age of five, he has been through more than a dozen placements. Described as ""extremely vulnerable"" to abuse and exploitation, he had to move from his last children's home in September after he climbed onto a roof and started throwing things down to the street below. While living In another placement, he discussed how to make a bomb. In the lodge, QV was being supervised day and night by two members of staff - similar to FJ. The court heard he felt isolated and had been refusing to attend the schooling arranged for him. One of his social workers said that because the property was a short-term holiday rental, it did not have the ""safeguards you would expect in a formal children's home setting"". Then, because the lodge had already been booked for October half term, QV had to be moved again, to another property in a different holiday park. If QV was a year older, the rules would be different. Local councils have to provide accommodation for 16- and 17-year-olds, but they can be housed in so-called ""unregulated"" settings which don't have to be registered with Ofsted. These settings are not children's homes, but are usually rooms or flats where older teenagers - on the verge of independence - learn to look after themselves. But in QV's case, it is likely special measures would almost certainly still apply to someone so vulnerable. In 2020, 6,480 under-18s were living in unregulated settings - the vast majority aged 16 or 17. Ofsted describes the problems housing teenagers who need high levels of support as ""very worrying"" with children exposed ""to a risk of serious harm"". Its National Director for Social Care, Yvette Stanley, also says placing young people in unregistered properties is costly - with local authorities paying around Â£10,000 per week per child. ""This shows it's not about local authorities skimping... there's just not enough provision out there."" Young people with the most complex needs are arguably best housed in secure units - at least for a time. But across England, there are only 13 such facilities with a maximum of 234 spaces. The urgent referral list for secure places has reached record levels, as Mr Justice Macdonald noted in his 3 November judgment for FJ and QV: ""As of 14 October 2021, there were 58 live referrals for children requiring secure accommodation and only 6 projected beds."" And, as the City of York discovered when they sought a place in an ordinary (rather than secure) children's home for FJ, many are reluctant to take the most vulnerable children. In England: There are 80,000 or so under-18s in care Most live with foster parents Nearly 13,000 are in children's homes More than 2,700 homes are Ofsted-registered Courts are seeingalmost double the number of cases,externalinvolving 10- to 17-year-olds compared to nearly a decade ago Each statistic is a real child with a personal story to tell. Children like FJ in York, QV in Plymouth and the third teenager from Derby - whose cases have all been considered by Mr Justice MacDonald. Both York and Derby councils said they were working with providers to get the unregistered placements registered as quickly as they could. But in his recent judgment, Mr Justice MacDonald wrote there was ""no clear evidence"" that registration was achievable for the Derby home - and in York, timescales were ""opaque"" for both FJ's current and future homes to be registered. Plymouth Council was not trying to register either of the holiday lodges with Ofsted - but just wanted to keep QV in them until a secure-home place became available. Mr Justice MacDonald also expressed his concern at how judges - without ""institutional expertise"" or the power to deploy inspectors - were being asked to decide children's futures. ""The High Court is not a regulatory body and nor is it equipped to perform the role of one,"" he wrote. Covid has exacerbated an already difficult situation for local authorities, says Charlotte Ramsden, Chair of the Association of Directors of Children's Services (ADCS). She says there is now a ""complex cohort of deeply distressed and traumatised teenagers"". ""Changing the law in September has been like closing a safety valve on a pressure cooker that's being heated. It explodes when we get these crisis placements - putting children in Airbnb or holiday lets - because there's nowhere else to place them."" She says the fact no-one will take these young people is ""keeping a lot of us awake at night"". Both Ofsted and ADCS say a new type of provision is needed for these young people - a combination of health and social care. The Department for Education told us it was up to councils to provide suitable safe accommodation for vulnerable children in their care and the chancellor had announced investment to help them. It also noted that the current independent review of children's social care, led by Josh MacAlister, would be looking at the ""major challenges"" for the sector. In recent months, Mr Justice MacDonald has heard other cases involving the most vulnerable children who needed, but hadn't been given, suitable care. In July, he heard abouta 15-year-old girl from North Yorkshire,externalwho was self-harming every day and had to be restrained nearly 200 times in just over six months. Doctors said she needed to be in a secure hospital, but there were no specialist NHS beds available anywhere in England. That same month, he wasasked to deprive a 12-year-old boy of his liberty,externalwho Wigan Council had placed on a regular hospital ward. The boy was so angry and violent it took 13 police officers to restrain him and he had to be sedated. Mr Justice MacDonald refused that order - and Wigan had to find an alternative. If you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress,these organisationsmay be able to help. What has happened to QV and FJ the two 15-year-olds whose cases ended up in the Family Division of the High Court? The boy has now been moved out of the holiday park and into a house in a small town, still with staff supporting and supervising him and he is still deprived of his liberty. Plymouth Council is seeking to register the property with Ofsted. In the case of FJ, Mr Justice MacDonald has called York back to the High Court to check the Ofsted-registration process for the two homes - current and planned. He has repeatedly mentioned the impact all the uncertainty must be having on her. ""[The girl] worries about the question of registration and lawfulness... this has a concrete impact upon her mental health."" Images in artwork courtesy Getty Images Â© 2025 BBC.

The first minister said there had been ""big concessions"", including from the United States on adaptation funding for developing countries. Climate talks into overtime as nations near deal She told BBC Scotland the final agreement would depend on the political will, determination and leadership that is shown in the hours ahead. On the last scheduled day of the 13-day summit, hundreds of delegates walked out of COP26 to join a protest outside the UN blue zone. Hundreds of delegates walked out of the COP26 venue Activists took to the stage to express frustration at a lack of results. Members of environmental groups and trade unions were among those who sang ""power to the people"" as they left the arena to join hundreds of protesters in the street outside the blue zone. New draft climate deal seeks more urgent action Fear of failure as climate talks enter final day What's been agreed at COP26 so far? The latest draft agreement has watered-down commitments to end the use of coal and other fossil fuels. While the language around fossil fuels has been softened, the inclusion of the commitment in a final deal would be seen as a landmark moment. Protests, however, took place throughout the day with campaigners claiming the summit was falling far short of what is required. Following a ""People's Plenary"" session in one of the main halls organised by the Cop26 Coalition, activists from around the world marched through the venue with a group of indigenous activists leading the procession. They carried banners and red ribbons to represent the red lines crossed by negotiators. Hundreds attended the protest in the streets outside the venue At a rally next to the COP26 venue, campaigners gathered for a street disco which turned sombre as speakers who came from inside the blue zone addressed the crowd. One of the speakers, a 15-year-old from Chad, told how Lake Chad has dried up by 95% since the 1950s. But despite being accredited for the summit the teenager said she has been excluded from key meetings. She added: ""No one is listening. No one is doing anything."" Another speaker alluded to the weather and praised those who have braved the wet conditions. She told the audience: ""I hope you leave drenched in hope."" Extinction Rebellion activist Sarah (left) said she believed that COP had failed Sarah, 29, an Extinction Rebellion activist from Glasgow, was helping to hold up sign outside the UN blue zone which read: ""A Giant COP Up"". She told the BBC: ""We are here today because COP has failed. ""COP has essentially been a giant trade show in which the fossil fuel executives have a bigger presence than delegates from countries most affected by climate change. ""It has shown that leaders, such as our own government, are content to let people suffer and let people die rather than take the action that is required."" Sarah said solutions to the climate crisis lie outside the barricaded SEC and on the streets, where some of the most affected groups had gathered to make their voice heard. Two people were led away after trying to climb the venue fence The atmosphere outside the UN blue zone was good natured, with activists even taking part in a mass Macarena dance. Around midday they were joined by delegates who filed out of the Scottish Event Campus. The rally that followed featured contributions from a diverse range of international speakers and a common theme - politicians are not doing enough to address the climate crisis. The event was on a much smaller scale than the colourful protests which snaked through the city last Friday and Saturday. But shortly after 14:15, as I was taking pictures of the distinctive Extinction Rebellion red dancers, I heard a commotion to my left. I looked round to see a man attempting to scale the barrier. He was immediately grabbed by three police officers and pinned to the ground. Seconds later, a few yards away, another protestor took advantage of the chaos and also tried to climb over the fence. He got his right leg over it before he was also hauled onto the road. Dr Caroline Palmer and husband Malcolm Redford took a train from Lancashire to make their voices heard Dr Caroline Palmer travelled to Glasgow for the day from Colne, Lancashire, with her husband Malcolm Redford. The retired GP, 67, said: ""I have got grandchildren and I feel very worried about what life is going to be like for them. It is our duty to do what we can to hold our government to account. ""They keep making promises but what we need is action. It's getting critical now."" Mr Redford, 68, wants to see an end to the extraction of fossil fuels and more affordable electric cars. The former teacher said: ""We need to make real choices to keep 1.5 alive otherwise we have lost."" Nayara Castiglioni Amaral is among the largest delegation of Brazilian activists to ever attend a COP Nayara Castiglioni Amaral has been in Scotland for the last fortnight as part of a delegation from a Brazilian youth organisation. Carrying a cardboard cut-out of the country's environment minister she expressed concern about the impact of her government's policy on indigenous communities. The 29-year-old said: ""We need more ambitious goals and we need to protect our tribal people as they take care of our environment."" Nayara said one of the highlights of her trip was last Saturday's march which organisers sayattracted 100,000 people. She added: ""It was one of the biggest protests that we have ever seen and it was beautiful. It was really powerful to be there.""

"Women who work mostly from home risk seeing their careers stall now workers are returning to the office in large numbers, according to Bank of England (BoE) economist Catherine Mann. She said office interaction was vital to advance in companies, but many women were still tied to home working. Ms Mann said it was a particular issue for mothers facing school disruptions and difficulty accessing childcare. Earlier this year, Rishi Sunak warned about young people's careers. The chancellor said he doubted his banking career would have been successful if he had started it in virtual meetings, and that being in the office helped build skills. Ms Mann, a member of the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee that sets interest rates, said online communication was unable to replicate the spontaneous office conversations that were important for recognition and advancement in many workplaces. She toldan event hosted by Financial News magazine,external: ""Virtual platforms are way better than they were even five years ago. But the extemporaneous, spontaneity - those are hard to replicate in a virtual setting."" Sunak warns young home working may hurt career Workers who want flexible work roles missing out Difficulty accessing childcare and pandemic-related disruption to schooling meant many women were continuing to work from home, while it had been easier for men to return to the office. ""There is the potential for two tracks,"" she said. ""There's the people who are on the virtual track and people who are on a physical track. And I do worry that we will see those two tracks develop, and we will pretty much know who's going to be on which track, unfortunately,"" she said. Ms Mann was an economics professor and chief economist at investment bank Citi and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, before joining the BoE in September. Flexible working has brought many benefits, many argue, including doing the school run and childcare Businesswoman Justine Roberts, co-founder of the Mumsnet website, agreed that there was a risk women's careers could suffer from not being in the office. But it was up to companies to be aware of this. But the flipside, she told the BBC, was that the flexibility of home working was a huge benefit to women, and mothers in particular. Presenteeism and long-hours culture had been eroded by new ways of working. ""Let's not forget that one of the best things to come out of [the pandemic crisis] is the ability to work flexibly,"" especially for mothers juggling childcare and school runs, she said. According to a BBC survey, just over half (56%) of women said they thought working from home would help them progress at work, as childcare and caring duties become less of a hindrance to working full-time. In all, 65% of managers felt that working from home helps advance women's careers. However, a quarter of the women polled said homeworking was unlikely to advance their careers. Danielle Harmer, chief people officer at insurance giant Aviva, said companies need to set out a framework to ensure that people working remotely are not an afterthought for company bosses. Otherwise, she said, career prospects and the gender pay gap would suffer. ""I think if organisations leave it up to their employees, you could have a potential situation where those with caring responsibilities, who tend to be female, tend to work from home more often, and we look back in two years and think: hang on a second, why has the gender pay gap widened? Or why are female promotions slowing down a little?"" she said. ""It's taken us a long time to make progress on things like the gender pay gap, and I think it would be terrible if we went backwards on it."" The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said British businesses reported that on average 60% of their staff were fully back at their normal place of work. About one-in-six employees are estimated to be using a hybrid model of working,the ONS said,external. Vincent Keavney, Partner at the law firm DLA Piper and Lord Mayor of London told the BBC's Today programme that he thought it was ""important"" for younger members in the sector to be in the office in order get the training they need. ""The buzz around the office and the buzz around the city is fantastic."" ""I don't think we should be micromanaging companies but there is a very strong message the the city is open,"" he added. However, proportions vary widely by sector. In professional services, 34% of staff are in the office, 24% are fully working from home, and 35% are doing a mix, the ONS said. Separate ONS data showed a slightly higher percentage of male workers than females worked from home for at least some of the time in late October. Previous ONS analysis showed women were more likely than men to say working from home allowed them more time to work, with fewer distractions. But men said working from home helped them come up with new ideas, while women found it a hindrance.

"This video can not be played ""You don't want to be where I am today"" - David Salmon's wife Linda took her own life while going through the menopause A bereaved husband has urged men to recognise signs of mental health symptoms linked to the menopause. Linda Salmon, 56, took her own life last April after her anxiety worsened during the Covid pandemic. Her husband David said he had not realised the menopause could cause suicidal thoughts. Mr Salmon, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, said: ""The physical side of symptoms you might see, but the mental ones are hidden."" He said a feature aired on the BBC's Look North programme after his wife's death led him to realise how the menopause could affect mental health. ""I didn't know there were all these other symptoms,"" he said. ""I honestly thought the menopause was you got a bit warm and had a few moods and then when I saw the programme highlighting suicide it all came together."" He believes he and his wife would have sought potentially life-saving help if they had known more about the link. Mr Salmon believes had his wife sought help, she may not have taken her own life When the national lockdown happened, mother-of-two Mrs Salmon worked as a key worker in a supermarket, but felt anxious about possibly falling ill with Covid. She was signed off work with anxiety and several days later she took her own life. Mr Salmon, who had been with Linda for 41 years, said he believed the menopause was a ""big contribution"" to her mental state and that worries about the pandemic had ""pushed her over the edge"". The menopause describes the age when women's periods stop and they can no longer become pregnant naturally. It normally happens between 45 and 55, but can also be brought on by surgery to remove the ovaries or the womb. In the UK, the average age of menopause is 51. It involves changes to hormones, specifically a reduction in oestrogen, which is key to the production of eggs during menstrual cycles. The body can start to behave very differently and many women experience symptoms long before their periods actually stop - a phase known as the peri-menopause. Symptoms of menopause can include hot flushes, night sweats, sleep problems, anxiety, low mood and a loss of interest in sex. Bladder problems and vaginal dryness are also common. Learn more:What does the menopause do to the body? Diane Danzebrink, who runsMenopause Support,external, said it was ""no coincidence"" that figures published by the Samaritans showed the highest rate of suicide among women was between the ages of 45 to 54. ""The vast majority of women will be peri-menopausal by the age of 45, the average age of menopause is 51. ""It's become absolutely clear to those who work and campaign and advocate in this area that this is simply not a coincidence."" The 55-year-old, from Northampton, set up the organisation after her struggle with the menopause, brought on by surgery, and the lack of help she received. Diane Danzebrink said she regularly heard from women who were not getting the right support She said her mental health had deteriorated rapidly and she suffered with ""crippling anxiety"" which left her unable to leave the house. ""I stopped answering the phone. I wouldn't even open the post because in my head I thought every letter was going to contain bad news,"" she said. She would frequently wake in the middle of the night with panic attacks but was ""too terrified"" to go to the doctor because she thought she was going mad. Ms Danzebrink added: ""Eventually it got to the point where I remember standing in my bedroom and thinking if this is my life, I don't think I want it any more."" After coming ""within a whisper"" of attempting suicide, Ms Danzebrink said, she sought medical help. Her doctor recognised her behaviour was a result of the menopause and she started Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). She said: ""We have successfully campaigned for menopause to be included in the school curriculum to ensure that all young people have a basic understanding, that will help them as they move through their lives. ""But we need better information for the entire population now so that people can help themselves or their partners, family, friends or colleagues."" Gabby Logan: 'Involve men in menopause discussion' 'My menopause was spotted in an AA meeting' What we wish we'd known about the menopause Mr Salmon said he now wanted to help other partners and families spot symptoms so he can prevent others from suffering as he has. ""We need to talk about it and make people aware. It's the mental side of it, not just the physical side,"" he said. ""If you are in a similar situation, I would say help your wife, hold her hand, get her through it. ""You don't want to be where I am today, nobody needs to do that.""

"This video can not be played Sabrina Lee takes a look at how a forecast in 2050 could look, if climate change remains unchecked The size of Wales is a common unit of measurement - but the country's outline could slightly change over the next century due to climate change. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said protecting all areas was ""difficult against the forces of nature"". More than 71,000 properties are currently at risk of flooding in Wales from tidal sources, the environment body added. NRW has said coastal flooding and erosion is ""a big risk for Wales"". Jeremy Parr, its head of flood and incident risk management, said in decades to come there will be ""some tough decisions in some locations where we might need to relocate some small communities and certainly make space for water and look after our environment."" Wales has 1,680 miles of coastline which surrounds the country on three sides, and about 60% of the Welsh population live in coastal areas. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Four ways to reduce your emissions Mr Parr said coastal flooding and erosion would be ""a big risk for Wales"" and ""all indications are it's going to get worse."" ""We can expect sea level rise for one thing and some of the predictions around that are quite scary,"" he added. ""The coastline is a dynamic environment. Parts of the coast will erode and fall away into the sea."" This video can not be played Eyewitnesses said this year's north Wales cliff fall was up to 40m (131ft) wide ""You get increased storminess and increase in winds. That can increase the water level even further and make conditions along the coast, really, really treacherous - and it means that there will be more flooding and it means that there will be more erosion."" The blue on the map is areas most at risk of flooding without more flood prevention measures while areas in yellow are parts of Wales that have been flooded ""in the past"" People are able tocheck the long term flood risk,externalof their area or street online. The warning follows amajor landslide on the north Wales coastlineearlier this year when cliffs of about 40m (131ft) wide fell onto a beach at Nefyn in Gwynedd. NRW said it ""makes sense"" to protect some vulnerable coastal towns and areas that are home to Wales' key infrastructure - like major roads and railways - and heritage sites such as castles. This video can not be played Miriam Barker explains how rising sea levels could affect Wales' coast The environmental watchdog has been working with local authorities and the Welsh government for several years to develop shoreline management plans for areas where climate change posed a particular challenge. But NRW acknowledges that losing areas of land to the seas was a difficult topic and needed to be handled sensitively so that people were not frightened. The seat of Welsh democracy at Cardiff Bay is protected by a barrage built in 1994 Asthe COP26 climate summitdraws to a close in Glasgow, the Royal Meteorological Society said cases of such extreme weather were on the increase, and global warming had serious implications. ""The Royal Met Society has been around since 1850 and we've seen a lot of extreme events here in the UK over that time,"" said chief executive Liz Bentley. This video can not be played One rail tunnel, built almost a century-and-a-half ago, has flooded seven times in the past year. ""But what we're finding because of climate change is that those events are becoming more frequent. ""One degree has made a big shift in what we're seeing in rainfall patterns. It also means we've started to see a significant increase in sea levels. So the sea level has risen by about 16 centimetres, which again, doesn't sound very much, but for low-lying areas that has a huge impact."" Key infrastructure in Wales like the A55 and railway line along the north Wales coast are next to the sea One leading geographical professor said Wales' coastline would ""change a lot"" in low lying areas with the sea moving inland. ""On the higher elevation areas there won't be that much change but there will be cliff falls,"" said Prof Richard Lucas, from Aberystwyth University's geography and earth sciences department. The 'forgotten' community left to fall off a cliff Warming world forces climate graphic changes Climate change in Wales in charts He said that although the landscape had changed in the past, the pace of change was a new phenomenon. Caernarfon Castle is one of Wales' heritage sites along the country's coastline ""It's the speed of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the speed that sea levels and other factors like flooding are changing. ""So the sea level is rising more rapidly than in the past, and ecosystems and people have to respond to that. And sometimes it's just too fast for them."" He added that to avoid a change in the shape of Wales, sea defences would ""need to be strengthened into the future"". The situation ""depends on the actions of people and how we respond to changing climate."" Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need.

"Michael Fawcett, Prince Charles's former valet, is accused of offering to help a donor secure an honour The chief executive of the Prince of Wales's charity has resigned amid accusations he helped a major donor secure an honour. Michael Fawcett, Prince Charles's aide for 40 years, has left the Prince's Foundation and his event planning firm will no longer work for Clarence House, a spokesperson said. Mr Fawcetttemporarily stood down from the charity in September. The prince has denied any knowledge of the offer of honours to a donor. A spokesperson for the prince's charity said: ""Michael Fawcett has resigned from his post as CEO of The Prince's Foundation."" Mr Fawcett became CEO of the foundation in 2018. It aims to promote sustainability, renovate the Dumfries House Estate and offer education and training programmes in construction and traditional crafts. Chair of Prince Charles' foundation quits amid access claims Charles has 'no knowledge' of aide honours claim Former aide to Charles steps down over honour claims He said he would step down temporarily after the Sunday Times, Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday published allegations that he had offered to help Saudi businessman Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz secure an honorary CBE and British citizenship. Mr Mahfouz, who denies any wrongdoing, donated large sums to restoration projects of particular interest to Prince Charles,according to the Sunday Times.,external He received an honorary CBE in late 2016. The Mail on Sunday published a letter from Mr Fawcett in 2017 in which he reportedly said he was willing to make an application to change the CBE to a KBE - an honorary knighthood - and to support Mr Mahfouz's application for citizenship. Mr Fawcett was then chief executive of the Dumfries House Trust and said the applications would be made in response to ""the most recent and anticipated support"" of the charity by Mr Mahfouz. Prince Charles with Michael Fawcett, his valet at the time In September, Clarence House said Prince Charles had ""no knowledge of the alleged offer of honours or British citizenship on the basis of donation to his charities"". The prince and Mr Fawcett were said to be fully supportive of an investigation into the claims by the Prince's Foundation.

"Prisons are facing difficulties recruiting enough officers amid a surge in job vacancies, a union has said. This comes as job adverts have soared to a record high in the run-up to Christmas, according to recruiters. Driving instructors, prison officers and forklift truck drivers are among the jobs in highest demand, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said. Meanwhile demand for construction roles dropped due to supply chain problems. How do I find a new job and who is hiring? UK job vacancies reach 20-year high Foreign drivers to be allowed more UK deliveries Prisons were among the employers with the most demand for staff in late October and early November, REC data suggested, with adverts for prison officer rising by 13%. The Prison Officers Association (POA) union said prisons are facing severe recruitment difficulties. ""Staff are voting with their feet and leaving"" after a recent pay review, said POA assistant general secretary Mick Pimblett. The prison service is ""close to breaking point"" in the run-up to Christmas, he added. The POA gave Berwyn prison in north Wales as an example - 134 prison officers have left over the past three months. There has been an increase in violence and self-harm among prisoners, and violence directed at prison officers, after coronavirus restrictions on prisoners mixing were lifted, said Mr Pimblett. Due to crown courts processing cases again after postponements from coronavirus lockdowns and people being convicted, the number of prisoners is reaching capacity, putting more strain on the system, he added. A HM Prison Service spokeswoman said: ""Vacancies across the estate have been stable for six months and these figures include recruitment to our brand new prison, HMP Five Wells, which will open in the new year."" In October, the HM Prison Service announcedthat all staff earning less than Â£24,000 will receive a Â£250 pay rise, and all staff yet to reach the top of their pay band will continue to receive progression pay of up to 5%. Vacancies for driving instructors saw the biggest jump, the REC data suggested, rising by about a third. An REC spokesman said that pent-up demand from the pandemic for driving lessons and tests was likely to be behind the rise. Karen Bransgrove, general manager of the Driving Instructors Association (DIA), said she had not noticed more adverts, but there was a lot of demand for tests and lessons. ""There is a huge backlog of tests,"" she said, adding that people could not learn to drive for 18 months during the pandemic so ""naturally there's pent-up demand"". She added that the number of instructors had also fallen. ""Lots of people took early retirement or dropped out [of driving instruction] due to the pandemic,"" Ms Bransgrove said. Loveday Ryder, chief executive of the Driver Vehicle and Standards Agency (DVSA) said it was doing ""all we can"" to provide as many tests as possible services get back to normal. ""I know learners will be keen to take their test now, but it is important that candidates are properly prepared and don't rush to take it,"" she said. ""With more than half of candidates failing, and demand currently extremely high for tests, learners should only take their test only when they are confident they can pass."" This would prevent a further backlog of tests and lengthy waits for retests. The REC figures also suggested a sharp rise in vacancies for forklift truck drivers. There is a chronic shortage of HGV drivers in the UK, which the logistics industry has blamed on factors including Covid and Brexit. There is also a shortage of forklift truck drivers, which the UK Warehousing Association said was also linked to Brexit. Clare Bottle, the association's chief executive, said that prior to Brexit, 34% of forklift truck drivers were EU nationals, but now many had gone back to their home countries. Driver pay went up between 20-30% because of the labour shortages that followed, she said, which was unsustainable for warehousing businesses, the majority of which were small to medium-sized. These businesses were already operating on thin margins, with 60-70% of costs already taken up by staffing. In the short term, those businesses had put prices up for their retailer customers to survive, but Ms Bottle said those price rises could ultimately be passed onto consumers, adding to inflationary pressures. How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? Lorry driver shortage: Government to lift rules on foreign haulier deliveries In the longer term, the industry needed to attract more younger people and women, she said. Ms Bottle added that warehousing was ""dominated"" by older people, mainly men: ""We've got an image problem that we need to tackle."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are closely monitoring labour supply and working with sector leaders to understand how we can best ease particular pinch points. Similar challenges are being faced by other countries around the world. ""We want to see employers make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad. Our Plan for Jobs is helping people across the country retrain, build new skills and get back into work. ""The government encourages all sectors to make employment more attractive to UK domestic workers through offering training, careers options, wage increases and investment."" Job adverts surged in many parts of the country between 25 October and 7 November, the REC data suggested, but in some sectors there was a sharp fall in demand. During the pandemic the UK construction industry has boomed, driven by factors including more house sales during the stamp duty holiday and an increased appetite for home improvements. But Covid has also seen a global squeeze on supply chains, with the costs of building materials rising rapidly. The REC's chief executive Neil Carberry said adverts for construction jobs saw a drop-off last week as supply issues ""constrained the industry's ability to work to capacity"". Adverts for painters and decorators were down more than 17%, while demand for roofers, plasterers, bricklayers and carpenters also fell. The Federation of Master Builders said the drop in adverts ""may be indicative of the overall cooling off of the market, following a 24-year-high in construction activity earlier in the year as lockdown restrictions eased"". Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, said: ""Small, local builders are also facing lengthy delays, with 89% having to press pause on work because of skills and materials shortages. ""These [REC] figures could suggest that builders are unwilling or unable to take on more work while skills and materials are running short, causing uncertainty when planning for new jobs.""

"A deal has been reached at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow after nearly two weeks of negotiations Boris Johnson calls it a ""big step forward"" but says there is a huge amount of work still to be done India and China asked for a crucial last minute-change to the agreement, calling for the ""phase-down"" not the ""phase-out"" of coal power Alok Sharma says it was important to get a deal done - but many countries voiced serious disappointment The deal is receiving a mixed reaction - Greenpeace says it keeps the 1.5C goal ""only just alive"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres meanwhile says: ""It's an important step but it's not enough"" The summit's overall goal was to chart a path to keep warming limited to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We are closing our coverage of the climate summit for today. Todayâs editors were
Lauren Turner, Tiffany Wertheimer and Kevin Ponniah. Our writers in London and Glasgow over a very long day were Georgina
Rannard, Matt Murphy, Becky Morton, Paul McLaren, Adam Durbin, Sam
Cabral, Dulcie Lee, Doug Faulkner and Mal Siret. After two long weeks of diplomatic back-and-forth, the Glasgow Climate Pact has been agreed. It has been labelled everything from historic and aggressive to fragile and disappointing. The measures are some of the strongest seen in the past 30 years of climate talks. Rich nations agreed to double the amount of cash they'll offer to vulnerable countries, and for the first time fossil fuels were mentioned in a COP agreement. But even if every government sticks to its promises, the world will still face a temperature rise of about 2C, which would lead to devastating impacts all over the globe. The overall consensus from delegates was that it was better to have an imperfect deal than no deal at all. Before we say goodbye - here are some of the most memorable moments from the past fortnight: Climate activist Greta Thunberg was mobbed as she arrived in Glasgow Day one started off with hundreds of people having to wait in long queues to get into the venue Former US President Barack Obama brought some star power to the summit, and called on young activists to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was pictured maskless and resting his eyes inside the hall And was his US counterpart, President Joe Biden, asleep or just resting his eyes? The Queen and other royals delivered powerful messages to the delegates Boris Johnson had to apologise to Israeli minister Karine Elharrar after she wasn't able to get into the venue in her wheelchair Thousands of climate activists protested in Glasgow - and cities around the world - during the summit China and the US issued a surprise joint statement vowing to boost climate co-operation There was a massive Earth hanging from the ceiling, which Greenpeace flew a ""not for sale"" banner up to on the last day, using helium balloons David ShukmanBBC News Science Editor, reporting from Glasgow Our science editor David Shukman has been reporting on climate change for nearly 20 years. This is his 10th COP summit - and here's his view on what we've seen agreed tonight: These conferences tend, at best, to produce incremental
progress not dramatic breakthroughs. And as US envoy John Kerry told me yesterday, this one was
never going to halt global warming on its own. So the hope is that agreeing to pick up the pace of climate
diplomacy, and packing the diary with more reviews and meetings, will make it
harder for governments to dodge the issue. Another hope is that the shame heaped on the richest nations for
failing to keep their word on climate aid to the poorest - together with new
arrangements - will lead to much-needed cash actually getting delivered. The initiatives by groups of countries on deforestation,
methane and fossil fuels do at least indicate a willingness to head in a new
direction, even if theyâre not verifiable. But is the goal of limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5C really
alive? Yes, if youâre really optimistic that the promises made here
will be kept and that the real world is embracing renewable energy, electric
cars and all the rest rapidly enough. As you can imagine, reaction is continuing to pour in to the Glasgow deal. EU leader Ursula von der Leyen has shared a statement on Twitter praising today's agreement as ""a step in the right direction"". She says that the deal ""sends a clear message time is up for fossil
fuel subsidies and unabated coal"". (That means coal produced without carbon capture technology.) ""If all long-term commitments announced in Glasgow will be
implemented, we should keep global warming under 2C,"" she adds. ""So we need to work further â so that next yearâs climate
conference in Egypt puts us firmly on track for 1.5C."" The difference between a world that warms by 2C instead of 1.5C in terms of climate impacts is significant. At the higher figure, many more people would face extreme heat, all coral reefs would be destroyed and flooding would be even worse. Allow Twitter content?

Asked how he will convince critics that the agreement represent urgent action, the US climate envoy says they should read it first, before saying it's a failure. ""The reality is that whatâs
happened here is significant,"" he says. ""Did I appreciate that we
had to adjust something tonight in an
unusual way? No,"" he adds, talking about the change to a line in the agreement about coal, which was pushed for by China and India. ""But you have to make tough decisions in this business sometimes."" US climate envoy John Kerry says the majority of the 20 largest economies in the world - which are responsible for 80% of emissions - are committed to reaching the 1.5C global warming target. He says Glasgow gives a clear blueprint for ""what we need to do"" from now until 2050. He admits some people ""may have wanted even stronger language"" but says the text that has been agreed to has the first ever mention of coal. Kerry goes on to say that this ""is the beginning of a 10-year sprint"". On the US-China agreement announced earlier in the week - which contained few concrete measures - he says it was announced ""with a view to producing a reduction in emissions"". ""We are the two largest economies in the world and we are going to work together to raise climate ambition in this decade,"" he says. There's been a lot of reporting on how India pushed for the language on coal to be weakened, but China was very strongly pushing for it behind the scenes, our reporters in Glasgow say. Helen BriggsEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow After a day of high emotion, tension and drama, at times,
the mood has lightened here. Thereâs a frenzy of activity as delegates spill out of the
plenary hall and journalists furiously file pieces to camera. Others are packing up their kit, knowing weâre meant to
leave within a few hours of the gavel falling for the last time. This slice of UN territory â for the fortnight the
conference lasted â is quickly being returned to Scottish soil. Staff are
cleaning, packing up boxes, and moving tables and chairs. On the way in this morning, everyone was taking pictures,
wondering if this would be the last day. Itâs hard to believe it is â and
that the Glasgow Climate Pact has finally become a reality. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst in Glasgow This outcome is good and bad. First the good: The measures taken are the strongest seen in 30 years of climate talks. Polluting nations agreed they hadnât done enough tocut emissions, and said theyâd do more over the next year. Rich nations also agreed todouble the amount of cashtheyâll offer for vulnerable countries to adapt to worsening weather. And after years of pressure theyâve accepted there should be a fund to actuallycompensate poor nationshit by extreme events. Fossil fuelswere mentioned too, for the first time at a COP, although India watered down the deal. There was also an innovation from the UK to seek separate agreements between governments, businesses and civil society onmethane, forests and innovation. The UK was also praised for itsdiplomacy. Thatâs the good news. The bad news is that if every government does everything it promises, the world will still face a catastrophic temperature rise of around 2C. This video can not be played COP26: 'Paris built the arena, Glasgow starts the race' - Kerry We're now hearing from US climate envoy John Kerry, hot on the heels of Alok Sharma. He says it was always unlikely that the summit in Glasgow would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"". âParis built build the arena, and Glasgow started the race.
Tonight the starting gun was fired,"" he says, referring to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. ""As a result of what took place here... nations that have
never considered having the word 'coal' in a plan... it's on the books â it's part
of the decision."" He adds that ""you have to phase-down coal before you can end coal"". ""This is the beginning of something,"" he says. When asked about the ""heartbreaking"" stories of poorer and island nations and how they are being affected by climate change, Sharma says he understands their disappointment with parts of the agreement. ""What was important was
to get a deal over the line, and that all the hard work... was not going to
dissipate,"" he says, defending the late compromises. Asked about the tense and seemingly fraught discussions in the summit's final hours, Sharma declines to go into detail about the back and forth that took place between negotiators. But he adds: ""Anyone who has seen footage of the conversations can make up their own minds about how I felt."" I'm sorry we couldn't hold the original language on coal, but nevertheless we do have language on coal and I think that is a start."" Alok Sharma, COP president In response to a question, Alok Sharma, who has led this summit, says he wishes the 11th hour watering down of the agreement on coal had not happened. But he says, ""we do have language on coal, on phase-down"" and that no-one would have thought that line would have been retained at all earlier in the summit. The line calling for the ""phase-down of unabated coal"" and an end to ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies is unprecedented in a COP agreement, experts say, even if it was weakened. Alok Sharma calls the agreement a ""fragile win"" and says that the hard work starts now. ""We have kept 1.5C alive â that was our overarching objective... But I would
still say that the pulse of 1.5C is weak."" He was asked about the moment he became emotional during the formal plenary. ""Iâve had about six hours
sleep in the last three days,"" he says, adding ""it is emotional, collectively
as a team we have achieved what many people doubted."" It's been a long, long day and the COP president is now facing the press. He says he's had six hours sleep in the last few days. Stay with us for updates. Georgina RannardBBC News Sohanur Rahman, 25, is a founding member of Bangladeshâs Friday for Future movement, leading youth activists in the country as they face the dire effects of rising sea levels and flooding. As the Glasgow agreement was gavelled, he told me that youth were recognised for the first time at COP, but âthe end result is nothingâ. He feels helpless and betrayed going back to Bangladesh with this agreement and says the ""empty pledges"" won't protect anyone from the climate crisis. He does not believe it will limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C, despite what politicians say. ""We have no scope to hold them accountable,"" he explains. He welcomes the good news on loss and damage - an acknowledgment from rich countries that poor nations need support paying for impacts of climate change they can't adapt to. But the voices of the most affected people were silenced, he says - âthe interest of the fossil fuel corporations have been clearly pandered to by the UK COP presidency.â This video can not be played COP26 deal changes 'a real blow' - Marshall Islands Tina Stege, climate envoy for Marshall Islands, has sent us her reaction to the deal. Her highly vulnerable Pacific Island country is at risk of being wiped out by climate change. She says last-minute changes to the wording on coal and the weakened language on loss and damage are ""blows"". There was a conversation we were not a part of and it was a real blow.. We had been told that there would be no further changes to the text and we had already swallowed some changes that were difficult to swallow."" Tina Stege But the ""real progress made"" in Glasgow is a ""lifeline"" for her country and it should not be discounted, she argues. Stege is pleased that money on climate finance was secured. And she says it's positive that countries are being called on to submit new targets to reduce emissions next year. Disappointment being expressed with the final pact is ""understandable"" after key issues were ""watered down in the final hours"", Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. However, the SNP politician adds there ""can be no doubt"" the negotiations in Glasgow have led to improvement on some key areas. While there has been much positive progress, there is no escaping the fact that COP26 has not delivered as much as global south countries, activists and campaigners rightly demanded and I firmly believe that the leaders of the rich developed countries must go further."" Nicola Sturgeon UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has posted a short statement on Twitter praising the deal reached by leaders in Glasgow - but says there is more work to be done.  We asked nations to come together for our planet at @COP26, and they have answered that call. I want to thank the leaders, negotiators and campaigners who made this pact happen â and the people of Glasgow who welcomed them with open arms.  I also want particularly to thank COP President Alok Sharma who has worked incredibly hard to bring countries together.  Today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5C.  I hope that we will look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change, and I will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal.""  While he may not be enthused with the deal, Shadow business minister  - and former Labour leader - Ed Miliband has nothing but praise for  Alok Sharma. He says Sharma, a Tory MP and minister of state at the cabinet office, has shown himself to be a ""person of decency, integrity and commitment"". Throughout the afternoon, the COP26 president has been seen flitting between various delegations, discussing the text and working to get the deal across the line. Allow Twitter content?

COP President Alok Sharma is still inside the conference hall, but he is expected to give a news conference when the official proceedings are done. The lectern is ready, flags and all, along with 100 journalists waiting for him outside the hall. India, along with China, pushed for the last-minute change to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal. But why? India - the world's third-largest emitter of fossil fuels - still relies heavily on coal, which makes up 70% of the country's energy production. A big part of their position can be summed up by comments from India's environment and climate minister Bhupender Yadav earlier. He asked how anyone could expect developing countries to make promises on phasing out coal when they have still to deal with their development agendas and eradicating poverty. On top of that, four million people are employed in India's coal industry - and in the last decade the country's coal consumption has nearly doubled. It  continues to import large quantities of coal and is planning to open dozens of new mines in the coming years despite pledges to invest massively in renewable energy. An average Indian still consumes far less power than a Brit or an American. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Prisons are facing difficulties recruiting enough officers amid a surge in job vacancies, a union has said. This comes as job adverts have soared to a record high in the run-up to Christmas, according to recruiters. Driving instructors, prison officers and forklift truck drivers are among the jobs in highest demand, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said. Meanwhile demand for construction roles dropped due to supply chain problems. How do I find a new job and who is hiring? UK job vacancies reach 20-year high Foreign drivers to be allowed more UK deliveries Prisons were among the employers with the most demand for staff in late October and early November, REC data suggested, with adverts for prison officer rising by 13%. The Prison Officers Association (POA) union said prisons are facing severe recruitment difficulties. ""Staff are voting with their feet and leaving"" after a recent pay review, said POA assistant general secretary Mick Pimblett. The prison service is ""close to breaking point"" in the run-up to Christmas, he added. The POA gave Berwyn prison in north Wales as an example - 134 prison officers have left over the past three months. There has been an increase in violence and self-harm among prisoners, and violence directed at prison officers, after coronavirus restrictions on prisoners mixing were lifted, said Mr Pimblett. Due to crown courts processing cases again after postponements from coronavirus lockdowns and people being convicted, the number of prisoners is reaching capacity, putting more strain on the system, he added. A HM Prison Service spokeswoman said: ""Vacancies across the estate have been stable for six months and these figures include recruitment to our brand new prison, HMP Five Wells, which will open in the new year."" In October, the HM Prison Service announcedthat all staff earning less than Â£24,000 will receive a Â£250 pay rise, and all staff yet to reach the top of their pay band will continue to receive progression pay of up to 5%. Vacancies for driving instructors saw the biggest jump, the REC data suggested, rising by about a third. An REC spokesman said that pent-up demand from the pandemic for driving lessons and tests was likely to be behind the rise. Karen Bransgrove, general manager of the Driving Instructors Association (DIA), said she had not noticed more adverts, but there was a lot of demand for tests and lessons. ""There is a huge backlog of tests,"" she said, adding that people could not learn to drive for 18 months during the pandemic so ""naturally there's pent-up demand"". She added that the number of instructors had also fallen. ""Lots of people took early retirement or dropped out [of driving instruction] due to the pandemic,"" Ms Bransgrove said. Loveday Ryder, chief executive of the Driver Vehicle and Standards Agency (DVSA) said it was doing ""all we can"" to provide as many tests as possible services get back to normal. ""I know learners will be keen to take their test now, but it is important that candidates are properly prepared and don't rush to take it,"" she said. ""With more than half of candidates failing, and demand currently extremely high for tests, learners should only take their test only when they are confident they can pass."" This would prevent a further backlog of tests and lengthy waits for retests. The REC figures also suggested a sharp rise in vacancies for forklift truck drivers. There is a chronic shortage of HGV drivers in the UK, which the logistics industry has blamed on factors including Covid and Brexit. There is also a shortage of forklift truck drivers, which the UK Warehousing Association said was also linked to Brexit. Clare Bottle, the association's chief executive, said that prior to Brexit, 34% of forklift truck drivers were EU nationals, but now many had gone back to their home countries. Driver pay went up between 20-30% because of the labour shortages that followed, she said, which was unsustainable for warehousing businesses, the majority of which were small to medium-sized. These businesses were already operating on thin margins, with 60-70% of costs already taken up by staffing. In the short term, those businesses had put prices up for their retailer customers to survive, but Ms Bottle said those price rises could ultimately be passed onto consumers, adding to inflationary pressures. How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? Lorry driver shortage: Government to lift rules on foreign haulier deliveries In the longer term, the industry needed to attract more younger people and women, she said. Ms Bottle added that warehousing was ""dominated"" by older people, mainly men: ""We've got an image problem that we need to tackle."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are closely monitoring labour supply and working with sector leaders to understand how we can best ease particular pinch points. Similar challenges are being faced by other countries around the world. ""We want to see employers make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad. Our Plan for Jobs is helping people across the country retrain, build new skills and get back into work. ""The government encourages all sectors to make employment more attractive to UK domestic workers through offering training, careers options, wage increases and investment."" Job adverts surged in many parts of the country between 25 October and 7 November, the REC data suggested, but in some sectors there was a sharp fall in demand. During the pandemic the UK construction industry has boomed, driven by factors including more house sales during the stamp duty holiday and an increased appetite for home improvements. But Covid has also seen a global squeeze on supply chains, with the costs of building materials rising rapidly. The REC's chief executive Neil Carberry said adverts for construction jobs saw a drop-off last week as supply issues ""constrained the industry's ability to work to capacity"". Adverts for painters and decorators were down more than 17%, while demand for roofers, plasterers, bricklayers and carpenters also fell. The Federation of Master Builders said the drop in adverts ""may be indicative of the overall cooling off of the market, following a 24-year-high in construction activity earlier in the year as lockdown restrictions eased"". Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, said: ""Small, local builders are also facing lengthy delays, with 89% having to press pause on work because of skills and materials shortages. ""These [REC] figures could suggest that builders are unwilling or unable to take on more work while skills and materials are running short, causing uncertainty when planning for new jobs.""

"Youth climate activists made a human corridor at the start of the COP26 closing plenaries on Thursday The COP26 climate summit in Glasgow is entering its final day, amid growing fears that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C is unlikely to be met. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres bluntly told the Associated Press news agency that goal was on ""life support"". He said the summit would probably not see governments make the pledges needed to cut CO2 emissions by enough. Earlier, COP26 President Alok Sharma warned that time was running out to close a deal before the summit ended. Scientists say limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C will help humanity avoid the worst climate impacts. This is compared with pre-industrial temperatures. At Paris in 2015, world leaders pledged to try to keep the world from warming by more than between 1.5C to 2C through sweeping greenhouse gas emissions cuts. Latest projections are for a rise of 2.7C. Mr Guterres warned that promises to reduce emissions were meaningless while governments continued to invest in fossil fuels. ""Promises ring hollow when the fossil fuels industry still receives trillions in subsidies,"" he said. He called the announcements made so far in Glasgow ""far from enough"", adding: ""We know what must be done."" But he said hope remained ""until the last moment"". âWe have 24 hours to go' What's been agreed at COP26 so far? Meanwhile, Mr Sharma called on negotiators to find solutions to difficult issues before the official closing of the summit scheduled for 18:00 GMT. ""Whilst the window on keeping 1.5 within reach is closing, it is still possible to get there,"" he said. Mr Sharma also said more work was needed on Article 6, which is about carbon markets and how countries balance their fossil fuel use. Mary Robinson, former Irish president and head of a group of senior political leaders on climate, accused some of the world's major carbon emitters of sabotaging any attempts to secure a more ambitious action-plan at COP26. She told the Associated Press that Russia and Saudi Arabia were ""pushing back hard"" to block any mention in the final deal out of Glasgow of working to phase out coal, or to reduce government subsidies to fossil fuels.

"Many vulnerable people need regular visits from carers in order to be able to live in their own homes Health minister Robin Swann is finalising proposals to improve pay for social care staff in Northern Ireland. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said officials have been in discussion with employers and a decision was due ""in the very near future"". Concern has been growing about a shortage of staff in the sector. Some domiciliary care companies have had to withdraw services as they struggle to recruit. The spokesperson said: ""The department can confirm that discussions have been ongoing in respect of funding for remuneration of staff in the domiciliary care and the wider social care sector and that proposals are being finalised. ""Notwithstanding ongoing budgetary pressures, the minister intends to announce his decision in the very near future. ""In developing these proposals, we have had constructive engagement with social care employers with the shared objective of improving terms and conditions for employees."" At present, about 75% of home care in Northern Ireland is provided by the independent sector. On Thursday, Dr Bob Brown of the Western Health and Social Care Trust told councillors in Londonderry the domiciliary care sector was struggling to recruit and retain staff. He said an additional Â£2 per hour could have a ""significant impact"". Dr Brown, the trust's director of care and older people's services, told the council's health committee the department has been working with the trust ""to identify ways this winter to incentivise domiciliary care"". Dr Bob Brown said the trust has ""made its case to the department"" ""Terms and conditions are a key issue,"" Dr Brown said. He added: ""There has been some calculations that indicate, that assuming an increase in the hourly rate gets straight into the carers' hands rather than the provider's hands, it could have a very significant impact on recruitment, even a Â£2 per hour increase."" Carer shortage leaves Greysteel woman 'stuck in hospital' The Western Trust said that proposals on domiciliary care staff pay ""are under active consideration"". ""To clarify, these are not Western Trust proposals but NI-wide proposals led by the minister and department,"" the trust said, in a statement. ""They form part of a package of measures being finalised to support the domiciliary care sector through this winter. ""In addition, proposals for the longer-term reform of adult social care will shortly be the subject of a public consultation launched by the minister. ""The consultation will include the vital issue of properly rewarding and recognising social care staff - which the minister has made clear is a priority for him."" About 1,600 people across Northern Ireland have been assessed as needing a care package - that is they need help with washing, dressing or cooking, or adaptations to their home. Many are waiting in hospitals or care homes because there is not enough home-based carers to provide the level of care they require. Domiciliary or home care packages allow those who are ill or vulnerable to be cared for in their own house. But, according to the Northern Trust, some independent providers have raised concerns about the sustainability of their service as they do not have enough staff. The trust said the problem is particularly acute in the Mid Ulster area with concerns also emerging in Causeway area too. While it is mostly the independent sector that is affected, BBC News NI understands that the trust's own service is experiencing challenges which may mean reducing the number of calls. Figures from the Department of Health show that as of October the number of people waiting for a care package, many of whom are in care homes, has dropped to 1,657. That includes: 410 people - Belfast Health Trust 402 people - Northern Health Trust 280 people - Southern Health Trust 424 people - South Eastern Health Trust 141 people - Western Health Trust BBC News NI understands that many front-line care staff feel the number waiting on care packages could be much higher.

"MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ says he is hopeful the two sides can make progress The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has welcomed what he says is ""a changing tone of discussion"" in talks about theNorthern Ireland Protocol. MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ was talking after a meeting in London with Lord Frost. Mr Å efÄoviÄ said he was hopeful the two sides could make progress on the supply of medicines next week. Meanwhile, Lord Frost said there were still ""significant gaps"" to be bridged between the bloc and the UK, and that talks would be ""intensified"". The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. What is Article 16 and why does it matter? Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem Suspension of NI-EU deal 'may be only option' That means that goods can flow freely between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, removing the threat of a ""hard border"". However, goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control - amounting to what is being referred to as an ""Irish Sea border"". The UK wants fundamental changes to the operation and governance of the protocol. Lord Frost says triggering Article 16 could be the ""only option"" The EU has proposed a package of measures which would reduce its practical impact. Mr Å efÄoviÄ said there would still need to be a ""reciprocal"" move from the UK. He added: ""We need to make serious headway in the course of next week. ""This is particularly important as regards the issue of medicines. I stand by my commitment to do whatever it takes to address this issue in line with what industry tells us."" He said agreement in this area could be a ""blueprint"" for reaching a wider deal"". In a statement, a UK government spokesperson said the preference ""remained to find a consensual way forward"", but that Article 16 was a ""legitimate safeguard"". ""Lord Frost also underlined the need to address the full range of issues the UK had identified in the course of discussions, if a comprehensive and durable solution was to be found that supported the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and was in the best interests of Northern Ireland. ""In this context, although talks had so far been conducted in a constructive spirit, Lord Frost underlined that in order to make progress, it was important to bring new energy and impetus to discussions."" The spokesperson said next week's talks would be ""intensified"". Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the UK government needed to take ""decisive action within weeks"". He added: ""It is essential that either the government gets agreement with the EU, and in the absence of such an agreement that it does move to trigger Article 16."" The protocol means Northern Ireland is still in the EU's pharmaceutical regulatory system. However it continues to get most of its medicines from Great Britain which is outside the EU's system. This is creating potential supply complications which have lead some firms in GB to indicate they will stop supplying products to NI. Nothing has changed so far as a ""grace period"" means the protocol is not yet being implemented for medicines. The EU's acknowledges that as it stands the protocol creates too much of a burden in this area and should be changed. In October it publishedproposals to tackle the difficulties, which will include changing EU law. If the protocol is causing serious difficulties either side can unilaterally suspend the relevant parts of it by using the Article 16 safeguards clause. However, UK ministers have said such a move is not imminent. What is Article 16 and why does it matter? What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

"Thousands of migrants converged on the Poland-Belarus border on Monday ""I swear to God, guys, gathering is the best thing."" With winter approaching and frustrations rising in the forests of western Belarus, the word went out among thousands of desperate would-be migrants. The best way to get to Poland, the messages said, was to try going en masse, rather than in furtive groups, creeping through the forest, hoping to cross into the European Union (EU) unnoticed. ""All immigrants go to this site,"" the messages said, complete with images of the Azs-16 Belorusneft petrol station, just over 1.6km (one mile) from the border. ""Many immigrants here."" And so, last Monday, thousands of migrants converged on the petrol station close to the Belarusian village of Bruzgi and started walking to the nearby border. Their target area was a crossing at Kuznica, where they believed they could enter Poland, hopefully unimpeded. One Telegram message included a map that showed the meeting point The crowd was mostly made up of Iraqi Kurds, escaping political and economic hardships at home in the hope of finding better lives in the EU. Videos from Monday show Belarusian soldiers standing by, unwilling or unable to stop the crowd reaching the border. This video can not be played Watch: Video shows hundreds of migrants at Belarus' border with Poland The country's authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, stands accused by the EU of orchestrating this entire crisis, which has been building since the summer. His neighbours call it a form of ""hybrid warfare"" against the EU, waged in revenge for successive waves of sanctions against his repressive regime. The lives entangled in the Poland-Belarus crisis How Belarus is helping âtouristsâ break into the EU The many routes taken by migrants to Belarus It's a charge he denies, despite warning, back in May, that he would no longer attempt to stop migrants and drugs passing into Europe. But while there is now ample evidence that the Lukashenko regime has encouraged tens of thousands of migrants to fly to Minsk and then pointed them in the direction of the borders with Lithuania and Poland, it's clear that social media is playing a significant role in shaping the actions of the migrants. Links to co-ordinates on Google Maps were shared widely On Monday, Poland accused Belarus of sending a large group of migrants to breach the border, calling it a major provocation. But it appears the mass move to a single crossing point may have been orchestrated by the migrants themselves, not the Belarusian authorities. Over a period of several days from late last week, Kurdish Telegram and Facebook groups with thousands of members were full of messages, telling migrants to head for a single location, with a specific purpose in mind. ""The convoy of hope stands here on the map, marked with a red balloon,"" read one message, repeated several times in a group called Iraqi Immigrants. ""Tomorrow at 9:30 behind the station all be ready for a few hours then leave,"" read another. ""Please join. It's the only solution."" Some Kurdish Facebook pages spread news of the meeting on 7 November Migrants and family members contacted by the BBC say that the convoy consisted of some who travelled directly from the Belarusian capital, Minsk, but also large numbers who had been trapped in the nearby forest for days, unable to find a way across the border. Shwan Kurd, a 33-year-old from Iraq, was among those who were already in the forest. He witnessed Monday's rush to the border but didn't know if it was planned. ""Everyone came to one place,"" he said. ""Maybe people came because of the social media posts."" A large crowd, they reckoned, would be impossible to ignore. ""For those in Belarus,"" another Telegram message read, ""thousands of people have gathered to create a mass influx."" Messages told migrants to go to a particular location The migrants have an eye on past precedent. ""The refugees said 'let's repeat 2015',"" Barwa Nusreddine Ahmed told me from his home in the northern Iraqi city of Sulaymaniyah. From there, he's closely following the progress of his brother, who's travelling with his pregnant wife and three children. In 2015-16, hundreds of thousands of migrants poured into Europe from Turkey, triggering a major crisis. There were dramatic scenes as desperate people pushed their way through the Greek-Macedonian border. Europe's migrant crisis: The year that changed a continent The German chancellor, Angela Merkel's decision to open Germany's doors contributed to the stampede and won the fierce admiration of migrants. The gesture has not been forgotten, and those flooding into Belarus this year hope, even believe, that the gesture will be repeated. ""They said we must do that thing again, so the world will see us,"" Mr Ahmed said. ""The refugees sayâ¦ we want to show the world how many people we are. Everybody is waiting for Germany to take action."" But the historical parallels don't stop there. Germany has been the primary destination country for migrants heading to Europe The Kurds, as a stateless and frequently persecuted people, have not failed to notice that 2021 marks a grim anniversary. In 1991, 1.5 million Kurds fled Iraq into neighbouring countries as former President Saddam Hussein sought to punish them for rising up in the wake of that year's Gulf War. It was an epic, harrowing struggle, as desperate refugees fled through the mountains in appalling conditions. In recent days, social media posts have noted the 30th anniversary of this traumatic event, and made explicit parallels with what is happening now. ""It's not something new to the Kurds,"" Mr Ahmed said.
