"Phelan's side lost 3-1 at West Brom on Monday after leading 1-0 Premier League strugglers Hull City have sacked head coach Mike Phelan. Phelan, 54, took over as caretaker manager following Steve Bruce's departure in the summer, becoming a permanent appointment in October. But with City in the relegation zone, picking up three points from their last nine games, the club announced they had ""parted company"" with Phelan. Hull said they were already searching for a replacement, with an announcement to be made ""in due course"". Phelan made a promising start to his Hull City career, winning the manager of the month award for August, but the Tigers' last league win was on 6 November, a 2-1 victory over Southampton. Swansea'svictory over Crystal Palaceon Tuesday night sent Hull to the bottom of the table, three points from safety. Former Manchester United assistant Phelan was in charge of the club for just 85 days as a manager, plus 81 days as caretaker boss. Assistant Neil McDonald, goalkeeping coach Bobby Mimms and chief scout Stan Ternent have also left the club. On Twitter, the club said: ""We would like to thank Mike for his efforts both as assistant manager and head coach over the last two years."" This video can not be played 'Basic' errors annoy Hull boss Phelan Phelan's last game in charge was a 3-1 defeat by West Brom on New Year's Eve. City were leading 1-0 at half-time but collapsed in the second half, falling to a fifth defeat in seven games. Hull will next play fellow strugglers Swansea in the FA Cup third round before taking on Manchester United in the first leg of the EFL Cup semi-finals on 10 January. It has been a tumultuous season for the club, which isup for sale.In July, Bruceleft as managerafter gaining promotion to the Premier League with a breakdown in his relationship with vice-chairman Ehab Allam contributing to his departure. At the beginning of the season injuries had left the Tigers with only 13 fit senior players although Phelan, while in temporary charge, did begin the campaign with successive league wins. Victories have been harder to come by since September, however, and with fellow strugglers Swansea and Crystal Palace sacking their managers over Christmas, Phelan paid the price as newly promoted Hull attempt to maintain their Premier League status. Stoke manager Mark Hughes, whose teambeat Watford 2-0on Tuesday, said: ""Mike got the job under difficult circumstances and I thought recent performances had markedly improved, so it showed he was having an impact. ""He's a great football guy, but that's the Premier League for you - it's ruthless and sometimes, at this time of year, owners get panicky."" BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty The dash to avoid the drop from the Premier League has claimed another victim with Hull City's sacking of Mike Phelan. Phelan has gone the same way as Alan Pardew at Crystal Palace and Bob Bradley at Swansea City as further evidence that patience simply does not - indeed some clubs feel it cannot - exist when the threat of relegation looms. And yet here is a manager who took his time to accept the Hull job when contenders were hardly queuing outside the door of the KC Stadium and after being named Premier League manager of the month in August. Phelan has also guided Hull to the EFL Cup semi-final against his former club Manchester United but this has simply not figured in the club's calculations when weighed against the fact they are bottom of the table with only 13 points from 20 games. Phelan has hardly had massive backing in the transfer market and in many games Hull actually played well without getting points on the board. This has ultimately cost him his job. The Tigers now need to choose carefully and see if they can find a way to back a new manager in the January market - with former Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett the name being mentioned after Phelan's departure. Premier League management is a brutal business but there must still be a large measure of sympathy for Phelan after taking on a task which plenty thought was a thankless one.

"Result: Bournemouth 3-3 Arsenal Arsenal come from 3-0 down to earn a point Gunners score three times in final 20 minutes Bournemouth's Francis sent off late on Result: Palace 1-2 Swansea - Rangel scores late winner Result: Stoke 2-0 Watford - Shawcross & Crouch Tom Rostance And that is that from us for another action-packed evening. See you tomorrow for Spurs v Chelsea? Go on then.Â Big Sam will be hitting the phones tomorrow, looking for a flat south of the river and two wingers. Sam Allardyce also says it is critical that his club get into the transfer market as he is losing Wilfried Zaha and Bakary Sako to the Africa Cup of Nations.Â Crystal Palace 1-2 Swansea Crystal Palace Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: ""It's easily identified, the lack of energy the players had showed massively. We struggled to keep up with Swansea, we hadn't recovered properly. ""I should have made more changes bu I still don't know the squad too well. ""The second half was ours, we saw a wonder goal from Wilfried Zaha that should have got us at least a point. But we switched off and it's massively disappointing. ""You can see it with your own eyes, you don't need to be a football manager. Some people say it's rubbish but it's not, the players were trying 100% but they were not physically able to reach their usual levels. They are shattered. ""It's beyond our control, certain elements. But we can defend better for the two goals and our first-half performance was nothing like I expect to see from my team."" Crystal Palace 1-2 Swansea Crystal Palace Crystal Palace defender Damien Delaney is told that Sam Allardyce blamed the defeat on the fact Swansea had an extra day's recovery: ""It's possible but as a player at this level you should be fit enough."" Stoke 2-0 Watford Watford Watford head coach Walter Mazzarri:âWe played well, but two episodes, two mistakes, and they managed to score goals. We could have scored before them and we didnât do it, but we demonstrated we can play against a difficult team like Stoke. âWe have to keep going and give everything for the next match. Nothing is going our way, so it is just a period we are not lucky but we need to change this. âWe have many injuries, so it is not a positive period."" Crystal Palace 1-2 Swansea Swansea City Swansea first-team coachAlan Curtis,who picked the team that beat Crystal Palace 2-1, said: ""It is a terrific result for us and a huge three points. The first half performance, we were excellent and we could have gone in with more than the one goal. ""We have been accused of lacking character but we came back and won it and I thought we deserved it. In training you can see the players have the ability, it is just the confidence that has been lacking. We deserved some luck today. ""Any team under Sam Allardyce will come on strongly, they have some terrific players. We had 24 hours more rest compared to them and that may have made a difference."" Â On the club's new manager Paul Clement, who joined Curtis in the technical area later in the match, Curtis added:""He came down for some moral support, he made his presence felt at half-time, but there was not too much to say. We would have surprised a lot of people with our performance today."" Crystal Palace 1-2 Swansea Crystal Palace Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: ""What went wrong? Not enough recovery time, no doubt about that. the energy of the players just couldn't get us in the faces of Swansea, they had an extra day and that told. You could see that. ""Our lads put so much in against Arsenal and you saw the effects of that. It wasn't an even playing field.Â ""It's difficult to take. We have all the science we have, we know the fatigue levels and the high intensity runs the players make and we knew they wouldn't be able to make them tonight. And they couldn't. Perhaps I picked the wrong side, I should have changed four or five. ""Whether you're tired or not you have to play and I told them that at half time. I was baffled with our first-half display, we were lumping the ball to Christian Benteke and who told them to do that? They were confused. ""It was a blatant penalty on Christian Benteke, outrageous that it wasn't given. That would have been a great lift."" Stoke 2-0 Watford Stoke City Stoke City manager Mark Hughes:Â ""We have played better and been beaten in recent weeks, we got goals at good times and then saw the game out quite comfortably. ""We didn't really have to deal with too many moments of anxiety. It's good to get a clean sheet, because we have shipped some poor goals in recent weeks.""Â On Peter Crouch being offered a new deal:""Peter has been playing really well and if you put balls in the right areas you know he is going to get on the end of things.Â ""He's done very well and has good support. I am sure we will get something done - he is playing as well as he ever has done.""Â #bbcfootball Jon Evans:Â Gary Rowett shouldn't rush into a job. No way Hull is the best career move for him. Meurig Jones:Given that Chelsea have only lost 8 points so far this season, this game has finished Arsenal. Only Liverpool can catch them. Antonio:We have the Wenger trifecta: Crystal Palace 1-2 Swansea Swansea caretaker manager/coach Alan Curtis has nearly lost his voice but he says his side deserved the win tonight. Full reaction to come.Â It's been a good few weeks for Chelsea hasn't it? Bournemouth 3-3 Arsenal Arsenal Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, speaking to the BBC:âAt the start we suffered from the quality of Bournemouth. One team had over three days to recover and on top of that we suffered at the back. It was a physical test but we came back into the game and mentally it was a test and we showed we are mentally strong. I am happy to play every day but only if our opponent has done the same. âWe want to win the game and we wanted three points but on the other hand some big teams have dropped points here and when youâre 3-0 down you have to acknowledge the qualify of the response of your team. I have mixed feelings but I must recognise my team has shown great mental strength.â On refereeing decisions (Arsenal conceded a penalty for a foul by Granit Xhaka, while Ryan Fraserâs goal came after he appeared to push Hector Bellerin):âIt is no penalty, or if it is then itâs a foul [on Bellerin]. The push from Xhaka was much less strong than the push for the goal.â What a difference three points make. Swansea are on the move.Â Hull City 'An absolute disgrace' says a Hull fan on 5 live reacting to the sacking of Mike Phelan. It looks very harsh from the outside doesn't it? Although it is a results business.Â Bournemouth 3-3 Arsenal Bournemouth Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: ""Fate conspired against us in several ways. I didnât think it was a sending off. I thought that was harsh but in the end the quality of their players showed. ""The emotion is one of disappointment but we canât forget what the players did in the first half of that game. ""Sometimes you get lost because youâre working every day but we have to remember how far weâve come and what weâre doing and at what level. But weâre here to win which is why this hurts so much."" #bbcfootball Jon Batham:Sacking of Mike Phelan by Hull City a farce. Given resources he's done well to keep in contact. What did Hull owners expect? Craig Reeves:Can't help but wonder what#HullCity,externalexpected of Mike Phelan, as they approach a League Cup semi-final with Man U next week. Jack:What a improved performance from the Swans. Desire, effort and resilience. Was Bob the problem? Come on the Swans!!!!Â   #bbcfootball Ope Mosuro: Chelsea must be loving these new year fixtures, first Liverpool and now Arsenal dropped points in winnable games Paul Murphy:Get promoted. Don't spend money on quality players. Sack manager. Yep, I can see your logic@HullCity,external Vincent Wood: Some people will tell you, ""you cannot love & hate the same thing at the same time."" Those people have never supported Arsenal Bournemouth 3-3 Arsenal Arsenal Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:""They started much faster and with 20 minutes to go we were 3-0 down so thatâs a mental test. We refused to lose the game. ""Bournemouth deserve a lot of credit but the disadvantage is too big to play against a team with three and a half days recovery. Thatâs too big a handicap. But they are a good team with quality and they played with pace. ""We had some players at half time who had problems. I changed it early in the second half and I believe we refused to lose. Thereâs a great resilience in the team and we saw that today. ""We dropped two points but we have to do better in the other games and hope other teams will drop points. ""It was not a result we wanted before the game but at 3-0 down weâd have signed for 3-3.Â  We were unlucky in some decisions tonight."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Christmas special saw the team of midwives relocate to South Africa Call the Midwife was the most-watched programme on Christmas Day - but audiences on 25 December fell to their lowest level on record, figures show. The historical drama attracted an audience of 9.2 million. It is the smallest number of viewers for Christmas Day's top show since the current ratings system began in 1981. Mrs Brown's Boys got nine million viewers, the Strictly Come Dancing special had 8.9 million and The Great Christmas Bake Off had 8.2 million. Data from those watching on-demand services on smartphones and computers is not included in the figures, from research body Barb. Call the Midwife fans saw the nuns and nurses from Nonnatus House travel to South Africa in a bid to prevent a hospital from closing down. Heidi Thomas, creator and writer of the Call the Midwife, said: ""We are always so proud to be part of BBC One's Christmas Day schedule, and absolutely delighted that so many people joined us. ""At this special time of year it really feels as though the cast, crew and audience of Call The Midwife are one big family, and we can't wait to share series six with everyone."" The new series returns to BBC One later this month. The Queen's Christmas Message was in the top 10 BBC One had eight of the 10 most-watched programmes on 25 December, while ITV had two. ITV soap Coronation Street drew 8.1 million viewers, while Emmerdale pulled in 6.2 million. The other top 10 programmes for Christmas Day were Doctor Who, EastEnders, The Queen's Christmas Message and Disney film Frozen. Audiences for Christmas Day - which traditionally attracts big audiences - have been falling in recent years with the introduction of catch-up and on-demand services. No programme has attracted more than 20 million viewers since 2001, and the figure of 15 million has not been achieved since 2008. Call The Midwife's 9.2 million is just over half the number who watched Wallace And Gromit: A Matter Of Loaf And Death in 2008 (16.2 million). The single biggest Christmas Day TV audience was recorded in 1989 when 21.8 million watched the UK premiere of the film Crocodile Dundee. The average Christmas Day audience this decade is 11.1 million. In the 1980s, it was 18.5 million.

"The cost of annual season tickets has increased by 1.9%, analysis by the BBC England Data Unit found Commuters in some parts of England will be worse off than others from rail fare rises, which were called a""kick in the teeth""by critics. In some areas there was no increase in annual season ticket prices, despite wage growth. Others have seen their annual fares rise despite average pay having fallen. Across the UK rail fares of all types - from season tickets to single journeys - increased by an average of 2.3% on the first weekday of the new year. Analysis by the BBC England Data Unit found annual season tickets had increased in cost by 1.9%, while median take-home pay had increased by 2%. The government said wages were growing faster than regulated fares, which include season tickets. Passengers commuting to Manchester with the most popular annual season tickets saw no increase at all, while the median take-home wage increased 2.8%. Annual passes from East Didsbury, Macclesfield, Stockport, Altrincham, Wilmslow, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne, Bolton, Glossop and Knutsford are all the same price as they were before the increase. Yet commuters in Liverpool will pay 1.9% more for an annual pass. This is despite median wages having fallen, according to theOffice for National Statistics,external. For more stories from the BBC England Data Unit follow our Pinterest board,external. Someone travelling from Runcorn to Liverpool would pay Â£1,532 for their annual pass, Â£28 more than in 2016. In Liverpool the average full-time wage, after tax and National Insurance deductions, fell from Â£21,901 in 2015 to Â£21,634 in 2016. The most expensive annual season ticket per mile travelled is Harlow Town to London Liverpool Street. A commuter pays Â£3,496, which is Â£64 more than in 2016. It works out at 39p per mile travelled. The figures are based on a Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) list of the most commonly used commuter services in six major cities. Our analysis of the figures was based on full-time workers using an annual season ticket five days a week, except on bank holidays or on 25 days of annual leave. Get the data here,external Lianna Etkind, public transport campaigner at the CBT, said: ""Wages remain stagnant and trains continue to be hopelessly overcrowded, so commuters are rightly angry at annual fare rises when they see little or no improvement in the service they receive. ""Many commuters are now being charged at a similar level to a premium rate phone number for their season tickets and are left feeling equally as fleeced. ""It's high time the government introduced a fairer ticketing system that actively encouraged rail travel, not penalised people for choosing to take the train."" According to the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, about 97p in every pound paid by passengers goes back into running and improving services. RDG chief executive Paul Plummer said: ""Money from fares is helping to sustain investment in the longer, newer trains and more punctual journeys that passengers want."" The Department for Transport said it had saved commuters money by capping season ticket increases so they are in line with inflation. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""Thanks to action by the government on train ticket prices, wages are growing faster than regulated fares."" Northern Rail, which runs commuter services into Manchester, confirmed it had not increased annual season ticket fares but said other prices had risen. It declined to comment further.

"The claim:The government will not be able to achieve the manifesto commitment to build 200,000 starter homes by 2020. Reality Check verdict:It currently seems unlikely because money has only been set aside for 60,000 starter homes. Also, the current plan is for 22% of new developments to be starter homes, which would mean one million suitable homes being built by 2020 - that would be a significant acceleration of house building. The government announced on Tuesday that it hadgiven the go-ahead,externalfor the construction of thousands of starter homes. Starter homes are new homes built for first-time buyers between 23 and 40 years old, sold at least 20% below market value. The maximum price after the discount has been applied is Â£250,000 outside London and Â£450,000 in the capital. The Conservatives made a commitment in theirmanifesto for the 2015 general election,externalto build 200,000 starter homes - the pledge to do so by 2020 was repeated in thecall for expressions of interest,externalin building starter homes that was released last March. On BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday, shadow housing minister John Healey said: ""They've promised by 2020 to build 200,000 of them, which no-one believes is possible."" The document from March talked about Â£2.3bn of funding from the 2015 Spending Review to support up to 60,000 starter homes, which would still leave the government well short of the target. The government is not talking a great deal about starter homes at the moment, promising more details of how it will deliver them in the housing White Paper, which is due later this month. The funding for the programme is supposed to pay for things like local authorities making brownfield sites suitable for residential development. At the moment, the government wants to use the planning system to get affordable housing built. Essentially, developers will have to agree that of every five homes they build, one will have to be a starter home. In a recent consultation,externalthe government said under the new system at least 22% of all new builds would be starter homes. That means almost one million new homes would have to be built by 2020 to hit the government's 200,000 target. In 2015, there were a total of 170,730 new homes built, which would not be enough over three years, even if all of them gave 22% as starter homes. But perhaps the May government will drop the commitment made under David Cameron or there will be another route to the creation of starter homes in the forthcoming White Paper.

"Mr Trump has previously said he would be happy to meet Kim Jong-un for a burger Donald Trump often tweets several times a day but doesn't dwell on policy issues and rarely speaks to the press. So his 140-character messages are the main insight we have into the thinking of the US president-elect. But what can they tell us about how his new administration will deal with the world? Mr Trump rubbished North Korea's claimto be developing missiles capable of striking the US, tweeting ""it won't happen"" on Monday at 15:05 EST (20:05 GMT). It's not particularly clear. It could indicate that Mr Trump believes that North Korea will not be able to develop the technology necessary. Or he may think the country's government will collapse, or that the new US administration will be able to persuade North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un to give up his nuclear programme. The BBC's Stephen Evans, in Seoul, says the South Korean government has interpreted the tweet as a warning to Mr Kim that the US will stop such a development from happening, either by military action or by disruptive covert operations. But with the tweet so ambiguous, it is open to many alternative interpretations too. North Korea is isolated from most of the world but backed by neighbour China The US president-elect has previously called Mr Kim a ""bad dude"", but he has also said he would be willing to speak to him over a burger (such a meeting would be a significant change of US policy towards North Korea). In an interview in May, Mr Trump said the isolated state's main backer - China - needed to take action to ease tensions. ""China can solve that problem with one meeting or one phone call,"" he told Reuters. And in a follow-uptweet,externalon Monday, Mr Trump said: ""China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!"" How might Trump deal with Kim Jong-un? The US has long aimed to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear programme, using a mixture of aid and sanctions,although in October the national intelligence director James Clapper said this was ""probably a lost cause"". In March 2016President Obama imposed new sanctions on North Koreaafter it carried out a nuclear test and a satellite launch. The White House spokesman said: ""We will continue to impose costs on North Korea until it comes into compliance with its international obligations."" The United Nations Security Council has also imposed sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear programme. How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme?

"Theresa May's year ahead is likely to be dominated by the process of the UK leaving the EU It's not hard to identify the issue that is likely to dominate 2017 for Theresa May and her Conservative government: in the absence of a bolt from the blue it will be Brexit, Brexit and more Brexit. The prime minister's announcement at her party conference that the government would trigger Article 50 by the end of March, setting in motion the process of leaving the EU, ensured it would remain at the top of the agenda. Mrs May has said she will set out more of the government's Brexit plans in a speech to be made in the new year. We don't know how much detail she will give, but her audience will be expecting something beyond the gnomic utterances that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and that she wants a ""red, white and blue Brexit"". MPs will get some sort of vote before Article 50 is triggered but the exact process won't be known until after the Supreme Court issues its judgement on whether Parliament must have a formal constitutional role. MPs won't block Article 50 but that doesn't mean the government will have an easy ride - either in March, or further ahead. Perhaps nobody knows this better than the Brexit Secretary David Davis. He has worked the European beat before, as a whip during the passage through Parliament of the Maastricht Treaty in the 1990s. Then as now, a Conservative government with a small majority was faced with seeking Parliamentary approval for a controversial and difficult measure around Britain's relationship with the European Union. That though, is where the similarity ends. While with Maastricht it was the Eurosceptics that were causing merry Hell, now it is likely to be diehard Remainers who will man any ""awkward squad"". Will the Three Brexiteers all still be in cabinet by the end of 2017? Of the ""Three Brexiteers"" at the top of government, Mr Davis has had the best write-ups so far for his command of the task at hand. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox have not slipped into their new roles so easily. Theresa May's relationship with Mr Johnson will be interesting to watch throughout 2017. She has seen fit to mock him and very publicly slap him down. It has been suggested that he is not happy about continuously being the butt of jokes, and the two of them are hardly natural bedfellows. Perhaps that's why bookmakers make Liam Fox and him the favourites to be the first minister to leave the Cabinet. Although Brexit will dominate, Theresa May has a broader agenda. In education, for example, the forced ""academisation"" of all schools is out and grammars are back in. She has also promised to develop a new industrial strategy to create ""an economy that works for everyone"". Again, her small majority in Parliament could put her at the mercy of awkward backbenchers. Former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan leads a group of MPs who could be prepared to block grammar schools. And some of the more free market-oriented Conservatives won't like policies that look like government meddling in business. There is one way that the prime minister could take arms against a sea of troubles. Despite saying she will stick to the planned 2020 date, the Fixed Terms Parliament Act allows for an early vote if two thirds of MPs back an early general election. Jeremy Corbyn says that Labour would support such a move so the numbers would be there. If Mrs May felt she was being stymied in her efforts to negotiate the best Brexit deal for Britain, she could change her mind and let the country issue its verdict.

"The Tuticorin zero-emissions plant to make soda ash Two world-leading clean energy projects have opened in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. A Â£3m industrial plant is capturing the CO2 emissions from a coal boiler and using the CO2 to make valuable chemicals. It is a world first. And just 100km away is the world's biggest solar farm, making power for 150,000 homes on a 10 sq km site. The industrial plant appears especially significant as it offers a breakthrough by capturing CO2 without subsidy. Built at a chemical plant in the port city of Tuticorin, it is projected to save 60,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year by incorporating them into the recipes for soda ash and other chemicals. Here's how it works: The plant operates a coal-fired boiler to make steam for its chemical operations. CO2 emissions from the boiler's chimney are stripped out by a fine mist of a new patented chemical. A stream of CO2 is fed into the chemicals plant as an ingredient for soda ash and other compounds with many uses, including the manufacturing of glass, detergents and sweeteners. The owner of the chemicals plant, Ramachadran Gopalan, told a BBC Radio 4 documentary: ""I am a businessman. I never thought about saving the planet. I needed a reliable stream of CO2, and this was the best way of getting it."" He says his operation has now almost zero emissions. He hopes soon to install a second coal boiler to make more CO2 to synthesise fertiliser. The chemical used in stripping the CO2 from the flue gas was invented by two young Indian chemists. They failed to raise Indian finance to develop it, but their firm, Carbonclean Solutions, working with the Institute of Chemical Technology at Mumbai and Imperial College in London, got backing from the UK's entrepreneur support scheme. Their technique uses a form of salt to bond with CO2 molecules in the boiler chimney. The firm says it is more efficient than typical amine compounds used for the purpose. The plant is projected to save 60,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year They say it also needs less energy, produces less alkaline waste and allows the use of a cheaper form of steel -  all radically reducing the cost of the whole operation. The firm admits its technology of Carbon Capture and Utilisation won't cure climate change, but says it may provide a useful contribution by gobbling up perhaps 5-10% of the world's emissions from coal. Lord Oxburgh, former chairman of Shell, and now director and head of the UK government's carbon capture advisory group, told the BBC: ""We have to do everything we can to reduce the harmful effects of burning fossil fuels and it is great news that more ways are being found of turning at least some of the CO2 into useful products."" Meanwhile, the nearby giant Kamuthi solar plant offers a marker for India's ambition for a rapid expansion in renewables. The world's largest solar farm at Kamuthi in southern India It is truly enormous; from the tall observation tower, the ranks of black panels stretch almost to the horizon. For large-scale projects, the cost of new solar power in India is now cheaper than coal and Prime Minister Modi plans to power 60 million homes from the sun by 2022. But solar doesn't generate 24/7 on an industrial scale, so India has adopted a ""more of everything"" approach to energy until then. Its recently-published National Electricity Plan projects no further additions to coal-based capacity between 2022 and 2027, and estimates that the share of clean generating capacity (including nuclear) will increase to 56.5% by the end of that period. The firm behind the solar plant, Adani, is also looking to create Australia's biggest coal mine, which it says will provide power for up to 100 million people in India. Renewables, it says, can't answer India's vast appetite for power to lift people out of poverty. Will India stick to its renewables promises with Donald Trump as US president? And questions have been raised recently as to whether India will stick to its renewables promises now President-elect Donald Trump may be about to scrap climate targets for the US. At the recentMarrakech climate conference, China, the EU and many developing countries pledged to forge ahead with emissions-cutting plans regardless of US involvement. But India offered no such guarantee. Some environmentalists are not too worried: they think economics may drive India's clean energy revolution.

"Ford's decision to cancel a $1.6bn investment in Mexico and invest an extra $700m in Michigan will be widely seen as concrete evidence that Donald Trump's economic nationalism is having the intended effect. Coincidentally, Ford's decision comes on the same day that the new President-elect launched an attack on General Motors for producing cars in Mexico bound for the US market. ""Build them in the USA or face big border tax"" said the incoming US president on Twitter. Cars made in Mexico can move across the border tax free thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), something that Donald Trump attacked during his campaign for causing the loss of US manufacturing jobs to cheaper labour. In fact, only a tiny fraction (2,400 out of 190,000) of the GM model he singled out, the Cruze, are made in Mexico. But while he may have picked on the wrong model, the message was unmistakable - the President-elect's hostility to NAFTA hasn't faded post-victory. That position - and its popularity among many US consumers - is clearly not lost on car makers. GM was quick to take to the airwaves to assure US customers that most GM cars are still made in the US and shares in the company recovered from early falls. The Ford Focus will be made in Mexico and while Ford's boss credited the business-friendly promises of the incoming President, he insisted it was switching investment in petrol cars in Mexico to electric cars in Detroit for its own business reasons. Shares in other targets of Mr Trumps ire, like defence contractor Lockheed Martin, did not recover so quickly and the President-elect will know his comments can cause ructions in boardrooms. Precisely the effect he is going for - and after today, one he will feel is working a treat.

"Original editions of Mein Kampf: It urged Germans to avenge their defeat in World War One ""Mein Kampf becomes German best-seller"" reads one international headline. ""Hitler's Mein Kampf a hit in Germany"" reads another. The fact that the Nazi manifesto reached number one inDer Spiegel's non-fiction charts,externalin April is cited as evidence that Adolf Hitler's propaganda is making a comeback in Germany. But the term ""best-seller"" does not necessarily mean very much. A quarter of all books sold in Germany are bought in the run-up to Christmas. At other times of the year it is possible to top listings with relatively few sales. Mein Kampf (My Struggle) is an expensive academic text, costing â¬58 (Â£49; $60), and is being bought by libraries, schools and history academics. ""This was a very special case. You can't really compare it with other books,"" Thomas Koch from the German Publishers' and Booksellers' Association told me. ""It's the first time that an annotated version has been published. So I can imagine that was why figures were relatively high."" Germany sees strong sales of Mein Kampf Life of Adolf Hitler Austria MPs vote to seize Hitler's house The plain IfZ edition of Mein Kampf: Publication has not been contested in court Most of the book's sales were made in the first quarter of 2016, before tailing off after April. This suggests that the initial run, when the book was republished in German for the first time, was followed by market saturation. For a German non-fiction book, sales of 85,000 are not bad. But the figures don't indicate a runaway hit. The current biggest non-fiction seller is The Hidden Life of Trees, a book about the ecosystem of woodland, which has sold half a million copies so far. The major hit of the last few years is a witty explanation of how the human bowel functions, by a medical student in her 20s, that sold over a million. The top-selling non-fiction book of the past decade, by comedian Hape Kerkeling, sold five million copies. Mein Kampf on the other hand is ranked 79th for non-fiction sales on the German Amazon site, narrowly beaten by a handbook on web coding, and a long way behind a handbook explaining how to get more Twitter followers. Nevertheless it is understandable that the publishers might be overwhelmed. IfZ, which printed the book, is anon-profit research institute,external, not a publishing house, and had expected lower sales of what is a dense academic text. Prof Wirsching says publication of Mein Kampf with scholarly notes did not help neo-Nazis And the institute believes this edition of Mein Kampf is helping to demystify, rather than empower, Hitler's legacy. ""It turned out that the fear the publication would promote Hitler's ideology, or even make it socially acceptable and give neo-Nazis a new propaganda platform, was totally unfounded,"" said IfZ director Andreas Wirsching. ""On the contrary, the debate about Hitler's world view and his approach to propaganda offered a chance to look at the causes and consequences of totalitarian ideologies.""

Bristol City - Second Division - 1905-06 When:After losing their first game of the season 5-1 to Manchester United, the Bristol Babe, as they were nicknamed, went on a perfect run from 9 September to 2 December 1905. Ended by:A 1-1 draw away to Leeds City on 9 December 1905. Champions:Despite three more draws that December, Bristol City only lost one further game all season to claim the title and promotion to the First Division. Manchester United - Second Division - 1904-05 When:A year before Bristol City matched them, Manchester United won 14 consecutive games between 15 October 1904 and 3 January 1905. Ended by:A 1-1 draw at Bristol City on 7 January 1905. Champions:Remarkably, United finished third and missed out on promotion to the First Division after falling behind Bolton and eventual champions Liverpool. They would be promoted in second behind Bristol City the following season. Every side to have reached 14 straight league wins has seen the streak end with an away draw in the following game. Chelsea could be going for their 15th win away at Leicester on 14 January - will it be the reigning champions who finally defy this year's favourites? BBC Radio 5 live football correspondent John Murray Talk about rarity value - we might witness something here that no team has been able to achieve in any one top-flight season since this league was first played in 1888. And if they manage it, Chelsea will become only the fifth team to win 14 consecutive league matches at any time, in any of the divisions. Tottenham are already one of the victims of this Chelsea winning streak, having lost at Stamford Bridge in November. But they will have other ideas this time round, and with good reason too, after running into a rich vein of form of their own with four successive wins.

"Paul Clement worked alongside England manager Gareth Southgate as a coach with England Under-21s Paul Clement has been confirmed as head coach of Swansea City. The 44-year-old becomes the Swans' third boss of the season after joining from Bayern Munich, where he was assistant to Carlo Ancelotti. Clementagreed a two-and-a-half-year dealto replace Bob Bradley, who had been in charge since Francesco Guidolin's departure in October. The former Derby County manager takes over with Swansea bottom of the Premier League. Can Clement turn it around at Swansea? Clement, who has also been Ancelotti's assistant boss at Chelsea, Paris St-Germain and Real Madrid, will be at Selhurst Park for the Swans' game against Crystal Palace on Tuesday, although first-team coach Alan Curtis will select the team. Last season he was in charge of Championship side Derby but wassacked by the clubin February 2016 after a run of seven league games without a win. Nigel Gibbs has been appointed assistant coach, with Karl Halabi named head of physical performance, with both arriving from Tottenham Hotspur. Bradley was sacked following a spell of seven defeats in 11 games, and Clementemerged as the frontrunnerto replace the American. 2016: A troubled year at Swansea City 18 January: Francesco Guidolin appointed to replace Garry Monk 11 May: Guidolin signs two-year contract after Swansea escape relegation 3 October: Bob Bradley appointed to replace Francesco Guidolin 27 December: Bradley sacked after 4-1 home defeat by West Ham Utd Former Manchester United assistant Ryan Giggs, Wales boss Chris Coleman and former Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett had also been linked with the job. The Swans are four points adrift at the bottom of the table and have lost their last four games, including Saturday's 3-0 homedefeat by Bournemouth. ""I could have stayed at Bayern as an assistant, but I've chosen to come into a very challenging situation. It excites me to do that and that's the attitude I want the players to have,"" said Clement on Swansea's website. ""It's a big task, but I think it can be done. ""We are looking at the potential of adding to the squad in the transfer window. I've discussed that with the owners already. ""But before that I quickly need to look at the players already here and get them playing up to or close to their potential - and get some good results."" ""Paul has not only worked with some of Europe's biggest football clubs, but also the very best players in the world,"" said Swans chairman Huw Jenkins. ""Swansea City's strength over many years had been the quality of the football coached on the training field. That has always been at the forefront of our success. ""There is no doubt in my mind that Paul can not only help us regain that footballing belief, but also restore some much-needed pride back into the football club."" BBC Wales football correspondent Rob Phillips ""Given the club's desperate plight, Clement needs to hit the ground running and the American investors simply have to provide funds for him to strengthen the squad in the January transfer window. ""The club's fans will surely judge whether Clement is an appointment with one eye on Championship football next season by how much commitment the owners show to giving the new man a fighting chance of saving the club from relegation.""

"Tigers, penguins and a lesser-known aye-aye baby were some of the animals counted by zookeepers at London Zoo's annual stock count. Sumatran Tiger cubs were just one of the hundreds of species counted. These two pictured, Achilles and Karis, arrived at the zoo in 2016. In previous years, the count has taken about a week to complete. Genghis, a Bactrian camel, was also counted. Although it is undertaken once a year, keepers have an inventory which is updated continuously. The count is required as part of the zoo's licence. Last year, nearly 18,500 animals were counted, including 21 red-kneed spiders and six Philippine crocodiles. There were a total of 712 species. The results are logged into the International Species Information System (ISIS) where the data is then shared with other zoos. Zookeeper Martin Franklin said the length of time it took to count the animals varied from department to department. ""I'm lucky in reptiles as we tend to have pretty large animals and it's a walk in the park to count them. We count them every day so we know what we've got but the point is we need to have a snapshot once a year for licensing purposes."" ""It's harder for other departments so for example our insects team have a real job on their hands. They might cheat a little bit sometimes and count an entire colony as just one animal but generally speaking, everything is counted. ""Our aquarium guys have a great trick - they take photographs so they can make sure they don't double count anything."" Founded in 1826 by Sir Stamford Raffles, it is the oldest zoological scientific zoo in the world. Last year saw four Humboldt penguin chicks hatched at Penguin Beach, and the zoo's first-ever aye-aye baby - a type of Lemur - arrived. The aye-aye, called Malcolm, was born was born on 1 July, but emerged from his secluded nesting box for the first time just before Halloween. Santa Claws visits London Zoo.

"Giant oak wine barrels sit above the bar of the Cittie of Yorke in Holborn - which is more reminiscent of a great hall in a Tudor mansion than than a traditional pub. The jury is out as to whether or not the massive casks were ever used as genuine storage vessels - or simply part of the inn's Tudor makeover in the 1920s. The Cittie of Yorke features in a new book, Great Pubs of London, written by George Dailey and featuring photographs taken by his daughter Charlie. The book examines the histories of 22 pubs. Take a look at some of them here. The Nags Head Belgravia On a quiet street in the heart of one of London's most exclusive neighbourhoods, the Nags Head's first customers would have been staff from the mansions on neighbouring streets. ""The likelihood is that, because of its location, most of the early landlords were connected with horses, carriages and stabling,"" writes Dailey. The pub's main bar - with its 150-year-old Chelsea pottery beer engine pump handles - is unusually low, with short stools in front. This is because the floor of the bar servery is positioned midway between the main bar and the lower back bar to the rear, which was once possibly a stables or courtyard. The Nags Head is also filled with dozens of toys, penny arcade machines, posters and photos - and the current landlord's collection of military memorabilia. The Blackfriar Blackfriars The Blackfriar - built in 1875 - stands on the site of London's Dominican friary in the parish of Ludgate. The Dominicans are known as ""the blackfriars"" because of the black cloaks they wear. In the early 20th Century the pub's interior was remodelled by the sculptor Henry Poole, who created a vision straight out of medieval England. There is a sumptuous mosaic ceiling, with marble columns and copper clay friezes. And black-cloaked friars can be spotted just about everywhere - all appearing to enjoy sins of overindulgence. The French House Soho The interior of the French House looks more like a Parisian backstreet bar, than a traditional London pub - and it remains a favourite of artists, writers, actors and photographers, George Dailey describes the inside as ""a little tired, faintly bohemian - but with unmistakeable Gallic charm"". For most of the 20th Century the pub's official name was The York Minster. Its metamorphosis into ""The French"" started in 1914, when its German owner sold the business to a Belgian - but ""The French sounds more romantic"", says Dailey. The Prospect of Whitby Wapping The inn on this site was first built in 1520 - on the north bank of the Thames to the east of the City. It would have been a timber structure surrounded by gardens and marshland. It was rebuilt in the 18th Century. Regular visitors included the writers Charles Dickens, Samuel Pepys and Samuel Johnson - and the venue was known for its bare-knuckle and cock fights. It's thought the pub's strange name derives from the fact that a collier - a ship carrying coal - from Whitby in North Yorkshire used to moor regularly beside the pub. Initially it was just called The Prospect. The George Inn Borough For people heading to London from the south, Borough High Street in Southwark was a terminus. The walled City of London was only a bridge away, but it was closed at night. Latecomers were forced to take rooms at one of the local inns - including The George. The George became a home for political debate and gossip - and Shakespeare's plays were often performed in its courtyard. According to Dailey: ""There is no pub in London that can boast of having a completely untouched 18th Century interior - but The George comes very close."" The Grapes Wapping The current building, which backs on to the shore of the Thames, dates from 1720 - built on the site of a previous pub, which burned down in 1710. In 1865, Charles Dickens is thought to have written about The Grapes - or The Bunch of Grapes, as it was then known. He describes ""a tavern of dropsical appearance... long settled down into a state of hale infirmity. It had outlasted many a sprucer public house, indeed the whole house impended over the water but seemed to have got into the condition of a faint-hearted diver, who has paused so long on the brink, that he will never go in at all."" The Ship Tavern Holborn Although rebuilt in the 1920s, there has probably been a pub on the site of The Ship since the mid-16th Century - and in its early incarnation it was known as a haven for persecuted Catholics. The pub is now just behind a busy underground station, but initially it would have overlooked a rough area of pasture land - Lincoln's Inn Fields. The Dove Hammersmith This narrow pub on the Thames is one of the best places to watch the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race - if you can find a space to stand. Anecdotal evidence suggests the Dove was actually a licensed pub as early as 1730 - when the green fields and orchards of 18th Century Hammersmith offered tranquillity away from the City of London, which was then only a two-hour coach ride away. The Flask Highgate With all the hallmarks of a village inn, The Flask is very close to Highgate Cemetery - the burial place of Karl Marx. It also claims to have two ghosts - a Spanish barmaid who took her life when the landlord rejected her amorous advances, and a hapless man dressed as a cavalier who crosses the main bar and disappears into a wall. The poets Byron, Shelley, Keats and Coleridge were regular drinkers here. Coleridge believed the clean air on the hill at Highgate was beneficial in his attempts to cure himself of opium addiction. The Lamb and Flag Covent Garden When the building now known as The Lamb and Flag was built, in the mid-17th Century, Covent Garden was a relatively new urban area - a smart and desirable address. But a century later, the gentry had moved away and the area had become a red-light district. Records from 1772 show that The Lamb and Flag - or Coopers Arms as it was known then - was trading successfully, but the clientele was drawn from the lower levels of society. A century later, and the venue was a popular location for unlicensed bare-knuckle fights. All images copyright Charlie Dailey. Great Pubs of London by George Dailey is published by Prestel.

"The hashtag #BackToWork is trending on Twitter as those returning to their jobs after the festive break share their sorrow that the fun is over and normal service is forced to resume. The sudden withdrawal from lie ins, naps and all-day snacking has hit some people - and even their pets - quite hard. And this morning's rude awakening has proved as alarming as the need to remain conscious for the duration of a 09:00 to 17:00 shift. The uncomfortable shift from lying horizontal on a sofa to sitting upright at a desk has proved difficult for some - with reports of email amnesia and password mind blocks. The drastic change in diet from a constant graze on festive leftovers and tins of chocolates to a one-hour slot to fill up on ""new year, new you"" salads is leaving a bitter taste in many mouths.

"Radstock Street is being marketed as ""desirable lateral living"" Buyers of a four-bedroom family home in London need deep pockets - but perhaps not as cavernous as a year ago. Asking prices in the capital for these top-of-the-ladder properties fell by 8.7% over the past year, according to search site Rightmove. House prices grew much faster in eastern England and the West Midlands than in London, according to Zoopla. London's annual house price growth for 2016 (3.7%) was below the UK average of 4.5% for the first time since 2008, theNationwide Building Society says,external. So has the London bubble burst? Are bargains to be had? Well, these things are relative. One new development in Radstock Street in Battersea will see eight large apartments go on the market in February for Â£3.65m each. For most people around the UK, that is an eye-watering price for a three-bedroom property. Yet, the developers say these homes will be attractive to downsizers - people aged in their 50s and 60s already owning a home in central London. The idea of downsizing to a Â£3m-plus home might make those eyes water a little more, but Louisa Brodie, head of search at Banda Property, says these apartments are ""realistically priced"". ""They have car parking, a porter, and are brand new. Properties like this are rare to find, and areas like this have a unique selling point,"" she says. ""London is still one of the most desirable places to live, anywhere."" Radstock Street is expected to attract interest This is surely a sign that London property has been decoupled from the rest of the country for many years. Despite the drop in activity in London, the average house price in the capital is still Â£474,000, more than double the typical price of Â£217,000 in the UK as a whole, according to thelatest official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS),external. The slowdown in central London is the result of the most significant change in the housing market in 2016 - a stamp duty surcharge on buy-to-let and second homes. Since April, anyone buying a home that is not their main residence has had to pay a 3% stamp duty surcharge. This meant that, for second homes or buy-to-let properties, the rate for properties priced at more than Â£1.5m reaches 15%. The surcharge led to a burst of activity in March followed by a steep drop in transactions in April - a ""hangover"" that still persists, according to Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). In Scotland, the equivalent tax - the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) - was also up-rated. The new surcharge, alongside a rise in normal stamp duty costs for Â£1m-plus homes since 2014, had a bigger impact on the market than the Brexit vote in June, according to experts. Ray Boulger, of John Charcol mortgage brokers, says it led to many at the expensive end of the market choosing to extend their homes rather than move. This made it more difficult to create chains lower down the market. Ed Stansfield, chief property economist at Capital Economics, says the housing market recovered ""remarkably quickly"" after cooling immediately after the UK's vote to leave the EU. He says a ""degree of nerves"" surrounding the economy and potential buyers' caution over stretching too far financially had kept a lid on house prices. Another major factor in the market over the last 12 months, according to the experts, is a lack of homes going on to the market. This supply squeeze has meant that, despite all the other pressures on affordability, prices continued to increase. The constraint on supply proved to be more problematic than expected, according to Mr Rubinsohn of Rics, whose prediction of a 6% rise in house prices for 2016 looks to be the most accurate. This trend will continue, he says, spelling more difficulties for first-time buyers whose incomes may fall in real terms. Many will continue to rely on the Bank of Mum and Dad for help with raising a mortgage deposit, while others will look to the government's Help to Buy projects to find somewhere affordable. Henry Pryor, property commentator:4% fall Ed Stansfield, Capital Economics:2% rise Ray Boulger, John Charcol mortgage brokers:1% rise Simon Rubinsohn, Rics:3% rise Robert Gardner, Nationwide building society:2% rise Martin Ellis, Halifax:1% to 4% rise Others see first-time buyers as key to the buoyancy of the housing market. ""First-time buyers still underpin the wider market. So long as the government continues to support them either directly via Help to Buy or by further tax changes then the market should not plunge but this is not completely in the gift of politicians who frankly have more pressing matters to attend to,"" says property buying agent Henry Pryor. ""Like last year if you already own a home then you are probably better off than someone who doesn't. If you don't, then it seems unlikely that 2017 will see a swift solution emerge."" The experts have a relatively wide spread of predictions for 2017 - from price falls overall to rises matching or outstripping the general level of inflation. Martin Ellis, housing economist at mortgage lender the Halifax, is offering a hedge-your-bets prediction of between a 1% and 4% rise. ""The relatively wide range for the forecast reflects the higher-than-normal degree of uncertainty regarding the prospects for the UK economy next year,"" he says. Given that a buying a home is the biggest financial transaction of most people's lives, they - and their mortgage lender - will want some certainty over their job and income before taking the plunge.

"Schwarzenegger halted his acting career in 2003 to serve two terms as governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger has made his debut as the new star of The Celebrity Apprentice, a role he inherited from US President-elect Donald Trump. The veteran action star made his mark on the US TV show by replacing Trump's ""You're fired"" catchphrase with a more idiosyncratic ""You're terminated"". Boy George, Jon Lovitz and Motley Crue singer Vince Neil are among the stars competing to raise money for charities. Mr Trump retains an executive producer credit on the NBC series. According to the New York Times,external, the real estate mogul turned TV star and politician was a ""ghostly presence"" that was ""sorely missed"". Schwarzenegger, wrote its critic Mike Hale, exuded ""robotic professionalism"" but was hampered by ""cautiousness and rigidity"". Boy George (fifth from right) is among the celebrities taking part in the show The Telegraph, though, felt he was ""more than qualified,external"" to act as the ""fake head of a fake business sitting in a fake boardroom"". ""He may not have Trump's business experience, but as a potential boss, he's a hell of a lot more intimidating,"" wroteTV Line's Andy Swift,external. Entertainment Weekly,external, meanwhile, said it was ""nice"" to see Schwarzenegger ""following Trump's lead in the nepotism department"" by appointing his nephew as one of his advisors. During Mr Trump's time on The Apprentice and its celebrity spin-off, his children Donald Jr and Ivanka frequently appeared as guest hosts and advisors. ""You're terminated"" refers to Schwarzenegger's role as a killer cyborg in 1984's The Terminator and its numerous sequels.

"The cost of annual season tickets has increased by 1.9%, analysis by the BBC England Data Unit found Commuters in some parts of England will be worse off than others from rail fare rises, which were called a""kick in the teeth""by critics. In some areas there was no increase in annual season ticket prices, despite wage growth. Others have seen their annual fares rise despite average pay having fallen. Across the UK rail fares of all types - from season tickets to single journeys - increased by an average of 2.3% on the first weekday of the new year. Analysis by the BBC England Data Unit found annual season tickets had increased in cost by 1.9%, while median take-home pay had increased by 2%. The government said wages were growing faster than regulated fares, which include season tickets. Passengers commuting to Manchester with the most popular annual season tickets saw no increase at all, while the median take-home wage increased 2.8%. Annual passes from East Didsbury, Macclesfield, Stockport, Altrincham, Wilmslow, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne, Bolton, Glossop and Knutsford are all the same price as they were before the increase. Yet commuters in Liverpool will pay 1.9% more for an annual pass. This is despite median wages having fallen, according to theOffice for National Statistics,external. For more stories from the BBC England Data Unit follow our Pinterest board,external. Someone travelling from Runcorn to Liverpool would pay Â£1,532 for their annual pass, Â£28 more than in 2016. In Liverpool the average full-time wage, after tax and National Insurance deductions, fell from Â£21,901 in 2015 to Â£21,634 in 2016. The most expensive annual season ticket per mile travelled is Harlow Town to London Liverpool Street. A commuter pays Â£3,496, which is Â£64 more than in 2016. It works out at 39p per mile travelled. The figures are based on a Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) list of the most commonly used commuter services in six major cities. Our analysis of the figures was based on full-time workers using an annual season ticket five days a week, except on bank holidays or on 25 days of annual leave. Get the data here,external Lianna Etkind, public transport campaigner at the CBT, said: ""Wages remain stagnant and trains continue to be hopelessly overcrowded, so commuters are rightly angry at annual fare rises when they see little or no improvement in the service they receive. ""Many commuters are now being charged at a similar level to a premium rate phone number for their season tickets and are left feeling equally as fleeced. ""It's high time the government introduced a fairer ticketing system that actively encouraged rail travel, not penalised people for choosing to take the train."" According to the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, about 97p in every pound paid by passengers goes back into running and improving services. RDG chief executive Paul Plummer said: ""Money from fares is helping to sustain investment in the longer, newer trains and more punctual journeys that passengers want."" The Department for Transport said it had saved commuters money by capping season ticket increases so they are in line with inflation. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""Thanks to action by the government on train ticket prices, wages are growing faster than regulated fares."" Northern Rail, which runs commuter services into Manchester, confirmed it had not increased annual season ticket fares but said other prices had risen. It declined to comment further.

"J2, or Granny, in the Salish Sea in 2010 The world's oldest known killer whale, affectionately known as Granny, is missing and presumed dead, researchers say. Estimated to be over 100 years old, the matriarch's official name was J2. She was the focal point ofa recent BBC documentarythat followed biologists' study of her clan of orcas, an effort to unravel an evolutionary mystery. Studying female orcas, which live long beyond their reproductive years, has revealed insights into the menopause. Only three mammals are known to experience menopause - orcas, short-finned pilot whales and humans. Even our closest ape cousins, chimpanzees, do not go through it. Their fertility peters out with age and, in the wild, they seldom live beyond childbearing years. Following Granny and other matriarch killer whales has shown their crucial role within the family group. They guide the pod as it forages, take care of other females' young calves and even feed the larger males. These post-reproductive female leaders help their families to survive, and the advantage they offer could show what drives a species to evolve to stop reproducing. An older female orca leads the way with her pod trailing behind This research continues, but an icon of the most well-studied killer whale population on the planet will no longer be part of it. Prof Darren Croft from the University of Exeter, UK, who leads this evolutionary biology research, told BBC News: ""It was inevitable that this day was going to come but it is very sad news and a further blow to this population."" He explained that in her later years she had ""been helping her family group to survive by sharing her knowledge of when and where to find food."" The orcas of an area known as the Salish Sea - close to Vancouver and Seattle - have been the subject of a four decades long study led by Dr Ken Balcomb from the Center for Whale Research (CWR). Dr Balcomb started this work after a period - between 1965 and 1975 - during which killer whales were taken from the Salish Sea to supply marine parks. The predictable habits of these Southern Resident killer whales, as they are called, made them an ideal target for capture, This video can not be played How a team in the US researched an orca family tree By observing and cataloguing the killer whales since 1976, when he first photographed Granny, Dr Balcomb exposed just how unsustainable the hunting of the whales was. He and the CWR garnered the Southern Residents protection as an endangered species. On the centre's website, which first reported Granny's death, Dr Balcomb wrote that he last saw her on 12 October, 2016, as she swam north far ahead of the others. ""Perhaps other dedicated whale-watchers have seen her since then,"" he wrote, ""but by year's end she is officially missing from the Southern Resident Killer Whale population, and with regret we now consider her deceased."" Prof Croft added that it was ""just incredible"" to think of what Granny lived through over the last century and how the world and her environment had changed over that time. ""She lived through the live captures,"" he told BBC News, ""and in recent years her world has changed dramatically with dwindling salmon stocks and increases in shipping threatening the survival of this incredible population. ""Although J2 is gone we will continue to benefit for many decades to come, from the incredible data collected on her life over the last 40 years by the Center for Whale Research."" The population of Southern Residents is now estimated to be just 78 animals, as of 31 December 2016. Numbers of salmon, which these killer whales feed on, are dwindling in the region. This has prompted Dr Balcomb to wonder if there is a future for these animals as their food supply runs down.

"Turkish police stand guard at the scene of the Istanbul nightclub attack The Daily Telegraph is one of a number of papers to report on the terrorist attack in Istanbul. It says a blurry picture of the gunman,external, who killed 39 people, is emerging, with reports that he may be from Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan. Writing in the i,external, Patrick Cockburn says it is clear the Turkish government does not know what to do to stop such attacks. He says they are likely to continue because so-called IS is too big and well-resourced to be eliminated. He notes that, as in France and Germany, it is impossible to stop attacks when ordinary civilians are the targets and the killers are prepared to die. The Times reports on a survey of doctors that suggests most believe,externalGP surgeries should be placed in A&E departments to deal with patients who do not need emergency treatment. The study of more than 500 doctors by the Press Association found most believed such a move was necessary to relieve the pressure on A&E. The Daily Mail highlights official NHS figures,externalshowing that about 13% of patients who attend A&E have minor problems and are discharged without treatment. TheFinancial Times,externalsays economists are more worried about the consequences of Brexit than they were a year ago, despite the economy showing little obvious damage since the vote in June to leave the EU. The FT's annual survey of UK economists, which had 122 responses, found a large majority expect growth to slow in 2017 as higher inflation hits household incomes. The paper notes that attacks on the profession, especially by Leave campaigners, have not led to a significant change of thinking about Brexit. Department store Harrods is being accused of short-changing some of its staff,according to the Guardian,external. The paper says a trade union is claiming the owners are keeping up to 75% of service charges in the store's cafes and restaurants. A spokeswoman for Harrods tells the paper that service charges are shared out among staff members - but only if they accept a cut in basic pay. The paper says it is the latest in a series of examples where high-profile hospitality firms and businesses have been found to be withholding service charges and tips from workers. The future of village halls is under threat,warns the Daily Telegraph,external, because communities are struggling to find young volunteers to help run them. It says the halls, of which there are said to be around 10,000 in Britain, are the cornerstones of many villages. But it says younger residents often work long hours away from their village, while the newly retired often do not want to commit to the duties required. Finally, theDaily Star is warning of bad weather,external, stating that its going to be the ""coldest January ever"".

"This video can not be played It was love at first sight between the Macedonian police officer and the Iraqi refugee Bobi Dodevski wasn't supposed to be working on the rainy March day when he met his future wife. Mr Dodevski, a 35-year-old Macedonian border guard, had agreed to cover for a colleague. Among the thousands of refugees hoping to cross the border that day was Noora Arkavazi, a young woman who had travelled with her family from Iraq. Ms Arkavazi, 20, left her home in Diyala, an eastern province of Iraq beset by violence, early in 2016. Alongside her parents, brother, and sister, she followed a well-trodden path west - crossing the border from Iraq into Turkey, taking a boat to the Greek island of Lesbos, and eventually entering Macedonia. There, as the family waited to learn if they would be allowed to cross into Serbia, she met Mr Dodevski. He saw something special in her eyes. ""It was destiny,"" he told the BBC. When the couple met, the fate of the refugees in Macedonia was hanging in the balance, as Balkan countries closed their doors to migrants. ""I had a simple dream to live with my family in Germany,"" Ms Arkavazi told the AFP news agency. She speaks six languages, and when she arrived at the border unwell she was directed to Mr Dodevski because of his English skills. She told the BBC World Service's Newsday: ""The first time I went through the border I had a very high fever and I had fallen down many times. Bobi immediately sent the Red Cross to save me."" The grim, muddy Macedonian border is a common thoroughfare for refugees Mr Dodevski attempted to remain professional, he said, but a female colleague quickly spotted the signs of cupid's arrow. As Ms Arkavazi remembered it, his co-worker chided his lack of focus and told him: ""Oh, I think you're in love and someone has stolen your brain here on the border!'"" ""After that I talked with him, and I felt like something lit me,"" she said. ""I wanted to talk with him more."" Mr Dodevski put it bluntly: ""I see many, many girls - maybe [more beautiful], a little, than Noora. But I see something special in Noora's eyes, and I say: 'This is it. I must have Noora here to be my wife!'"" When she had recovered from her illness, Noora began helping the local Red Cross. Her fellow refugees in the Tabanovce transit camp could only wait for news about their status, but on the sidelines Noora and Bobi were quietly getting to know one another. He took her and her mother to nearby markets to buy clothes and food. She was struck by the way he would play with the migrants' children, unlike his more serious colleagues. One day in April, the pair were enjoying dinner in a restaurant and he was visibly nervous - shaking and drinking lots of water. ""I told him no, you're joking,"" Noora said, ""but maybe 10 times he repeated this, 'will you marry me?'"" Won over, she agreed to be Mrs Dodevski. Noora and Bobi now live together in Kumanovo, Macedonia The pair wed in July, on her birthday, just four months after they met The couple married in the north Macedonian town of Kumanovo. While the groom is Orthodox Christian, his bride comes from a Kurdish Muslim family. They were joined by 120 guests of all faiths, including her Red Cross colleagues. Asked about their rapid engagement, Noora said it was love at first sight. ""This is what has happened between me and Bobi."" Though her family successfully made it to Germany, Noora stayed in Macedonia with her husband and his three children. The five of them live together in Kumanovo. And they will soon be six. ""I am pregnant, four months!"", said Noora, laughing with joy.

"Volvo still has the largest share of the country's car market overall Sweden's best-selling car in 2016 was not a Volvo - the first year that has happened in more than half a century. Instead the Volkswagen Golf topped sales, according to the country's carmakers' association, although Volvo still had the largest share of the country's car market overall. The Golf made up 5.9% of new cars bought in the country, while Volvo's V70, S90 and V90 took 5.7% together. Volvo was last knocked off top spot in 1962 by a Volkswagen Beetle. Despite Volvo's car business now being owned by a Chinese firm, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, it is still viewed as an iconic Swedish brand. And it still sells the most cars in Sweden, with more than one in five cars (21.5%) on the country's roads, compared with Volkswagen's 15.7%. However, Volvo's V70, the most popular car in Sweden for the past two decades, has ceased production in favour of the newer V90 model. Sweden is Volvo's second-biggest market behind China. The Swedish carmakers' association said 2016 saw record car sales with 372,000 new registrations, up by 8% on the 2015 figure, helped by a strong economy, while truck sales were up by more than 15%.

"J2, or Granny, in the Salish Sea in 2010 The world's oldest known killer whale, affectionately known as Granny, is missing and presumed dead, researchers say. Estimated to be over 100 years old, the matriarch's official name was J2. She was the focal point ofa recent BBC documentarythat followed biologists' study of her clan of orcas, an effort to unravel an evolutionary mystery. Studying female orcas, which live long beyond their reproductive years, has revealed insights into the menopause. Only three mammals are known to experience menopause - orcas, short-finned pilot whales and humans. Even our closest ape cousins, chimpanzees, do not go through it. Their fertility peters out with age and, in the wild, they seldom live beyond childbearing years. Following Granny and other matriarch killer whales has shown their crucial role within the family group. They guide the pod as it forages, take care of other females' young calves and even feed the larger males. These post-reproductive female leaders help their families to survive, and the advantage they offer could show what drives a species to evolve to stop reproducing. An older female orca leads the way with her pod trailing behind This research continues, but an icon of the most well-studied killer whale population on the planet will no longer be part of it. Prof Darren Croft from the University of Exeter, UK, who leads this evolutionary biology research, told BBC News: ""It was inevitable that this day was going to come but it is very sad news and a further blow to this population."" He explained that in her later years she had ""been helping her family group to survive by sharing her knowledge of when and where to find food."" The orcas of an area known as the Salish Sea - close to Vancouver and Seattle - have been the subject of a four decades long study led by Dr Ken Balcomb from the Center for Whale Research (CWR). Dr Balcomb started this work after a period - between 1965 and 1975 - during which killer whales were taken from the Salish Sea to supply marine parks. The predictable habits of these Southern Resident killer whales, as they are called, made them an ideal target for capture, This video can not be played How a team in the US researched an orca family tree By observing and cataloguing the killer whales since 1976, when he first photographed Granny, Dr Balcomb exposed just how unsustainable the hunting of the whales was. He and the CWR garnered the Southern Residents protection as an endangered species. On the centre's website, which first reported Granny's death, Dr Balcomb wrote that he last saw her on 12 October, 2016, as she swam north far ahead of the others. ""Perhaps other dedicated whale-watchers have seen her since then,"" he wrote, ""but by year's end she is officially missing from the Southern Resident Killer Whale population, and with regret we now consider her deceased."" Prof Croft added that it was ""just incredible"" to think of what Granny lived through over the last century and how the world and her environment had changed over that time. ""She lived through the live captures,"" he told BBC News, ""and in recent years her world has changed dramatically with dwindling salmon stocks and increases in shipping threatening the survival of this incredible population. ""Although J2 is gone we will continue to benefit for many decades to come, from the incredible data collected on her life over the last 40 years by the Center for Whale Research."" The population of Southern Residents is now estimated to be just 78 animals, as of 31 December 2016. Numbers of salmon, which these killer whales feed on, are dwindling in the region. This has prompted Dr Balcomb to wonder if there is a future for these animals as their food supply runs down.

"Susan Snow took this snap from her garden in Bishop's Cleeve, just north of Cheltenham Stargazers have had their heads turned by the sight of the bright Moon and the planet Venus on Monday night. Clear skies gave people across the UK a great view of the planet sitting below a crescent Moon. Keen snappers got their cameras out to record the moment and took to social media to share the images. And some were hoping to see Mars and even Neptune if the skies remained clear. Sarah Mills got this picture in Cumbria, near to Cartmel Kay Koyama-Gore captured the skyline over the water of Leith During January, Venus will reach its peak height above the horizon, according to the Beckstrom Observatory.

"Gary Barlow has been a judge on The X Factor in the past Gary Barlow has said the success of his new BBC One talent show should not be judged on TV ratings because they are less relevant than they used to be. Barlow is using Let It Shine, which starts on Saturday, to find the five leads for a Take That stage musical. Let It Shine will go up against The Voice UK, which has moved to ITV. Barlow told the BBC: ""I think people are ingesting TV in a different way now. That old system of ratings shouldn't really apply any more."" Speaking on the set of the show, the Take That star added: ""But I think people are still loving, downloading and buying music and listening to music more importantly. ""And I think people are ready for a new Saturday night experience."" Barlow is on the judging panel with Amber Riley, Dannii Minogue and Martin Kemp The eight-week show will be hosted by Mel Giedroyc and Graham Norton, while Barlow will act as a judge alongside Dannii Minogue, Spandau Ballet's Martin Kemp and Glee star Amber Riley. The winners will tour the UK with the new musical for a year. Audiences for TV singing contests have been in decline for a number of years. December's The X Factor final was the least watched in the show's history and lost out in the ratings to BBC One's Planet Earth II, which was shown at the same time. The Voice UK, also had its smallest ever audience for a final last April, with 4.5 million watching, compared with 6.3 million the previous year. The judges on The Voice will be Gavin Rossdale, Sir Tom Jones, Jennifer Hudson and will.i.am However, Barlow, who was a judge on The X Factor for three series, said there was demand for another TV singing show. ""I think it's incredibly exciting,"" he said. ""It's something I haven't done before. I've done lots of things in my career. But this feels like something new. ""And I have to say I think Saturday night needs a new idea at the moment. And I think this could be it."" Let It Shine is filling the BBC One Saturday night slot that was vacated by The Voice UK's move to ITV. ITV has reinstated Sir Tom Jones as a coach on The Voice UK, two years after he was sacked by the BBC. The BBC showed the first five series of The Voice UK. Both shows start on Saturday and their transmissions overlap for 25 minutes. Barlow refuses to see it as any kind of singing show shoot-out. He said: ""I've got to be honest with you. It's the same with music - I don't look right or left - I just concentrate on what we are doing and try and make it the best quality it can be."" Fellow judge Dannii Minogue, whose sister Kylie was a coach on The Voice UK, believes there is enough appetite from viewers for both shows to do well. ""I think they are really different shows,"" she said. ""The Voice has really settled into what it's doing. I think it has such a fan base. ""This one is different. We are giving them the skills which you can take on to use forever. But then also it's a 12-month gig. That's a really big job for someone. You come out of that and you can do anything you want to do."" Let It Shine editor Guy Freeman, who is also in charge of the BBC's Eurovision Song Contest coverage, insists that there are good reasons for the BBC to have replaced The Voice UK with another singing show. ""A: there's gut instinct. B: there's an awful lot of research which says that people at the beginning of a dark winter want a real treat on TV,  because Christmas has finished. Everything is finished and you don't want TV to suddenly kind of desert you."" Let It Shine is on BBC One on Saturday from 19:00-20:25 GMT. The Voice UK is on ITV on the same night from 20:00 GMT.

"On Thailand's border with Myanmar, also known as Burma, more than 100,000 people live in a string of refugee camps. Many fled ethnic conflict in their homeland decades ago, and have brought up their children here. Gracia Fellmeth arrived in one of the camps a year ago to study depression in women before and after childbirth. After an hour's bus journey through forest from the town of Mae Sot, Mae La appears suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere. In the morning mist, thousands of bamboo huts cling to steep limestone crags. It is the largest of nine refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, and home to almost 40,000 people.  Many residents have spent their entire lives in this isolated place, unable to work and dependent on outside aid. The majority are Karen, one of Myanmar's largest ethnic minorities. It is a Wednesday morning, three months after my arrival, and the dusty waiting room is full. Pregnant women wait patiently to be seen by nurses, midwives and medics. They will have their bellies examined, their blood pressure monitored and their blood screened. Since my arrival, women are also offered a depression screen - a series of 10 questions to look for symptoms of depression, which is common in pregnancy. Our first patient today is 18-year-old Myo Myo. She is nine weeks pregnant. She enters the room, smiling. Lar Paw, a Karen counsellor and midwife I am working with, explains what the interview involves. Myo Myo agrees to take part. We sit down on the bamboo floor and begin. ""In the past month, have you ever felt sad or down for long periods of time?"" I ask. ""Sometimes,"" Myo Myo replies. ""We have some family problems. And not enough money."" Gracia Fellmeth screened many young pregnant women for signs of depression Calm and composed, she continues her story - a story by now familiar to me. She describes a happy relationship with her husband. Despite his alcohol dependency, he is good to her, she says, and she loves him. They are both happy about the pregnancy. However, there are tensions with her mother-in-law, who disapproves of Myo Myo and rebukes her for not contributing to household expenditure. I want to know more about her symptoms. She tells us that the episodes of sadness are short-lived, occurring only once or twice a month and lasting an hour or so. ""Do you ever think about hurting yourself, or about suicide?"" I probe. Myo Myo hesitates. ""Sometimes I think about it, if we have been arguing with my mother-in-law,"" she admits. She has never attempted suicide though, and assures us she is not planning to. A quarter of all women we speak to think about suicide at least occasionally. A smaller proportion - about 3% - have made attempts. We lack the resources to follow up all of these patients, so we focus only on those with pronounced thoughts of suicide or severe symptoms of depression. Myo Myo has other symptoms, too - low energy and ""thinking too much"" - but they occur only once in a while and do not seem to be out of the ordinary. We don't arrange a follow-up but we tell her to come and talk to us any time, if she wants to share her worries with anyone. Two days later I am on the bus to Mae La when a colleague asks me: ""Did you hear about the suicide? A young girl. She was pregnant."" My heart pounds. Was it someone I had interviewed? Someone we had been following up? Or worse, someone we hadn't followed up? Lar Paw stands outside the clinic waiting for me. ""Doctor! We have a suicide. Do you remember this patient?"" She hands me a file. It is Myo Myo's. I feel shaky. I remember her, and I remember that we had not considered her to be high-risk. Among the hundreds of women we had spoken to, Myo Myo, tragically, had not stood out. ""Her husband also. They did it together,"" Lar Paw continues softly. A double suicide? I couldn't think straight. We had seen Myo Myo only two days ago. How could this have happened? Had we given her the idea of taking her own life? Was this all my fault? Later that day we go to Myo Myo's home to pay our respects. The family sits quietly. The two bodies lie in the middle of the room under a sheet, surrounded by candles. Two cups wrapped in plastic are lined with a fluorescent blue liquid - remnants of the toxic weed-killer that led the couple to their death. We sit in silence until Myo Myo's mother-in-law stumbles in, drunk. Myo Myo's sister-in-law shouts at her. ""This is all your fault,"" she sobs. Later we find out about an altercation that had taken place earlier in the week between Myo Myo's husband and his mother, during which she had slapped him in the face. The death of this young couple left us deeply saddened, but also troubled. Should we have done more to encourage Myo Myo to put aside her thoughts of suicide? Could we have stopped her? Had it been the impulsive act of an adolescent in response to a family feud? Had a Buddhist belief in rebirth enticed the couple to leave this world and start a new, better, life together? We will never know. What we do know is that suicide is too common in Mae La - last year it accounted for half of all deaths among pregnant women and new mothers. What is the explanation? There could be many factors - including chronic uncertainty, hopelessness, boredom, and the legacy of the conflict that led these families to Mae La in the first place.

"The Christmas morning excitement about presents doesn't always last the week, let alone the year It is not much more than a week since Christmas Day but how many of those toys that you bought and were received with so much joy are still being used? Or did you get the latest piece of technology as your Christmas present - to replace the almost identical one that you got last year? Why is almost everything these days so short-lived? One of the best-selling toys this Christmas was the Hatchimal, just Â£59.99 for a cuddly toy that you have to encourage to hatch from its own plastic egg. Call me a cynic but I don't see that being the centre of many kids' world throughout all of 2017. How long will the Hatchimals remain a favourite? Of course, if you are willing to spend that kind of money to give your children just what they want for Christmas, fair enough, but for environmental experts the real cost is more significant. Such toys are often very hard to recycle, and a lot could be done to change that, says Margaret Bates, professor of sustainable waste management at Northampton University. ""Eighty per cent of waste is generated at the design stage, so if we can start thinking of the end of life when we are designing things we will get a much better recovery rate,"" she says. ""Just even using fewer screws or making sure that you keep materials separate, so that you can use plastic and metal but not stick them together."" This TV could be repaired if it went wrong... The technology even exists to go much further, adds Prof Bates: ""There are also some clever things that you can do like putting things in the microwave or expose them to a special light source and all the fixtures and fittings will snap off, they just fall apart."" That, of course, makes recycling much easier. The trouble is, not many toys or presents are designed that way, even some wrapping paper is not recyclable. ...but if this X-Box controller malfunctions, you might just throw it away The trend away from repairing, recycling or reusing seems to be getting worse but it has been going on for years, according to Deyan Sudjic, director of the Design Museum in London. ""Ever since the 1920s and an American advertising man called Elmo Calkins, who suggested it was the duty of the consumer to use stuff up to get us out of the [Great] Depression, there has been the concept of built-in obsolescence,"" he says. And that obsolescence is getting more and more built in. Some new games consoles won't work with the games people already own. Or, take the smartphone - it has replaced many products like the camera, typewriter and Dictaphone. But those items could last for decades. Some were even passed down from one generation to the next.  Now, however, people replace their phones when one part breaks or a new model is released. The dictaphone grew a lot smaller than this 1945 model, but it has now been replaced by the smartphone You can even see this on the High Street. TV and radio repair shops are a vanishing breed. Lawnmower maintenance ones are even rarer and camera shops are in serious decline. But there is an exception that proves the rule - the explosion in the number of bicycle repair shops. The reason is simple enough to understand: we are cycling more and the technology is pretty much the same as it has always been. John Gallen should know - he repairs bikes at Cycle Surgery in central London. ""Materials have changed. There are steel, carbon, aluminium, even bamboo bikes out there, but ultimately it is still the triangular frame, two wheels, handlebars and a set of pedals and off you go,"" he tells me. The materials may have changed but the bicycle's shape is essentially the same as it was in the 1930s But even that may be about to change with the new popularity of electric bikes. ""We are moving down that road,"" says John. ""The electric bikes are making their way into the market and with them you just plug the bike in to get the diagnostics."" It is possible to design and make things that last a long time, can be repaired or upgraded and then, finally, almost totally recycled, but that doesn't seem to be happening yet. But it may be coming sooner than current trends suggest. Modern technology from toys to mobile phones and electric bikes is dependent on increasingly rare metals.

"David Bowie was the biggest-selling artist on vinyl last year Vinyl sales topped three million last year, the highest UK total in 25 years. More than 3.2 million records were sold in 2016, a rise of 53% on the previous year,according to the BPI,external, which represents the music industry. David Bowie's Blackstar was the most popular album on vinyl, selling more than double the number of copies of 2015's biggest-seller, Adele's 25. The last time vinyl fared so well in the UK, in 1991, Simply Red's Stars was the year's biggest-selling record. However, vinyl still only accounts for 2.6% of the overall music market - and while it continues to enjoy a resurgence, sales of CDs and downloads are falling rapidly. A total of 47.3 million CDs were bought in 2016, a drop of 11.7%; while downloads plummeted by 29.6%, with just 18.1 million albums bought online. Four years ago, when the download market was at its peak, that figure was 32.6 million. Now, consumers are increasingly turning to streaming services. Source: Official Charts Company According to the BPI, there were approximately 45 billion audio streams in 2016 - the equivalent of the UK's 27 million households each listening to 1,500 songs over the course of the year. In December, more than a billion streams were served in a single week for the first time. To put that in context, the UK is now streaming more songs in a week than it did in a month just three years ago. Additionally, the BPI's figures do not account for music listened to on YouTube because the Official Chart Company does not collect data from Google's video streaming service. However,it is estimated,externalthat if YouTube was included, the figure for streams accessed by music fans in the UK would double. Drake dominated the streaming charts with his album Views and hit single One Dance The most popular artists of 2016 were Adele and Coldplay, who outsold all their competitors, despite not releasing new material. Adele's 25, which came out in November 2015, was the year's biggest-seller (not counting compilations), shifting 753,000 copies. Coldplay were in second place with A Head Full of Dreams, which racked up 512,000 sales. Michael Ball and Alfie Boe released the most successful new album of the year, selling 512,000 copies of their record Together in just five weeks and topping the Christmas chart. Their sales victory was something of a surprise, given that they went up against high-profile new releases from the likes of Robbie Williams, Emeli Sande, Little Mix and Olly Murs. The year's biggest single was Drake's One Dance, which accumulated more than 141 million streams, while Justin Bieber's Purpose was 2016's most-streamed album. Overall, the music market grew by 1.5% over the course of 2016, achieving an estimated retail value of Â£1bn. Source: Official Charts Company Vinyl has now enjoyed nine consecutive years of growth since facing near extinction in 2007. Some fans prefer the ""warmth"" of the sound compared with digital files, while others buy LPs as souvenirs and works of art. Last year,a BBC/ICM poll foundthat people who listened to music on streaming services were more likely to buy vinyl - often as a goodwill gesture to an artist they loved. But 48% of those surveyed said they did not play the vinyl they bought - while 7% did not even own a turntable.

"The Tuticorin zero-emissions plant to make soda ash Two world-leading clean energy projects have opened in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. A Â£3m industrial plant is capturing the CO2 emissions from a coal boiler and using the CO2 to make valuable chemicals. It is a world first. And just 100km away is the world's biggest solar farm, making power for 150,000 homes on a 10 sq km site. The industrial plant appears especially significant as it offers a breakthrough by capturing CO2 without subsidy. Built at a chemical plant in the port city of Tuticorin, it is projected to save 60,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year by incorporating them into the recipes for soda ash and other chemicals. Here's how it works: The plant operates a coal-fired boiler to make steam for its chemical operations. CO2 emissions from the boiler's chimney are stripped out by a fine mist of a new patented chemical. A stream of CO2 is fed into the chemicals plant as an ingredient for soda ash and other compounds with many uses, including the manufacturing of glass, detergents and sweeteners. The owner of the chemicals plant, Ramachadran Gopalan, told a BBC Radio 4 documentary: ""I am a businessman. I never thought about saving the planet. I needed a reliable stream of CO2, and this was the best way of getting it."" He says his operation has now almost zero emissions. He hopes soon to install a second coal boiler to make more CO2 to synthesise fertiliser. The chemical used in stripping the CO2 from the flue gas was invented by two young Indian chemists. They failed to raise Indian finance to develop it, but their firm, Carbonclean Solutions, working with the Institute of Chemical Technology at Mumbai and Imperial College in London, got backing from the UK's entrepreneur support scheme. Their technique uses a form of salt to bond with CO2 molecules in the boiler chimney. The firm says it is more efficient than typical amine compounds used for the purpose. The plant is projected to save 60,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year They say it also needs less energy, produces less alkaline waste and allows the use of a cheaper form of steel -  all radically reducing the cost of the whole operation. The firm admits its technology of Carbon Capture and Utilisation won't cure climate change, but says it may provide a useful contribution by gobbling up perhaps 5-10% of the world's emissions from coal. Lord Oxburgh, former chairman of Shell, and now director and head of the UK government's carbon capture advisory group, told the BBC: ""We have to do everything we can to reduce the harmful effects of burning fossil fuels and it is great news that more ways are being found of turning at least some of the CO2 into useful products."" Meanwhile, the nearby giant Kamuthi solar plant offers a marker for India's ambition for a rapid expansion in renewables. The world's largest solar farm at Kamuthi in southern India It is truly enormous; from the tall observation tower, the ranks of black panels stretch almost to the horizon. For large-scale projects, the cost of new solar power in India is now cheaper than coal and Prime Minister Modi plans to power 60 million homes from the sun by 2022. But solar doesn't generate 24/7 on an industrial scale, so India has adopted a ""more of everything"" approach to energy until then. Its recently-published National Electricity Plan projects no further additions to coal-based capacity between 2022 and 2027, and estimates that the share of clean generating capacity (including nuclear) will increase to 56.5% by the end of that period. The firm behind the solar plant, Adani, is also looking to create Australia's biggest coal mine, which it says will provide power for up to 100 million people in India. Renewables, it says, can't answer India's vast appetite for power to lift people out of poverty. Will India stick to its renewables promises with Donald Trump as US president? And questions have been raised recently as to whether India will stick to its renewables promises now President-elect Donald Trump may be about to scrap climate targets for the US. At the recentMarrakech climate conference, China, the EU and many developing countries pledged to forge ahead with emissions-cutting plans regardless of US involvement. But India offered no such guarantee. Some environmentalists are not too worried: they think economics may drive India's clean energy revolution.

"It has been called one of the greatest inventions of the 20th Century, and without it almost half the world's population would not be alive today. A hundred years ago two German chemists, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, devised a way to transform nitrogen in the air into fertiliser, using what became known as the Haber-Bosch process. But Haber's place in history is controversial. He is also considered the ""father of chemical warfare"" for his years of work developing and weaponising chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War One. Fritz Haber's work weaponising poisonous gases during World War One was extremely controversial Plants need nitrogen: it is one of their five basic requirements, along with potassium, phosphorus, water and sunlight. In a natural state, plants grow, they die, the nitrogen they contain returns to the soil, and new plants use it to grow. Agriculture disrupts that cycle: we harvest the plants, and eat them. From the earliest days of agriculture, farmers discovered various ways to prevent crop yields from declining over time: by restoring nitrogen to their fields. Manure has nitrogen. So does compost. The roots of legumes host bacteria that replenish nitrogen levels. That is why it helps to include peas or beans in crop rotation. But these techniques struggle to fully satisfy a plant's appetite for nitrogen. Add more, and the plant grows better. That is exactly what Fritz Haber worked out how to do, driven in part by the promise of a lucrative contract from the chemical company BASF. That company's engineer, Carl Bosch, then managed to replicate Haber's process on an industrial scale. Both men later won Nobel Prizes - controversially, in Haber's case, as many by then considered him a war criminal. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You canlisten onlineand find information about the programme's sources orsubscribe to the programme podcast. The Haber-Bosch process is perhaps the most significant example of what economists call ""technological substitution"", where we seem to have reached some basic physical limit, then find a workaround. For most of human history, if you wanted more food to support more people, then you needed more land. But the thing about land, as Mark Twain once joked, is that they are not making it any more. Haber and Bosch provided a substitute: instead of more land, make nitrogen fertiliser. It was like alchemy. ""Brot aus Luft"", as Germans put it, or ""Bread from air"". From air and quite a lot of fossil fuels. First of all, you need natural gas as a source of hydrogen, the element to which nitrogen binds to form ammonia. Then you need energy to generate extreme heat and pressure. Schematic diagram of the Haber-Bosch process to make ammonia from nitrogen Haber discovered that was necessary, with a catalyst, to break the bonds between air's nitrogen atoms and persuade them to bond with hydrogen instead. Imagine the heat of a wood-fired pizza oven, with the pressure you would experience 2km under the sea. To create those conditions on a scale sufficient to produce 160 million tonnes of ammonia a year - the majority of which is used for fertiliser - the Haber-Bosch process today consumes more than 1% of all the world's energy. That is a lot of carbon emissions. And there is another very serious ecological concern. Only some of the nitrogen in fertiliser makes its way via crops into human stomachs, perhaps as little as 15%. Most of it ends up in the air or water. This is a problem for several reasons. Compounds like nitrous oxide are powerful greenhouse gases. They pollute drinking water. They also create acid rain, which makes soils more acidic, disrupting ecosystems, and threatening biodiversity. Phosphorus and other nutrients can create marine dead zones such as this one in the Gulf of Mexico When nitrogen compounds run off into rivers, they likewise promote the growth of some organisms more than others. The results include ocean ""dead zones"", where blooms of algae near the surface block out sunlight and kill the fish below. The Haber-Bosch process is not the only cause of these problems, but it is a major one, and it is not going away. Demand for fertiliser is projected to double in the coming century. In truth, scientists still do not fully understand the long-term impact on the environment of converting so much stable, inert nitrogen from the air into various other, highly reactive chemical compounds. We are in the middle of a global experiment. One result is already clear: plenty of food for lots more people. If you look at a graph of global population, you will see it shoot upwards just as Haber-Bosch fertilisers start being widely applied. Again, Haber-Bosch was not the only reason for the spike in food yields. New varieties of crops like wheat andricealso played their part. Still, if we farmed with the best techniques available in Fritz Haber's time, the earth would support about four billion people. Our current population is around seven and a half billion, and growing. New strains of rice such as the IR8 variety first planted in 1967 also boosted the global food supply Back in 1909, as Haber triumphantly demonstrated his ammonia process, he could hardly have imagined how transformative his work would be. On one side of the ledger, food to feed billions more human souls; on the other, a sustainability crisis that will need more genius to solve. For Haber himself, the consequences of his work were not what he expected. As a young man, he converted from Judaism to Christianity, aching to be accepted as a German patriot. Beyond his work on weaponising chlorine, the Haber-Bosch process also helped Germany in World War One. Ammonia can make explosives, as well as fertiliser. Not just bread from air, but bombs too. When the Nazis took power in the 1930s, however, none of this outweighed his Jewish roots. Stripped of his job and kicked out of the country, Haber died, in a Swiss hotel, a broken man.

"This video can not be played The Sound of 2017: Nadia Rose Young UK rapper Nadia Rose hastaken fifth place on the BBC's Sound of 2017 list, which showcases emerging artists for the coming 12 months. Alongside the likes of Little Simz and Lady Leshurr, she's part of a groundswell of female voices in the male-dominated world of UK hip-hop and grime. Two years ago, the 23-year-old was studying for a degree while working 12-hour shifts in a betting shop to make ends meet. She would scribble down lyrics in her spare time as her male contemporaries - Section Boyz, Bonkaz and her cousin Stormzy - were starting to break through. Realising the job was holding her back, she packed it in and started to make her name with her savage, witty lyrics and sense of fun. Her breakthrough video, Station, was shot, without permission, at a local railway station, with Nadia dancing nonchalantly on the tracks as a train pulled in. More recently, the colourful, funky single Skwod saw the rapper take over the streets of London with a girl gang, complete with body-popping Beyonce choreography and all. She spoke to the BBC about her upbringing in Croydon, the rappers she looks up to, and why she read the dictionary as a child. 5.Nadia Rose 4.Jorja Smith 3.Raye 2.Rag 'N' Bone Man 1.Ray BLK For people who haven't heard you, describe what they're missing. My sound is just really bassy, hard-hitting, dancehall, hip-hop infused fun. I call it magic. And funny, too. Your lyrics have proper punchlines. Yeah, quite a few! Do you work hard on them? It varies, depending on what it is I'm creating. A lot of the time I don't even write the bars. It's all in my head, really. The rapper says her verses are ""full of fun, full of energy"" Apparently you used to read the dictionary as a child? That is true, yeah! What's your favourite word? Antidisestablishmentarianism. It's one of the longest words in the English language. Have you ever tried to get it into a song? I've been asked and I'm definitely working on it! It might not fit on a single cover, but it could definitely fit in a lyric. What triggered your interest in words? It was learning about synonyms that did it for me. I was like, ""Wow, you can use another word to mean the same thing as this word?"" It just went crazy from there. This video can not be played Nadia Rose performs Tight Up for BBC Music Sound of 2017 When did you first perform in public? Oohâ¦ The first time I performed in public? To be fair, growing up I was always performing. It didn't have to be on a stage. It could be a family event and I would just make it about me, somehow. I would perform anywhere. Going up in a lift, on the side of a road, wherever. One of your teachers said you were the most entertaining pupil she ever had. Yeah, that was touchingâ¦ And actually, I do agree. There's a fine line between ""entertaining"" and ""troublemaker"". How often did you end up on the wrong side? Ha ha! Some days it did tip over into what some teachers would call ""disruptive"". But I thought it was creative. What did you study at university? Music and music management. It was very helpful when signing my deal - because there were things I definitely wouldn't have had a clue about prior to taking that course. At the same time as studying, you were working at a betting shop and making music in your spare time. Did you get any sleep? Nah, barely. All my free time was up in the studio. I just had a feeling I was giving music my spare time, rather than my time. It got to a point where it felt very weird and I thought, ""This is all the wrong way round. I'm getting too comfortable at work and keeping music as a little side thing."" I needed to give it my all to actually get the results that I wanted. The video for Skwod captures the star's charisma and personality Your dad was an MC too. How instrumental was he in your musical education? He played a huge part in all of this. He had quite an eclectic music taste, but there was loads of Sizzla, Buju Banton, a lot of the old-school reggae guys. That's where that part of my musical personality comes from. Who were the MCs you listened to growing up? In terms of MCs and rappers, it was definitely a lot of the hip-hop legends, like Busta, Eminem, Missy, Lil Kim. But I wasn't just inspired by MCs. I was a huge Spice Girls fan, too. Which one were you? They called me Wavey Spice! [Wavey is London slang for cool/good.] There weren't many female MCs in the UK to look up to. Well, there was Ms Dynamite. Seeing what she was able to achieve was inspiring. How do you feel about the current wave of female MCs? It's a good time and hopefully it'll continue to build. Why do you think it's happening now? Probably me! I bringing them with me! I saw afreestyle you recorded for SB:TV,externalwhere you said you'd been told to ""get naked and wear thongs"" to sell records. Was that based on real experience? It's from personal experience as well as people that have told me stories. As women in this male-dominated field, we've all been approached with something along those lines at one point. It happens, but we have to be able to overcome it. Rose risked life and limb to make the video for Station I need to ask about the video to Station... I was worried you might die on the train tracks. A few people were, including my mum. How dangerous was it? It was literally by chance that we survived. There was no real planning. We didn't even get permission. Recently I found out we got the train times wrong. The train that would have been coming on the other side was actually due at the time we got off the tracksâ¦ We thought we had a good five minutes spare, but we had seconds. Network Railhas asked the BBC to point out that, while they applaud Nadia Rose on her success, they were concerned to see her music video set on the working railway. A spokesperson said: ""Trespassing on the railway is highly dangerous and can maim or kill you. As the operator of the railway, Network Rail has a responsibility for keeping passengers and visitors safe and we take these responsibilities very seriously. No one wants to stop people from having innocent fun but they should do so safely without putting their lives at risk."" The other notable thing about that video, and Skwod too, is how much charisma you have. Were you always a natural in front of the camera? Yeah, basically. I'm in my element. I'm doing the thing I love and I'm being able to share that with people. Nadia Rose: ""I definitely need a Grammy under my belt"" This summer, you got to go to Rio for a grime showcase at the British embassy. What was that like? That was amazing. I loved Rio. Just to be part of the Olympics was extra-special, again with my squad. I look forward to going again. You'd expect the British embassy to choose something more boring, like Sting... Well, I'm actually a huge Sting fan. I wouldn't call him boring, but I get what you mean. It was definitely good to bring my sound over there. So what's your plan for 2017? It's going to be filled with a lot of music, a lot of visuals. If you thought this year was the Nadia Rose takeover, you have no idea! What's your biggest ambition? I definitely need a Grammy under me belt. One at least. At the very least. To bring a Grammy back to Croydon, how would that be, eh?

"Turkish police stand guard at the scene of the Istanbul nightclub attack The Daily Telegraph is one of a number of papers to report on the terrorist attack in Istanbul. It says a blurry picture of the gunman,external, who killed 39 people, is emerging, with reports that he may be from Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan. Writing in the i,external, Patrick Cockburn says it is clear the Turkish government does not know what to do to stop such attacks. He says they are likely to continue because so-called IS is too big and well-resourced to be eliminated. He notes that, as in France and Germany, it is impossible to stop attacks when ordinary civilians are the targets and the killers are prepared to die. The Times reports on a survey of doctors that suggests most believe,externalGP surgeries should be placed in A&E departments to deal with patients who do not need emergency treatment. The study of more than 500 doctors by the Press Association found most believed such a move was necessary to relieve the pressure on A&E. The Daily Mail highlights official NHS figures,externalshowing that about 13% of patients who attend A&E have minor problems and are discharged without treatment. TheFinancial Times,externalsays economists are more worried about the consequences of Brexit than they were a year ago, despite the economy showing little obvious damage since the vote in June to leave the EU. The FT's annual survey of UK economists, which had 122 responses, found a large majority expect growth to slow in 2017 as higher inflation hits household incomes. The paper notes that attacks on the profession, especially by Leave campaigners, have not led to a significant change of thinking about Brexit. Department store Harrods is being accused of short-changing some of its staff,according to the Guardian,external. The paper says a trade union is claiming the owners are keeping up to 75% of service charges in the store's cafes and restaurants. A spokeswoman for Harrods tells the paper that service charges are shared out among staff members - but only if they accept a cut in basic pay. The paper says it is the latest in a series of examples where high-profile hospitality firms and businesses have been found to be withholding service charges and tips from workers. The future of village halls is under threat,warns the Daily Telegraph,external, because communities are struggling to find young volunteers to help run them. It says the halls, of which there are said to be around 10,000 in Britain, are the cornerstones of many villages. But it says younger residents often work long hours away from their village, while the newly retired often do not want to commit to the duties required. Finally, theDaily Star is warning of bad weather,external, stating that its going to be the ""coldest January ever"". The paper predicts temperatures will drop to -15C in parts of the country, with heavy snow expected too. It adds that ""transport chaos is almost certain"".
