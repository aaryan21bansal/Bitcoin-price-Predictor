"Palestinian witnesses say a building was struck in Gaza City - Israel says it hit militant training sites Israel has carried out its biggest attack against Hamas militant targets in Gaza since the war in 2014, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says. The raids were a response to rockets fired into Israel, he said. Hamas said a truce had been agreed, but further exchanges have been reported. Palestinian health officials said two people were killed and 12 injured in an air strike in Gaza City on Saturday. Three Israelis were hurt by one of the rockets fired on Israel. More than 200 projectiles - including rockets and mortars - had been fired into Israel since Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. The IDF said it had struck facilities used by Hamas, which dominates Gaza, including a battalion headquarters in Beit Lahia, a training camp located in a high-rise building in the al-Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza, weapons storage facilities and rocket launchers.

""In consultation with the minister of defence, the chief of staff and the top security command of the state of Israel, we have decided on strong action against Hamas terrorism,"" Mr Netanyahu said in a video statement. ""The IDF have struck Hamas with the hardest blow since Operation Protective Edge and we will increase the strength of our attacks as necessary,"" he added, referring to the 2014 conflict. However, Palestinian officials said a ceasefire had now been agreed thanks to ""Egyptian and international efforts"". Israel has not commented on the report, although Reuters quoted an unnamed Israeli defence official a saying ""only the facts on the ground will dictate our further response"". Witnesses told Reuters news agency an Israeli strike had hit an empty building in Gaza City and that the casualties were passers-by. Hamas said another Palestinian had died after being shot by Israeli troops during border protests on Friday. The IDF said dozens of rockets had been fired on Israel from within Gaza. More than 90 rockets are reported to have fallen in Israel One rocket hit a home in the town of Sderot. Three people suffered shrapnel wounds. The attacks come amid an escalation of violence in the region in recent months. They coincided with mass demonstrations along the border which saw thousands of Palestinians express their support for the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel - as well as demanding an end to the blockade of Gaza imposed by Israel and Egypt. This video can not be played How kites and balloons became militant weapons Israel and Egypt say the blockade is a necessary security measure against militants. Gaza health officials say more than 130 Palestinians were killed and 15,000 others injured by Israeli forces during the protests. Human rights groups have accused Israeli troops of using excessive force. Israel says it has only opened fire in self-defence or on people trying to infiltrate its territory under the cover of the demonstrations. Hamas, an Islamist militant group, does not recognise Israel's right to exist and there has been violence and wars between the two sides for many years.

"Theresa May held talks with the US president during his UK visit The prime minister has warned Conservative MPs that they could be putting Brexit at risk. Some long-standing Leave campaigners are unhappy with herBrexit White Paper,externalwhich proposes a common rulebook with the EU for traded goods. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Theresa May urged the country to ""keep their eye on the prize"". Her message comes ahead of crucial Commons votes on trade and customs policy next week. Some members of her party's European Research Group (ERG) want to amend that legislation to scupper Mrs May's plans. The White Paper, which sparked the resignations of ministers Boris Johnson and David Davis, is aimed at ensuring trade co-operation, with no hard border for Northern Ireland, and global trade deals for the UK. Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg called it a ""bad deal for Britain"". US President Donald Trumptold the Sun newspaper,externalthe proposals would ""probably kill"" a trade deal with his country. Hours later, however, he said a US-UK trade deal would ""absolutely be possible"". Trump: US-UK trade deal 'absolutely possible' Reality Check: What does Brexit White Paper reveal? Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan Mrs May said she has not seen any workable alternative to the White Paper - so voting against her legislation could lead to a ""disorderly and damaging Brexit"". The prime minister said the legacy of Brexit ""cannot be a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland"". She added that Brexit must not destroy the ""integrated supply chains and just-in-time processes on which jobs and livelihoods depend"". But Mrs May did offer some reassurance to those who worry she will make further concessions to Brussels. ""Our Brexit deal is not some long wish-list from which negotiators get to pick and choose,"" she wrote. ""It is a complete plan with a set of outcomes that are non-negotiable."" She added her Brexit plan would ""end"" both the free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. This video can not be played Why Tory MPs are fighting over the government's Brexit white paper Long-standing Leave campaigners are not the only group likely to revolt, however. There are also fears that some former Remainers in her party will vote with Labour to compel her to negotiate a fully-fledged customs union with the EU. ""This would be the ultimate betrayal of the Brexit vote,"" she says. On Thursday, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he would analyse the details with the European Parliament and member states and was ""looking forward"" to negotiations with the UK next week. The UK is hoping the EU will back the White Paper proposals so an exit deal can be struck by the autumn, ahead of the UK's official departure from the EU in March. 18 October 2018:The key EU summit.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump was booed by protesters while playing golf at Turnberry Thousands took to the streets of Edinburgh ina third day of protestsagainst Donald Trump's UK visit. They demonstrated as the US president played golf during a visit to his Turnberry resort on the Ayrshire coast. Mr Trump is in Scotland on a private visit with his family ahead of a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. No protesters were arrested in Scotland, but the Met Police said 12 people were detained following pro-Trump processions in London. Report: Trump in Scotland Meet the people who said no to Trump Trump's golf round held up celebrant During his Saturday afternoon golf game he was booed by demonstrators gathered at the perimeter of the Turnberry complex. Earlier, Police Scotland confirmed that they were investigating how aparaglider was able to fly over the resort hotelwith a banner criticising Mr Trump. The president's visit to Scotland has been accompanied by a major security operation. Police snipers are positioned on tiers of temporary scaffolding overlooking the golf course, with a large number of other officers patrolling the grounds and surrounding area. The march and protest in Edinburgh began at midday on Saturday The police estimated that 9,000 people joined the Edinburgh demonstration. Organisers said they believed some 60,000 had taken to the streets Mr Trump travelled north of the border for the weekend after meeting Prime Minister Theresa May at Chequers and The Queen at Windsor on Friday. Speaking after talks with Mrs May,the president said a US-UK trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"". That came just hours after he told The Sun Theresa May's Brexit plan could kill an agreement. Mr Trump has often spoken of his love for Scotland and its people and had been a regular visitor to the country for many years, but this is his first trip since becoming the US leader. Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell greeted Mr Trump after his Air Force One jet landed at Prestwick Airport in Scotland on Friday evening. The American president did not meet Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, however, she denied she had refused to see him. At a gay pride event in Glasgow on Saturday, she told the BBC: ""If the opportunity arises to meet the president I will do that and I'm sure if the opportunity arises in the future we will have lots to talk about, including the close and very important links between our two countries. ""In democracies, it's also important to be able to focus also on where we perhaps disagree, and lots of people disagree with the policies of the Trump administration."" Donald Trump spent most of Saturday afternoon playing a game of golf at Turnberry, the course he bought in 2014 Snipers are positioned around the resort, with a heavy police presence While Mr Trump was at Turnberry, police estimated that about 9,000 protesters walked from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh to the Meadows for a ""carnival of resistance"". The event featured the giant Trump Baby balloon, which was banned from both Turnberry and Holyrood. Trump blames Obama over 'Russian hacking' Trump arrives in Scotland amid protests Trump: US-UK trade deal 'absolutely possible' In Pictures: Trump's UK visit and protests Reality Check: The challenges ahead for a trade deal Tens of thousands of people - organisers claim up to 250,000 - protested in London on Friday against Mr Trump's UK visit. Demonstrators also filled George Square in Glasgow ahead of his arrival in Scotland. However, the UK government's  International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC that the anti-Trump campaigners were ""an embarrassment to themselves"". He believed that the large scale protests in London and other cities ""did not reflect the genuine good manners and hospitality of the British people"". As well as the protests in Edinburgh and at Turnberry, there were supporters of Mr Trump at London's ""Welcome Trump"" and ""Free Tommy Robinson"" processions. English right-wing activist Robison is currentlyserving a 13 month jail sentence for potentially prejudicing a court case. The Met Police said that there were clashes during those processions and 12 people were arrested for a range of alleged crimes, including violent disorder, assault and and public order offences. This video can not be played Liam Fox: 'Trump protesters an embarrassment to themselves' Mr Trump - whose mother was Scottish - and members of his family are spending the weekend at the hotel he bought in 2014 before departing on Sunday for the meeting with Russian leader Mr Putin in Finland the following day. The paraglider stunt, which happened shortly after Mr Trump and his entourage arrived at Turnberry, was reportedly staged by Greenpeace. Ben Stewart, a spokesman for the organisation, told the BBC: ""It wasn't dangerous at all. We let the police know about 10 or 15 minutes before that we were coming in. ""We phoned them, we had someone on the police line who informed them. We thought it was important that the president actually saw a real-life protester. ""There's tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of people on the streets around the UK."" The police said no arrest had been made. This video can not be played Glider protester at Trump's resort Police insisted they wanted to strike a balance between ""protection and public safety and the public's right to peacefully protest"". However, Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams said officers were committed to tracing the person who flew the aircraft. He added: ""There are armed assets protecting the president - both from the US Secret Service and ourselves and the Met Police, who offer a close protection function as well. ""And there's no doubt anybody who breaches security around him puts themselves in grave danger. ""On this occasion we could assess the situation and we realised there was no direct threat to the president however it's absolutely something that is very serious."" As well as playing host to one of the world's most powerful men, Turnberry was the venue for a wedding on Saturday afternoon.

"George Smith thought he might miss the wedding when he was stopped at a checkpoint A celebrant who was due to marry a couple at Trump Turnberry on Saturday feared he would miss the wedding when a security checkpoint would not let him through. The timing of Mr Trump's venture onto the golf course at the Ayrshire resort coincided with George Smith's arrival to perform the wedding ceremony. Traffic movement was halted when the US President headed to the fairway. The bride had to alert police to let the celebrant through in time. George told the BBC: ""I was driving towards the hotel and I was stopped at a checkpoint. I knew there would be checks so I brought my driving licence and passport. ""I was on the list of people attending the wedding so I wasn't worried. ""But they told me that something was happening and they had stopped all traffic from entering. They weren't going to let me in. They said I had to wait."" George was stopped at three security checkpoints and was worried he would not get through Panicking about getting there on time, George had to call the bride who then told the hotel what had happened. He said: ""She spoke to the hotel who took my car registration and sent the police out to let me in. I made it with only 15 minutes to get ready."" George found out what the problem was: ""Mr Trump was going to play golf. They said he was 'out and about' so things changed. ""When he was in the hotel people were allowed to come and go. But he was out and about to go to the golf course and all the traffic was stopped."" The happy couple had been told the Trump visit would not impact on their big day. But George said it certainly was no ordinary wedding. Mr Trump's golf game meant all traffic movement had to stop ""They had a lovely ceremony. Once we started we were in a bubble. They could still go outside for photographs."" But the couple were warned the US President may make an appearance at the reception. George said: ""They have been advised that they may receive a visit. Mr Trump is aware they were getting married in his hotel today. ""If he did pop in, it would make their wedding totally unique. Something to tell the grandchildren. ""The fact he was there means their day was special and totally different from anyone else's.""

" Donald Trump came to Scotland to build the world’s greatest golf course on spectacular sand dunes on the Aberdeenshire coast. He fought and won the planning rights to do so - bulldozing his way through environmental objections with the bold promise of a £1bn investment and thousands of jobs. In pursuit of his vision, he clashed with politicians, nature lovers and even his own neighbours. In Scotland they’ve been hitting back at Mr Trump for more than a decade. Two flags flutter in the breeze on top of what used to be the coastguard station at Menie, on the Aberdeenshire coast in north-eastern Scotland. The Mexican flag flies from David Milne's home From this buff-coloured block of 1950s architecture, there are stunning views over Donald Trump’s golf course, across marram grass-covered sand dunes  out to the North Sea. The couple who have made this converted watch house their home are David and Moira Milne. From their roof they fly the Scottish saltire, white on blue and - more curiously - the green, white and red tricolour of Mexico. The Milnes hoisted the Mexican flag in solidarity with that country when Mr Trump promised to build a wall on their border and make them pay for it. “He’s already tried that here,” says David. “He built a fence and sent us a bill.” David and Moira enjoyed stunning views along the coastline The Milnes’ house and garden are like an island, encircled by Trump-owned land. The Trump Organization erected a fence to mark the boundary between their properties and wanted them to pay half the cost. They said the Milnes had built an extension that strayed across the boundary. It was just one of several clashes between the man who would become president of the United States and a quiet-living couple from Aberdeenshire. Mr Trump bought Menie, a former shooting estate eight miles north of Aberdeen, in 2006. He did so with a grand design in mind. To develop this windswept stretch of sand dunes, meadow and woodland into a 1,500-acre golf resort with a championship course as its centrepiece. The Milnes resisted Trump attempts to buy their property We are going to build the greatest golf course in the world, this house is ugly” It took six years of wrangling before the first phase was completed. The Milnes got on the wrong side of Mr Trump because they refused to sell to him. And he made no secret of the fact he wanted them to leave. On one visit to Menie, he was filmed looking up at their house from the passenger seat of a Range Rover on land earmarked for his golf course. “I want to get rid of that house” he said. When advised by an employee that this approach could cause a “bit of stir” he replied: “Who cares, who cares, you know what, who cares? We are going to build the greatest golf course in the world, this house is ugly.” Mr Trump seemed to feel the same way about other dwellings overlooking his property. He famously accused local farmer and salmon fisherman, Michael Forbes of living in a “pig-like atmosphere”. All refused to leave their homes. The Trump Organization raised the possibility of using compulsory purchase powers to force them out but eventually dropped the idea. Mr Forbes painted anti-Trump slogans on his green corrugated-iron shed and became a hero to those opposed to the billionaire’s development plans. He won a national award for his defiant spirit, prompting Mr Trump to threaten to withdraw business from the whisky company that sponsored it. Mr Forbes has rusting machinery, fishing gear and any amount of farmyard jumble lying in the grounds around his house and outbuildings. The appearance contrasts sharply with the carefully manicured fairways of Trump International Golf Links. But Mr Forbes insists he was not hurt by Mr Trump’s “pigsty” jibe. He says he and his mother - who lives there too - laughed it off because they regard Mr Trump as “a clown”. Michael Forbes and his mother think Trump is “a clown” There was further dispute with the Milnes when the Trump  construction team mounded earth around their property. It was later removed. We have a great relationship with the vast majority of our neighbours” And then there was the tree planting. The Milnes’ views up and down the coast used to be completely uninterrupted - but one day that changed. David was at work when his phone rang. It was Moira. “They’ve got a digger at the front of the house and they are planting trees,” she told him. It appeared to be an attempt to screen off the property from view by golfers. Asked to explain, Sarah Malone - who is in charge of Trump's Scottish business interests - said: “We have the right to plant trees and you know it’s our land. Why wouldn’t we plant trees?” She denied there was any attempt to bully the Milnes. “We have a great relationship with the vast majority of our neighbours,” she said. In much of the Scottish media, Mr Trump has been portrayed as a neighbour from hell bullying the locals to get his own way. It is what he might nowadays dismiss as “fake news” that ignores the jobs, investment and visitors he has brought to the area. The Milnes were not able to stop him developing the Menie estate but they have successfully resisted his attempts to get them out. And Mr Trump also failed to stop some new neighbours arriving in the area. They are electricity generating giants - the largest in Scottish waters and among the most advanced anywhere in the world. Each of the 11 turbines that make up the Aberdeen offshore wind farm stands 191m tall. Each blade spans 80m. Together they should generate enough power for 80,000 homes. Although they are sited more than a mile off the Aberdeenshire coast, they are strikingly obvious to anyone playing a round on Donald Trump’s golf course. Some may find them aesthetically pleasing, relaxing even. But to Mr Trump they are an eyesore. He did everything he could to stop them being built, but failed. Mr Trump is not a fan of wind power. He hates it with a passion. He argued that developing a wind energy industry in Scotland would ruin the environment, the tourist economy and trigger riots across the country. “They are so unattractive, so ugly, so noisy and so dangerous that, if Scotland does this, I think Scotland will be in serious trouble,” he told the Scottish Parliament in 2012. Appearing before a committee of MSPs, he accused two first ministers of Scotland of luring him to invest with false promises. Mr Trump had been friendly with both Labour’s Jack McConnell and his Scottish National Party successor Alex Salmond. Both had visited the tycoon during trips to New York for the annual Tartan Day celebrations. Both were very keen to secure his investment for Scotland. Mr Trump claimed they had privately assured him there was no way a wind farm would be allowed near his course. Both politicians strongly denied giving any such assurances. Having made his opposition to wind farms abundantly clear, the Scottish Parliament asked Mr Trump for his evidence that they would be economically ruinous for Scotland. He came out with a Trump classic. “I am considered a world class expert in tourism,” he replied. “So when you say ‘where is the expert and where is the evidence’ - I am the evidence!” The Scottish Parliament was not persuaded. Neither were the courts. In 2015 the UK Supreme Court rejected his attempts to block the wind development. Mr Trump claims the wind turbines damage the natural environment at the Menie estate. But his critics say his golf course has destroyed it. The northern part of the course covers part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) regarded as one of Britain’s best examples of a mobile sand dune system. Before construction work began in 2010 the dune system moved north at substantial speeds - up to 11m per year across an area of about 15 hectares. It was a living landscape, constantly evolving. Construction vehicles on the Menie Estate in 2010 Government agency Scottish Natural Heritage has been monitoring the impact of the course on the landscape and plant life. It found habitat loss and damage to the dune system. Dr Jim Hansom, a geomorphologist from Glasgow University, says he would be “absolutely surprised” if the sand dunes were allowed to keep their SSSI status. “It really should be de-notified because there’s no dynamism involved in that site now and that was the original justification for its notification,” he says. “It’s been ruined from a virgin undeveloped wilderness site into something that’s relatively manicured.” Scottish Natural Heritage, which objected to the original development, is assessing the scale of the damage to decide whether parts of the Menie site should lose SSSI protection. It’s been ruined from a virgin undeveloped wilderness site” Ms Malone says the Trump Organization is relaxed about the outcome. “I don’t think it matters to us. It may matter to other people and we’ll be comfortable with whatever the option and the decision on that is,” she says. Ms Malone insists that the Trump approach to environmental matters has been “first class”. The deterioration of the sand dunes was predicted long before the wind farm row, and long before the first bulldozer arrived on the Menie estate.  But those who gave Mr Trump the go-ahead decided it was a price worth paying for what he promised. A promise that, if not broken, is far from fulfilled. Ten years ago, the man who now occupies the Oval Office was invited to Aberdeenshire to give evidence at a public local inquiry about his golf course plans. The Menie resort is officially opened in July 2012 It was set up to examine the arguments for and against what Mr Trump said would be the world’s greatest golf course on the protected sand dunes. Environmentalists claimed he was overstating its potential in order to justify building part of his course on the site. But in his evidence in June 2008, Mr Trump insisted the Menie estate had the rare qualities required for a world-beating golf course. There were many bold claims about the proposed resort with big numbers attached. It was supposed to be a £1bn investment, creating about 6,000 jobs. It was to include not one but two championship golf courses, a 450-bedroom hotel and almost 1,500 holiday and residential homes. The massive scale of this promised investment was suitably beguiling. It persuaded the local inquiry team and even government ministers that the economic benefit justified the environmental impact. Telling the 2008 inquiry how Menie would make a world-class golf course The Scottish government controversially called in Mr Trump’s planning application for a national decision after it was thrown out by Aberdeenshire Council. In November 2008 they granted him the planning permission he desired. In those days Mr Trump was still chummy with Scotland’s first minister Alex Salmond, who was also the local MSP in Aberdeenshire. As first minister he was able to give the Trump team direct access to Scotland’s chief planner. Salmond would be accused of misusing his position to help a billionaire, but a parliamentary inquiry found he had not broken the rules. The first ball is hit at Trump International Golf Links Scotland Much of what was promised by Mr Trump has yet to materialise. By 2018 the resort included one golf course and a club house, a 16-bedroom boutique hotel and some lodges. The Trump Organization says it has spent around £100m, which is about 10% of what was promised. It says about 500 people were involved in construction and that it employs 150 people, including part-time and seasonal staff. Mr Salmond, who supported the golf development as local MSP, says that is nowhere near good enough. “The people who were putting it forward did not live up and honour the agreements they made to the Scottish people,” he says. A decade on, the Trump-Salmond relationship has soured. Global circumstances have also changed. The financial crisis intensified in late 2008, just as Mr Trump was granted planning permission for the golf course. More recently the 2014 oil price crash hit the Aberdeenshire economy hard. Mr Trump did not use either as an excuse for delaying development. Instead, he put much of it on hold while he fought his legal battle against the wind farm. Mr Salmond branded Mr Trump a “three-time loser” in 2015 when he lost a third attempt to block the wind project at the UK Supreme Court. Mr Trump hit back calling Mr Salmond “a has-been and totally irrelevant”. Their bitter feud has never really stopped. With the wind farm fight decided, the leader of Aberdeenshire Council, Jim Gifford, has called on the Trump Organization to finish the job they began at Menie. A flying visit to Aberdeenshire during the US presidential campaign “I think they have an obligation to bring forward what they promised, that’s the bottom line of it,” he says. “The difficulty we have is we can’t force them to do that.” Even if we’d only spent £10m that should be celebrated” But the Trump Organization says it does not need to be forced, because it remains committed to further development. “We haven’t finished,” says Ms Malone. “It’s a multi-phase project and we’re not stupid. This wasn’t going to get built overnight. “It’s a long-term investment opportunity for us and that’s how Mr Trump has always approached it. Even if we’d only spent £10m that should be celebrated.” What has been built so far is celebrated by some, especially in the Aberdeenshire business community. And the course itself, designed by Martin Hawtree, is frequently listed among the world’s great golf courses. Golf Monthly describes it as “a masterpiece, an instant classic”. Mr Trump courted, then clashed with Scotland’s political leaders as he sought to get his own way with the golf development. But it’s nothing compared to how relations deteriorated when he ran for president. While running for office in December 2015, Donald Trump suggested banning citizens from majority Muslim countries entering the US.  There was outrage in Scotland. Scotland’s new first minister Nicola Sturgeon removed his status as a “Global Scot” - a business ambassador who acts for Scotland on the world stage. It was a symbolic gesture soon followed by another, as Aberdeen’s Robert Gordon University took back the honorary degree they had bestowed upon the businessman in 2010. As the Scottish Parliament election approached in 2016, Scottish party leaders across the political spectrum became bolder in their opposition. Donald Trump receiving an honorary degree from Robert Gordon University in 2010 (it was later revoked) Labour’s Kezia Dugdale described Candidate Trump as “an arse” and travelled to the United States to campaign for Hillary Clinton. And Ruth Davidson of the Scottish Conservatives told a TV debate she had “too much faith in the people of the US to ever let that man anywhere near the White House”. At that same debate Ms Sturgeon said “we should all rejoice” when the American people “send Donald Trump packing”. When asked how she’d handle a phone call from President Trump if he did win the election, she imagined herself saying: “I’m on the other line, sorry.” She imagined incorrectly. A few months later she took that call. Mr Trump phoned to thank her for the letter which she wrote congratulating him on his victory. It probably wasn’t the easiest letter she’s had to write. At the same time protesters took to the streets of Scotland’s cities, when the newly inaugurated president enacted his controversial travel ban in January 2017. Nicola Sturgeon had not anticipated a Trump victory Ms Sturgeon has continued to speak out against some of Mr Trump’s policies, such as the detention of child migrants separated from their parents. On visits to the US she has prioritised business links over engagement with the Trump administration and met some of his high-profile critics, including Hillary Clinton. The first minister has said she would be prepared to meet the president when he visits Scotland, butno plans were madefor her to see him during his latest trip. There are those who think it was a mistake for Scotland’s politicians to take sides in a foreign election against the man who now occupies the highest political office on the planet. Trump’s travel ban brought protests to Edinburgh in 2017 “It was very unseemly. It’s not what you do,” says Sebastian Gorka, a former adviser to the Trump administration. He warns that there could be repercussions for Scotland. “You’d have to ask the president but he has a very, very long memory. He doesn’t forget stuff.” American-Scot Jack Perry takes the view that ignoring any president is not an option. Mr Perry was head of the development agency Scottish Enterprise when Mr Trump first mooted building his golf course. “You can dislike the man, you can dislike his politics, you can dislike his public pronouncements,” he says. “But there still has to be some respect for the office. I don’t think you have any choice but to deal with him.” It is especially difficult to ignore a US president who now owns two major golf resorts in your country. Donald Trump never made any secret of his ambition to bring major golf tournaments to Scotland.  “I think we’ll have the Ryder Cup,” he said in 2013. “I think we’ll have the Open. I think we will have many, many great tournaments over the years.” A year later he added a second Scottish property to his golf portfolio - the famous Turnberry resort in Ayrshire. His investment here was far less controversial than his dealings in Aberdeenshire. He restored a fading classic to grandeur - adding a ballroom, chandeliers and a touch of Trump bling. Improvements to the courses at Trump Turnberry have been well received. It was described as “a jewel in the crown of Ayrshire” by Val Russell from the local chamber of commerce. She said dealings with the Trump Organization had been nothing but positive. But neither of Mr Trump’s Scottish venues has yet been awarded the right to host a major yet. So far, that ambition is unfulfilled. And it seems to play on the president’s mind. He may have temporarily handed control of his businesses to his sons, but golf and Scotland remain something of a pre-occupation. When the Wall Street Journal was invited into the White House for an interview, his mind strayed in that direction. In the middle of a conversation about post-Brexit trade, he wondered if Scotland might hold a second independence referendum. If it did, he thought this would be “terrible”. Chief among his apparent concerns, it seems, was the impact on golf in an independent Scotland. “What would they do with the British Open if they ever got out?” he asked. “They’d no longer have the British Open. Keep it in Scotland”. A family affair: Trump Turnberry is opened in 2016 But the Open may not come Mr Trump’s way. At least not while he’s president. No matter how good his courses, the Trump brand is just too controversial for some tournaments and their sponsors. Take the Scottish Open championship, part of the European tour, for example. It’s sponsored by Aberdeen Standard Investments.  Its joint chief executive, Martin Gilbert, is a friend of the president and attended his inauguration. Mr Gilbert has expressed a desire to take the Scottish Open back to Aberdeenshire - but not to Mr Trump’s Menie resort. “Trump’s is a great course but there are issues if we went there - and the worst thing would be if he came,” Mr Gilbert said in 2017. “Politics aside, Trump would be an ideal venue but you can’t put politics aside.” We are in uncharted territory with the president’s family owning golf courses” The Royal and Ancient (R&A) - the governing body that decides where the Open is played - has a greater dilemma. They already have Turnberry on the official rota of venues that host the tournament. The Open was last at Turnberry in 2009, before Mr Trump took over, and would be expected to secure a return visit fairly soon. The next available year is 2022. But the decision will likely have to be taken while he is still in office. “For all of us in the game, we are in uncharted territory here with the president’s family owning golf courses,” says R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers. “We’re all learning as we go.” It’s possible that Turnberry will remain an Open venue without actually hosting it again until Mr Trump leaves the White House. That would certainly avoid the inevitable howl of protest and a potential boycott. Despite all the rebuffs he’s had in Scotland, Mr Trump is not one who gives up without a fight. As Malone puts it: “We absolutely will host majors. That’s why it was designed.” The Menie development was also intended - according to Mr Trump - as a tribute to his Scottish mother, Mary-Anne MacLeod, who was born and raised on the isle of Lewis. Mr Trump’s hotel here, a restored baronial mansion from the early 19th Century, is named MacLeod House in her memory. Further development of the resort may be required if it is to host big tournaments. The Trump Organization has already submitted a planning application for a second golf course. And despite the wind turbines President Trump loves to hate now being in place, the company he founded has also drawn up plans to build a resort village in Aberdeenshire. It includes a mixture of 550 residential homes and holiday accommodation, but no big hotel. The scene is set for a fresh fight with the planning authorities. The political atmosphere has changed a great deal since Donald Trump was being courted by successive Scottish governments in the mid-2000s. Politicians are much warier of him and his business empire now and would not want to be seen to give special favours. Yet if they want more Trump investment it seems further compromise will be required. A formal planning application was expected to be lodged in Aberdeenshire in early 2018. It has yet to materialise. And who knows when it will. That is as unpredictable as President Trump himself.

She added that Brexit must not destroy the ""integrated supply chains and just-in-time processes on which jobs and livelihoods depend"". But Mrs May did offer some reassurance to those who worry she will make further concessions to Brussels. ""Our Brexit deal is not some long wish-list from which negotiators get to pick and choose,"" she wrote. ""It is a complete plan with a set of outcomes that are non-negotiable.""

On Thursday, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he would analyse the details with the European Parliament and member states and was ""looking forward"" to negotiations with the UK next week.

"The team of volunteers began draining the lake on Saturday morning A marine lake in North Somerset is being drained after the discovery of high levels of bacteria from dog poo. Swimmers are being advised not to use Clevedon Marine Lake until it is drained and refilled by the high tides. Marine Lake Enthusiasts member Joe Norman said: ""The results came back with high levels of E Coli and they're two or three times higher than the levels recommended."" The issue came to light after people had ear infections after taking a dip. The draining began earlier on Saturday morning. ""We've got a team to come and open the sluices. ""It's a muscle effort as it's a worm and crank you have to turn 350 times to lift the sluices and they're well encrusted having been underwater for a long time,"" added Mr Norman. North Somerset Council's environmental health service manager, Dee Mawn, has also said there is a year-round dog ban at Marine Lake. She added: ""The order is in place for a reason - to reduce the risk of unfriendly bacteria draining into the lake. ""Unfortunately people are ignoring the order and, as much as we would like to think everyone picks up after their dogs, sadly some don't.

"A sea of placards, banners and chanting from thousands of demonstrators has washed through Edinburgh's city centre streets in protest against the US president's visit to the UK. The march, which started at the Scottish Parliament and ended in the Meadows was peaceful, with police confirming no arrests had been made. Organisers said 60,000 people took part in the day's events in the capital. But Police Scotland estimated the figure to be 9,000. Zainab Hussnain said she painted ""Dump Trump"" on her face and joined the protest after seeing children in cages on TV The march was led by a woman chanting through a public address system with the crowd repeating her. She was getting the crowd to chant: ""Children should be in the classroom, not in cages."" There was a high police presence with some of them armed. The march passed through Abbeyhill, the West End and Edinburgh University buildings in Buccleuch Place to reach the Meadows, where a Carnival of Resistance was held. As the march reached the Meadows, the Trump baby blimp was flown to a great cheer from the crowd. The start of the march, which had set off about 20 minutes later than the noon billing, reached the Meadows after about an hour. The tail end arrived about half an hour after that. Many carried placards with messages including ""Dump Trump"", ""Love Trumps Hate"", while others brought signs with messages for the American leader, including ""Tweet off Twitter twit"" and ""Bolt ya rocket"". Musicians got the crowd roused outside the Scottish Parliament Before leaving parliament, those attending listened to speeches from politicians including Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, SNP MP Tommy Sheppard and Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone. Mr Leonard told the crowd: ""We are here today standing shoulder to shoulder, all parties and none, all faiths and none, standing together in this capital to send a message out to the world that Scotland stands united against Trump. ""Donald Trump is not welcome here. The horrific scenes at the Mexican border are just the latest example of his repudiation of decent human values. Caging children like animals is barbaric and we simply cannot roll out the red carpet for a US president who treats people that way. ""These demonstrations are not simply just about the politics of Donald Trump, it is about his moral values as well."" Mr Sheppard said Mr Trump is now the ""international cheerleader for bigotry, intolerance and prejudice throughout the world"". He added: ""We need to stand up, and those values and that glib sincere method of delivering them hold no place in 21st century Scotland."" Those gathered at the Meadows heard speeches from campaigners punctuated by live music, while the Trump baby inflatable - depicting the US president as a nappy-clad baby holding a mobile phone - was flown in the background. Kirsty Haigh, an activist with Scotland United Against Trump and one of the organisers of the demonstration, said: ""When it became clear that he (Mr Trump) was coming here, it just made sense that we had to get out on the streets and we had to make it known to him loud and clear that we don't welcome him. ""But also to send a big message of solidarity and hope back to the people of America, back to the people who have been affected by his politics, saying we'll support you, we'll stand with you and we'll stand up against his abhorrent politics."" She said the turnout for the events in Edinburgh had ""surpassed all expectations"", adding: ""We reckon over 60,000 people have taken part in what's been happening, come to the parliament for the start, been on the march, been here at this amazing carnival of resistance."" Organisers said about 60,000 people attended the march in the capital Scottish human rights lawyer Aamer Anwar was at the front of the march before he addressed the crowd. Haylee, G Devils in Skirts changed many of their lyrics to anti-Trump ones Zainab Hussnain, 21, from Edinburgh, said she painted ""Dump Trump"" on her face and joined the protest after seeing children in cages on TV.

"Palestinian witnesses say a building was struck in Gaza City - Israel says it hit militant training sites Israel has carried out its biggest attack against Hamas militant targets in Gaza since the war in 2014, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says. The raids were a response to rockets fired into Israel, he said. Hamas said a truce had been agreed, but further exchanges have been reported. Palestinian health officials said two people were killed and 12 injured in an air strike in Gaza City on Saturday. Three Israelis were hurt by one of the rockets fired on Israel. More than 200 projectiles - including rockets and mortars - had been fired into Israel since Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. The IDF said it had struck facilities used by Hamas, which dominates Gaza, including a battalion headquarters in Beit Lahia, a training camp located in a high-rise building in the al-Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza, weapons storage facilities and rocket launchers.

""In consultation with the minister of defence, the chief of staff and the top security command of the state of Israel, we have decided on strong action against Hamas terrorism,"" Mr Netanyahu said in a video statement. ""The IDF have struck Hamas with the hardest blow since Operation Protective Edge and we will increase the strength of our attacks as necessary,"" he added, referring to the 2014 conflict. However, Palestinian officials said a ceasefire had now been agreed thanks to ""Egyptian and international efforts"". Israel has not commented on the report, although Reuters quoted an unnamed Israeli defence official a saying ""only the facts on the ground will dictate our further response"". Witnesses told Reuters news agency an Israeli strike had hit an empty building in Gaza City and that the casualties were passers-by. Hamas said another Palestinian had died after being shot by Israeli troops during border protests on Friday. The IDF said dozens of rockets had been fired on Israel from within Gaza. More than 90 rockets are reported to have fallen in Israel One rocket hit a home in the town of Sderot. Three people suffered shrapnel wounds. The attacks come amid an escalation of violence in the region in recent months. They coincided with mass demonstrations along the border which saw thousands of Palestinians express their support for the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel - as well as demanding an end to the blockade of Gaza imposed by Israel and Egypt. This video can not be played How kites and balloons became militant weapons Israel and Egypt say the blockade is a necessary security measure against militants. Gaza health officials say more than 130 Palestinians were killed and 15,000 others injured by Israeli forces during the protests. Human rights groups have accused Israeli troops of using excessive force. Israel says it has only opened fire in self-defence or on people trying to infiltrate its territory under the cover of the demonstrations. Hamas, an Islamist militant group, does not recognise Israel's right to exist and there has been violence and wars between the two sides for many years.

"Mont Blanc, with 11 peaks above 4,000m, is western Europe's highest mountain range France has issued a decree restricting access to the summit of the country's highest mountain, Mont Blanc. As a result of overcrowding and safety risks, climbers will not be allowed on the peak's popular ""Royal Route"" for the next eight days, officials said. But mountaineers who have already booked accommodation on the route will be permitted to climb. Concerns have been raised recently over the numbers of tourists visiting Mont Blanc in the summer. The restrictions, introduced on Saturday, mean that only climbers who can prove that they already have a booking at the high-altitude shelter known as the Gouter will be allowed to set out for the top of Mont Blanc via the easiest and most frequented route. Two killed in Chamonix-Mont-Blanc fall Three bodies found on Miage glacier Tourists rescued from Mont Blanc cable car Authorities for the Haute-Savoie region said the shelter's overnight capacity of 120 people was frequently being exceeded, which presented ""safety and public order"" risks. ""Access to the summit of Mont Blanc via this route... is only permitted to those who have a reservation at the Gouter refuge,"" an official statement reads. The temporary restrictions are in place to ensure that climbers have adequate accommodation for an overnight stay, it adds. Mont Blanc, with 11 peaks reaching more than 4,000m above sea level, is western Europe's highest mountain range - and a challenging area for climbers. Recently, concerns have been raised over the numbers of tourists visiting Mont Blanc in the summer and the risks it poses to those who lack experience, as well as the pollution it causes. Last year, 15 people died on approaches to the summit, and two people have already been killed in falls this year. The Mont Blanc massif is extremely popular with walkers and climbers but is Europe's deadliest mountain range, claiming some 50 lives each year.

"England reached the World Cup semi-finals for the first time since 1990 London-born poet and writer Musa Okwonga, the son of Ugandan immigrants, looks at how England's multicultural team captured the imagination of a nation and became role models for young people. England's football team, as it prepares to make its way home from the World Cup, has done something almost as impressive as claiming the trophy itself: it has captured the hearts of even the most sceptical people in the country. Those people, long accustomed to heartbreaking disappointment when it comes to the country's football fortunes, saw something entirely different this summer: a group of players playing to the very edge of their potential, and beyond. They also saw, in the words of manager Gareth Southgate, a team which in its youth and diversity represented ""modern England"". In terms of race and background, Southgate's players were as varied as you might find at a convention of YouTubers or on the line-up of the Wireless Festival. At the start of the World Cup,the Migration Museum,externalreleased a graphic showing how different the England team would look if first and second-generation immigrants were removed from it. The graphic, which quickly went viral, showed only five players would remain from the current line-up. The Migration Museum's graphic that showed the impact of immigration on England's starting line-up The changing face of the country can best be seen by looking back to the previous times when England similarly stirred the affection of their compatriots. In 1966, when they claimed the World Cup for the first and only time, it would be another 12 years until a black player would make an appearance for the England team in a full international. For most of the 1980s, John Barnes was one of the strongest bonds that immigrant communities like mine felt with the national side, seeing ourselves in him as he speed-skated down the wing, shrugging off racist insults with a drop of the shoulder. By 1990, when England were eliminated at the semi-final stage by West Germany, their line-up included Paul Parker and Des Walker, two footballers of Caribbean heritage. In their semi-final loss to Croatia on Wednesday, five of their starting players were of Caribbean heritage, with one - Raheem Sterling - born abroad. When Southgate spoke of this team being the face of modern England, he was somewhat ahead of the curve, given the black population of England (according to the 2011 Census) is 3%. A further challenge down the line will be the Football Association's development of Asian heritage players, given that this percentage of the population stands at 8%. In one sense though, Southgate's team does offer a compelling and positive glimpse at the future - where disparate groups of people can come together and produce performances that most observers thought beyond them. It might seem strange that so many have seen such symbolism in this team, but that's just a reflection of the uncertain period we are living in. Kyle Walker, one of the team's centre-backs, tweeted as much the day after the loss to Croatia. ""We might live in a time,"" he wrote, ""where sometimes it's easier to be negative rather than positive, or to divide than to unite, but England: let's keep this unity alive. I love you."" Another reason this team may have captured the imagination is its regional diversity. In a country whose focus can often be London-centric, it is refreshing to see players who hail not only from the capital but also from Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Tyne and Wear. The dressing-room has the range of accents you might expect to hear when catching your connecting train at Leeds. Yet perhaps the reason this team is held in highest esteem is they have confounded the stereotype of the self-obsessed footballer. In the months prior to the tournament, tabloid newspapers regaled their readers with tales of some of these players' supposed excesses, yet during the tournament, these players conducted themselves with such distinction that the coverage of the team was overwhelmingly positive. In future, the team will have stronger challenges to face. There's an argument that they could and should have gone further in this World Cup - that a side with players who've performed in the later stages of the Uefa Champions League should have held onto a one-goal lead, and proceeded to the final against France. Yet that's a discussion for another time. For now, England can look back on a team that despite being more diverse than previous squads, still reflected the same ethos that gave some of their predecessors a measure of success - a selflessness, a willingness to put the collective above the individual. Southgate, too, follows in the proud tradition of fellow England managers such as Graham Taylor - the first person to appoint a black man, Paul Ince, as the country's captain - in promoting the best footballers, regardless of their origin. Southgate's players may not have expected to be ambassadors for a nation that has endured a turbulent time of late, but it is a role they have performed with aplomb. And, most crucially, they have become that most important of objects: a mirror in which countless young people can see themselves. Both on and off the field, it is exciting to wonder what they might achieve next.

" Donald Trump came to Scotland to build the world’s greatest golf course on spectacular sand dunes on the Aberdeenshire coast. He fought and won the planning rights to do so - bulldozing his way through environmental objections with the bold promise of a £1bn investment and thousands of jobs. In pursuit of his vision, he clashed with politicians, nature lovers and even his own neighbours. In Scotland they’ve been hitting back at Mr Trump for more than a decade. Two flags flutter in the breeze on top of what used to be the coastguard station at Menie, on the Aberdeenshire coast in north-eastern Scotland. The Mexican flag flies from David Milne's home From this buff-coloured block of 1950s architecture, there are stunning views over Donald Trump’s golf course, across marram grass-covered sand dunes  out to the North Sea. The couple who have made this converted watch house their home are David and Moira Milne. From their roof they fly the Scottish saltire, white on blue and - more curiously - the green, white and red tricolour of Mexico. The Milnes hoisted the Mexican flag in solidarity with that country when Mr Trump promised to build a wall on their border and make them pay for it. “He’s already tried that here,” says David. “He built a fence and sent us a bill.” David and Moira enjoyed stunning views along the coastline The Milnes’ house and garden are like an island, encircled by Trump-owned land. The Trump Organization erected a fence to mark the boundary between their properties and wanted them to pay half the cost. They said the Milnes had built an extension that strayed across the boundary. It was just one of several clashes between the man who would become president of the United States and a quiet-living couple from Aberdeenshire. Mr Trump bought Menie, a former shooting estate eight miles north of Aberdeen, in 2006. He did so with a grand design in mind. To develop this windswept stretch of sand dunes, meadow and woodland into a 1,500-acre golf resort with a championship course as its centrepiece. The Milnes resisted Trump attempts to buy their property We are going to build the greatest golf course in the world, this house is ugly” It took six years of wrangling before the first phase was completed. The Milnes got on the wrong side of Mr Trump because they refused to sell to him. And he made no secret of the fact he wanted them to leave. On one visit to Menie, he was filmed looking up at their house from the passenger seat of a Range Rover on land earmarked for his golf course. “I want to get rid of that house” he said. When advised by an employee that this approach could cause a “bit of stir” he replied: “Who cares, who cares, you know what, who cares? We are going to build the greatest golf course in the world, this house is ugly.” Mr Trump seemed to feel the same way about other dwellings overlooking his property. He famously accused local farmer and salmon fisherman, Michael Forbes of living in a “pig-like atmosphere”. All refused to leave their homes. The Trump Organization raised the possibility of using compulsory purchase powers to force them out but eventually dropped the idea. Mr Forbes painted anti-Trump slogans on his green corrugated-iron shed and became a hero to those opposed to the billionaire’s development plans. He won a national award for his defiant spirit, prompting Mr Trump to threaten to withdraw business from the whisky company that sponsored it. Mr Forbes has rusting machinery, fishing gear and any amount of farmyard jumble lying in the grounds around his house and outbuildings. The appearance contrasts sharply with the carefully manicured fairways of Trump International Golf Links. But Mr Forbes insists he was not hurt by Mr Trump’s “pigsty” jibe. He says he and his mother - who lives there too - laughed it off because they regard Mr Trump as “a clown”. Michael Forbes and his mother think Trump is “a clown” There was further dispute with the Milnes when the Trump  construction team mounded earth around their property. It was later removed. We have a great relationship with the vast majority of our neighbours” And then there was the tree planting. The Milnes’ views up and down the coast used to be completely uninterrupted - but one day that changed. David was at work when his phone rang. It was Moira. “They’ve got a digger at the front of the house and they are planting trees,” she told him. It appeared to be an attempt to screen off the property from view by golfers. Asked to explain, Sarah Malone - who is in charge of Trump's Scottish business interests - said: “We have the right to plant trees and you know it’s our land. Why wouldn’t we plant trees?” She denied there was any attempt to bully the Milnes. “We have a great relationship with the vast majority of our neighbours,” she said. In much of the Scottish media, Mr Trump has been portrayed as a neighbour from hell bullying the locals to get his own way. It is what he might nowadays dismiss as “fake news” that ignores the jobs, investment and visitors he has brought to the area. The Milnes were not able to stop him developing the Menie estate but they have successfully resisted his attempts to get them out. And Mr Trump also failed to stop some new neighbours arriving in the area. They are electricity generating giants - the largest in Scottish waters and among the most advanced anywhere in the world. Each of the 11 turbines that make up the Aberdeen offshore wind farm stands 191m tall. Each blade spans 80m. Together they should generate enough power for 80,000 homes. Although they are sited more than a mile off the Aberdeenshire coast, they are strikingly obvious to anyone playing a round on Donald Trump’s golf course. Some may find them aesthetically pleasing, relaxing even. But to Mr Trump they are an eyesore. He did everything he could to stop them being built, but failed. Mr Trump is not a fan of wind power. He hates it with a passion. He argued that developing a wind energy industry in Scotland would ruin the environment, the tourist economy and trigger riots across the country. “They are so unattractive, so ugly, so noisy and so dangerous that, if Scotland does this, I think Scotland will be in serious trouble,” he told the Scottish Parliament in 2012. Appearing before a committee of MSPs, he accused two first ministers of Scotland of luring him to invest with false promises. Mr Trump had been friendly with both Labour’s Jack McConnell and his Scottish National Party successor Alex Salmond. Both had visited the tycoon during trips to New York for the annual Tartan Day celebrations. Both were very keen to secure his investment for Scotland. Mr Trump claimed they had privately assured him there was no way a wind farm would be allowed near his course. Both politicians strongly denied giving any such assurances. Having made his opposition to wind farms abundantly clear, the Scottish Parliament asked Mr Trump for his evidence that they would be economically ruinous for Scotland. He came out with a Trump classic. “I am considered a world class expert in tourism,” he replied. “So when you say ‘where is the expert and where is the evidence’ - I am the evidence!” The Scottish Parliament was not persuaded. Neither were the courts. In 2015 the UK Supreme Court rejected his attempts to block the wind development. Mr Trump claims the wind turbines damage the natural environment at the Menie estate. But his critics say his golf course has destroyed it. The northern part of the course covers part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) regarded as one of Britain’s best examples of a mobile sand dune system. Before construction work began in 2010 the dune system moved north at substantial speeds - up to 11m per year across an area of about 15 hectares. It was a living landscape, constantly evolving. Construction vehicles on the Menie Estate in 2010 Government agency Scottish Natural Heritage has been monitoring the impact of the course on the landscape and plant life. It found habitat loss and damage to the dune system. Dr Jim Hansom, a geomorphologist from Glasgow University, says he would be “absolutely surprised” if the sand dunes were allowed to keep their SSSI status. “It really should be de-notified because there’s no dynamism involved in that site now and that was the original justification for its notification,” he says. “It’s been ruined from a virgin undeveloped wilderness site into something that’s relatively manicured.” Scottish Natural Heritage, which objected to the original development, is assessing the scale of the damage to decide whether parts of the Menie site should lose SSSI protection. It’s been ruined from a virgin undeveloped wilderness site” Ms Malone says the Trump Organization is relaxed about the outcome. “I don’t think it matters to us. It may matter to other people and we’ll be comfortable with whatever the option and the decision on that is,” she says. Ms Malone insists that the Trump approach to environmental matters has been “first class”. The deterioration of the sand dunes was predicted long before the wind farm row, and long before the first bulldozer arrived on the Menie estate.  But those who gave Mr Trump the go-ahead decided it was a price worth paying for what he promised. A promise that, if not broken, is far from fulfilled. Ten years ago, the man who now occupies the Oval Office was invited to Aberdeenshire to give evidence at a public local inquiry about his golf course plans. The Menie resort is officially opened in July 2012 It was set up to examine the arguments for and against what Mr Trump said would be the world’s greatest golf course on the protected sand dunes. Environmentalists claimed he was overstating its potential in order to justify building part of his course on the site. But in his evidence in June 2008, Mr Trump insisted the Menie estate had the rare qualities required for a world-beating golf course. There were many bold claims about the proposed resort with big numbers attached. It was supposed to be a £1bn investment, creating about 6,000 jobs. It was to include not one but two championship golf courses, a 450-bedroom hotel and almost 1,500 holiday and residential homes. The massive scale of this promised investment was suitably beguiling. It persuaded the local inquiry team and even government ministers that the economic benefit justified the environmental impact. Telling the 2008 inquiry how Menie would make a world-class golf course The Scottish government controversially called in Mr Trump’s planning application for a national decision after it was thrown out by Aberdeenshire Council. In November 2008 they granted him the planning permission he desired. In those days Mr Trump was still chummy with Scotland’s first minister Alex Salmond, who was also the local MSP in Aberdeenshire. As first minister he was able to give the Trump team direct access to Scotland’s chief planner. Salmond would be accused of misusing his position to help a billionaire, but a parliamentary inquiry found he had not broken the rules. The first ball is hit at Trump International Golf Links Scotland Much of what was promised by Mr Trump has yet to materialise. By 2018 the resort included one golf course and a club house, a 16-bedroom boutique hotel and some lodges. The Trump Organization says it has spent around £100m, which is about 10% of what was promised. It says about 500 people were involved in construction and that it employs 150 people, including part-time and seasonal staff. Mr Salmond, who supported the golf development as local MSP, says that is nowhere near good enough. “The people who were putting it forward did not live up and honour the agreements they made to the Scottish people,” he says. A decade on, the Trump-Salmond relationship has soured. Global circumstances have also changed. The financial crisis intensified in late 2008, just as Mr Trump was granted planning permission for the golf course. More recently the 2014 oil price crash hit the Aberdeenshire economy hard. Mr Trump did not use either as an excuse for delaying development. Instead, he put much of it on hold while he fought his legal battle against the wind farm. Mr Salmond branded Mr Trump a “three-time loser” in 2015 when he lost a third attempt to block the wind project at the UK Supreme Court. Mr Trump hit back calling Mr Salmond “a has-been and totally irrelevant”. Their bitter feud has never really stopped. With the wind farm fight decided, the leader of Aberdeenshire Council, Jim Gifford, has called on the Trump Organization to finish the job they began at Menie. A flying visit to Aberdeenshire during the US presidential campaign “I think they have an obligation to bring forward what they promised, that’s the bottom line of it,” he says. “The difficulty we have is we can’t force them to do that.” Even if we’d only spent £10m that should be celebrated” But the Trump Organization says it does not need to be forced, because it remains committed to further development. “We haven’t finished,” says Ms Malone. “It’s a multi-phase project and we’re not stupid. This wasn’t going to get built overnight. “It’s a long-term investment opportunity for us and that’s how Mr Trump has always approached it. Even if we’d only spent £10m that should be celebrated.” What has been built so far is celebrated by some, especially in the Aberdeenshire business community. And the course itself, designed by Martin Hawtree, is frequently listed among the world’s great golf courses. Golf Monthly describes it as “a masterpiece, an instant classic”. Mr Trump courted, then clashed with Scotland’s political leaders as he sought to get his own way with the golf development. But it’s nothing compared to how relations deteriorated when he ran for president. While running for office in December 2015, Donald Trump suggested banning citizens from majority Muslim countries entering the US.  There was outrage in Scotland. Scotland’s new first minister Nicola Sturgeon removed his status as a “Global Scot” - a business ambassador who acts for Scotland on the world stage. It was a symbolic gesture soon followed by another, as Aberdeen’s Robert Gordon University took back the honorary degree they had bestowed upon the businessman in 2010. As the Scottish Parliament election approached in 2016, Scottish party leaders across the political spectrum became bolder in their opposition. Donald Trump receiving an honorary degree from Robert Gordon University in 2010 (it was later revoked) Labour’s Kezia Dugdale described Candidate Trump as “an arse” and travelled to the United States to campaign for Hillary Clinton. And Ruth Davidson of the Scottish Conservatives told a TV debate she had “too much faith in the people of the US to ever let that man anywhere near the White House”. At that same debate Ms Sturgeon said “we should all rejoice” when the American people “send Donald Trump packing”. When asked how she’d handle a phone call from President Trump if he did win the election, she imagined herself saying: “I’m on the other line, sorry.” She imagined incorrectly. A few months later she took that call. Mr Trump phoned to thank her for the letter which she wrote congratulating him on his victory. It probably wasn’t the easiest letter she’s had to write. At the same time protesters took to the streets of Scotland’s cities, when the newly inaugurated president enacted his controversial travel ban in January 2017. Nicola Sturgeon had not anticipated a Trump victory Ms Sturgeon has continued to speak out against some of Mr Trump’s policies, such as the detention of child migrants separated from their parents. On visits to the US she has prioritised business links over engagement with the Trump administration and met some of his high-profile critics, including Hillary Clinton. The first minister has said she would be prepared to meet the president when he visits Scotland, butno plans were madefor her to see him during his latest trip. There are those who think it was a mistake for Scotland’s politicians to take sides in a foreign election against the man who now occupies the highest political office on the planet. Trump’s travel ban brought protests to Edinburgh in 2017 “It was very unseemly. It’s not what you do,” says Sebastian Gorka, a former adviser to the Trump administration. He warns that there could be repercussions for Scotland. “You’d have to ask the president but he has a very, very long memory. He doesn’t forget stuff.” American-Scot Jack Perry takes the view that ignoring any president is not an option. Mr Perry was head of the development agency Scottish Enterprise when Mr Trump first mooted building his golf course. “You can dislike the man, you can dislike his politics, you can dislike his public pronouncements,” he says. “But there still has to be some respect for the office. I don’t think you have any choice but to deal with him.” It is especially difficult to ignore a US president who now owns two major golf resorts in your country. Donald Trump never made any secret of his ambition to bring major golf tournaments to Scotland.  “I think we’ll have the Ryder Cup,” he said in 2013. “I think we’ll have the Open. I think we will have many, many great tournaments over the years.” A year later he added a second Scottish property to his golf portfolio - the famous Turnberry resort in Ayrshire. His investment here was far less controversial than his dealings in Aberdeenshire. He restored a fading classic to grandeur - adding a ballroom, chandeliers and a touch of Trump bling. Improvements to the courses at Trump Turnberry have been well received. It was described as “a jewel in the crown of Ayrshire” by Val Russell from the local chamber of commerce. She said dealings with the Trump Organization had been nothing but positive. But neither of Mr Trump’s Scottish venues has yet been awarded the right to host a major yet. So far, that ambition is unfulfilled. And it seems to play on the president’s mind. He may have temporarily handed control of his businesses to his sons, but golf and Scotland remain something of a pre-occupation. When the Wall Street Journal was invited into the White House for an interview, his mind strayed in that direction. In the middle of a conversation about post-Brexit trade, he wondered if Scotland might hold a second independence referendum. If it did, he thought this would be “terrible”. Chief among his apparent concerns, it seems, was the impact on golf in an independent Scotland. “What would they do with the British Open if they ever got out?” he asked. “They’d no longer have the British Open. Keep it in Scotland”. A family affair: Trump Turnberry is opened in 2016 But the Open may not come Mr Trump’s way. At least not while he’s president. No matter how good his courses, the Trump brand is just too controversial for some tournaments and their sponsors. Take the Scottish Open championship, part of the European tour, for example. It’s sponsored by Aberdeen Standard Investments.  Its joint chief executive, Martin Gilbert, is a friend of the president and attended his inauguration. Mr Gilbert has expressed a desire to take the Scottish Open back to Aberdeenshire - but not to Mr Trump’s Menie resort. “Trump’s is a great course but there are issues if we went there - and the worst thing would be if he came,” Mr Gilbert said in 2017. “Politics aside, Trump would be an ideal venue but you can’t put politics aside.” We are in uncharted territory with the president’s family owning golf courses” The Royal and Ancient (R&A) - the governing body that decides where the Open is played - has a greater dilemma. They already have Turnberry on the official rota of venues that host the tournament. The Open was last at Turnberry in 2009, before Mr Trump took over, and would be expected to secure a return visit fairly soon. The next available year is 2022. But the decision will likely have to be taken while he is still in office. “For all of us in the game, we are in uncharted territory here with the president’s family owning golf courses,” says R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers. “We’re all learning as we go.” It’s possible that Turnberry will remain an Open venue without actually hosting it again until Mr Trump leaves the White House. That would certainly avoid the inevitable howl of protest and a potential boycott. Despite all the rebuffs he’s had in Scotland, Mr Trump is not one who gives up without a fight. As Malone puts it: “We absolutely will host majors. That’s why it was designed.” The Menie development was also intended - according to Mr Trump - as a tribute to his Scottish mother, Mary-Anne MacLeod, who was born and raised on the isle of Lewis. Mr Trump’s hotel here, a restored baronial mansion from the early 19th Century, is named MacLeod House in her memory. Further development of the resort may be required if it is to host big tournaments. The Trump Organization has already submitted a planning application for a second golf course. And despite the wind turbines President Trump loves to hate now being in place, the company he founded has also drawn up plans to build a resort village in Aberdeenshire. It includes a mixture of 550 residential homes and holiday accommodation, but no big hotel. The scene is set for a fresh fight with the planning authorities. The political atmosphere has changed a great deal since Donald Trump was being courted by successive Scottish governments in the mid-2000s. Politicians are much warier of him and his business empire now and would not want to be seen to give special favours. Yet if they want more Trump investment it seems further compromise will be required. A formal planning application was expected to be lodged in Aberdeenshire in early 2018. It has yet to materialise. And who knows when it will. That is as unpredictable as President Trump himself.

"It's known as the ""honey shot"" - when a conventionally attractive woman is picked out of the crowd by cameras at a sporting event. The issue has come under scrutiny during this World Cup and Fifa has said broadcasters have got to stop zooming in on ""hot women"". It happened to Natalia Betancourt at the 2014 World Cup game between Colombia and Brazil. Those few seconds on screen would launch a career in modelling and on TV. ""I had no idea the cameras would zoom on me,"" she tells BBC 100 Women. ""And of course, I had no idea how it would all grow from there."" Her image was noticed by the singer Rihanna, who shared a picture of Natalia in the crowd, captioning it ""Colombian cutie"". ""It was a fun moment, but I thought that was it - a few seconds of fame and a nice Twitter interaction with a pop star I admire."" When Natalia returned to Colombia from the tournament in Brazil, she wasn't prepared for what would happen next. ""That image opened the doors of the media for me,"" she explains. ""I had nothing to do with that world before, I owned a construction supplies company with my boyfriend."" Within months, she was on the front cover of men's magazines. ""I took part in the Colombian edition of the reality TV show Dancing with the Stars,"" says Natalia. ""That was a game changer; afterwards I became more comfortable and relaxed being in the media."" She's since worked with a number of Colombian brands and now models for an international hair care company. ""I still have the construction company with my boyfriend. Yes, the same guy that went with me to the 2014 World Cup - we have been together 13 years."" The high of being picked out of the crowd was followed by the low of the almost inevitable social media backlash. ""The nice comments were always more numerous, but I found it hard to ignore those that hurt,"" she says. Fans from all nations have been picked out from the crowd by photographers at Russia 2018 Just this week,Fifa's diversity boss has said broadcasters have been told to stop zooming in on ""hot women""in the crowd at football matches. ""We've done it with individual broadcasters. We've done it with our host broadcast services,"" said Federico Addiechi. During Russia 2018 photographic agency Getty Images published a photo gallery of ""the hottest fans at the World Cup"" featuring exclusively young women. The gallery was later removed by Getty, who said that it was a ""regrettable error in judgement"". The honey shot is not a new phenomenon. US sports television director Andy Sidaris is usually credited with its invention,external, saying: ""Once you've seen one huddle you've seen them all. ""So you either look at the popcorn, the guys, or the ladies. The choice is clear to me."" Anti-discrimination group Fare Network says sexism has been the biggest problem at Russia 2018. Fifa said it has been working with the local organisers and Russian police to identify and punish abusive fans. Meanwhile online community This Fan Girl has produceda collection of photographs that represent the ""different kinds of women""who go to matches. Campaigners hope these five photographs of England fans will begin to replace the sexualised images of female fans that online searches offer ""I have always been a football fan,"" says Natalia. ""I love going to matches and I love the atmosphere of a World Cup. Brazil was my first World Cup but after that I promised I wouldn't miss one."" Other women have also made a career after featuring in a honey shot, most notably Pamela Anderson, who was picked out of the crowd by cameras at a football game in Canada. ""I did not know what a honey shot was,"" Natalia says. ""I don't think it's offensive or objectifying. I think in a way it's good that it shows that football is a sport for both women and men."" Natalia's honey shot story doesn't end there. She travelled to Russia a few weeks ago, for her second World Cup tournament. ""I got zoomed in on during the Colombia vs England match, which I think was hilarious,"" she says. ""In Brazil I was all smiles and excitement, this time I looked worried and sad on camera - it was right after England had kicked us out of the World Cup.""

"This is how it works in Trump world. The US president arrives at a party, causes a fuss, breaks some crockery, and leaves everyone stunned. Then as the dust settles, he declares what a good time he has had, how it's all been a great success, while offering a few words of apology for the disruption caused. So it was at the Nato summit, and so it was during his visit to Britain. Mr Trump used his interview in the Sun to throw a few plates at Theresa May, criticising her Brexit strategy, threatening to block a trade deal with the US, praising Boris Johnson. Cue outrage and much gnashing of teeth. Then came the news conference at Chequers where the president revealed he had apologised to the prime minister, praising Mrs May as an ""incredible woman... doing a fantastic job... a terrific woman"", insisting the UK-US relationship was ""the highest level of special"", all the while accepting that a trade deal might be possible just so long as there were no ""restrictions"" on US firms. And so it goes: the UK-US relationship settles back on to an even keel and life returns to normal. That, at least, is the hope of British officials. President Trump dined at Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill They designed this trip to show Mr Trump the depth of the relationship between the UK and the US: the history of Blenheim and Churchill, the dinner with business leaders who create jobs in America, the special forces who co-operate in the fight against terrorism, the Queen who has met 11 of Mr Trump's predecessors. The symbolism was clear: the ties that bind Britain to the US are long and deep. And government sources said the talks with Mr Trump at Chequers were good. They said the fallout from the Sun interview shaped the mood. Donald Trump: US-UK trade deal 'absolutely possible' Trump: I didn't criticise Theresa May to The Sun Brexit: What are the challenges ahead for a UK/US trade deal? Any discussion that began with Donald J Trump apologising put the other side in a stronger position. The conversation, I am told, was relaxed, detailed and covered all the issues from the Middle East to North Korea. ""It was good, solid, substantive stuff,"" said one source. ""We landed some messages."" In other words, so they hope, the special relationship continues, Mr Trump's apology and recantation on trade enough to correct the damage of the interview in the Sun. But is that really true? The president's words cannot be unspoken. He has described the UK as being in ""turmoil"", a ""hotspot with lots of resignations"". He intervened directly in domestic UK politics, a gross breach of diplomatic etiquette. And even worse, he intervened in favour of the prime minister's opponents. This was more than being undiplomatic to one's host: this was a hostile act that handed ammunition to those Brexiteers wishing to undermine the prime minister's Brexit strategy. And what is more, the president was plain rude: to Mrs May whom he criticised for ignoring his advice. And for good measure, Mr Trump said Britain was ""losing its culture"" because of immigration. Until now, many British politicians tend to say things like ""focus on what Donald Trump does, not what he says"", ""ignore the tweets, stick to the substance."" They also say the special relationship is about more than how well the Oval Office gets on with Number 10: the core of the relationship, they insist, is the military, security and intelligence nexus. They like to quote Winston Churchill's speech in Fulton, Missouri in 1946 when he popularised the phrase ""the special relationship"" which he described as ""not only the growing friendship and mutual understanding between our two vast but kindred systems of society, but the continuance of the intimate relationship between our military advisers"". Winston Churchill's 1946 speech at Fulton, Missouri, helped popularise the term ""special relationship"" In her prepared statement at Chequers, the first point Theresa May made was to highlight the importance of UK-US military co-operation around the world. My question is this: how long can this security relationship continue when the political tensions are so great? How long is it before the policy differences between the Trump White House and the May Downing Street begin to infect the institutional relationships - the diplomats, the soldiers, the spies - that normally stay immune from the poison of day-to-day politics? Can the two relationships really continue to exist in isolation? Note this: since Donald Trump took office, Theresa May has had to disagree with him publicly over his decision to impose trade tariffs on EU steel, abandon the Iran nuclear deal, move the US embassy to Jerusalem, order a travel ban on Muslims from some countries and retweet anti-Muslim messages from a British far-right group. Mr Trump has also questioned the multilateral, liberal rules-based order that Britain defends, while embracing the regimes of authoritarian ""strong men"". President Trump's visit has prompted big public demonstrations Mr Trump wants to approach the world not through alliances but individual bilateral deals, a series of transactional relationships with other countries that balance short-term national interests. In his mind, the UK may be just another country with which to deal. But at Chequers, Mrs May deliberately warned Mr Trump not only that it was their responsibility to ensure the transatlantic relationship endured, but also that it was based on the shared values of democracy and justice. So there are two fundamentally opposed positions: Donald Trump's belief in an interest-based transactional relationship with the UK, where access to US markets is determined by how detached the UK is from EU markets, and Theresa May's view of a transatlantic relationship based on shared values. And the question remains: as the US and the UK drift further apart between these positions, how long can the institutional relationship between the soldiers and the spies survive the tensions of their political masters?

"The 2018 World Cup has been seen as a public relations triumph for Vladimir Putin's Russia, but beyond the football concerns remain about the country's commitment to democracy, human rights and the international order. For the last month, I have barely recognised Moscow. Like the tornado in the Wizard of Oz, the World Cup blew into town and swept me away from a sepia world, over the rainbow, to a Technicolor dreamland. In this land of Oz, otherwise known as ""World Cup Russia"", football fans from across the globe thronged the streets of central Moscow. They sang, danced and partied through the night in a sea of Mexican sombreros, Peruvian ponchos, Icelandic Viking helmets and, of course, Russian tricolours. Even the normally stern-faced Russian police officers were cracking smiles. In more than 20 years of living in Moscow, I cannot remember a time when the city has felt more relaxed, more cosmopolitan, more welcoming. Football fans from around the world have partied in Russia Neither can I remember President Putin scoring such a resounding public relations success. The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters. Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country's authoritarian image. All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised. ""I thank the Russian people for their hospitality,"" England supporter Darren from Blackpool told me near Red Square. ""Everything the British government has said about Russia is a lie. It's propaganda. Fair play to Putin. He's done a brilliant job with the World Cup."" One of the lasting images of this tournament is that of a smiling Vladimir Putin basking in the glory of his World Cup, as he chats to a group of footballing legends. Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed former internationals including Lothar Matthaus (4th l) and Rio Ferdinand (r) Among the soccer stars invited to the Kremlin that day were England's Rio Ferdinand and Denmark's Peter Schmeichel. They got tea, Mr Putin got praise. ""This is the one of the best World Cups I have seen in the last 40 years,"" gushed Germany's Lothar Matthaus. ""Thank you Mr President. Thank you Russia."" ""I was told people, police in Red Square are smiling,"" Fifa President Gianni Infantino remarked to the Kremlin leader. ""This is great. This is exactly what Russia is. This is the new image that we have about Russia."" World Cup 2018: 'Russia dream over but nation's hope restored' Which fans made the journey to Russia? I am delighted that visitors to World Cup Russia have experienced some of the things that I love about this country: the warmth of the people, their humour, their generosity. I am pleased that police on Red Square have been smiling. But a brief trip to this land of Oz is not enough to form a complete picture of Vladimir Putin's Russia. Police officers may be smiling now. But they were not smiling last May when they broke up an anti-Putin protest on Pushkin Square. A recent anti-Putin demonstration in Moscow's Pushkin Square resulted in a number of arrests A successful World Cup does not change the trend: in recent years democracy, human rights and freedom of speech in Russia have been under attack. An increasingly belligerent Russia annexed Crimea and has intervened militarily in eastern Ukraine. Russia stands accused of cyber attacks, of meddling in western elections and of carrying out the Novichok nerve agent attack in Salisbury. All of which the authorities here deny, and dismiss as Russophobia. Moscow has also denied any connection to the death of Dawn Sturgess, who wasrecently exposed to Novichokin Amesbury. In their coverage, state media here have suggested that Britain has used the incident to spoil Russia's World Cup triumph. As for Russian officials, they are using praise from foreign football fans to try to discredit allegations against their country. The Russian government has denied any involvement in the chemical attack in Salisbury ""The problem with Russia's image wasn't created by Russia,"" says Konstantin Kosachev, who chairs the foreign affairs committee of Russia's upper house of parliament. ""It was created by countries like the United Kingdom, spreading false information about Russia as a country. ""They failed. We are happy that so many people in the UK and in other countries had a unique chance not to see channels like BBC telling stories about Russia, but to see the real Russia with their own eyes."" ""But we've reported many positive things about Russia,"" I point out. ""I don't know, I don't follow the BBC, unfortunately,"" admits Mr Kosachev. Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are to meet in Helsinki As the World Cup ends, the challenge for the Kremlin will be to convert a short-term PR success into long-term diplomatic gains. Much will depend on the wider geopolitical game Russia is currently playing. And here, too, it appears President Putin is winning. On Monday he meets Donald Trump for a summit in Helsinki: with Russia under western sanctions, that is a diplomatic coup for Moscow. ""We seem to be victorious everywhere,"" believes former Kremlin foreign policy advisor Sergei Karaganov. ""I am afraid of that, because it's too good to be true. After all, we are continuously hitting well beyond our weight. But if we do it well, then why not?""

"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2018: Kerber beats Williams to win first Wimbledon title Wimbledon 2018 on the BBC Venue:All England Club, WimbledonDates:2-15 July Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button, Connected TVs and the BBC Sport website and app; Live Radio 5 live and 5 live sports extra commentary; Text commentary online. Angelique Kerber beat seven-time champion Serena Williams to win her first Wimbledon title and spoil the American's dream comeback as a mum. The German 11th seed, 30, beat the 23-time Grand Slam champion 6-3 6-3 to add this title to her 2016 Australian Open and US Open crowns. Williams had been the favourite despite it being only her fourth tournament since giving birth in September. Kerber dropped to the grass when a netted service return gave her victory. ""It is a dream come true,"" said Kerber, who is the first German woman to win the title since Steffi Graf in 1996. ""I know I had to play my best tennis against a champion like Serena. Serena is a great person and a great champion and she is a great inspiration for all of us."" Williams said she had been happy to simply get to the final so soon into her comeback, adding: ""It is obviously a disappointment but I can't be disappointed. I'm literally getting started. ""To the other mums out there I was playing for you today and I tried. But Angelique played really well. I look forward to continuing to be out there and do what I do best."" I'm still contender at Slams - Williams Relive Kerber's victory over Williams Djokovic beats Nadal to reach final Live scores, schedule and results The start to the women's final was delayed by the conclusion of the men's semi-final between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal Kerber, known for her defensive style, came to the match with a more attacking plan in mind - keep the point going and exploit Williams' lack of mobility around the court. And it paid off handsomely with the 36-year-old's dashes to the net ending in errors half of the 24 times she came forward. The German former world number one showed her intent in the first game, breaking the Williams serve that forms the backbone of her game. Williams broke back to level at 2-2 before Kerber re-established the advantage in the seventh game when the American hit long, and she took the set when Williams sent a backhand into the net. Kerber stuck with her tactics in the second set, breaking in the sixth, and the sight of Williams falling to the ground in frustration when she missed a straightforward lob for 30-0 when Kerber was serving for the match summed up her day. The German struck a forehand winner to bring up championship point and sealed the victory on the next point when Williams could only return a serve into the net. Overcome by the magnitude of what she had achieved against a player who beat her in the 2016 Wimbledon final, Kerber collapsed on to the ground and covered her eyes, while Williams came over to her side of the net to share a warm embrace. Williams had been seeking to become just the fourth mother to win a Grand Slam title in the Open era Williams, like Kerber, had dropped just one set on her way to the final but she had also faced only one player ranked in the top 50 here before Saturday's showpiece. Despite her world ranking of 181 and special seeding of 25, she has been favourite for the title, with pundits and players pointing to the potent combination ofher intimidating aura- created by titles, fitness and mental strength - and the fact that her power game is perfectly suited to the fast surface of grass. However, Kerber did not let her play that game with Williams managing just four aces and hitting 24 unforced errors as the German bided her time and capitalised on the fact her opponent was not quite back to her best 10 months after giving birth to her daughter. Williams, in fact, hit more than twice as many winners as the German (23-11) but was let down by some rash forehands and below-par net play in front of a packed Centre Court, where her friend the Duchess of Sussex was watching from the Royal Box. It means her bid for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title must wait until next month's US Open at least. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2018: Watch an emotional Serena Williams react to final defeat Billie Jean King,six-time Wimbledon champion on BBC TV: ""After that very first game, you could see Kerber thinking 'woah, this is great, good start'. You could see it in her body language, she really settled in. ""Kerber was so consistent. Keeps getting one, two, three, four balls back, and when Serena's not had that match play... ""Serena could never get any rhythm, if you can keep her out there long enough, keep the rallies long, and see how fit she is... she looked a bit like she was sucking it up, out of breath a few times. Kerber always gets that one more ball back."" Martina Navratilova,nine-time Wimbledon singles champion on BBC TV: ""More balls came back, Kerber returned Serena's serve well. Serena didn't get the payoff from her ground strokes, tried to hit harder and made more errors. ""She came to the net more often which she doesn't do a lot. ""Kerber has a shot at being world number one. She will get so much confidence from this win, so you have to look at her as one of the favourites. The year is so young.""

"Passengers are being advised to check websites for revised timetables Train passengers have been warned to expect disruption on Sunday due to staff shortages caused by hot weather and the World Cup Final. Great Western Railway (GWR) warned a ""significant number"" of its trains would be without crew. Northern, which will operate an amended timetable, said some of its staff were not required to work on Sundays and had ""made themselves unavailable"". Other rail operators told the BBC they expected to run services as normal. GWR has lifted ticket restrictions to allow travel on a different day. Passengers have been advised to check websites for revised timetables. Northern said it was still working on its plans, but warned that many services in Cumbria, Lancashire and Greater Manchester were likely to be cancelled. GWR said the worst-hit services would be long-distance routes, including those to and from London Paddington, Bristol, South Wales, Oxford, and Devon and Cornwall. It blamed factors including the World Cup Final, good weather and the start of the summer holidays, while Northern said staff did not have to give a reason for not being available. Managing director Mark Hopwood said: ""We will have managers and volunteers throughout our network to help at stations and on board, but unfortunately we will not be able to deliver our planned timetable of services; and the trains we are able to operate will be extremely busy. ""I would encourage customers to travel on a different day if they are able to and we will happily offer refunds to those who choose not to travel.""

"Dawn Sturgess died last weekend and Charlie Rowley remains in hospital About 400 items have been recovered by police investigating the Novichok poisoning of a couple in Wiltshire. Earlier officers investigating the murder of Dawn Sturgess and poisoning of Charlie Rowley took four vehicles from two locations - a police garage in Swindon and Salisbury ambulance depot. On Friday detectives saidthe fatal Novichok dose came from a bottle found at Mr Rowley's Amesbury house. Police warned searches of the area could last months. Mr Rowley remains critically ill in hospital. Assistant Metropolitan Police commissioner Neil Basu described the poisoning investigations as ""one of the most complex and difficult that UK policing has ever faced"". Mr Basu who is the National Lead for Counter Terrorism (CT) Policing in the UK added: ""The work being carried out is extremely important. ""Not only are we trying to solve an extremely serious crime that has been committed, but we're also working to identify any potential outstanding risks to the public, all whilst ensuring that all those involved in the search process are not themselves exposed to any risk of contamination. ""It is painstaking and vital work, which unfortunately takes a very long time to complete, but I am sure that the public understands why it is absolutely necessary."" The bottle was found at Mr Rowley's home in Amesbury He added searches were being hampered by the hot weather as investigators had to wear protective clothing and were limited to the amount of time they could spend in special suits because of the heat. Work involves taking swabs from surfaces and ensuring the process does not contaminate a wider area, police said. All the items are being transported to the labs at Porton Down for analysis. Tests are ongoing to establish whether the couple were poisoned with the same batch of Novichok poison used in the attack against Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March.

"This video can not be played Attenborough launches ""Boaty McBoatface"" polar ship Sir David Attenborough has launched the 10,000-tonne hull of the UK's newest polar ship - named after him - into the River Mersey. The broadcaster pushed the button, sending the hull sliding out from the Cammell Laird yard in Birkenhead, into the water where building will continue. ""Our future will be affected by what people working on this ship will be discovering in years to come,"" he said. It is ""the greatest possible honour"" to be its namesake, Sir David added. The hull of the Â£200m research vessel entered the river stern-first, creating a big wave as it hit the water. Ahead of the launch, the riverbed was dredged in front of the slipway to make sure the steel mass did not bottom out. Sir David and Dame Jane Francis press the big button Tugs were on hand to catch the hull as it floated out from the slipway ""When 100 years ago this country sent people down to the South Pole, we were the pioneers in exploring the Antarctic,"" Sir David said. ""When we did so, I suspect the reason we did was the South Pole seemed as far away as it could possibly get to be on this planet. ""Now, 100 years later, we realise that remote place is, in fact, key to the whole understanding of the planet. What goes on down there affects the whole of the Earth."" This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough polar ship: Here's an inside peek Saturday was an important milestone for the ship, whose development has been followed closely since an online campaign tried to get it named ""Boaty McBoatface"". ""She's like a giant Airfix model,"" said Cammell Laird project manager John Drummond. ""She's being put together with one million pieces of steel, 30km of piping, 5,000 valves, and 450km of cabling."" How to put a polar ship in the water The steelwork that went in the water represents the lower-decks of the Attenborough and the components whose great size meant they had to be encapsulated during the build. This included the vessel's huge diesel-electric Rolls-Royce engines. Four tugs were on hand to catch the hull as it floated out into the Mersey. These then moved the structure a short distance down the river to the company's ""wet basin"". Claire Biggar says a lot of work is still needed to finish the ship It is here that the upper-decks will be attached, together will all the internal fixtures and fittings, such as cabins and laboratories. ""At the moment we have just the six decks in the hull, and the other six decks of what we call the super-structure will be lifted on after she's gone into our harbour,"" explained Claire Biggar, assistant ship manager at Cammell Laird. An official handover of the finished ship is scheduled for the end of the year. It is at this point that the RRS Sir David Attenborough can begin sea trials, and go on its maiden expeditions to the Arctic and the Antarctic. Prof Dame Jane Francis is the director of the British Antarctic Survey: ""We've now got a real state-of-the-art ship and so we'll be able to do a lot more science. We'll be able to go into more remote areas. We'll be able to do bigger projects; we'll be able to do a lot more science. We really will be able to do frontier science that we haven't been able to do in the past,"" she told BBC News. The two ships that make up the UK's existing polar fleet - the RRS James Clark Ross (JCR) and the RRS Ernest Shackleton - are ageing, with nearly 50 years' service now between them. These vessels are also getting expensive to run. The Â£200m, state-of-the-art Attenborough will be their replacement. It will have the capability to fulfil all the roles currently undertaken by the JCR and the Shackleton, which broadly split into research and logistics. The new ship will support scientists working at both ends of the planet. At times, this will include delivering the supplies that sustain British bases, such as Rothera and Halley in Antarctica. On other occasions, it will mean acting as the platform from which scientists can launch investigations of the polar environment. Because of where the ship will have to work, the hull has been designed to break through metre-thick sea-ice. The Attenborough will be equipped with all the latest scientific gear. It will have a helipad, cranes and onboard labs, and have the ability to deploy subs and other ocean survey and sampling kit. One of its key features is an enclosed ""moon pool"". This is essentially a huge hole running right through the middle of the hull. It will allow instruments to be lowered into - and recovered from - the sea when weather or dense sea-ice conditions would normally make such work very difficult. The ship design, put together by Rolls-Royce, also enables near-silent running when required, meaning scientists can study sea creatures without disturbing them. Boaty the submarine is among the sophisticated equipment that the ship will deploy Boaty McBoatface lives on in the form of a yellow submarine. The National Oceanography Centre in Southampton has three long-range autonomous underwater vehicles. When one of these is out on patrol, it carries the humorous moniker. The intention is that these Boaty-class subs will frequently operate from the Attenborough. They will be asked to go into places the ship itself cannot reach, such as under the colossal floating ice shelves that surround Antarctica.

"Majid al-Mohandis performing in Jeddah last year A woman in Saudi Arabia has been arrested after running on stage to hug a male singer during a concert, according to reports. Majid al-Mohandis was performing at a festival in the western city of Taif when the woman darted on to the stage. Videos posted online showed her holding on to Mr Mohandis,externalwhile security staff tried to pull her off him. Women in Saudi Arabia are not allowed to mix  in public with men who are unrelated to them. Mr Mohandis, whose website says is ""the prince of Arab singing"", has not commented on the incident. The Iraqi-born singer, who also has Saudi citizenship, continued to perform after the incident. A public prosecutor will now consider harassment charges against the woman, police told Okaz, a leading Saudi newspaper, and Efe news agency. The country has strict morality laws regarding alcohol prohibition, modest clothing and gender segregation. Restrictions that had long been placed on women attending public events in the kingdom have been relaxed in the past year under a series of reforms by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 'I can't believe I'm driving in Saudi Arabia' In pictures: Saudi driving lessons for women Vision 2030, unveiled last year, aims to increase household spending on cultural and entertainment activities in the oil-dependent kingdom from 2.9% to 6% by 2030. Women were allowed to attend a concert and a football match for the first time on the same weekend, and the kingdom also hosted its first concert by a female singer, Lebanese star Hiba Tawaji, in December. Women were also allowed to drive from last month. But significant restrictions remain in place and women still have to adhere to strict dress codes.

"This video can not be played 'I'd like them to sit down and explain' Former Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams has called on those who attacked his home to meet him. Mr Adams asked those responsible to have the ""gumption and guts"" to meet him and explain their actions. Sinn FÃ©in activist Bobby Storey's house was also attackedand police say the devices thrown at both homes were believed to be ""large industrial or commercial fireworks"". Such devices have the capacity to cause serious injury and damage to property. The attacks took place in west Belfast on Friday night. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Adams said two of his grandchildren had been in the driveway before the attack but no-one was injured. Mr Adams said he was unsure whether there was a connection between the attacksand the recent violence in Londonderry, which is being linked to dissident republicans. In a direct appeal to those who attacked his home, he said: ""I'd like them to sit down and explain to me what this is about. ""I'd like those who are involved in exploiting children in Derry to do the same thing, or those who are poisoning the atmosphere in east Belfast and causing havoc to do the same thing."" He said those responsible were ""resistant to change"" and the groups that had stepped away from the peace process saw Sinn FÃ©in as the enemy. Sinn FÃ©in said there were children in the driveway minutes before the attack The Police Service of Northern Ireland said officers were investigating incidents at two houses in west Belfast, after reports were received of loud bangs at both locations at 22:50 BST on Friday 13 July. ""There were no reports of any injuries. However, a parked car was damaged at one of the houses,"" a spokesman said. By Chris Page, Ireland correspondent Gerry Adams has spoken several times in the past about death threats made against him - by loyalists and by dissident republicans who are opposed to the peace process. Sinn FÃ©in's statement about the attacks on the homes of Mr Adams and Bobby Storey doesn't explicitly pin the blame on republican splinter groups. However, the party's reference to ""increasingly desperate and irrelevant groups"" firmly points in that direction - and republicans who have expressed support for Mr Adams on social media have condemned dissidents as ""criminals"" and ""thugs"". A number of hours earlier, Mr Adams's successor as Sinn Fein President - Mary Lou McDonald - strongly denounced the dissidents who are believed to be behind recent rioting in Londonderry as ""warped, negative, regressive, dangerous people"". Police responded to reports of loud bangs at 22:50 BST on Friday 13 July The other attack occurred at the home of Bobby Storey, a senior Sinn FÃ©in figure and a former member of the Provisional IRA. He was involved in the Maze Prison escape in 1983, where 38 IRA prisoners escaped from the maximum security prison. The attacks in Belfast came after six nights of violence in Derry, which have taken place around the Twelfth of July parades, which often bring a heightening of tensions centred around the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne. â Mr Adams, 69, spent nearly 34 years at the helm of Irish republican party Sinn FÃ©in. During The Troubles Mr Adams survived several attempts on his life, including a 1984 gun attack by loyalist paramilitaries. He is one of the most recognisable and controversial figures in Irish politics Two months after the death of Martin McGuinness in 2017, Mr Adams announced he would step down as leader. He was succeeded by Mary Lou McDonald. You can read a full profile here.

"The Ryanair plane descended 8,000m in seven minutes, observers say More than 30 Ryanair passengers, some bleeding from their ears, have received hospital treatment in Germany after their plane to Croatia lost cabin pressure, German police say. Flight FR7312 from Dublin to Zadar made an emergency landing in Frankfurt. The airline said oxygen masks were deployed and the crew carried out a ""controlled descent"". The plane descended 8,000m (26,000ft) from 11,300m to 3,000m in seven minutes, according to Flight Radar.

Ryanair said the plane ""landed normally and customers disembarked, where a small number received medical attention as a precaution"". The plane was carrying 189 passengers, 33 of whom were hospitalised, and some decided not to continue with their journey, German police said. Some of the passengers told the Irish Times newspaper what they experienced,external. ""We get on the plane, we're flying and next of all the oxygen mask comes down, we're left in darkness for 15 minutes, there's no reassurance just people shouting 'emergency, emergency',"" Sarah McGarry told the newspaper. ""There was a newborn baby and children on the flight, people are screaming and we don't know what's going on for 15 minutes . . . Then finally we're told that we're going to Germany."" Another passenger told the newspaper: ""It was really scary, there were three to four minutes (that felt like an hour) when the plane was falling fast and I thought we were done for"". Passengers also criticised their treatment once they had landed, saying they had not been given enough food and drink and had been forced to sleep on a concrete basement floor or on camp beds. Spanish passenger Minerva Galvan said on social media that those on board had been ""abandoned"" at Frankfurt Hahn airport after going through a ""very scaring moment"". Allow Twitter content?

Ms McGarry, who was with three children, said her eardrum burst during the descent but said she did not go to hospital because she was not told whether she would get back to the airport in time to catch the rescheduled flight. In its statement Ryanair said it would pay for hotels for the affected passengers but added that there was a ""shortage of available accommodation"". Earlier this weeka co-pilot smoking an e-cigarette on an Air China flight caused the plane to start a rapid emergency descent, bringing the plane 6,500m lower, investigators said. The co-pilot tried to conceal his actions but accidentally shut off the air-conditioning, causing oxygen levels to fall. Ryanair is Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, according to the International Air Transport Association. It flies in 37 countries and carried 130 million passengers last year.

"Mont Blanc, with 11 peaks above 4,000m, is western Europe's highest mountain range France has issued a decree restricting access to the summit of the country's highest mountain, Mont Blanc. As a result of overcrowding and safety risks, climbers will not be allowed on the peak's popular ""Royal Route"" for the next eight days, officials said. But mountaineers who have already booked accommodation on the route will be permitted to climb. Concerns have been raised recently over the numbers of tourists visiting Mont Blanc in the summer. The restrictions, introduced on Saturday, mean that only climbers who can prove that they already have a booking at the high-altitude shelter known as the Gouter will be allowed to set out for the top of Mont Blanc via the easiest and most frequented route. Two killed in Chamonix-Mont-Blanc fall Three bodies found on Miage glacier Tourists rescued from Mont Blanc cable car Authorities for the Haute-Savoie region said the shelter's overnight capacity of 120 people was frequently being exceeded, which presented ""safety and public order"" risks. ""Access to the summit of Mont Blanc via this route... is only permitted to those who have a reservation at the Gouter refuge,"" an official statement reads. The temporary restrictions are in place to ensure that climbers have adequate accommodation for an overnight stay, it adds. Mont Blanc, with 11 peaks reaching more than 4,000m above sea level, is western Europe's highest mountain range - and a challenging area for climbers. Recently, concerns have been raised over the numbers of tourists visiting Mont Blanc in the summer and the risks it poses to those who lack experience, as well as the pollution it causes. Last year, 15 people died on approaches to the summit, and two people have already been killed in falls this year. The Mont Blanc massif is extremely popular with walkers and climbers but is Europe's deadliest mountain range, claiming some 50 lives each year.

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter Gabriella hasn't seen her father for two years The family of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe says Boris Johnson's resignation as foreign secretary has put their bid for her release ""back to square one"". The 39-year-old was detained in Iran in April 2016 and given a five-year jail sentence for spying. Her sister-in-law, Rebecca Ratcliffe, said Johnson's resignation had put Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case ""at the bottom of the pile"". The Foreign Office said it is working to secure the ""outcome we all want"". Jailed British-Iranian faces new charge What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Boris Johnson resigned from the cabinet in a row over Theresa May's Brexit plan Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, Dr Ratcliffe, a GP from Cwmbran, Torfaen, said Johnson developed a ""genuine concern"" for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, from Hampstead, north London, and his resignation is a ""setback"". In November, while serving as foreign secretary, Johnson was forced to apologise after contradicting the claim that the mother was on holiday in Iran when she was arrested. However, Dr Ratcliffe said progress was being made after he visited Iran and to discuss the case. ""It came a bit out of the blue. We weren't expecting it and it's a bit of a setback.,"" she said. ""Poor Nazanin has been detained for two years and this is her third foreign secretary in that time."" Jeremy Hunt was appointed foreign secretary in the wake of Johnson's departure, but the family are concerned his attention will be elsewhere. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was close to securing diplomatic protection, but the change means a decision is now not expected for several months. What's in Jeremy Hunt's in-tray? Johnson 'must raise jailed Iran mum case' Jeremy Hunt will now be responsible for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case in his role as foreign secretary ""Every time there's a change in foreign secretary and anything happens in the government to destabilise things, her case just gets put to the bottom of a very long list of priorities for the foreign secretary and foreign office,"" Dr Ratcliffe added. ""It felt like we had momentum. It felt like we had a foreign secretary who was taking her very seriously and was going to try and get her out. ""Nazanin gets more and more disheartened and it's like she's been forgotten. ""It's a heart-breaking situation all round. Her daughter has just turned four and that's her third birthday she's had without her parents. She won't carry on like this much longer."" A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We will continue to approach our consular cases in Iran in a way that we judge is most likely to secure the outcome we all want. Therefore we will not be providing a running commentary on every twist and turn."" Jailed British-Iranian faces new charge Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?

"This video can not be played 'I'd like them to sit down and explain' Former Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams has called on those who attacked his home to meet him. Mr Adams asked those responsible to have the ""gumption and guts"" to meet him and explain their actions. Sinn FÃ©in activist Bobby Storey's house was also attackedand police say the devices thrown at both homes were believed to be ""large industrial or commercial fireworks"". Such devices have the capacity to cause serious injury and damage to property. The attacks took place in west Belfast on Friday night. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Adams said two of his grandchildren had been in the driveway before the attack but no-one was injured. Mr Adams said he was unsure whether there was a connection between the attacksand the recent violence in Londonderry, which is being linked to dissident republicans. In a direct appeal to those who attacked his home, he said: ""I'd like them to sit down and explain to me what this is about. ""I'd like those who are involved in exploiting children in Derry to do the same thing, or those who are poisoning the atmosphere in east Belfast and causing havoc to do the same thing."" He said those responsible were ""resistant to change"" and the groups that had stepped away from the peace process saw Sinn FÃ©in as the enemy. Sinn FÃ©in said there were children in the driveway minutes before the attack The Police Service of Northern Ireland said officers were investigating incidents at two houses in west Belfast, after reports were received of loud bangs at both locations at 22:50 BST on Friday 13 July. ""There were no reports of any injuries. However, a parked car was damaged at one of the houses,"" a spokesman said. By Chris Page, Ireland correspondent Gerry Adams has spoken several times in the past about death threats made against him - by loyalists and by dissident republicans who are opposed to the peace process. Sinn FÃ©in's statement about the attacks on the homes of Mr Adams and Bobby Storey doesn't explicitly pin the blame on republican splinter groups. However, the party's reference to ""increasingly desperate and irrelevant groups"" firmly points in that direction - and republicans who have expressed support for Mr Adams on social media have condemned dissidents as ""criminals"" and ""thugs"". A number of hours earlier, Mr Adams's successor as Sinn Fein President - Mary Lou McDonald - strongly denounced the dissidents who are believed to be behind recent rioting in Londonderry as ""warped, negative, regressive, dangerous people"". Police responded to reports of loud bangs at 22:50 BST on Friday 13 July The other attack occurred at the home of Bobby Storey, a senior Sinn FÃ©in figure and a former member of the Provisional IRA. He was involved in the Maze Prison escape in 1983, where 38 IRA prisoners escaped from the maximum security prison. The attacks in Belfast came after six nights of violence in Derry, which have taken place around the Twelfth of July parades, which often bring a heightening of tensions centred around the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne. â Mr Adams, 69, spent nearly 34 years at the helm of Irish republican party Sinn FÃ©in. During The Troubles Mr Adams survived several attempts on his life, including a 1984 gun attack by loyalist paramilitaries. He is one of the most recognisable and controversial figures in Irish politics Two months after the death of Martin McGuinness in 2017, Mr Adams announced he would step down as leader. He was succeeded by Mary Lou McDonald. You can read a full profile here.

The 59-year-old replaces fellow Italian Antonio Conte, who wassacked on Fridayafter two years at Stamford Bridge. Sarri led Napoli to two second-place finishes in his three seasons in charge of the Serie A side, who namedCarlo Ancelotti as his successorin May. ""It is an exciting new period in my career,"" said Sarri. ""I hope we can provide some entertaining football for our fans and that we will be competing for trophies at the end of the season, which is what this club deserves."" He is the 13th managerial appointment by Blues owner Roman Abramovich since his takeover of the club in 2003, including Jose Mourinho and Guus Hiddink on two occasions. Sarri's appointment had been widely expected, with Chelsea agreeing compensation to bring him to Stamford Bridge because he had two years left on his Napoli deal and had remained on the Italian club's payroll after Ancelotti's arrival. A visionary former banker loved by Guardiola - who is Sarri? How Conte exit continues title-winning trend Why did Conte's reign at Chelsea turn sour? Italian football expert James Horncastle Sarri never made it as a player and, unable to make a living as a footballer, he worked as a foreign currency trader at the Banca Toscana. He was attached to the international department, which involved business trips to Europe's financial centres, including the City of London - but the role never stoked his imagination quite like football did. He coached part-time, hopping from one Tuscan town to another and in 2001, when foreign currency traders like him were no longer as useful to banks as Italy prepared to adopt the euro, Sarri decided to take a leap of faith and leave his well-paid, regular-hours role, for what he says is ""the only job I would do for free"". Maurizio Sarri's Serie A record at Napoli Juventus have dominated the Italian league - winning seven titles in a row - but no side has come closer to them in that time than Napoli, who finished four points behind their rivals last season. Sarri comes with a reputation as an attacking manager, with Napoli's haul of 94 goals in the 2016-17 league campaign remaining the highest number scored in a Serie A season since the turn of the century. In his three years in charge, Napoli scored 251 league goals - more than any other side in the Italian top flight. He is Chelsea's sixth Italian manager since Gianluca Vialli in 1998, following Claudio Ranieri, Ancelotti, Roberto di Matteo and Conte. Despite his success domestically, he failed to guide the Naples club past the last-16 stage of the Champions League, finishing third in their group last season behind Manchester City and Shakhtar Donetsk. He joined Napoli in 2015 after guiding Empoli to the top flight. Chelsea is his first managerial job outside his home country and he has yet to win a major trophy.

"An explosive device has been thrown at former Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams' house in west Belfast, the party has said. In a statement the party added activist Bobby Storey's house was also attacked. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) confirmed that it was investigating two incidents in west Belfast. Mr Adams, a member of parliament in the Republic of Ireland, tweeted that no-one was hurt at his house. Sinn FÃ©in said there were children in the driveway minutes before the attack The incident occurred on Friday night Sinn FÃ©in MLA Gerry Kelly said ""these were reprehensible and cowardly attacks"". ""Grandchildren were in the driveway of Adams' home minutes before the attack,"" he added. An explosive was also thrown at the house of Bobby Storey, a former member of the Provisional IRA. Bobby Storey is a senior Sinn FÃ©in figure and a former IRA prisoner Mr Storey was involved in the Maze Prison escape in 1983, where 38 IRA prisoners escaped from the maximum security prison.

"This video can not be played 'I'd like them to sit down and explain' Former Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams has called on those who attacked his home to meet him.

Such devices have the capacity to cause serious injury and damage to property. The attacks took place in west Belfast on Friday night. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Adams said two of his grandchildren had been in the driveway before the attack but no-one was injured. Mr Adams said he was unsure whether there was a connection between the attacksand the recent violence in Londonderry, which is being linked to dissident republicans. In a direct appeal to those who attacked his home, he said: ""I'd like them to sit down and explain to me what this is about. ""I'd like those who are involved in exploiting children in Derry to do the same thing, or those who are poisoning the atmosphere in east Belfast and causing havoc to do the same thing.""

"It has been just days since the whirlwind that is Donald Trump landed in the UK for his first official visit since becoming US president - and what a couple of days it has turned out to be. A floating effigy, a bombshell interview and a meeting with the Queen - all against the backdrop of angry protests. To be honest, it was never going to be your usual visit by a head of state: the initial invitation, for a full state visit, had created so much outrage that it ended up being debated in parliament. So by the time Mr Trump finally touched down - fresh from a Nato summit which had been more than a little tense - the country was braced. Here is how the visit panned out. Mr Trump and his wife Melania arrived on Air Force One at London Stansted - an airport more used to welcoming budget flights - on Thursday afternoon, fresh from that Nato summit in Brussels. The US First Couple were immediately whisked from the airport to central London, and the official residence of the US Ambassador, Woody Johnson, in Regent's Park. This video can not be played President Donald Trump arrived at Stansted for a two-day working visit But not for the Trumps the joys - and traffic - of the motorway: they travelled via helicopter. In fact, Mr Trump and his entourage would go on to avoid travelling by road wherever possible, the road convoy travelling from location to location to meet the president as he disembarked from Marine One, his official helicopter. No doubt, this meant the president could travel more quickly and efficiently during a packed schedule. Avoiding protest-lined streets was a bonus too. Unfortunately, travelling by helicopter did not stop him being a few minutes late reaching Blenheim Palace, where Prime Minister Theresa May was waiting to greet the president, along with 150 other guests. Blenheim Palace, by the way, was where Britain's wartime leader Winston Churchill was born - the man whose bust Mr Trump placed back in the Oval Office, and in whose chair he has now sat: Allow Twitter content?

President Trump would later rave about how well the dinner - a smoked salmon starter followed by Hereford beef fillet and potatoes (surely a winner with the steak-loving president), topped off with strawberries and cream - had gone. But before it was over, British tabloid The Sun had dropped a bombshell. It came just before 23:00 UK time (22:00 GMT) in a series of tweets from The Sun's Tom Newton Dunn. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump did not need to be making any more enemies in the UK. As soon as the visit was confirmed, people angry at the president's policies - ranging from the so-called Muslim ban, to the wall with Mexico, and his rejection of the Paris climate deal - began to organise. The result was tens of thousands of people gathering in central London to protest against the visit. This video can not be played Thousands of protesters march through London In fact, Mr Trump's schedule, with all meeting venues kept outside the capital, was arranged with the protests in mind - and it hadn't gone unnoticed by the president. In particular, it seems he had heard about the ""Trump Baby"", a six-metre (19.7ft) balloon depiction of the property mogul as a nappy (or diaper) wearing infant, complete with mobile and tan lines. More than 10,000 people signed a petition calling for the inflatable to be given permission to fly, although it was not universally popular. Some have described the balloon, which was inflated outside parliament on Friday morning, as ""a disgrace"" and ""disrespectful.""

""I guess when they put out blimps to make me feel unwelcome, no reason for me to go to London,"" he told the Sun. To which some protesters responded: that was the point.

But it was not Mrs Trump's skills at the Commonwealth sport which caught the eye of those watching. Rather, it was the 10cm Laboutin heels she was wearing, which - as anyone who has worn a pair of 10cm heels will know - do not mix well with grass. Mrs Trump was also wearing a Victoria Beckham dress, which was seen as a good, diplomatic choice by the former model who found herself in hot water overher choice of jacket on a visit to a migrant child detention centre last month. Back at Chequers, Mr Trump and Mrs May were ready to face the press - and of course, there was only one question on everyone's lips: was the so-called ""special relationship"" still in good order?

"This video can not be played Attenborough launches ""Boaty McBoatface"" polar ship Sir David Attenborough has launched the 10,000-tonne hull of the UK's newest polar ship - named after him - into the River Mersey. The broadcaster pushed the button, sending the hull sliding out from the Cammell Laird yard in Birkenhead, into the water where building will continue. ""Our future will be affected by what people working on this ship will be discovering in years to come,"" he said. It is ""the greatest possible honour"" to be its namesake, Sir David added. The hull of the Â£200m research vessel entered the river stern-first, creating a big wave as it hit the water. Ahead of the launch, the riverbed was dredged in front of the slipway to make sure the steel mass did not bottom out. Sir David and Dame Jane Francis press the big button Tugs were on hand to catch the hull as it floated out from the slipway ""When 100 years ago this country sent people down to the South Pole, we were the pioneers in exploring the Antarctic,"" Sir David said. ""When we did so, I suspect the reason we did was the South Pole seemed as far away as it could possibly get to be on this planet. ""Now, 100 years later, we realise that remote place is, in fact, key to the whole understanding of the planet. What goes on down there affects the whole of the Earth."" This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough polar ship: Here's an inside peek Saturday was an important milestone for the ship, whose development has been followed closely since an online campaign tried to get it named ""Boaty McBoatface"". ""She's like a giant Airfix model,"" said Cammell Laird project manager John Drummond. ""She's being put together with one million pieces of steel, 30km of piping, 5,000 valves, and 450km of cabling."" How to put a polar ship in the water The steelwork that went in the water represents the lower-decks of the Attenborough and the components whose great size meant they had to be encapsulated during the build. This included the vessel's huge diesel-electric Rolls-Royce engines. Four tugs were on hand to catch the hull as it floated out into the Mersey. These then moved the structure a short distance down the river to the company's ""wet basin"". Claire Biggar says a lot of work is still needed to finish the ship It is here that the upper-decks will be attached, together will all the internal fixtures and fittings, such as cabins and laboratories. ""At the moment we have just the six decks in the hull, and the other six decks of what we call the super-structure will be lifted on after she's gone into our harbour,"" explained Claire Biggar, assistant ship manager at Cammell Laird. An official handover of the finished ship is scheduled for the end of the year. It is at this point that the RRS Sir David Attenborough can begin sea trials, and go on its maiden expeditions to the Arctic and the Antarctic. Prof Dame Jane Francis is the director of the British Antarctic Survey: ""We've now got a real state-of-the-art ship and so we'll be able to do a lot more science. We'll be able to go into more remote areas. We'll be able to do bigger projects; we'll be able to do a lot more science. We really will be able to do frontier science that we haven't been able to do in the past,"" she told BBC News. The two ships that make up the UK's existing polar fleet - the RRS James Clark Ross (JCR) and the RRS Ernest Shackleton - are ageing, with nearly 50 years' service now between them. These vessels are also getting expensive to run. The Â£200m, state-of-the-art Attenborough will be their replacement. It will have the capability to fulfil all the roles currently undertaken by the JCR and the Shackleton, which broadly split into research and logistics. The new ship will support scientists working at both ends of the planet. At times, this will include delivering the supplies that sustain British bases, such as Rothera and Halley in Antarctica. On other occasions, it will mean acting as the platform from which scientists can launch investigations of the polar environment. Because of where the ship will have to work, the hull has been designed to break through metre-thick sea-ice. The Attenborough will be equipped with all the latest scientific gear. It will have a helipad, cranes and onboard labs, and have the ability to deploy subs and other ocean survey and sampling kit. One of its key features is an enclosed ""moon pool"". This is essentially a huge hole running right through the middle of the hull. It will allow instruments to be lowered into - and recovered from - the sea when weather or dense sea-ice conditions would normally make such work very difficult. The ship design, put together by Rolls-Royce, also enables near-silent running when required, meaning scientists can study sea creatures without disturbing them. Boaty the submarine is among the sophisticated equipment that the ship will deploy Boaty McBoatface lives on in the form of a yellow submarine. The National Oceanography Centre in Southampton has three long-range autonomous underwater vehicles. When one of these is out on patrol, it carries the humorous moniker. The intention is that these Boaty-class subs will frequently operate from the Attenborough. They will be asked to go into places the ship itself cannot reach, such as under the colossal floating ice shelves that surround Antarctica.

Speaking after talks at Chequers, Mr Trump said the US-UK relationship is ""the highest level of special"", while Mrs May said they had discussed plans for an ""ambitious"" trade agreement. Mr Trump and his wife, Melania, later had tea with the Queen at Windsor. Thousands of people have protested in London against Mr Trump's UK visit.

The crowd is full of whistles, drums and the all important pots and pans that seem to have become a symbol of this movement. Whilst the mood is jovial, their motivation is serious. Most of those I've talked to are here because of Mr Trump's immigration policies, especially after recent pictures from the Mexican border. There are also countless signs on his attitude to women.

"Mr Afwerki arrived in Ethiopia on Saturday - his first visit to the country in two decades Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki is visiting Ethiopia for the first time since the start of the two countries' border war in 1998. The three-day visit aims to cement ties just days after the two neighbours declared their ""state of war"" over. Mr Afwerki was welcomed on arrival by Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Thousands of people, many waving Eritrean flags, lined the streets of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, to mark the historic visit on Saturday. Mr Afwerki, whose visit is the latest in a string of moves towards reconciliation between Africa's erstwhile bitter enemies, was also greeted by dozens of traditional Ethiopian dancers while a brass band performed for him as he walked the red carpet. Some residents painted their faces for the welcome ceremony for Mr Afwerki People sang and waved Ethiopian flags from their balconies Along the main road from the airport, thousands of Ethiopians gathered to celebrate with both Ethiopian and Eritrean flags waved side-by-side. Speaking at a lunch hosted by Mr Abiy, Mr Afwerki said history was being made following an agreement that will see diplomatic and trade relations restored and lead to the resumption of flights between the two countries. ""Words cannot express the joy we are feeling now,"" he said. People lined roads in Addis Ababa wearing T-shirts emblazoned with images of both leaders Last week Mr Abiy travelled to Eritrea's capital, Asmara, where the two leaders signed a pact formally ending the state of war while agreeing to re-establish diplomatic and trade ties after two decades of hostility. Since taking office in Ethiopia in April, Mr Abiy has announced a series of reforms, and spoken of mending ties with Eritrea. 'I only live to see my daughters again' Is this the man to change Ethiopia? An improved relationship between the two could also see the reunification of families who have been divided by the conflict. The two countries have been in a state of ""no war, no peace"" since 2000, when a peace deal ended a war in which tens of thousands of people were killed. A border commission set up under the peace agreement ruled that the town of Badme, the flashpoint for the conflict, was part of Eritrea but Ethiopia refused to accept this and so normal relations were never resumed. The two leaders have now committed to fully implementing the commission's decision. The rivalry affected the whole region. The countries took rival sides in Somalia's long conflict - Eritrea was accused of backing Islamist groups, while Ethiopia, a US ally, supported the internationally recognised government. Until now, Eritrea has said that war could resume at any time and this is why it has national conscription, or compulsory military service, which could last indefinitely. It is one of the main reasons why so many Eritreans try to leave the country and seek asylum in Europe. Making peace with Africa's North Korea Behind the smiles of Eritrea's president Mr Afwerki's visit is a remarkable turnaround for the 72-year-old independence leader who has been isolated diplomatically and seen as secretive and paranoid. As well as his overtures to Eritrea, Mr Abiy has lifted a state of emergency, freed political prisoners and announced economic reforms. He inherited a country that has seen some of the fastest economic growth in the world in recent years, but has also been riven by years of protests by people who feel marginalised. Jubilant Eritreans took to the streets of the capital, Asmara, last week as Ethiopia's prime minister visited The previous government was accused by many of human rights violations - including torture and extrajudicial killing of political dissidents. Mr Abiy is the country's first Oromo leader - the ethnic group at the centre of nearly three years of anti-government protests, which have left hundreds of people dead. Along with diplomatic and trade ties, transport and telephone links will also be re-established. The first flights between the two countries in two decades are expected to begin next week - over the past 20 years it has been impossible to travel directly from one nation to the other. This raises the possibility that families who have been divided by the conflict could finally be reunited.

In the video, first reported by KLPZ, Mr Mosely tells the officer who pulled him over that he ""didn't even notice"" his speed because of his ""nice"" car. ""I'm trying to surprise my wife,"" he said, adding that he only speeds ""as long as it's safe"". Mr Mosley also tells the La Paz County officer he does not break the law because he can, but ""because I'm just trying to get home"". The deputy's written report also stated that the Republican lawmaker said they should not waste time on the incident since he has legislative immunity. In his apology, Mr Mosley said: ""My desire to get home to see my family does not justify how fast I was speeding nor my reference to legislative immunity when being pulled over."" He adds: ""In addition, my jokes about frequently driving over 100 miles per hour during my 3-hour commute to and from the capitol were entirely inappropriate and showed extremely bad judgement on my part, for which I am truly sorry."" Mr Mosely was elected in 2016 and is running for re-election in November. A top Arizona lawmaker, Speaker J D Mesnard, said in a statement he was ""disturbed"" by the video. ""Nothing short of an emergency justifies that kind of speeding, and assertions of immunity in that situation seem outside the intent of the constitutional provision regarding legislative immunity,"" said Mr Mesnard.

"Dawn Sturgess died on Sunday after falling ill on 30 June Novichok that poisoned a couple in Wiltshire came from a small bottle found in the home of one of the victims, police say. A bottle was found in a search at Charlie Rowley's Amesbury house and was tested by scientists at Porton Down, the Metropolitan Police said. Mr Rowley, 45, remains in hospital in Salisbury in a serious but stable condition after falling ill on 30 June. His partner Dawn Sturgess, 44, died last weekend. Scientists at the Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory are still trying to establish whether the deadly substance found at Mr Rowley's house came from the same batch of Novichok that contaminated Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March. Police said they were still trying to find out where the bottle came from, and why it ended up in the house. Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head of UK Counter Terrorism Policing, said it was ""clearly a significant and positive development"". ""However, we cannot guarantee that there isn't any more of the substance left and cordons will remain in place for some considerable time,"" he added. ""This is to allow thorough searches to continue as a precautionary measure for public safety and to assist the investigation team."" Charlie Rowley remains at Salisbury District Hospital after regaining consciousness earlier this week A spokesman said detectives had spoken to Mr Rowley and were due to speak to him again to establish how he and Ms Sturgess came to be contaminated. A murder inquiry was started following the death of Ms Sturgess, a mother of three, on Sunday. The discovery of the bottle comes as the Foreign Office announced independent chemical weapons experts would arrive in the UK next week to assist with the investigation. Staff from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will travel to the UK to independently confirm the identity of the nerve agent which led to Ms Sturgess's death. The samples will be analysed at ""highly reputable international laboratories designated by the OPCW"", a spokesman said. BBC Security Correspondent Gordon Corera The bottle was found at Mr Rowley's home in Amesbury The discovery of the bottle is a significant moment. It will help reassure residents in the local area that the risks to their health have been reduced, although the police say they cannot guarantee no more of the substance is left. And it also may provide a significant piece of evidence in trying to establish how Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley came to be poisoned - and what link there might be with the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. The working assumption of police is that the bottle was a container discarded after the March poisoning. It may now be possible to establish a scientific link by trying to match impurities in both samples of Novichok to see if the nerve agent comes from the same batch. Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard said the discovery of the bottle was ""significant and encouraging"". He said private security guards would join officers on some of the cordons from next week, as the investigation continued. ""This will free up some Wiltshire Police officers to get back to supporting day-to-day community policing,"" About 100 detectives from the Counter Terrorism Policing Network are continuing to work on the investigation, alongside colleagues from Wiltshire Police, a spokesman said.

"Mr Afwerki arrived in Ethiopia on Saturday - his first visit to the country in two decades Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki is visiting Ethiopia for the first time since the start of the two countries' border war in 1998. The three-day visit aims to cement ties just days after the two neighbours declared their ""state of war"" over. Mr Afwerki was welcomed on arrival by Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Thousands of people, many waving Eritrean flags, lined the streets of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, to mark the historic visit on Saturday. Mr Afwerki, whose visit is the latest in a string of moves towards reconciliation between Africa's erstwhile bitter enemies, was also greeted by dozens of traditional Ethiopian dancers while a brass band performed for him as he walked the red carpet. Some residents painted their faces for the welcome ceremony for Mr Afwerki People sang and waved Ethiopian flags from their balconies Along the main road from the airport, thousands of Ethiopians gathered to celebrate with both Ethiopian and Eritrean flags waved side-by-side. Speaking at a lunch hosted by Mr Abiy, Mr Afwerki said history was being made following an agreement that will see diplomatic and trade relations restored and lead to the resumption of flights between the two countries. ""Words cannot express the joy we are feeling now,"" he said. People lined roads in Addis Ababa wearing T-shirts emblazoned with images of both leaders Last week Mr Abiy travelled to Eritrea's capital, Asmara, where the two leaders signed a pact formally ending the state of war while agreeing to re-establish diplomatic and trade ties after two decades of hostility. Since taking office in Ethiopia in April, Mr Abiy has announced a series of reforms, and spoken of mending ties with Eritrea. 'I only live to see my daughters again' Is this the man to change Ethiopia? An improved relationship between the two could also see the reunification of families who have been divided by the conflict. The two countries have been in a state of ""no war, no peace"" since 2000, when a peace deal ended a war in which tens of thousands of people were killed. A border commission set up under the peace agreement ruled that the town of Badme, the flashpoint for the conflict, was part of Eritrea but Ethiopia refused to accept this and so normal relations were never resumed. The two leaders have now committed to fully implementing the commission's decision. The rivalry affected the whole region. The countries took rival sides in Somalia's long conflict - Eritrea was accused of backing Islamist groups, while Ethiopia, a US ally, supported the internationally recognised government. Until now, Eritrea has said that war could resume at any time and this is why it has national conscription, or compulsory military service, which could last indefinitely. It is one of the main reasons why so many Eritreans try to leave the country and seek asylum in Europe. Making peace with Africa's North Korea Behind the smiles of Eritrea's president Mr Afwerki's visit is a remarkable turnaround for the 72-year-old independence leader who has been isolated diplomatically and seen as secretive and paranoid. As well as his overtures to Eritrea, Mr Abiy has lifted a state of emergency, freed political prisoners and announced economic reforms. He inherited a country that has seen some of the fastest economic growth in the world in recent years, but has also been riven by years of protests by people who feel marginalised. Jubilant Eritreans took to the streets of the capital, Asmara, last week as Ethiopia's prime minister visited The previous government was accused by many of human rights violations - including torture and extrajudicial killing of political dissidents. Mr Abiy is the country's first Oromo leader - the ethnic group at the centre of nearly three years of anti-government protests, which have left hundreds of people dead. Along with diplomatic and trade ties, transport and telephone links will also be re-established. The first flights between the two countries in two decades are expected to begin next week - over the past 20 years it has been impossible to travel directly from one nation to the other. This raises the possibility that families who have been divided by the conflict could finally be reunited.

"Mr Mosley is up for re-election in November An Arizona state lawmaker bragged to a police officer that he sometimes drives more than double the speed limit - after he was pulled over for speeding. Police stopped Representative Paul Mosley for going 97mph (156km/h) in a 55mph zone near Parker, Arizona, on 27 March in a filmed incident. Mr Mosley said he would go ""130, 140"" mph on his way home and told the cop he had legislative immunity. The lawmaker has posted an apology on his Facebook page. Allow YouTube content?

You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. In the video, first reported by KLPZ, Mr Mosely tells the officer who pulled him over that he ""didn't even notice"" his speed because of his ""nice"" car. ""I'm trying to surprise my wife,"" he said, adding that he only speeds ""as long as it's safe"". Mr Mosley also tells the La Paz County officer he does not break the law because he can, but ""because I'm just trying to get home"". The deputy's written report also stated that the Republican lawmaker said they should not waste time on the incident since he has legislative immunity. In his apology, Mr Mosley said: ""My desire to get home to see my family does not justify how fast I was speeding nor my reference to legislative immunity when being pulled over."" He adds: ""In addition, my jokes about frequently driving over 100 miles per hour during my 3-hour commute to and from the capitol were entirely inappropriate and showed extremely bad judgement on my part, for which I am truly sorry."" Mr Mosely was elected in 2016 and is running for re-election in November. A top Arizona lawmaker, Speaker J D Mesnard, said in a statement he was ""disturbed"" by the video. ""Nothing short of an emergency justifies that kind of speeding, and assertions of immunity in that situation seem outside the intent of the constitutional provision regarding legislative immunity,"" said Mr Mesnard. CBS News reported,externalthe Arizona Fraternal Order of Police has revoked its endorsement of Mr Mosley due to his speeding. In a statement, John Ortolano, the order's president, condemned the lawmaker's ""recklessness, his demeanor and his utter disregard for the safety of the public"". Why is speeding not a taboo?

"Dawn Sturgess died on Sunday after falling ill on 30 June Novichok that poisoned a couple in Wiltshire came from a small bottle found in the home of one of the victims, police say. A bottle was found in a search at Charlie Rowley's Amesbury house and was tested by scientists at Porton Down, the Metropolitan Police said. Mr Rowley, 45, remains in hospital in Salisbury in a serious but stable condition after falling ill on 30 June. His partner Dawn Sturgess, 44, died last weekend. Scientists at the Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory are still trying to establish whether the deadly substance found at Mr Rowley's house came from the same batch of Novichok that contaminated Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March. Police said they were still trying to find out where the bottle came from, and why it ended up in the house. Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head of UK Counter Terrorism Policing, said it was ""clearly a significant and positive development"". ""However, we cannot guarantee that there isn't any more of the substance left and cordons will remain in place for some considerable time,"" he added. ""This is to allow thorough searches to continue as a precautionary measure for public safety and to assist the investigation team."" Charlie Rowley remains at Salisbury District Hospital after regaining consciousness earlier this week A spokesman said detectives had spoken to Mr Rowley and were due to speak to him again to establish how he and Ms Sturgess came to be contaminated. A murder inquiry was started following the death of Ms Sturgess, a mother of three, on Sunday. The discovery of the bottle comes as the Foreign Office announced independent chemical weapons experts would arrive in the UK next week to assist with the investigation. Staff from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will travel to the UK to independently confirm the identity of the nerve agent which led to Ms Sturgess's death. The samples will be analysed at ""highly reputable international laboratories designated by the OPCW"", a spokesman said. BBC Security Correspondent Gordon Corera The bottle was found at Mr Rowley's home in Amesbury The discovery of the bottle is a significant moment. It will help reassure residents in the local area that the risks to their health have been reduced, although the police say they cannot guarantee no more of the substance is left. And it also may provide a significant piece of evidence in trying to establish how Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley came to be poisoned - and what link there might be with the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. The working assumption of police is that the bottle was a container discarded after the March poisoning. It may now be possible to establish a scientific link by trying to match impurities in both samples of Novichok to see if the nerve agent comes from the same batch. Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard said the discovery of the bottle was ""significant and encouraging"". He said private security guards would join officers on some of the cordons from next week, as the investigation continued. ""This will free up some Wiltshire Police officers to get back to supporting day-to-day community policing,"" About 100 detectives from the Counter Terrorism Policing Network are continuing to work on the investigation, alongside colleagues from Wiltshire Police, a spokesman said. Forensic investigators have been searching for the source of the nerve agent since Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess fell ill Public Health England said the risk to the public in Salisbury and Amesbury ""remains low"" and no further cases of illness linked to the incident had been seen. As a precaution members of the public are continuing to be urged to not to pick up items such as syringes, needles, cosmetics or similar objects made of materials such as metal, plastic or glass. The advice remains ""if you didn't drop it, then don't pick it up"", a spokesman said.

Most of those I've talked to are here because of Mr Trump's immigration policies, especially after recent pictures from the Mexican border. There are also countless signs on his attitude to women. 'Dump Trump': Views from the London marches What has Trump said about your country? Anti-Trump protesters are staging demonstrations in central London At the news conference, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship between our two nations is indispensable to the cause of liberty, justice, and peace."" He also told reporters: He had apologised to Mrs May for the Sun's story - but she told him not to worry as ""it's only the press"" He had not given Mrs May advice on how to deal with the EU but ""did give her a suggestion... and I think she found it maybe too brutal"" Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"" and ""whatever"" the UK did after it left the EU was ""OK with me"" Mr Trump described Brexit as a ""very tough situation... between the borders and the entries into the countries and all of the things"", saying: ""The only thing I ask is that she work it out so that we can have very even trade."" This video can not be played A giant blimp of Donald Trump has been launched in London Mrs May said the US was ""keen"" to do a deal with the UK, adding: ""We will do a trade deal with them and with others around the rest of the world."" She maintained the government's Brexit agreement - which has come under fire from supporters of a ""hard Brexit"" - ""delivers"" on the referendum vote. Earlier, Mr Trump said he and Mrs May had spoken for an hour-and-a-half at the black-tie dinner at Blenheim Palace on Thursday, which he attended with his wife Melania. ""I think we probably never developed a better relationship than last night,"" he said. This video can not be played Trump: We've never had a better relationship Mr Trump arrived at Chequers by helicopter after visiting the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, Berkshire. Meanwhile,Mrs Trump played bowlswith the PM's husband, Philip May, at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London, where she met Chelsea Pensioners and local children and was shown how to make remembrance poppies. Downing Street said Mrs May had presented the US president with a gift of an illustrated ancestral chart of his Scottish heritage through his mother, and his wife with a bespoke perfume called the First Lady in a custom bottle. The Trumps flew to Prestwick Airport after their meeting with the Queen In his Sun interview, Mr Trump also said former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who disagrees with the PM on Brexit and resigned this week - would make a ""great prime minister"", adding: ""I think he's got what it takes."" At the news conference, Mr Trump said he had been responding to the Sun's question about Mr Johnson as a possible prime minister, adding: ""He has been very nice to me. He's been saying very good things about me as president.""

"This video can not be played Emotional scenes as England players react to semi-final defeat Gareth Southgate was in a reflective mood as he prepared to bring England's momentous World Cup campaign to a close. As he prepared for Saturday's third-place play-off against Belgium in St Petersburg, the manager looked back on the run to England's first World Cup semi-final in 28 years - and ahead to the future for his emerging side. So what will England and Southgate take away from Russia? England will return home to widespread acclaim for reaching the last four. They were 22 minutes from their first World Cup final since 1966, until Croatia came back from a goal down to win 2-1 in extra time on Wednesday. In the past, other nations have been mystified by England's sense of self-importance at major tournaments - given it has so rarely been matched by results. Southgate's side may have had a favourable draw, helped by big names falling early, but they gave reason to be proud in Russia. They attempted to play in a style that countered the old English stereotype of perspiration over inspiration. And while it would be understandable if Southgate took some time to recover from the anguish of getting so close to a World Cup final, this tournament has enhanced his reputation - and restored England's. This video can not be played Southgate has been majestic - Ferdinand England's united front was not simply the reflection of a polished Football Association public relations strategy - it was a reality on and off the pitch. In the past, England squads have been riven with divisions based around club loyalties. Southgate has ensured no such problems existed in Russia. When captain Harry Kane referred to his fellow squad members as being ""like brothers"", no-one flinched. England's players have genuinely shared a special bond in this past month, reflected in their behaviour - whether at training at Zelenogorsk, out and about in Repino, or on the pitch. When the players got to their hotel rooms at the start of the tournament, the FA ensured they had photographs of their families there. Southgate used the personal touch too. A member of the FA staff found a handwritten note from the England manager in his room on arrival - sharing it on social media. Yes, it was part of an overall strategy but it was genuine - and there was a feeling of unity among everyone involved with England in Russia. That is something solid for Southgate to build on. England leave Russia with plenty to encourage them - including a clear tactical plan. In previous tournaments, tactics appeared a movable feast - from the farce of Paul Scholes playing on the left of midfield as Sven-Goran Eriksson tried to shoehorn his best players into a team, to the madcap selections of Roy Hodgson's latter days in charge. Southgate decided more than a year ago a 3-5-2 system was what suited England best, then decided on the players to fit it. He wants England to be a modern, possession-based team. To a large extent, he has achieved that, although some bad long-ball habits returned when the tide turned against Croatia. In terms of strategy, Southgate has demonstrated a clarity of thought that bodes well. Were England good, lucky or a bit of both? Why England v Belgium matters? In the past England's players have appeared aloof. Not any more. England has fallen in love with its footballers again. There was a refreshing simplicity around this squad, after the overblown celebrity of the David Beckham era,the distasteful circus of the WAGsin Baden-Baden in Germany in 2006 and the unrelenting focus on high-profile stars such as Wayne Rooney. Southgate said: ""The desire of our public is to see players playing with pride, first and foremost. ""They want to see a team who leaves everything out on the pitch and they have seen that without question. ""They've got to know the players better I think and the reality is different to the perception, with this group in particular. There will be an affinity there."" Wayne Rooney criticised the fans for booing after England's 0-0 draw with Algeria at the 2010 World Cup England's players were remarkably open when telling their stories, such as when Danny Rose spoke about his struggle with depression. The squad's modesty and likeability touched a chord back home and led to a surge of goodwill bordering on hysteria as the World Cup progressed. Relations between the team and journalists were cordial, as they played darts and mixed together at the media centre in Repino - with the slight blip of ""teamsheetgate"", when assistant Steve Holland was pictured holding a piece of paper that appeared to give away the line-up for the group match against Panama. The FA's open-house policy with the media, starting with the Super Bowl-style presentation of 23 players for interview at St George's Park in early June, fostered good relations, although results helped. This was a happy England camp. It was reflected on and off the pitch. Quiz: How many World Cup third-place finishers can you name? Lawro's predicts: France v Croatia & Belgium v England Dublin interviews 'skipper' Southgate England not only have a team for the present but also one for the future - and the all-important spine is taking shape. Jordan Pickford, at 24, has the capacity to be England's goalkeeper for the next decade while Harry Maguire, only a year older, has been outstanding in that three-man defensive system, with the best yet to come from John Stones, who is 24. Southgate has work to do in terms of midfield creation but Dele Alli will be a long-term fixture while 24-year-old captain and leading marksman Kane will, barring accidents, wear the armband and be England's main spearhead for years to come. England's ultimate disappointment came as a result of failing to close out a semi-final against Croatia despite controlling it for 45 minutes. They are a team in development and there will be bumps in the road - but Southgate himself said England cannot be regarded as a top team until they beat a top team. England have not beaten a team ranked above them at a major tournament since defeating Argentina in Japan during the 2002 World Cup. The current side have still to acquire that match hardness. It was something Southgate has been reflecting on, saying: ""We need to keep continually improving. The improvement over the last eight months has been dramatic, but we've had six matches playing with this system ahead of this tournament. ""The players have got a lot clearer. We felt the best way to be successful was to play that system and get the detail as clear as possible. Now we've cemented that, we can look at other things moving forward and progress in other areas."" If they end their World Cup adventure by overcoming Belgium, who stand third in the Fifa rankings, it will be a highly satisfactory starting point.

"Policeman on Link Street, Camden, north London, where a 20-year-old man was stabbed in April Earlier this year, an article in the Sunday Times sparked debate about rising levels of violent crime with a claim that the numbers of murders in London had surpassed those in New York during one month -- February. My colleague, Dominic Casciani,analysed the figuresand found that the newspaper was correct. In February, the New York Police Department dealt with 11 homicides (suspected cases of murder, manslaughter and infanticide) while London's Metropolitan Police opened investigations into 15 deaths. But the overall tally for the year to April showed there were more homicides in New York than in London, and that as a proportion of the population they were far higher across the pond. The apparent blip in the homicide rate and a surge in stabbings -- knife crimes recorded by police forces across England and Wales in 2017 went up by 22 per cent -- prompted an intervention from Donald Trump. There were 141 homicides in New York City in the first half of this year In a speechto the National Rifle Association in May, the US President said there was ""blood all over the floors"" of a London hospital. ""They say it's as bad as a military war zone hospital. Knives, knives, knives, knives,"" said Mr Trump. ""London hasn't been used to that. They're getting used to it. It's pretty tough."" In an interview published in the Sun newspaper on Friday, the President reiterated his view on London's hospitals and said the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was doing a ""bad job on crime."" The Mayor argues that crime has increased across England and Wales. And he says insinuating that the immigrant population is responsible for rising crime in London - as President Trump did - was ""preposterous."" So, as Mr Trump visits the UK, and with six months' data for the first half of 2018, how do London and New York now compare? The figures are pretty clear.  In the first six months of this year, there were 80 homicides in London, including one in the City of London which has its own police force. Over the same period in New York there were 141 homicides - 61 more than London. As the year has gone on, the initial monthly homicide figures have been updated, as some cases turn out to be non-suspicious deaths and are re-categorised.  What that shows is that February was the only month where there were more killings in London (18) than in New York (14): it was indeed a blip. It is difficult to pinpoint the reason for these kinds of anomalies , but one factor could be the heavy snow in New York in February which has traditionally been linked with reduced violent crime. What's also noticeable is that since the spike in killings in London in February, the numbers have dropped steadily month-by-month, after the Met established a violent crime task force and stepped up patrols and weapons searches in hotspot areas. Crime figures must be treated with caution; selecting individual statistics to make a point can be misleading.  Although London is experiencing an upsurge in serious violent crime, particularly among teenagers and young men, it is not at the levels that it was in the mid-2000s, and the rate of homicides remains well below that of New York, despite the fact that the Big Apple is a far safer city than it used to be.

"An explosive device has been thrown at former Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams' house in west Belfast, the party has said. In a statement the party added activist Bobby Storey's house was also attacked. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) confirmed that it was investigating two incidents in west Belfast. Mr Adams, a member of parliament in the Republic of Ireland, tweeted that no-one was hurt at his house. Sinn FÃ©in said there were children in the driveway minutes before the attack The incident occurred on Friday night Sinn FÃ©in MLA Gerry Kelly said ""these were reprehensible and cowardly attacks"". ""Grandchildren were in the driveway of Adams' home minutes before the attack,"" he added. An explosive was also thrown at the house of Bobby Storey, a former member of the Provisional IRA. Bobby Storey is a senior Sinn FÃ©in figure and a former IRA prisoner Mr Storey was involved in the Maze Prison escape in 1983, where 38 IRA prisoners escaped from the maximum security prison. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood condemned the attacks  as ""disgraceful"". ""It is important, at moments like this, that we all stand together against those who want to drag us back to the past,"" he said. ""They should be left in no doubt, it will not work."" By Chris Page, Ireland correspondent Gerry Adams has spoken several times in the past about death threats made against him - by loyalists and by dissident republicans who are opposed to the peace process. Sinn FÃ©in's statement about the attacks on the homes of Mr Adams and Bobby Storey doesn't explicitly pin the blame on republican splinter groups. However, the party's reference to ""increasingly desperate and irrelevant groups"" firmly points in that direction - and republicans who have expressed support for Mr Adams on social media have condemned dissidents as ""criminals"" and ""thugs"". A number of hours earlier, Mr Adams's successor as Sinn Fein President - Mary Lou McDonald - strongly denounced the dissidents who are believed to be behind recent rioting in Londonderry as ""warped, negative, regressive, dangerous people"". Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the attacks were a ""deliberate and calculated attempt to cause fear and raise tensions within our community"". They come after six nights of violence in Londonderry,which led to six people being arrested on Thursday evening. This video can not be played Makeshift barricades were set alight on a number of roads Over the course of Thursday 75 petrol bombs and two improvised explosives were thrown at PSNI officers. Police accused dissident republicans of the attacks, which have takenplace around the Twelfth of July parades,a frequent heightening of tensions centred around the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne. â Mr Adams, 69, spent nearly 34 years at the helm of Irish republican party Sinn FÃ©in. During The Troubles Mr Adams survived several attempts on his life, including a 1984 gun attack by loyalist paramilitaries. He is one of the most recognisable and controversial figures in Irish politics Two months after the death of Martin McGuinness in 2017, Mr Adams announced he would step down as leader. He was succeeded by Mary Lou McDonald. You can read a full profile here.

"History teacher James Husband raped a 16-year-old girl A former teacher at a top independent school in West Sussex has been sentenced to 17 years in jail for a string of sex offences including rape. James Husband, 68, from York, was convicted of raping a 16-year-old pupil at Christ's Hospital School in Horsham. He was also found guilty at an earlier hearing at Hove Crown Court of five indecent assault charges on the girl. During the trial, the court heard Husband told the girl: ""It's OK, I've had a vasectomy,"" before raping her. Husband, of Wigginton, is the fifth Christ's Hospital School teacher to be convicted of sexually abusing students. Over the five cases, the sexual abuse at the school spanned more than 30 years and involved 22 victims. Judge Christine Henson, who placed Husband on the sex offenders register for life, said the victim had give ""harrowing"" evidence during the trial. The judge told him: ""You put yourself in the position of her mentor in order to make her feel special and dependent on you so you could do what you wanted sexually with her. ""She viewed you as a father figure, thus rendering the abuse of trust particularly acute."" The independent school charges fees of up to Â£31,500 a year In a victim impact statement read to the court, the woman said: ""The grooming process was devious and malignant. By making me feel special for the first time in my life, I became dependent on him for my own feeling of self worth."" She said Husband moulded her into his ""plaything"" and ""puppet"" so ""he could do what he wanted to me"". ""He twisted my mind to abuse my body and made my body feel dirty and degraded until I believed this to be true."" She said she had been left with a ""life sentence"" of anorexia, suicidal thoughts and self-harm and suffered from ""unbearable"" flashbacks. Although described by the prosecution as a ""great pupil capable of achieving great things"", she said she had failed to make the grades to take up a place at Cambridge University because she had been ""worn down"" by his abuse. Gary Dobbie is yet to be sentenced Husband's co-defendant and a former head of house at the school Gary Dobbie, 66, of  Rue De La Piale in Albi, France, was convicted of 15 counts involving multiple offences against six boys and two girls as young as 12. Dobbie, formerly of Hereford, was teaching at independent Shrewsbury School, in Shropshire, at the time of his arrest in 2016. He has yet to be sentenced. Jurors heard the abuse took place between 1990 and 2001 and that both men were friends and used to laugh together about their actions. After the hearing, Det Sgt Karrie Bohanna from Sussex Police said; ""The victims of Husband and Dobbie were mainly children who should have been able to feel safe whilst in the care of their teachers. ""Instead both Husband and Dobbie exploited their positions in order to groom and sexually abuse their victims."" An NSPCC spokesman said Husband ""used and abused his position of trust in the worst possible way"". He said: ""His jailing today will hopefully give some sort of closure to his victim and at the same time encourage other people in a similar position to come forward and report what has happened to them.""

"The government'sBrexit White Paper,external, published this week, asserts that the UK can create a free trade area in goods with the EU, but still forge its own trade deals around the world. But Donald Trump saidin an interview with The Sun,externalthat the government's proposal for its future relationship with the EU would ""probably kill"" any US-UK free trade deal in the future. Then, in his news conference with Theresa May at Chequers, the president slightly changed his tune: ""If they're going to go a certain route, I just said I hope you're going to be able to trade with the United States"", Mr Trump said. ""I read reports where that won't be possible but I believe, after speaking with the prime minister's people and representatives and trade experts, it will absolutely be possible."" Well, the UK will be able to do some trade deals with other countries, but there's no question that the government's proposals will make the process more difficult. Let's look at goods first. The White Paper,externalsays the proposal on customs would ""enable the UK to set its own tariffs and vary them as it chooses, independently of the tariffs the EU applies."" In other words, according to the White Paper, the UK could have much lower tariffs with the US than the EU does (or no tariffs at all.) A tariff is a tax or duty paid on goods crossing borders. But there are some important caveats. First of all the customs proposal may well be rejected by the EU anyway. And, in any case, the biggest impediments to free trade are not tariffs, but what are known as 'non-tariff barriers' - the rules and regulations that govern all our economies. The government has proposeda common rulebook with the EU on goods and agri-food- which would in effect mean the UK signing up to a whole host of EU rules and regulations. Reality Check: What's the EU common rulebook? Reality Check: What does the Brexit White Paper reveal? Reality Check: Why services matter in any Brexit deal In her news conference with Mr Trump, Theresa May insisted that ""there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the rest of the world once we leave the European Union."" But the White Paper itself admits that ""in the context of trade negotiations, a common rulebook would limit the UK's ability to make changes to regulationâ¦"" And that in turn would make it far more difficult to do trade deals with other countries like the United States. It is often noted that the UK, as part of the EU, does not allow the import of genetically modified food, chlorine-washed chicken or nearly all types of hormone-injected meat - all of which are allowed in the United States. The US would push the UK to change these regulations in negotiations on a future trade deal, but the terms of the Brexit White Paper would not allow it if the UK wants to maintain frictionless trade with the EU. ""We don't currently have border checks because the French, for example, assume the UK is enforcing EU regulations,"" says Professor Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex. ""If we changed the rules for US-imported goods after Brexit, they'd want to start putting in checks."" Kinder Eggs are banned in the US because they contain toys It's not all a one-way street of course. Kinder Eggs are a popular product in Europe but under US regulations, food sales are banned if they have""partially or completely imbedded therein any non-nutritive object"",external(such as a toy). In any case, Mr Trump's remarks about possible restrictions on free trade hardly come as a surprise, because his administration has said it before. Mr Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross,speaking at the CBI conference in London last November,external, said it was important that any Brexit deal between the UK and the EU ""takes into account (Washington's) commercial interests and does not hinder the development of a closer US-UK relationship."" The UK should take steps, he added to ""avoid any unnecessary regulatory divergences"" with the United States. What about the services sector, in which the UK government has proposed a much looser relationship with the EU, even though services make up roughly 80% of the UK economy? Last year the US Secretary of Commerce said the UK should seek to avoid ""unnecessary"" divergence with the US Under the terms of the White Paper (and, again, it's important to stress that the whole thing has yet to be negotiated with the EU) the UK will be able to explore free trade deals in services around the world. But most current free trade deals barely mention services, partly because reaching agreement on common rules and regulations is so difficult. The UK would like to change that, and ""push for greater liberalisation of global services."" It's not hard to see why. In 2017 the EU was the biggest market for UK services exports around the world. But services trade outside the EU grew by more than 73% between 2007 and 2017, andaccording to the Office for National Statistics,,externalthe largest single market for UK services exports outside the EU last year was the United States. ""On the whole new technology has allowed services to trade more effectively on a global scale over the past 15 years,"" Professor Winters explains. ""But the very fact the UK is so efficient in services makes other countries cautious about agreements on services with the UK."" So the UK is looking to the future, and there are certainly opportunities out there. But under the terms of the Brexit White Paper, there will be limits on what it can achieve in trade deals, on goods in particular. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"To say it was a sub-optimal start to a news conference would be an understatement. In fact a huge British understatement. In fact, frankly ridiculous. Overnight, Donald Trump had given an interview to the Sun newspaper in which, given the febrile state of UK politics, contained three utterly deadly quotes. The first was that if Prime Minister Theresa May went ahead with her Brexit plan as hammered out at Chequers last week (and which led to the resignations of two cabinet ministers), then it would ""kill"" a trade deal with the US. The second zinger from the president ahead of his joint news conference was that May hadn't listened to him over how to negotiate Brexit with the EU. ""She didn't listen. No, I told her how to do it,""he told the Sun,external. And the final killer quote concerned one of those cabinet ministers who walked - Britain's blond bombshell Boris Johnson, who has long coveted the top job. The US president said he would make a very good prime minister. Ouch! Can you imagine how that made Mrs May wince? When Barack Obama came to the UK just before the EU referendum, he faced the sternest criticism over his comments that Britain would go to the back of the queue on any future trade deal if it left the EU. Mr Obama was doing that to help David Cameron. Mr Trump's intervention seemed designed to undermine the prime minister. That's quite something. What has Trump said about your country? So what would unfold when the two of them emerged onto the parched Buckinghamshire lawn at Chequers to face the press? Would Mrs May summon upher inner Hugh Grant from the film Love Actually,externaland tell the US leader that there was something terribly wrong with the special relationship? Or would she, the vicar's daughter, be much more polite and accommodating, and not dare to contradict her occasionally bullying guest? No such ""back off, Mr President"" rant from the real prime minister Well in the end she didn't have to make a choice. The US president seemed to have discovered a reverse thrust button inside his suit. ""No trade deal? We'll go along with whatever you decide. We just want to keep on trading. Not listen to my advice? Well maybe she will, and listen - this Brexit thing is a really tough deal. ""Boris? Sure, I think he would make a good prime minister, but I think Theresa is fantastic. Superb. A wonderful woman. I really got to know her last night. I felt sorry for the other people at our table. We just spoke to each other."" It was the sort of thing that leads teenagers to use the word ""euwww"". The challenges ahead for a UK/US trade deal after Brexit In Pictures: Trump's UK visit and protests But then he went into rhetorical overdrive, turbo boosters firing, uttering the words that ALL British prime ministers love to hear. Special relationship? It was incredibly special. Specialer than a special thing. More precious than the most valuable jewel. It was one of the great wonders of the world. It was 11 out of 10 special. OK, I exaggerate a touch. But not by much. This video can not be played Do Trump and May hold hands every time? And then came something rarer than hens' teeth. President Trump conceded that he had apologised to the prime minister over that Sun interview. I thought I'd misheard that bit of the news conference. It was like watching the Wacky Races. The car comes crashing off the road but somehow it splutters on, with the engine dragging along the ground, exhaust pipe belching black fumes, bodywork crumpled. At this news conference they got the wheels back on track, as Dick Dastardly and Penelope Pitstop smiled sweetly at each other.
