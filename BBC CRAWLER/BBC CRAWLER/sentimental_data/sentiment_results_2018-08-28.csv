"Sir Cliff Richard is to release a new album which he says reflects the ""bad period"" he has been through. The singer was awarded Â£210,000 in damages in Julyafter the BBC breached his privacy with its reporting of a police raid at his home in 2014. He was never arrested or charged during the police investigation. The 77-year-old, who will release Rise Up on 23 November, said he spent two years of his life where he ""couldn't sleep or think about anything"". He said: ""I chose Rise Up as the title track because, after the bad period I went through in my life, I've managed to rise up out of what seemed like a quagmire."" ""I love the lyric 'They're never gonna break me down, they're never gonna take me down, they know I'm gonna rise up feeling stronger',"" he added. ""It is always great to sing lyrics you can feel and I really felt those words."" Sir Cliff took legal action against the BBC over broadcasts of a South Yorkshire Police raid on his home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, in August 2014. It followed an allegation made by a man who claimed he was sexually assaulted as a child by Sir Cliff at an event at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane stadium in 1985. Sir Cliff announced the new 16-track album at London's Abbey Road Studio, where he recorded his debut single Move It, released exactly 60 years ago on 29 August 1958. He said his longevity ""should be considered a plus, not a drawback"", adding that his new record could be ""a revival for me"". The single Rise Up will be released in October along with the song Schoolboy Crush - the original B-side to Move It - to mark his 60th anniversary in the music industry. The new album features a duet with Olivia Newton-John, who Sir Cliff previously worked with on the track Had To Be in 1995. It also sees a reworking of some of his classic tracks, including Devil Woman and Miss You Nights, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

"The US territory has asked Congress for $139bn in recovery funds Officials in Puerto Rico now say 2,975 people died following Hurricane Maria - a devastating storm that struck the US island territory in September 2017. The revised death toll is nearly 50 times the previous estimate of 64. Governor Ricardo Rossello ""accepted"" the findings in a long-awaited independent investigation. The mayor of the capital, San Juan, accused the US government of deliberately downplaying the impact of the storm. Puerto Rico has struggled to repair its infrastructure and power grid since the storm, and is asking US Congress for $139bn (Â£108bn) in recovery funds. ""I'm giving an order to update the official number of deaths to 2,975,"" Governor Ricardo Rossello told reporters on Tuesday. ""Although this is an estimate, it has a scientific basis."" In a statement, the White House said the federal government supported the governor's efforts to ""ensure a full accountability and transparency of fatalities"" in the hurricane. President Donald Trump was criticised for praising the federal response to the hurricane-ravaged island in the weeks following the storm.Critics accused him of showing more concern for residents in Texas and Florida after they were hit by hurricanes. The authorities have faced criticism for underreporting the toll of Maria - the most powerful storm to hit the region in nearly 90 years. Until now, the official figure was 64 - even thoughthe island had previously acknowledged the death toll was probably much higher. In the wake of the disaster,some experts estimated as many as 4,600 deaths. This video can not be played Months after Maria, many on this US island still suffered in the dark The latest findings - accepted by the island's authorities - were made in a report,externalby experts from George Washington University, which the governor commissioned. The government's initial number was for those killed directly by the hurricane, crushed by collapsing buildings, drowned or hit by flying debris. But the new report also counted those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare provision and a lack of electricity and clean water. Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis. Total blackout hits 3.4m Puerto Ricans Six graphics that sum up Puerto Rico disaster Puerto Rico profile ""This shows the magnitude of the catastrophe,"" Governor Rossello told El Nuevo Dia newspaper. When asked why his government was unable to recognise a higher death toll until now, he replied: ""I am not perfect. I make mistakes. Now, hindsight tends to be 20-20."" He echoed one finding in the report - that doctors ""lacked awareness"" on how to appropriately certify deaths attributed to natural disasters. ""The responsibility for adjudicating the cause of deaths rested with the doctors,"" Mr Rossello said. ""But unfortunately there was no formal process to prepare them for this kind of devastation. ""At that moment, that was the number [of deceased] that we had and today we have the evidence which indicates the number was definitely higher."" San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told the BBC that there had been ""neglect"" by the Trump administration and some local officials hadn't wanted to confront the president about the need for more aid. ""It seemed like it was better to dance to President Trump's tune than to tell the truth that we were all seeing."" she said. ""I did was I thought ought to be done as I screamed, literally, out of the top of my lungs to say 'We're dying here' and the bureaucracy and the inefficiency of the federal government was killing us."" Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington correspondent For close to a year, Puerto Rico's government has clung to the idea that 64 people died as a result of Maria. That figure was always risible - particularly when you consider that the 150 mph (241 km/h) winds caused around $90bn worth of damage and left households for, on average, 84 days without electricity; 64 days without water and 41 days without cellular telephone coverage. In truth, the new official number is still an estimate - based on mortality data and taking into account historical data on migration patterns. But the official recognition will allow the island to move on and focus fully on rebuilding its infrastructure and extracting the tens of billions of dollars needed from Congress to give the three million inhabitants of this already bankrupt territory something of a future. Researchers tracked the number of deaths using death certificates and other mortality data between mid-September 2017 to mid-February of this year. This video can not be played Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico wasn't a ""real catastrophe like Katrina"", Trump told officials in the US territory last year The Caribbean island is home to 3.3 million people, some 8% of which have since left the island, the study said. It also said that those from poorer backgrounds in Puerto Rico were 45% more likely to have been killed in the aftermath of the hurricane. The governor said he would sign an executive order to create a committee to examine and put into practice the report's recommendations. Puerto Rico has been reeling ever since the storm struck - with residents still suffering blackouts, broken infrastructure and a lack of services. Hurricane Maria caused the largest blackout in US history,external, according to research consultancy the Rhodium Group. It is ranked as the third most financially costly cyclone in US history since 1900, yet its death toll is a third higher than the costliest - Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with an estimated 1,833. What is Trump's plan for Puerto Rico? Trump lashes out at hurricane plea mayor Trump puts Puerto Rico on notice over aid The new study raises questions about President Trump's response to the disaster. During a visit in October, Mr Trump had suggested officials should be ""proud"" the death toll - at the time only 16 - was not as high as ""a real catastrophe"" like Katrina.

"Trump jokingly shows a red card to the media during a meeting with the president of the world football body, Fifa US President Donald Trump has warned Google, Twitter and Facebook they are ""treading on troubled territory"" amid a row over perceived bias. He said they had to be ""very careful"", after earlier accusing Google of rigging the search results for the phrase ""Trump news"". An aide said the administration was ""looking into"" the issue of regulation. Google said its search engine set no political agenda and was not biased towards any political ideology. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr Trump said Google had ""really taken a lot of advantage of a lot of people, it's a very serious thing"". Adding the names of Facebook and Twitter, he said: ""They better be careful, because you can't do that to people... we have literally thousands of complaints coming in."" He gave no details of what action he might take. However, when asked earlier about Google, Mr Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the administration was ""taking a look"" at whether it should be regulated and would do ""some investigation and some analysis"". Analysts say there is little to back up Mr Trump's claim and that it is unclear how he could take action. Some said attempts to alter search engine results could violate the First Amendment, although his administration could make it difficult for Google by looking into its dominance of the market. In an earlier tweet, Mr Trump accused Google of prioritising negative news stories from what he described as the ""national left-wing media"". He said most of the stories that appeared on the results page were negative and that conservative reporting was being ""suppressed"". Allow Twitter content?

""We continually work to improve Google search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment."" Google denied using political viewpoints to shape its search results Mercedes Bunz, a senior lecturer in digital technology at King's College London, told BBC News it was highly unlikely that Google was deliberately ranking news according to political bias. ""Google's news algorithm is optimised for actuality and proximity of an event but it is generally not optimised to look for political orientation,"" she said. ""However, it has a tendency to rank web pages higher that a lot of people link to. ""For news, this does not seem to have changed with Google's last update of its search algorithm, which was rolled out on 1 August."" Twitter and Facebook have not commented directly. In his tweets, President Trump claimed that 96% of the news articles presented by Google in response to the phrase ""Trump news"" were from left-wing news outlets. He did not name the source of this figure - but The Verge websitereports it appears to have come from,externalanalysis by Paula Bolyard at the conservative news sitePJ Media,external. Ms Bolyard reported the 96% figure and said CNN had the greatest number of featured links, which President Trump mentioned as well.

"Jonathan Sacks was chief rabbi between 1991 and 2013 A former chief rabbi says Jeremy Corbyn's comments about British Zionists are the ""most offensive statement"" by a politician since Enoch Powell's ""Rivers of Blood"" speech. In an interview with the New Statesman,external, Lord Sacks accused the Labour leader of being an ""anti-Semite"". A 2013 video of Mr Corbynaccusing some British Zionists of having ""no sense of English irony"" emerged last week. A Labour Party spokesman called Lord Sacks's comment ""absurd and offensive"". Zionism refers to the movement to create a Jewish state in the Middle East, roughly corresponding to the historical land of Israel, and thus support for the modern state of Israel. Corbyn defends 'British Zionist' comments Jewish MP 'feels unwelcome' after Corbyn comments BBC defends Rivers of Blood broadcast The clip -published by the Daily Mail,external- showed Mr Corbyn speaking at the Palestinian Return Centre and recalling a disagreement between some Zionists and the Palestinian representative to the UK, Manuel Hassassian, following a speech Mr Hassassian had made in Parliament. He said: ""This [Hassassian's speech] was dutifully recorded by the thankfully silent Zionists who were in the audience on that occasion, and then came up and berated him afterwards for what he'd said."" Mr Corbyn, who was a backbench MP at the time, went on to claim that the people concerned ""clearly have two problems"". ""One is they don't want to study history, and secondly, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all their lives, they don't understand English irony either."" This video can not be played Corbyn suggests a group of Zionists need lessons in history and irony Speaking for the first time on the anti-Semitism row within the Labour Party, Lord Sacks - who held the post of chief rabbi between 1991 and 2013 - told the magazine: ""The recently disclosed remarks by Jeremy Corbyn are the most offensive statement made by a senior British politician since Enoch Powell's 1968 'Rivers of Blood' speech. ""It was divisive, hateful and like Powell's speech it undermines the existence of an entire group of British citizens by depicting them as essentially alien."" Crossbench peer Lord Sacks said Mr Corbyn could only be judged by his ""words and actions"", before adding that he had given support to ""racists, terrorists and dealers of hate who want to kill Jews and remove Israel from the map"". Lord Sacks said: ""When he implies that, however long they have lived here, Jews are not fully British, he is using the language of classic pre-War European anti-Semitism. ""When challenged with such facts, the evidence for which is before our eyes, first he denies, then he equivocates, then he obfuscates. ""This is low, dishonest and dangerous. He has legitimised the public expression of hate, and where he leads, others will follow."" Enoch Powell delivered the ""Rivers of Blood"" speech in 1968 Conservative MP Enoch Powell delivered a speech in 1968 to a local Tory party meeting in Birmingham. It came days before the second reading of the 1968 Race Relations Bill, which led to the Race Relations Act - making it illegal to refuse housing, employment or public services to people because of their ethnic background. The speech was anti-immigration and saw Mr Powell reference observations made by his Wolverhampton constituents during the speech, including: ""In 15 or 20 years' time, the black man will have the whip hand over the white man."" He ended with a quote from Virgil's Aeneid, when civil war in Italy is predicted with ""the River Tiber foaming with much blood"". The speech became one of the most controversial in British political history and ended Mr Powel's career in Edward Heath's shadow cabinet. Lord Sacks said the leader of the Labour Party was ""an anti-Semite"", at a time where Jews were still being murdered in Europe ""for being Jews"", and ""within living memory of the Holocaust"". He said: ""For more than three and a half centuries, the Jews of Britain have contributed to every aspect of national life. ""We know our history better than Mr Corbyn and we have learned that the hate that begins with Jews never ends with Jews. ""Mr Corbyn's embrace of hate defiles our politics and demeans the country we love."" On Friday, Mr Corbyn said the comments had been made to ""defend the Palestinian ambassador in the face of what I thought were deliberate misrepresentations"" from people ""for whom English was a first language, when it isn't for the ambassador"". He said: ""I described those pro-Israel activists as Zionists, in the accurate political sense and not as a euphemism for Jewish people - and that is made clear in the rest of my speech that day. ""I am now more careful with how I might use the term 'Zionist' because a once self-identifying political term has been increasingly hijacked by anti-Semites as code for Jews."" Allies of Mr Corbyn said the speech had been ""taken out of context"", with shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying the focus should not be on what Mr Corbyn said five years ago but on tackling anti-Semitism in British society, including within Labour. But the leader was criticised by other members of his own party, with Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger describing the comments as ""inexcusable"" and making her ""feel unwelcome"" in the party. In response to Lord Sacks's comments, a Labour spokesman said: ""This comparison with the race-baiting Enoch Powell is absurd and offensive. ""Jeremy Corbyn is determined to tackle anti-Semitism both within the Labour Party and in wider society. And the Labour Party is committed to rebuilding trust with the Jewish community.""

"Crypto-anarchist Cody Wilson fired the world's first 3D printed handgun in 2013 A firm that distributed 3D-printer blueprints for guns has circumvented a ban on sharing them online by selling flash drives containing the files. The designs had been available for free download but a temporary ban was imposed by a US judge concerned that they could fall into the wrong hands. Defense Distributed now promises to deliver the drives to customers in select states. Its suggested price is $10 (Â£7.70), but customers can choose how much to pay. The history of what the Texas-based firm's founder Cody Wilson calls the ""downloadable gun"" has been a chequered one. The computer-aided designs (CADs) were originally published online in 2013. But the website was quickly ordered to remove the files over fears they could be used by terrorists or criminals to make untraceable ""ghost guns"". In a surprise move, and following lengthy court action from Defense Distributed, the US Department of Justice ruled in July that the blueprints did not represent a national security threat and could be put back online. They were downloaded thousands of times, prompting outcry from 19 US states. Led by Washington state, they launched a legal action against the US government. That in turn led to a federal judge issuing a temporary ban which saw the files once again removed from the internet. The files will only be available to purchase in states which have not objected to their distribution Now back online, the files are only available for purchase for delivery to customers based in states that have not imposed a ban. Those living elsewhere are told: ""Your masters say you can't be trusted with this information."" Users can also submit their own files to sell on the platform and will get a 50% cut. At a news conference, Mr Wilson said his firm had already received 400 orders. Are 'ghost guns' a step too far? Will 3D printing change my world? ""I'm happy to become the iTunes of 3D guns if I can't be the Napster"", the news siteArs Technica reported him as saying,external. Napster was a file-sharing music service, which offered MP3s for free. ""Anyone who wants to get these files is going to get them. They can name their own price,"" Mr Wilson added. He said that his move was motivated by the desire to support freedom of speech rather than to make money. The main Defense Distributed website still carries a statement saying that it had been ordered to shut down its file repository.

"University Challenge is to focus on posing ""gender neutral"" questions, says the show's executive producer. Peter Gwyn made the remark following a viewer complaint that the questions were skewed towards men. ""We try to ensure that when hearing a question, we don't have any sense of whether it was written by a man or a woman,"" he said. It comes in response to criticism that not enough female contestants appear on the quiz show. In an interview with Radio Times, Gwyn said ""we agreed"" improvement was needed ""and decided to rectify it."" ""Perhaps 'gender-neutrality' is what we aim for,"" he said, referring to both the style and content of the questions on the BBC Two programme. He added that ""questions should never sound as if they are directed more at men than women"". ""There are numerous balances we try to achieve in the questions we cast for each match, between the arts and the sciences, or between contemporary and historical themes, and we recognise that the gender balance is of great importance."" It's not the first time the long-running programme, hosted by Jeremy Paxman, has courted controversy over alleged sexism. All-male teams on University Challenge have been criticised Female contestants have repeatedly spoken of online abuse and objectification after their appearances. All-male teams and all-male finals - such as last year's contest between Balliol College Oxford and Wolfson College Cambridge - have been criticised by the likes ofhistorian and broadcaster Mary Beard.,external Gwyn says they do everything they can to encourage women to take part but it is the universities and colleges themselves who make the team selections. Rosie McKeown, from this year's winning team, St John's Cambridge, said there are several reasons for the gender imbalance. ""The most obvious one is, unfortunately, the hostility that some female contestants are subjected to on social media. But I think there may also be an issue with women underestimating themselves and being hesitant to try out for the show. I hope that will change soon.""

"This video can not be played May: 'Common sense' to prepare for Brexit no deal Theresa May has insisted her approach to Brexit will deliver a ""good"" deal for the UK and enable it to make the most of opportunities around the world. Speaking in South Africa, she told the BBC she was sticking by her ""sensible"" plans as they both respected the 2016 referendum vote and protected jobs. While hopeful of an agreement in October, she said it was right to prepare for leaving without a deal. Earlier, she announced Â£4bn of extra British support for African economies. On the first day of a three-day visit to the continent, the prime minister insisted trade deals with countries like South Africa would be a prize for ""global Britain"" after it leaves the EU next year. But the BBC's political correspondent Ben Wright said that as she heads to Nigeria and Kenya this week, she knows a very tough autumn of political bargaining awaits her back home. PM seeks new jobs partnership with Africa In an interview with the BBC, Mrs May played down warnings by Chancellor Philip Hammond last week about the risks of a no-deal exit - which he said could have a Â£80bn negative economic impact. She said the comments were based on analysis first released in January that were, at the time, a ""work in progress"". Mrs May then cited comments by the head of the World Trade Organisation, who said Brexit ""won't be a walk in the park, but won't be end of the world either"". This video can not be played Theresa May was all smiles as she joined school children for a dance ""We are working for a good deal, we have put forward our proposal for a good deal,"" she said. ""I believe that deal is to the benefit, not only of the UK, but the EU. ""What the government is doing is putting in place the preparations to make sure we can make a success whatever our future relationship is with the EU and whatever the outcome of the negotiations."" With dogged determination Theresa May danced along with a group of children in a soggy Cape Town playground - her first stop on a three-day dash around sub-Saharan Africa. It is the first No 10-led business delegation to Africa since 2011. The school children symbolised, she said later, the dynamism and creativity of the continent's growing and youthful population. And it is jobs for these young people and millions like them that the UK wants to help African economies create - using UK companies, capital and government help to invest in African countries in the hope of keeping them politically stable later on. At a speech in the city on Tuesday, the prime minister pledged an extra Â£4bn in direct UK government investment - which she expects to be matched by the private sector. Mrs May also said the UK would fundamentally shift the way it spends aid money - to focus on long-term economic and security challenges rather than short-term poverty reduction. For the UK of course, Brexit is a spur to expand trade beyond the EU, which is by far our biggest market. Some Tory MPs have said they cannot support Mrs May's blueprint for the UK's future relations with the EU, saying it is a betrayal of the millions who voted to leave the EU in 2016. But Mrs May said the proposals were sensible as they insisted that an end to EU freedom of movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court was ""non-negotiable"", while ensuring British manufacturers had unrestricted access to an EU wide free trade zone for goods. ""It is right as we look to our future relationships that we protect jobs and livelihoods,"" she added. As part of a renewed focus on Africa, Mrs May has said she wants the UK to become the continent leading's investment partner within the G7, overtaking the US. She told the BBC that this was not unrealistic, given that the UK was already the largest foreign investor in South Africa, the continent's largest economy. ""One of the benefits of leaving the EU is that we will be able to negotiate our own trade deals in the future,"" she said. ""We look to a global Britain outside the EU making the most of those trade deals around the rest of the world.""

"Crypto-anarchist Cody Wilson fired the world's first 3D printed handgun in 2013 A firm that distributed 3D-printer blueprints for guns has circumvented a ban on sharing them online by selling flash drives containing the files. The designs had been available for free download but a temporary ban was imposed by a US judge concerned that they could fall into the wrong hands. Defense Distributed now promises to deliver the drives to customers in select states. Its suggested price is $10 (Â£7.70), but customers can choose how much to pay. The history of what the Texas-based firm's founder Cody Wilson calls the ""downloadable gun"" has been a chequered one. The computer-aided designs (CADs) were originally published online in 2013. But the website was quickly ordered to remove the files over fears they could be used by terrorists or criminals to make untraceable ""ghost guns"". In a surprise move, and following lengthy court action from Defense Distributed, the US Department of Justice ruled in July that the blueprints did not represent a national security threat and could be put back online. They were downloaded thousands of times, prompting outcry from 19 US states. Led by Washington state, they launched a legal action against the US government. That in turn led to a federal judge issuing a temporary ban which saw the files once again removed from the internet. The files will only be available to purchase in states which have not objected to their distribution Now back online, the files are only available for purchase for delivery to customers based in states that have not imposed a ban. Those living elsewhere are told: ""Your masters say you can't be trusted with this information."" Users can also submit their own files to sell on the platform and will get a 50% cut. At a news conference, Mr Wilson said his firm had already received 400 orders. Are 'ghost guns' a step too far? Will 3D printing change my world? ""I'm happy to become the iTunes of 3D guns if I can't be the Napster"", the news siteArs Technica reported him as saying,external. Napster was a file-sharing music service, which offered MP3s for free. ""Anyone who wants to get these files is going to get them. They can name their own price,"" Mr Wilson added. He said that his move was motivated by the desire to support freedom of speech rather than to make money. The main Defense Distributed website still carries a statement saying that it had been ordered to shut down its file repository. This video can not be played Cody Wilson: The man behind America's 3D-printed guns Defense Distributed's files cover a range of firearms, including 3D-printable components that could make a version of the AR-15 rifle, a gun that has been used in US mass shootings.

"This video can not be played French and British fishing fleets have come to blows over when they can catch scallops French and British fishermen have clashed in the English Channel in an escalating battle over scallops. About 40 French boats tried to stop five larger British boats from fishing 12 nautical miles (22km) off the Normandy coast, in the Bay of Seine. Fishing boats collided and stones were thrown, but no-one was injured. UK boats are entitled to fish in the scallop-rich area, but their presence has angered the French, who accuse the British of depleting shellfish stocks. Now UK fishermen are demanding government protection, while the French bewail the loss of a ""primary resource"". The French boats gathered overnight on Monday in protest against so-called British ""pillaging"". ""The French went to contact the British to stop them working and they clashed with each other,"" said Dimitri Rogoff, who heads the Normandy fishing committee. Scallop wars: Could Brexit calm troubled waters? The British were unable to match the local flotilla for numbers and were ultimately chased away. Two British boats, Golden Promise and Joanna C, returned to Brixham harbour with damaged windows. The crews alleged they had been were surrounded and had rocks and metal shackles thrown at them. A video on French media showed a Scottish scallop dredger, the Honeybourne 3, colliding with French vessels. A French local government spokesperson, Ingrid Parrot, said: ""Things were thrown on both sides - from the English and from the French. Both parties were extremely tense."" British boats are legally entitled to fish off the Normandy coast - but their French counterparts accuse them of ""pillaging"" Tension has rumbled for 15 years, but in the past five years a deal has prevailed - larger British boats stayed out of the area in exchange for more fishing rights. British boats can gather scallops year-round, but French law restricts the scallop fishing season to between 1 October and 15 May. ""For the Brits, it's an open bar - they fish when they want, where they want, and as much as they want,"" Mr Rogoff complained. ""We don't want to stop them from fishing, but they could at least wait until 1 October so that we can share. ""Scallops are a flagship product for Normandy, a primary resource and a highly sensitive issue."" Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Producers Association, described the clashing incident as ""clear piracy"". Speaking about the Scottish boat, he told BBC Scotland: ""He's fully entitled to be there. UK vessels can enter that French zone, it's not illegal. ""The Peterhead vessel is going about its business. The French vessels are probably attacking it."" Fears fishermen 'will not survive' Brexit no deal Fish thrown into Thames in Brexit deal protest World's fishing fleets mapped from orbit Appeals for calm were issued by Britain's National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which said some boats had been filmed manoeuvring dangerously. ""We have raised the matter with the British government and asked for protection for our vessels, which are fishing legitimately,"" its chief executive, Barrie Deas, said. ""The deeper issues behind the clashes should be settled by talking around the table, not on the high seas where people could be hurt.""

"Gerald Gavan's (left) intended target was Billy McGregor A man has admitted trying to kill six children in a hit-and-run after they innocently got caught up in a feud. Gerald Gavan, 22, from East Kilbride, drove a car into the youngsters after targeting Billy McGregor in Glasgow's Castlemilk area. The dispute between Gavan and Mr McGregor is thought to be linked to the 2017 murder of Jamie Lee in the area. At the High Court in Glasgow, carpet salesman Gavan admitted attempting to murder the children on 24 March. He also pleaded guilty to trying to kill Mr McGregor in the same incident. Gavan was remanded in custody at the High Court in Glasgow and will be sentenced next month. A judge watched graphic footage of the children being hurled into the air as Gavan struck them. Police near the scene of the hit-and-run in March One 14-year-old girl - who Gavan also reversed over - suffered a broken neck and required lengthy surgery. Prosecutor Maryam Labaki said the background to this crime was a ""family feud"" involving a ""fatality"". She added: ""Gavan is associated with one side of that dispute."" Gavan's former co-accused Gary Owen - who had his not guilty pleas accepted - is a relative of a man who is wanted in connection with the play park shooting of Jamie Lee. The hit and run happened after Billy McGregor - also known as William Dearie - had gone to a local shop at about 16:00. At the time the children were ""talking and laughing together"" in the same street. As Billy McGregor crossed the road towards them he spotted Gavan's silver Vauxhall Astra heading towards him. Ms Labaki said: ""The car accelerated and steered towards Billy McGregor, travelling diagonally and mounting the pavement."" He failed in trying to dodge the car - but Gavan then carried on into the children on the pavement. The advocate depute added: ""As the car collided with the group, six of them were struck, causing them to be thrown up into the air in different directions. ""Two of the children who had been sent flying were hit with such force that they were carried over a parked car landing on the ground opposite."" Distressed relatives of the young victims sobbed and one woman left the courtroom as CCTV of the incident was played to the court. In the footage, a 14-year-old girl was seen being unable to get up. Gavan then reversed over her before driving off at speed. The court was told he was unaware she was still on the ground. The teenager was found to have a badly broken neck and needed an initial six-hour operation. She later had a titanium plate attached to her spine to help her recovery and spent about two weeks in hospital. The court heard her injury was ""healing well"" and that she will make a full recovery. A 13-year-old boy was treated for a leg injury while a 14-year-old boy needed stitches for a knee wound. A 13-year-old girl was badly bruised while a 12-year-old girl was treated at hospital for muscle injuries. Another 14-year-old girl required physiotherapy. Billy McGregor had cuts to his arm and leg - as well as bruising - but ""declined medical attention"". The court heard Gavan's guilty plea was accepted on basis he had ""intended to cause physical injury"" to Mr McGregor. Ms Labaki: ""In striking him with the vehicle - when immediately in front of the children - Gavan had no opportunity to brake in time. ""His actions amounted to wicked recklessness in respect of the children."" Gary Owen, 20, had also faced the attempted murder claims but his not guilty pleas were accepted. Gavan and Owen, along with Ali Coats and Jay Gavan, 20, had further faced a charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice in connection with the crime. Not guilty pleas were also accepted for that allegation. Gavan was remanded in custody pending sentencing on  25 September in Edinburgh. Det Insp Peter Sharp said: ""Gerald Gavan has today finally admitted his guilt following a number of months where he tried to evade justice in a cowardly manner. ""This incident which unfolded in the afternoon of Saturday 24 March in Castlemilk was something which will no doubt stay in the minds of the young victims for a long time."" The officer said the consequences, especially for the 14-year-old girl who had to have surgery, could have been much worse. He added: ""For anyone to play out retribution or aggression in a public area using a vehicle as a weapon will simply not be tolerated. ""For innocent members of the public to be caught up in this horrendous incident is unacceptable.""

Louis Makepeace, 18, claims bosses at the Heart of Worcestershire College discriminated against him after being ruled out of the field due to his size. The 3ft 10in (1.16m) aspiring chef said he was ""appalled"" by their actions. The college told the BBC ""at no point has Louis been told he could not attend his course"", which begins next month. However, it confirmed ""adjustments Louis requires will need to be agreed before an unconditional offer can be given"".

"The suspect had won a previous competition, US media report A gunman who attacked a Florida video game tournament was so obsessed with his pastime he would refuse to bathe or go to school, say court records. David Katz, 24, had a history of mental illness, according to his parents' divorce filing in his home state. His mother once confiscated his console and locked it in her room, and he punched a hole in the door, she said. Katz killed two people in the city of Jacksonville on Sunday before fatally shooting himself, police say. According to court papers in Maryland, he had a longstanding feud with his mother, and had twice been hospitalised for mental illness. The incident took place in a games bar attached to a restaurant ""His hair would very often go unwashed for days,"" his mother told a court during her 2007 divorce proceedings. ""When I took his gaming equipment controllers away so he couldn't play at three or four in the morning, I'd get up and find that he was just walking around the house in circles."" The documents obtained by the Associated Press show that his parents - Nasa engineer Richard Katz and government toxicologist Elizabeth Katz - disagreed over their youngest son's care, including whether he should take the antipsychotic medication he had been prescribed. The boy sometimes ""curled up into a ball"", refused to attend school and sobbed, Mrs Katz said. The Maryland judge awarded custody to Katz's mother, and the father was allowed visitation rights. Eli Clayton, 21, and Taylor Robertson, 27, were shot dead in Sunday's attack in Jacksonville at an eSports tournament for players of Madden NFL, an American football game. Eleven others were injured. Fellow players spoke of Katz's erratic playing style and unwillingness to make friends. ""We've always known he was a little off and stuff just because he wasn't social at all,"" Shay Kivlen, 21, of Seattle, told CBS News on Monday. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williamstold the Baltimore Sun,externalon Monday that no motive had yet been determined. He said Katz had legally purchased the two handguns used in the shooting from a licensed dealer in the Baltimore area.

"A Russian howitzer: Military modernisation is a priority for President Putin Russia plans to hold massive war games involving 300,000 personnel next month - its biggest military manoeuvres since a Cold War drill in 1981. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Vostok-2018 drills were justified given ""aggressive and unfriendly"" attitudes towards his country. Units from China and Mongolia will also take part in the exercises at military ranges in central and eastern Russia. The manoeuvres come at a time of rising tension between Nato and Russia. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said 36,000 tanks, armoured personnel carriers and armoured infantry vehicles would take part in Vostok-2018, from 11 to 15 September, along with more than 1,000 aircraft. Vostok is Russian for east. All of Russia's airborne units and two of its naval fleets will also take part in the drills across Siberia and the Russian Far East. Mr Shoigu compared the Vostok-2018 exercises to Soviet manoeuvres in 1981, which involved a pretend attack on Nato. He said: ""In some ways they will repeat aspects of Zapad-81, but in other ways the scale will be bigger."" Mr Peskov said the involvement of Chinese units showed Russia and Beijing were co-operating in all areas. Russia's military role in Syria grows Russia's new military - should Nato worry? Russia launches huge war games The scale of Vostok-2018 is equivalent to the forces deployed in one of the big World War Two battles. A smaller-scale Russia-Belarus exercise was held in western regions last year. President Vladimir Putin has made military modernisation - including new nuclear missiles - a priority. Russia's armed forces are reckoned to have about one million personnel in total. The Chinese defence ministry put out a fairly dry statement talking of deepening military co-operation and ""enhancing both sides' capabilities to jointly respond to various security threats"". But it did say the exercises would ""not target any third party"". The ministry also confirmed the extent of the Chinese involvement - ""3,200 troops, more than 900 pieces of military hardware as well as 30 fixed-wing aircrafts and helicopters"" - and confirmed the location - the Tsugol training range in Russia's Trans-Baikal region. Some of the forces have already arrived. Details of the Mongolian involvement are unclear. Analysis by the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow The scale and scope of Vostok-2018 is unprecedented for modern Russia, but no surprise. The giant drill is clearly meant as a show of strength by Vladimir Putin and his military, a demonstration that - despite Western sanctions, including against the defence sector - the country remains defiant. It's also a reminder that while Russia is seen as a hostile and aggressive force in the West, Moscow has long seen Nato encroachment as the threat. President Putin's spokesman argued that Vostok was essential, in what he called a ""very aggressive and unfriendly"" international context. It's how he defended the presumably giant bill for such a giant event, too, at a time when Russians are protesting furiously against a reform of the pension system they're told is critical, because social spending is unsustainable as it stands. Spokesman Dylan White said Nato was briefed on Vostok-2018 in May and would monitor it. He said the organisation was considering a Russian offer to allow Nato military attachÃ©s based in Moscow to be sent to observe the drills. He said in a statement: ""All nations have the right to exercise their armed forces, but it is essential that this is done in a transparent and predictable manner."" He added: ""Vostok demonstrates Russia's focus on exercising large-scale conflict. It fits into a pattern we have seen over some time: a more assertive Russia, significantly increasing its defence budget and its military presence."" It has been increasing since Russia annexed the Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backed pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends Navy Day in St Petersburg last month Nato has reacted with an increased deployment of forces in eastern Europe, sending 4,000 troops to member nations. Russia says the Nato build-up is unjustified and provocative. The poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in southern England in March did not help relations, with Nato expelling Russian diplomats. The UK and the US - both Nato members - say Moscow was behind the attack, although Russia denies it. President Putin again traded barbswith Nato last week over the alliance's assets near the Russian border.

"Trump jokingly shows a red card to the media during a meeting with the president of the world football body, Fifa US President Donald Trump has warned Google, Twitter and Facebook they are ""treading on troubled territory"" amid a row over perceived bias. He said they had to be ""very careful"", after earlier accusing Google of rigging the search results for the phrase ""Trump news"". An aide said the administration was ""looking into"" the issue of regulation. Google said its search engine set no political agenda and was not biased towards any political ideology. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr Trump said Google had ""really taken a lot of advantage of a lot of people, it's a very serious thing"". Adding the names of Facebook and Twitter, he said: ""They better be careful, because you can't do that to people... we have literally thousands of complaints coming in."" He gave no details of what action he might take. However, when asked earlier about Google, Mr Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the administration was ""taking a look"" at whether it should be regulated and would do ""some investigation and some analysis"". Analysts say there is little to back up Mr Trump's claim and that it is unclear how he could take action. Some said attempts to alter search engine results could violate the First Amendment, although his administration could make it difficult for Google by looking into its dominance of the market. In an earlier tweet, Mr Trump accused Google of prioritising negative news stories from what he described as the ""national left-wing media"". He said most of the stories that appeared on the results page were negative and that conservative reporting was being ""suppressed"". Allow Twitter content?

Google denied using political viewpoints to shape its search results. It said: ""Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology. ""We continually work to improve Google search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment."" Google denied using political viewpoints to shape its search results Mercedes Bunz, a senior lecturer in digital technology at King's College London, told BBC News it was highly unlikely that Google was deliberately ranking news according to political bias. ""Google's news algorithm is optimised for actuality and proximity of an event but it is generally not optimised to look for political orientation,"" she said. ""However, it has a tendency to rank web pages higher that a lot of people link to. ""For news, this does not seem to have changed with Google's last update of its search algorithm, which was rolled out on 1 August."" Twitter and Facebook have not commented directly. In his tweets, President Trump claimed that 96% of the news articles presented by Google in response to the phrase ""Trump news"" were from left-wing news outlets. He did not name the source of this figure - but The Verge websitereports it appears to have come from,externalanalysis by Paula Bolyard at the conservative news sitePJ Media,external. Ms Bolyard reported the 96% figure and said CNN had the greatest number of featured links, which President Trump mentioned as well.

"House of Fraser has criticised ""greedy landlords"" that are resisting new owner Mike Ashley's attempts to cut rents on the store chain's 59 outlets. Earlier this month the Sports Direct owner bought the retailer for Â£90m after it collapsed into administration. It has been seeking to cut rents in an attempt to prevent stores from closing. The British Property Federation criticised Sports Direct, saying one party cannot ""cry 'unfair' in the media when it doesn't get what it wants"". About seven House of Fraser stores have been saved so far, including Plymouth, Darlington and Middlesbrough, as well as the flagship store on London's Oxford Street. Mr Ashley's firm warned landlords that ""time is running out"" to keep stores open. ""Some landlords are being very collaborative in order to give us a chance at turning the business around, giving House of Fraser a lifeline and saving hundreds of jobs,"" a spokesman said. ""However, some greedy landlords would rather see the stores close than help save the jobs of hundreds of people. ""We will continue to try and convince these landlords but ultimately time is running out. Some closures will be announced."" House of Fraser rescue details emerge Ashley vows to keep stores open However, Melanie Leech, the chief executive of the British Property Federation, said each party in the negotiations had its own interests. ""Many property owners are investing in and managing property on behalf of pensioners' savings, and depend on occupiers being able to pay rent. The long-term health of our High Streets also depends on this,"" she said. ""There will be a range of factors to consider on a store-by-store basis - but what property owners won't be doing is simply leaving stores empty for the sake of it; that would be in no one's interests."" Mike Ashley bought House of Fraser for Â£90m Mr Ashley vowed to save about 47 House of Fraser storesafter buying the chain, which he aims to make ""the Harrods of the high street"". ""We will do our best to keep as many stores open as possible,"" he said. Other House of Fraser stores the new owner says will remain open are Telford, Aylesbury and Carlisle. Sports Direct needs to cut costs if the loss-making department store chain is to remain viable and continue trading, but some landlords are opposing rent reductions of the scale it is demanding. BBC News understandssome have been asked to sign deals for rent equivalent to 5% of a store's turnover, while about 28 stores would not get any rent at all but have their business rates paid for. Most landlords will end up taking a financial hit, but some think Sports Direct's proposals will be better than an earlier restructuring deal that would have resulted in 31 stores closing. Offering rates-only deals, or ""meanwhile leases"", to landlords is an unprecedented move for such a big, established retailer. One retail property expert told the BBC that such an offer would be quite attractive for some landlords: ""They continue to trade, without the burden of business rates which gives them at least a year to come up with a plan.

"Flames destroyed the clock at the top of the landmark city centre building There are ""grave concerns"" that the Primark building in Belfast city centre could collapse, the fire service has told the BBC. A fire broke out in the listed five-storey Bank Buildings at about 11:00 BST on Tuesday. Firefighters remain at the scene and the roof and some floors have collapsed. There are no reports of any injuries and it is not yet clear how the fire started. History of Belfast's Bank Buildings In pictures: Primark building destroyed in fire This video can not be played The landmark building was gutted by the fire within a matter of hours The fire service said the blaze started on the fifth floor or the roof. The flames died down on Tuesday evening but firefighters are expected to remain at the scene into Wednesday morning. Firefighters have pieced together 1km (3,280ft) of hose to bring water from the River Lagan to the building. ""We certainly can't guarantee the structural integrity of the building at this time,"" said Assistant Chief Fire Officer Michael Graham. ""Our expectation is that the internal floors will collapse where the fire has been burning at its greatest intensity. ""We actually hope that might help the overall structure."" This video can not be played Senior fire officer Michael Graham warned of ""grave concerns"" that the building could collapse A police officer at the scene told BBC News NI earlier on Tuesday that structural engineers had assessed the building and said it was ""at risk of imminent collapse"". Police are advising people to avoid Castle Street and Royal Avenue. Royal Avenue has been cordoned off and pieces of debris have fallen from the side of the historic building. Clothing giant Primark confirmed that the building was safely evacuated. It is believed that more than 350 people work in the store. The fire spread rapidly through the whole building, causing floors to collapse Mr Graham said it had been ""an intense six hours"" for firefighters. ""The priority for us was to stop any fire spreading to any other building and keep our firefighters and the community safe,"" he added. ""We feel we've achieved all of those things."" Alice Murdoch told BBC News NI that she was inside the building just before it was evacuated. ""I just popped inside and you could smell the smoke already,"" she said. ""Staff were sort of looking at each other and then the alarm started going off and they said: 'Get out as quickly as you can.' Ms Murdoch said it was ""quite scary"" but that the evacuation was well organised. Alice Murdoch was shopping in Primark when the fire started on Tuesday morning Caitlin Hunter said there was a sense of ""controlled panic"" as people inside the store tried to get out. ""I was inside on the bottom floor just having a nosey around at the make-up section and all of a sudden I could smell a weird smell of smoke,"" she said. ""Nothing had been said at this point what about was happening but people [had] their gut instinct, knowing something wasn't right. ""It was a race for people to come down the lifts and stairs... we were all rushing out."" By Catherine Morrison, BBC News NI A large crowd of several hundred people has gathered at the police cordon on High Street as firefighters continue to tackle the fire. They are watching one of the biggest fires in Belfast city centre in peacetime. There are gasps from the crowd as small internal sections of the building collapse every few minutes. Flames are now contained to a small section of the third and fourth floors. But the fire service has said it will continue with this operation for the next three to four hours. The Belfast city centre branch of the Primark clothing and homeware chain was undergoing a major refurbishment. It was being extended along Castle Street in a project costing an estimated Â£30m. The original Bank Buildings was designed by Sir Robert Taylorand erected by Waddell Cunningham in 1785. WH Lynn designed the new Bank Buildings in 1900. Firefighters used aerial equipment to try to tackle the blaze at the top of the building He intended it as a bridge to the 20th Century, with a compromise between the classical style of the upper part of the building and the great expanse of plate glass below. Three bombs exploded in the Bank Buildings in 1975 - a huge fire broke out shortly afterwards and damaged parts of the building. In 1979, it was taken over by the Dublin-based group Primark. Within 18 months, the store was totally refurbished and the exterior restored to its 1903 glory. Primark CEO Paul Marchant said he was ""deeply shocked and saddened"" by the fire. Thick smoke from the fire could be seen over Belfast throughout Tuesday afternoon ""The safety and wellbeing of our customers, colleagues and construction team is of course the most important consideration and we are truly relieved that all were evacuated safely,"" he added. Rajesh Rana, the president of Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said he was sorry to hear about the fire. ""It is a sad day for Belfast and for one of our city's leading retailers, which was in the midst of completing a Â£30m expansion project,"" he said.

"An archive view of Castle Place in Belfast, showing the Bank Buildings Ablaze at Belfast's flagship Primark storeis not the first incident of its kind at the Royal Avenue premises. From public executions to fires, the Grade B1 listed five-storey Bank Buildings has a long and gruesome history. The original building on the site was erected by Waddell Cunningham in 1785. The bank opened in 1787 as the Bank of the Four Johns, named after the four founders who shared a Christian name. After the bank collapsed it was used as the residence of the Bishop of Down and Connor, the Rev Dr William Dickson. In 1805 the building was converted into a shop. The last public execution was carried out on the building's doorstep in 1816. In 1853, a wholesale drapery firm was founded at the site, which became a commercial department store. At the turn of the century the new Bank Buildings was designed by WH Lynn, who was also responsible for the city's Central Library and Carlisle Memorial Methodist Church. Until 1961 only the ground and first floors were used as a retail store, with the remainder of the building taken up by the company's wholesale warehouse. In 1969 the original drapery firm Robertson, Ledlie, Ferguson and Co, was sold to the House of Fraser group. Robertson, Ledlie, and Ferguson continued to run the shop as a subsidiary company but four years later Boots acquired the Bank Buildings when it took over House of Fraser.

"This video can not be played Fans pay their respects to Aretha Franklin in Detroit The body of Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul, has arrived in Detroit to begin lying in state as thousands of fans gather for a final goodbye. Her body was delivered in a vintage white Cadillac hearse to the African-American museum in her home town where it will remain for two days. The museum also hosted civil rights activist Rosa Parks's viewing in 2005. Detroit, seen as the home of soul music, is treating Franklin's death as the passing of royalty. A week of mourning is being held in the city, where fans have descended from across the US to see the late singer one last time. Franklin's gold-plated casket The body of the 76-year-old, who died of pancreatic cancer nearly two weeks ago, will be on public view on Tuesday and Wednesday at the Charles H Wright Museum of African American History. ""She's the queen,"" said Melissa Howard, who flew from Texas on Monday to pay her respects. ""She's royalty. She's worth it,""she told the Detroit Free Press,external.

At the scene - Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Detroit As the sun rose on America's Motor City, the crowds were already waiting in line to say a final farewell to the Queen of Soul. Just before 8 o'clock in the morning, a white vintage Cadillac pulled up at the city's African American museum - moments later a gold casket was carried out. Just as she always did, Aretha Franklin arrived in style. It didn't take long for fans to break out in a rendition of Amazing Grace. Throughout the day, crowds who've waited patiently to pay respects have been spontaneously singing their favourite Aretha songs. Here the mood is melodic, not morose. Aretha Franklin was a global superstar whose voice will be remembered the world over, but she never forgot her hometown roots. This week, her hometown is showing the world, they'll never forget her. Fans wait in line to see Franklin's body The venue was reportedly chosen because Rosa Parks's viewing took place there in 2005 and because it needs to accommodate the thousands of people expected to attend. Friday's funeral at the Greater Grace Temple is for family and friends only, but Chaka Khan, Jennifer Hudson and Stevie Wonder are among those due to sing there. Former US President Bill Clinton will be among the speakers. The red lipstick and sheer dress she is wearing looks like something the gospel singer would wear onstage and ""something she would have selected for herself,"" her niece Sabrina Owens told the Associated Press.

The vehicle also carried the bodies of Rosa Parks in 2005 and Temptations singer David Ruffin in 1991, he said.

A 1940 white Cadillac LaSalle hearse delivered Franklin's body to Detroit's African-American museum ""They really loved her, and she loved Detroit."" He said the casket where Franklin rests is 24-karat gold plated. ""God didn't make a better singer and there isn't a better casket,"" Mr Swanson said. ""She deserves the very best.""

"The man walked towards the student and was captured striking her on the cafe's video A month after a video went viral of a woman being publicly attacked in a Paris street, a man has been detained by police. Marie Laguerre had shared CCTV footage of the moment she was hit in the face near a cafe by a man who had harassed her as she walked home from work. The suspect had been receiving psychiatric treatment at a hospital and was arrested as he left, reports say. Ms Laguerre has been asked to identify him on Wednesday. Named Firas M by French media, the 25-year-old man had been sent to the hospital as part of a separate judicial case. Investigators had got hold of his phone number and traced him to the hospital. They had run into difficulties with the hospital because of medical confidentiality, Le Parisien reported. The suspect was described as disturbed and violent and ""capable of hitting his mother,"" the report said. Slap video of harassed woman shocks France France plans law on street harassment One French woman in eight raped - report Paris prosecutors launched an investigation into the attack on Ms Laguerre on 30 July, amid public shock at the blatant attack on the 22-year-old student in the 19th district of north-east Paris. The images of a woman being followed and then slapped on CCTV coincided with legislation that will soon see on-the-spot fines for street harassment. The new laws have been put forward by Equalities Minister MarlÃ¨ne Schiappa, who praised police for arresting the suspect. For complaints, investigations and soon verbal abuse in the street, she said French police were ""first in line to let nothing go unpunished"". Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Theresa May was all smiles as she joined school children for a dance Theresa May has announced plans to boost Britain's investment in Africa after Brexit, during her first trip to the continent as prime minister. In a speech in Cape Town, she pledged Â£4bn in support for African economies, to create jobs for young people. She also pledged a ""fundamental shift"" in aid spending to focus on long-term economic and security challenges rather than short-term poverty reduction. She will also visit Nigeria and Kenya during the three-day trade mission. On her way to South Africa, the prime minister played down warnings from the chancellor about the economic damage a no-deal Brexit could cause. Talking to journalists on board RAF Voyager on Tuesday morning, Mrs May reiterated that she believed a no-deal Brexit was still better than a bad deal - adding no-deal ""wouldn't be the end of the world"". Last week Chancellor Philip Hammond warned in a letter that a no-deal Brexit could damage the economy. Mrs May's trip - which will see her meet the presidents of all three countries - aims to deepen economic and trade ties with growing African economies ahead of Britain leaving the EU in 2019. May's mission to woo Africa after Brexit Brexiteer anger at Hammond's 'project fear' WW1 shipwreck bell returns to South Africa No-deal Brexit 'risks break-up of UK' Arriving in South Africa on Tuesday morning, Mrs May said she wanted the UK to overtake the US to become the G7's biggest investor in Africa by 2022. She promised to continue existing economic links based on the UK's EU membership - including an EU-wide partnership with the Southern African Customs Union and Mozambique - after Brexit next year. Promising an extra Â£4bn in direct UK government investment - which she expects to be matched by the private sector - she said while the UK could not match the ""economic might"" of some foreign investors - such as China or the US - it offered long-term opportunities of the ""highest quality and breadth"". Mrs May said young people were the future of the continent She defended the UK's aid spending in Africa, a target of criticism from some Tory MPs, saying it had ""worked"" to give millions of children and women an education and immunise millions against deadly diseases. But she said she was ""unashamed"" that it had to work in the UK's own interest and pledged a new approach in future, focusing on helping British private sector companies invest in fast-growing countries like Cote D'Ivoire and Senegal while ""bolstering states under threat"" from Islamist extremism such as Chad, Mali and Niger. ""True partnerships are not about one party doing unto another, but states, governments, businesses and individuals working together in a responsible way to achieve common goals,"" she said. The UK's overseas aid budget totalled Â£13.9bn in 2017, an increase of Â£555m in 2016. UK direct investment in Africa was Â£42.7bn in 2016, compared with Â£44.3bn from the US, Â£38bn from France and Â£31bn from China, according to data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. By BBC News reporter Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg Mrs May addressed business leaders at the offices of First National Bank in Cape Town Theresa May is on a charm offensive. This is the first visit by a UK prime minister to South Africa in five years - the last visit was by David Cameron when he came for Nelson Mandela's memorial in 2013. But this trip was prompted by Brexit, as with the UK leaving the European Union next year, it needs to strengthen its trade agreements around the world. Mrs May's address to business leaders was peppered with flattery about the continent's potential, as well as noting concerns about challenges around security and poverty, and she promised a mutually beneficial relationship. But some say the UK is late to the trade party, with countries like China already having firm trade partnerships across Africa. Africa is changing, re-imagining itself and rejecting the label of the ""dark continent"". Many in South Africa, and indeed across the continent, will be keen to see how the UK, which has at times been criticised for being too focused on aid rather than trade, demonstrates its shift to seeing the continent as an equal partner at the table. Mrs May said national self-interest and global co-operation were not in conflict and the UK could play a key role in harnessing the ""innovation and creativity"" of young people in Africa, 60% of whose population is under the age of 25. ""The challenges facing Africa are not Africa's alone,"" she said. ""It is the world's interest to see these jobs created."" Lord Boateng, chair of the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund, praised the government's ""proactive spirit"" at making more opportunities for British business on the continent, but said the UK was ""late to the party"". New Zimbabwe leader vows brighter future NI firm in PM's trade mission to Africa May pays tribute to 'great leader' Annan He told BBC Radio 4's World At One:  ""The reality is that the Chinese, the French, the Indians, indeed Korea, Japan, Germany even, tend to have had a much more proactive response to business in Africa than we traditionally have had. ""We have a lot of catching up to do if we are to make the most of what is an historic opportunity to recast the relationship between Africa and the UK away from it being seen solely as a philanthropic exercise, a basket case suitable only for [oversees aid], to an opportunity that requires investment, that requires risk taking and support by government for British companies."" Sharon Constancon, chair of the South African Chamber of Commerce in London, said the UK's aims were ambitious given that it currently ranked seventh and eighth respectively in terms of exports and imports to South Africa, the continent's largest economy. During talks with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Mrs May said she raised the issue of his government's controversial land reform program, which has been criticised by US President Donald Trump - who last week claimed that white farmers were being murdered and their property expropriated. The UK PM said she supported measures that were legal, transparent and had democratic approval, welcoming Mr Ramaphosa's assurances there would be ""no smash and grab"" seizures of land. By Larry Madowo, BBC Africa business editor The UK's historical relationship with many African countries still counts for something, but, as Prime Minister Theresa May will find on her trip to the continent, the UK now vies for attention with larger economies offering greater riches. The continent's leaders need to decide who to prioritise: an ambitious but friendly China, the huge European Union bloc, the potential riches of the United States, or the historically-linked United Kingdom. The prime minister's trip comes a week before the huge Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing. Dozens of African heads of state are expected there and China may offer new trade and finance deals. Mrs May's trip seems rather low key in comparison. Theresa May has met her South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa Tuesday- Mrs May flew into Cape Town where she met young people, before delivering a keynote speech on trade and how UK private sector investment could be brought into Africa. After a bilateral meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, she visited Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for 18 years. She had a guided tour and was handed a key to open the cell Mr Mandela was imprisoned in, before writing in the guestbook: ""His legacy lives on in the hopes and dreams of young people here in South Africa and around the world."" Wednesday- Mrs May intends to meet Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in the capital Abuja before meeting victims of modern slavery in Lagos. Thursday- In Kenya, Mrs May will meet president Uhuru Kenyatta before visiting British troops and a business school. A state dinner hosted by Mr Kenyatta will conclude the trip.

"Jonathan Sacks was chief rabbi between 1991 and 2013 A former chief rabbi says Jeremy Corbyn's comments about British Zionists are the ""most offensive statement"" by a politician since Enoch Powell's ""Rivers of Blood"" speech. In an interview with the New Statesman,external, Lord Sacks accused the Labour leader of being an ""anti-Semite"". A 2013 video of Mr Corbynaccusing some British Zionists of having ""no sense of English irony"" emerged last week. A Labour Party spokesman called Lord Sacks's comment ""absurd and offensive"". Zionism refers to the movement to create a Jewish state in the Middle East, roughly corresponding to the historical land of Israel, and thus support for the modern state of Israel. Corbyn defends 'British Zionist' comments Jewish MP 'feels unwelcome' after Corbyn comments BBC defends Rivers of Blood broadcast The clip -published by the Daily Mail,external- showed Mr Corbyn speaking at the Palestinian Return Centre and recalling a disagreement between some Zionists and the Palestinian representative to the UK, Manuel Hassassian, following a speech Mr Hassassian had made in Parliament. He said: ""This [Hassassian's speech] was dutifully recorded by the thankfully silent Zionists who were in the audience on that occasion, and then came up and berated him afterwards for what he'd said."" Mr Corbyn, who was a backbench MP at the time, went on to claim that the people concerned ""clearly have two problems"". ""One is they don't want to study history, and secondly, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all their lives, they don't understand English irony either."" This video can not be played Corbyn suggests a group of Zionists need lessons in history and irony Speaking for the first time on the anti-Semitism row within the Labour Party, Lord Sacks - who held the post of chief rabbi between 1991 and 2013 - told the magazine: ""The recently disclosed remarks by Jeremy Corbyn are the most offensive statement made by a senior British politician since Enoch Powell's 1968 'Rivers of Blood' speech. ""It was divisive, hateful and like Powell's speech it undermines the existence of an entire group of British citizens by depicting them as essentially alien."" Crossbench peer Lord Sacks said Mr Corbyn could only be judged by his ""words and actions"", before adding that he had given support to ""racists, terrorists and dealers of hate who want to kill Jews and remove Israel from the map"". Lord Sacks said: ""When he implies that, however long they have lived here, Jews are not fully British, he is using the language of classic pre-War European anti-Semitism. ""When challenged with such facts, the evidence for which is before our eyes, first he denies, then he equivocates, then he obfuscates. ""This is low, dishonest and dangerous. He has legitimised the public expression of hate, and where he leads, others will follow."" Enoch Powell delivered the ""Rivers of Blood"" speech in 1968 Conservative MP Enoch Powell delivered a speech in 1968 to a local Tory party meeting in Birmingham. It came days before the second reading of the 1968 Race Relations Bill, which led to the Race Relations Act - making it illegal to refuse housing, employment or public services to people because of their ethnic background. The speech was anti-immigration and saw Mr Powell reference observations made by his Wolverhampton constituents during the speech, including: ""In 15 or 20 years' time, the black man will have the whip hand over the white man."" He ended with a quote from Virgil's Aeneid, when civil war in Italy is predicted with ""the River Tiber foaming with much blood"". The speech became one of the most controversial in British political history and ended Mr Powel's career in Edward Heath's shadow cabinet. Lord Sacks said the leader of the Labour Party was ""an anti-Semite"", at a time where Jews were still being murdered in Europe ""for being Jews"", and ""within living memory of the Holocaust"". He said: ""For more than three and a half centuries, the Jews of Britain have contributed to every aspect of national life. ""We know our history better than Mr Corbyn and we have learned that the hate that begins with Jews never ends with Jews. ""Mr Corbyn's embrace of hate defiles our politics and demeans the country we love."" On Friday, Mr Corbyn said the comments had been made to ""defend the Palestinian ambassador in the face of what I thought were deliberate misrepresentations"" from people ""for whom English was a first language, when it isn't for the ambassador"". He said: ""I described those pro-Israel activists as Zionists, in the accurate political sense and not as a euphemism for Jewish people - and that is made clear in the rest of my speech that day. ""I am now more careful with how I might use the term 'Zionist' because a once self-identifying political term has been increasingly hijacked by anti-Semites as code for Jews."" Allies of Mr Corbyn said the speech had been ""taken out of context"", with shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying the focus should not be on what Mr Corbyn said five years ago but on tackling anti-Semitism in British society, including within Labour. But the leader was criticised by other members of his own party, with Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger describing the comments as ""inexcusable"" and making her ""feel unwelcome"" in the party. In response to Lord Sacks's comments, a Labour spokesman said: ""This comparison with the race-baiting Enoch Powell is absurd and offensive. ""Jeremy Corbyn is determined to tackle anti-Semitism both within the Labour Party and in wider society. And the Labour Party is committed to rebuilding trust with the Jewish community.""

"Sentina Bristol wanted the court to hear submissions about the role the Home Office might have played in her son's death The mother of a Windrush migrant has walked out of his inquest after the coroner was ""very rude"". Dexter Bristol, 57, collapsed and died in the street on 31 March while trying to prove his British citizenship. His family wanted to make submissions to the court about the role Home Office policy might have played in Mr Bristol's death. But Coroner Dr William Dolman ruled the policy was not relevant to the immediate circumstances of his death. He said it was ""absolutely clear"" Mr Bristol was under ""some sort of distress or pressure"", but added this was not solely because of his immigration status. Sentina Bristol and other family members left the hearing after the coroner ruled the Home Office should not be considered an interested party. Dr Dolman apologised to the family, who said they wanted ""justice"". Dexter Bristol died after suffering heart failure and collapsing in the street Mr Bristol was born in Grenada and came to the UK at the age of eight in 1968 asone of the Windrush generation, the court heard. However, he lost his job in 2017 and could not get a new one because he did not have a passport or documents proving his right to work. Mr Bristol died of natural causes after suffering acute heart failure near his home in Camden, north London, the coroner ruled. He had not visited his GP for more than a year and believed he could not change surgeries unless he proved his immigration status. Mrs Bristol, a trained nurse and British citizen, said the family was ""disappointed"" about an unsuccessful adjournment application at St Pancras Coroner's Court. She added: ""We want justice, that's what we're fighting for."" Before the family withdrew from proceedings on Tuesday, the court heard a heated exchange between Dr Dolman and the family lawyer. Dr Dolman accused Una Morris of ""trying to tell me how to run my court"" and repeatedly ordered her to sit down. He later apologised to Ms Morris and Mr Bristol's family, saying: ""I didn't mean any discourtesy at all."" Ms Morris told him family members were ""deeply upset at the way you spoke to me"". Mrs Bristol said although Dr Dolman was not speaking directly to her, ""he was very rude"". She described her son as someone who was ""very quiet"", ""bright"" and ""never got into any arguments with anyone"".

"University Challenge is to focus on posing ""gender neutral"" questions, says the show's executive producer. Peter Gwyn made the remark following a viewer complaint that the questions were skewed towards men. ""We try to ensure that when hearing a question, we don't have any sense of whether it was written by a man or a woman,"" he said. It comes in response to criticism that not enough female contestants appear on the quiz show. In an interview with Radio Times, Gwyn said ""we agreed"" improvement was needed ""and decided to rectify it."" ""Perhaps 'gender-neutrality' is what we aim for,"" he said, referring to both the style and content of the questions on the BBC Two programme. He added that ""questions should never sound as if they are directed more at men than women"". ""There are numerous balances we try to achieve in the questions we cast for each match, between the arts and the sciences, or between contemporary and historical themes, and we recognise that the gender balance is of great importance."" It's not the first time the long-running programme, hosted by Jeremy Paxman, has courted controversy over alleged sexism. All-male teams on University Challenge have been criticised Female contestants have repeatedly spoken of online abuse and objectification after their appearances. All-male teams and all-male finals - such as last year's contest between Balliol College Oxford and Wolfson College Cambridge - have been criticised by the likes ofhistorian and broadcaster Mary Beard.,external Gwyn says they do everything they can to encourage women to take part but it is the universities and colleges themselves who make the team selections. Rosie McKeown, from this year's winning team, St John's Cambridge, said there are several reasons for the gender imbalance. ""The most obvious one is, unfortunately, the hostility that some female contestants are subjected to on social media. But I think there may also be an issue with women underestimating themselves and being hesitant to try out for the show. I hope that will change soon."" This year's final did include more questions about women, including a round about female artists.

"The suspect had won a previous competition, US media report A gunman who attacked a Florida video game tournament was so obsessed with his pastime he would refuse to bathe or go to school, say court records. David Katz, 24, had a history of mental illness, according to his parents' divorce filing in his home state. His mother once confiscated his console and locked it in her room, and he punched a hole in the door, she said. Katz killed two people in the city of Jacksonville on Sunday before fatally shooting himself, police say. According to court papers in Maryland, he had a longstanding feud with his mother, and had twice been hospitalised for mental illness. The incident took place in a games bar attached to a restaurant ""His hair would very often go unwashed for days,"" his mother told a court during her 2007 divorce proceedings. ""When I took his gaming equipment controllers away so he couldn't play at three or four in the morning, I'd get up and find that he was just walking around the house in circles."" The documents obtained by the Associated Press show that his parents - Nasa engineer Richard Katz and government toxicologist Elizabeth Katz - disagreed over their youngest son's care, including whether he should take the antipsychotic medication he had been prescribed. The boy sometimes ""curled up into a ball"", refused to attend school and sobbed, Mrs Katz said. The Maryland judge awarded custody to Katz's mother, and the father was allowed visitation rights. Eli Clayton, 21, and Taylor Robertson, 27, were shot dead in Sunday's attack in Jacksonville at an eSports tournament for players of Madden NFL, an American football game. Eleven others were injured. Fellow players spoke of Katz's erratic playing style and unwillingness to make friends. ""We've always known he was a little off and stuff just because he wasn't social at all,"" Shay Kivlen, 21, of Seattle, told CBS News on Monday. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williamstold the Baltimore Sun,externalon Monday that no motive had yet been determined. He said Katz had legally purchased the two handguns used in the shooting from a licensed dealer in the Baltimore area.

"Sentina Bristol wanted the court to hear submissions about the role the Home Office might have played in her son's death The mother of a Windrush migrant has walked out of his inquest after the coroner was ""very rude"". Dexter Bristol, 57, collapsed and died in the street on 31 March while trying to prove his British citizenship. His family wanted to make submissions to the court about the role Home Office policy might have played in Mr Bristol's death. But Coroner Dr William Dolman ruled the policy was not relevant to the immediate circumstances of his death. He said it was ""absolutely clear"" Mr Bristol was under ""some sort of distress or pressure"", but added this was not solely because of his immigration status. Sentina Bristol and other family members left the hearing after the coroner ruled the Home Office should not be considered an interested party. Dr Dolman apologised to the family, who said they wanted ""justice"". Dexter Bristol died after suffering heart failure and collapsing in the street Mr Bristol was born in Grenada and came to the UK at the age of eight in 1968 asone of the Windrush generation, the court heard. However, he lost his job in 2017 and could not get a new one because he did not have a passport or documents proving his right to work. Mr Bristol died of natural causes after suffering acute heart failure near his home in Camden, north London, the coroner ruled. He had not visited his GP for more than a year and believed he could not change surgeries unless he proved his immigration status. Mrs Bristol, a trained nurse and British citizen, said the family was ""disappointed"" about an unsuccessful adjournment application at St Pancras Coroner's Court. She added: ""We want justice, that's what we're fighting for."" Before the family withdrew from proceedings on Tuesday, the court heard a heated exchange between Dr Dolman and the family lawyer. Dr Dolman accused Una Morris of ""trying to tell me how to run my court"" and repeatedly ordered her to sit down. He later apologised to Ms Morris and Mr Bristol's family, saying: ""I didn't mean any discourtesy at all."" Ms Morris told him family members were ""deeply upset at the way you spoke to me"". Mrs Bristol said although Dr Dolman was not speaking directly to her, ""he was very rude"". She described her son as someone who was ""very quiet"", ""bright"" and ""never got into any arguments with anyone"". Mr Bristol's immigration lawyer, Jacqueline McKenzie, said after the hearing that her client had been ""robust"" but was ""distressed by the fact that he was having to prove his status in the country"". ""He was prepared to fight but as the months went on and he was required to find more evidence it became very difficult and we saw him just decline into a shadow of himself,"" she added.

"Louis Makepeace said the college's actions left him ""appalled"" A teenager with dwarfism who was allegedly told he was a ""safety risk"" for a catering course has been offered a job by Gordon Ramsay. Louis Makepeace, 18, claims bosses at the Heart of Worcestershire College discriminated against him after being ruled out of the field due to his size. The 3ft 10in (1.16m) aspiring chef said he was ""appalled"" by their actions. The college told the BBC ""at no point has Louis been told he could not attend his course"", which begins next month. However, it confirmed ""adjustments Louis requires will need to be agreed before an unconditional offer can be given"". Ramsay blasted the college for a ""disgusting attitude"" and said he would ""offer him an apprenticeship any day"". Midlands breaking news: Enoch Powell plaque 'scrapped'; Dumped dog 'may have been bait' A spokesperson for Ramsay confirmed the tweet by him was a formal offer of work. ""Gordon's tweet was a genuine offer of help for Louis Makepeace, should he wish to pursue his cooking career within the Gordon Ramsay Restaurants chef apprentice programme,"" the spokesperson said.

Louis Makepeace wants to pursue a career in catering Louis said: ""I wanted to learn the skill, but I'm appalled by the way this has been handled by the college. ""I'm not sure I would want to study at the college now, as they've messed me about and dragged it out for too long. ""I still want to cook and one day open my own cafe or restaurant.""

"Debate over the future of cheques has been reignited amid a pay dispute at a company that has been printing cheques for more than 100 years. Some 79 members of the Unite union at Communisis in Crewe said their industrial action could have affected supply to High Street banks. Strikes scheduled this week have been called off amid the expectation of a fresh offer from the company. But the dispute has prompted discussion over our current use of cheques. The use of cheques in the UK peaked in 1990, when there were more than four billion transactions a year. Their popularity has been falling significantly since. A total of 405 million cheques were processed in the UK last year. Their future was in doubt a few years ago when the payments industry discussed phasing them out by 2018, but it was forced into a change of heart by MPs who said no viable alternatives for the vulnerable and elderly were in place. Who do you trust after cash? Debit card payments more popular than cash Old Charles Darwin paper Â£10 notes out, new 10p coins in The response from some at the news that printed cheques and chequebooks could be delayed by the dispute among specialists in Crewe, was to question when they last wrote a cheque. Some parents still do so for school trips, some small traders - such as window cleaners - may still ask for them, and, of course, the giant cheque still features in pictures of lottery winners and big charity donations. Tax refunds from HM Revenue and Customs used to often come by cheque, but nowadays the tax authority encourages customers to get money paid directly into their bank accounts. However, it still issued nearly six million cheques in the last financial year. More controversially, compensation payments by cheque from Ryanair with no signature wererevealed in a recent BBC investigation. Here are some of your views sent to theBBC Business Live pageon the use of cheques: Mark Greenman says: ""I am the director of Wales International Freight and we still pay all our suppliers by cheque. ""The reason for this is I have total control of the payments and avoid any computer error or more importantly fraudulent activity."" Financial adviser James Wyman says: ""Many of my clients will hand over a cheque to make contributions into pensions, investment accounts, or ISAs as it can be done in a single transaction, whereas daily limits on payments via internet banking mean they have to log in and make a series of payments. ""You are able to go into the bank and get a large payment made in a single transaction. However, why would you go out of your way to enter a branch if you were able to write out a cheque?"" However, Michael Ryder says: ""Last summer I took over the running of a small charity that used cheques for all of its transactions. About 300 cheques a year, all of them dual-authorised, had to be posted around the country to collect signatures before being dispatched to the payee. ""Since November last year we have written no cheques, payments are quicker, accountability is clearer, risk of misuse reduced and charges are lower."" However, there is still innovation in the centuries-old method of payment. A number of banks have trialled systems that allow people to pay in a cheque by taking a photo on their smartphone and submitting it on a secure smartphone app. A new UK-wide system, allowing banks to clear cheques from customers of different banks, is set to be in place by the end of the year.

"On her trip to Africa, Theresa May is hoping to promote what she describes as a ""truly Global Britain"" The UK's historical relationship with many African countries still counts for something, but, as Prime Minister Theresa May will find on her trip to the continent, the UK now vies for attention with larger economies offering greater riches. Mrs May is travelling to South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya this week on her first African visit as prime minister as she looks to boost Britain's post-Brexit trade. Britain's aim after leaving the European Union in March next year is to ""deepen and strengthen its global partnerships"",Mrs May said in a statement,external. ""This week I am looking forward to discussing how we can do that alongside Africa to help deliver important investment and jobs as well as continue to work together to maintain stability and security."" But it might be a hard sell. Chinese loans financed Kenya's new railway linking the capital, Nairobi, to the coast. What will Britain be able to offer? The UK is introducing legislation that should mean that African businesses will access the UK market on the same terms as they do now. Nevertheless, African countries, many of them former British colonies, will need to redefine their relationship with Britain in the wake of Brexit. Brexit: All you need to know The story behind Africa's free trade dream The continent's leaders need to decide who to prioritise: an ambitious but friendly China, the huge European Union bloc, the potential riches of the United States, or the historically-linked United Kingdom. In 2015, total trade (imports and exports combined) between Africa and the UK amounted to $36bn (Â£28bn), but that figure for the EU as a whole was $305bn. In the same year, trade between China and Africa totalled $188bn, and between the US and Africa is amounted to $53bn. To sweeten her offer, the prime minister is bringing along a delegation of 29 business leaders to promote ""the breadth and depth of British expertise in technology, infrastructure, and financial and professional services,"" Downing Street says. Mrs May begins her trip to Africa in her country's largest trading partner on the continent, South Africa, where she will sit down with President Cyril Ramaphosa. She will use a speech in Cape Town on Tuesday to lay out her plans to partner with Africa using private sector trade and investment after the United Kingdom leaves the EU. ""The UK has long been an important trading partner for South Africa and certainly in the current economic climate, where many South African businesses are struggling, numerous entrepreneurs are looking to the UK to expand their reach,"" Rachel Irvine, who runs a public relations and marketing agency, told the BBC. She has recently expanded her business, Irvine Partners, in London and sees significant potential in the prime minister's visit. But she says that it is ultimately about which country offers the best deals. 'We welcome both Mrs May and the Chinese, and like any other developing economy we'll do the business that suits us best."" The prime minister's trip comes a week before the huge Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing. Dozens of African heads of state are expected there and China may offer new trade and finance deals. The summit comes after Chinese President Xi Jinping's second tour of Africa when he visited Senegal, Rwanda, Mauritius and South Africa. Mrs May's trip seems rather low key in comparison. The British prime minister is also set to meet Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja, just four months after they held talks in London. Nigeria is Britain's second largest trading partner in Africa, but should the country be so focused on the UK? Tunji Andrews, an economist based in Nigeria's commercial hub Lagos, believes Nigeria should concentrate more on its relationship with the European Union. ""The diversity of demand of the EU market makes it slightly more attractive. ""I think it's impossible not to look at the British market at this point, but I'll also say that while Britain remains a viable trade partner, it just doesn't hold the same value to Africa as China and to a lesser extent, the US."" Nigeria's top export to the UK is crude oil and its largest import is refined oil, a structural inefficiency that leads to regular fuel shortages as the populous West African nation lacks a properly functioning refinery. Mrs May concludes her maiden African trip in Kenya, becoming the first British prime minister to visit the East African country in over 30 years. The country re-exports some of its products to the EU through the UK and there are concerns that a hard Brexit might jeopardise that. Kenya's trade split between the UK and the rest of the EU ""is almost 50-50 and the country will have to strike a good deal with both the UK and the EU because it depends on both markets to sell its tea, fresh produce and other agricultural products,"" says economist Tony Watima. Kenya supplies more roses to the European Union than any other country and is the world's third largest exporter of cut flowers. The country sends 17% of its flowers sold in the EU to the UK. With 500,000 people supported by the flower industry, according to the Kenya Flower Council, every market is critical. But with direct flights from Nairobi to New York beginning in October, the country may be looking to tap into the larger US market for its goods. President Uhuru Kenyatta will meet Mrs May in Nairobi on Thursday just three days after discussing trade with US President Donald Trump at the White House. Kenya will be keen to keep its UK market for its roses, but other EU countries are also important customers Overall, there is a sense that Africa is being wooed from many sides. Mrs May's trip to the continent is part of her mission to create a ""truly Global Britain"". She goes with the hope of offering a new partnership in which both the UK and Africa can benefit, but there are those who want the continent to drive a hard bargain. ""Markets are global, why should Africa have to pick just one?"" asks South African businesswoman Rachel Irvine. ""It is therefore decidedly in the interest of both parties to play nice with each other."" The story behind Africa's free trade dream What happens now that a deal's been done?

"This video can not be played The prime minister handed the ship's bell to President Cyril Ramaphosa at a ceremony in Cape Town A World War One relic linked to one of the worst maritime disasters in English waters has been returned to South Africa by Theresa May. The SS Mendi sank off the Isle of Wight in 1917 killing more than 600 South Africans en route to the Western Front to support British troops. The prime minister handed the ship's bell to President Cyril Ramaphosa at a ceremony in Cape Town. She said it marked the ""close bonds"" between the two countries. The SS Mendi sank on 21 February 1917 when it was accidentally rammed in thick fog by the Royal Mail packet-boat SS Darro. A government inquiry said the Darro failed to lower lifeboats, leaving 646 men to drown. Its captain was later handed a one-year suspension of his master's certificate. More than 800 members of the South African Native Labour Corps were on board the Mendi Most of the dead were members of the South African Native Labour Corps, heading to France to build railways, trenches, camps and roads on the Western Front. Speaking at the presidential office in Cape Town, Mrs May said: ""I'm proud to be able to present the historic bell from the SS Mendi to President Ramaphosa and the people of South Africa. ""Six hundred and seven black troops from the South African Native Labour Corps who set sail from Cape Town just over a century ago sadly never reached their destination, and never served alongside many other Allied forces on the Western Front. ""Today is an important opportunity to commemorate this tragedy in our shared history and is yet another example of the close bonds, historical links and mutual respect which underpins the UK's very close relationship with South Africa."" The story became a symbol of racial injustice in South Africa, where successive white-led governments discouraged annual Mendi Day commemorations. In 1995, the Queen and Nelson Mandela unveiled a memorial to the Mendi victims in Soweto. The bell from the SS Mendi is thought to have been removed for the shipwreck in the 1980s May to visit Africa for first time as PM 'Lost' WW1 Mendi bell handed to museum The sinking of the SS Mendi The ship's bell was given to BBC reporter Steve Humphrey in 2017 in a plastic bag at Swanage Pier, Dorset, after an anonymous phone call. A note in the bag read: ""If I handed it in myself it might not go to the rightful place. ""This needs to be sorted out before I pass away as it could get lost."" A note was left with the bell, entrusting it to a BBC reporter The BBC's Steve Humphrey with the bell at Southampton's SeaCity Museum It is thought the bell was taken from the shipwreck in the early 1980s. Until recently it had been on display at the Sea City Museum in Southampton. Mrs May will also visit Nigeria and Kenya as part of her first trip to Africa since becoming prime minister.

"Gerald Gavan's (left) intended target was Billy McGregor A man has admitted trying to kill six children in a hit-and-run after they innocently got caught up in a feud. Gerald Gavan, 22, from East Kilbride, drove a car into the youngsters after targeting Billy McGregor in Glasgow's Castlemilk area. The dispute between Gavan and Mr McGregor is thought to be linked to the 2017 murder of Jamie Lee in the area. At the High Court in Glasgow, carpet salesman Gavan admitted attempting to murder the children on 24 March. He also pleaded guilty to trying to kill Mr McGregor in the same incident. Gavan was remanded in custody at the High Court in Glasgow and will be sentenced next month. A judge watched graphic footage of the children being hurled into the air as Gavan struck them. Police near the scene of the hit-and-run in March One 14-year-old girl - who Gavan also reversed over - suffered a broken neck and required lengthy surgery. Prosecutor Maryam Labaki said the background to this crime was a ""family feud"" involving a ""fatality"". She added: ""Gavan is associated with one side of that dispute."" Gavan's former co-accused Gary Owen - who had his not guilty pleas accepted - is a relative of a man who is wanted in connection with the play park shooting of Jamie Lee. The hit and run happened after Billy McGregor - also known as William Dearie - had gone to a local shop at about 16:00. At the time the children were ""talking and laughing together"" in the same street. As Billy McGregor crossed the road towards them he spotted Gavan's silver Vauxhall Astra heading towards him. Ms Labaki said: ""The car accelerated and steered towards Billy McGregor, travelling diagonally and mounting the pavement."" He failed in trying to dodge the car - but Gavan then carried on into the children on the pavement. The advocate depute added: ""As the car collided with the group, six of them were struck, causing them to be thrown up into the air in different directions. ""Two of the children who had been sent flying were hit with such force that they were carried over a parked car landing on the ground opposite."" Distressed relatives of the young victims sobbed and one woman left the courtroom as CCTV of the incident was played to the court. In the footage, a 14-year-old girl was seen being unable to get up. Gavan then reversed over her before driving off at speed. The court was told he was unaware she was still on the ground. The teenager was found to have a badly broken neck and needed an initial six-hour operation. She later had a titanium plate attached to her spine to help her recovery and spent about two weeks in hospital. The court heard her injury was ""healing well"" and that she will make a full recovery. A 13-year-old boy was treated for a leg injury while a 14-year-old boy needed stitches for a knee wound. A 13-year-old girl was badly bruised while a 12-year-old girl was treated at hospital for muscle injuries. Another 14-year-old girl required physiotherapy. Billy McGregor had cuts to his arm and leg - as well as bruising - but ""declined medical attention"". The court heard Gavan's guilty plea was accepted on basis he had ""intended to cause physical injury"" to Mr McGregor. Ms Labaki: ""In striking him with the vehicle - when immediately in front of the children - Gavan had no opportunity to brake in time. ""His actions amounted to wicked recklessness in respect of the children."" Gary Owen, 20, had also faced the attempted murder claims but his not guilty pleas were accepted. Gavan and Owen, along with Ali Coats and Jay Gavan, 20, had further faced a charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice in connection with the crime. Not guilty pleas were also accepted for that allegation. Gavan was remanded in custody pending sentencing on  25 September in Edinburgh. Det Insp Peter Sharp said: ""Gerald Gavan has today finally admitted his guilt following a number of months where he tried to evade justice in a cowardly manner. ""This incident which unfolded in the afternoon of Saturday 24 March in Castlemilk was something which will no doubt stay in the minds of the young victims for a long time."" The officer said the consequences, especially for the 14-year-old girl who had to have surgery, could have been much worse. He added: ""For anyone to play out retribution or aggression in a public area using a vehicle as a weapon will simply not be tolerated. ""For innocent members of the public to be caught up in this horrendous incident is unacceptable.""

"This video can not be played Fans pay their respects to Aretha Franklin in Detroit The body of Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul, has arrived in Detroit to begin lying in state as thousands of fans gather for a final goodbye. Her body was delivered in a vintage white Cadillac hearse to the African-American museum in her home town where it will remain for two days. The museum also hosted civil rights activist Rosa Parks's viewing in 2005. Detroit, seen as the home of soul music, is treating Franklin's death as the passing of royalty. A week of mourning is being held in the city, where fans have descended from across the US to see the late singer one last time. Franklin's gold-plated casket The body of the 76-year-old, who died of pancreatic cancer nearly two weeks ago, will be on public view on Tuesday and Wednesday at the Charles H Wright Museum of African American History. ""She's the queen,"" said Melissa Howard, who flew from Texas on Monday to pay her respects. ""She's royalty. She's worth it,""she told the Detroit Free Press,external.

At the scene - Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Detroit As the sun rose on America's Motor City, the crowds were already waiting in line to say a final farewell to the Queen of Soul. Just before 8 o'clock in the morning, a white vintage Cadillac pulled up at the city's African American museum - moments later a gold casket was carried out. Just as she always did, Aretha Franklin arrived in style. It didn't take long for fans to break out in a rendition of Amazing Grace. Throughout the day, crowds who've waited patiently to pay respects have been spontaneously singing their favourite Aretha songs. Here the mood is melodic, not morose. Aretha Franklin was a global superstar whose voice will be remembered the world over, but she never forgot her hometown roots. This week, her hometown is showing the world, they'll never forget her. Fans wait in line to see Franklin's body The venue was reportedly chosen because Rosa Parks's viewing took place there in 2005 and because it needs to accommodate the thousands of people expected to attend. Friday's funeral at the Greater Grace Temple is for family and friends only, but Chaka Khan, Jennifer Hudson and Stevie Wonder are among those due to sing there. Former US President Bill Clinton will be among the speakers. The red lipstick and sheer dress she is wearing looks like something the gospel singer would wear onstage and ""something she would have selected for herself,"" her niece Sabrina Owens told the Associated Press.

"Coalition air strikes have caused most direct civilian casualties UN human rights experts believe war crimes may have been committed by all parties to the conflict in Yemen. In their first such report,external, they allege Yemeni government forces, the Saudi-led coalition backing them, and the rebel Houthi movement have made little effort to minimise civilian casualties. They point to attacks on residential areas in which thousands have died. The warring parties are also accused of arbitrary detentions, torture, enforced disappearances and recruiting children. The experts will present their report to the UN Human Rights Council next month. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. They have received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France. This video can not be played The conflict in Yemen has been raging for years - but what is it all about? At least 6,660 civilians have been killed and 10,563 injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition has also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have affected 1.1 million people. The so-called Group of Experts note that coalition air strikes have caused most direct civilian casualties,external, and that they have hit residential areas, markets, funerals, weddings, detention facilities, civilian boats and medical facilities. The report says they ""have reasonable grounds to believe that individuals in the government of Yemen and the coalition may have conducted attacks in violation of the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution that may amount to war crimes"". This video can not be played Aftermath of an attack that shocked the world They add that the naval and air restrictions imposed by the coalition on rebel-held areas to halt alleged weapons smuggling may also constitute a violation of the proportionality rule of international humanitarian law, while the effective closure of Sanaa airport may violate the principle of protection for the sick and wounded. The experts also expressed concern at the situation in the southern city of Taiz, where the Houthis have been besieging a government-held area for three years. Ending Yemenâs never-ending war The girl with the strawberry ring Who is fighting whom in Yemen? The report says civilians, including women and children, have been hit by shelling and snipers from the Houthis and other parties while in their homes, fetching water at local wells, or on their way to purchase food or seek medical attention. The Houthis are accused of indiscriminately using ""weapons with wide area effect"" in Taiz and other urban settings, which would constitute a war crime. Three million people have been displaced by the conflict The experts also found evidence of widespread arbitrary detention throughout the country by all parties, and ill-treatment and torture of some facilities. Victims and witnesses also described to the experts ""persistent and pervasive aggressive behaviour"", including sexual violence perpetrated by a pro-government force known as the Security Belt and UAE personnel, according to the report. The experts say they also received information indicating all parties had conscripted or enlisted children - some as young as eight years old - and used them to participate actively in hostilities. Houthi officials did not immediately respond to the UN report, but a spokesperson for the coalition said it had referred the document to its legal team. ""The coalition will take an appropriate position on this matter and make an announcement about it once the legal team submits its observations,"" the spokesperson added. The UN's special envoy has warned that if the conflict is left unresolved, Yemen could collapse On Monday, the coalition accused the UN team in Yemen of bias afterit called for expressing condolences to the families of more than 30 civilians, including 22 children, reportedly killed in two air strikes,externallast week. The experts say they have identified, where possible, individuals who may be responsible for war crimes and passed a confidential list of their names to the UN high commissioner for human rights. They also urged the international community to ""refrain from providing arms that could be used in the conflict"" - an apparent reference to Western countries, who are selling weapons to the coalition, and to Iran, which the coalition alleges is smuggling weapons the Houthis. ""Despite the severity of the situation, we continue to witness the total disregard for the suffering of the people of Yemen. This crisis has reached its peak with no apparent sight of light at the end of the tunnel,"" Charles Garraway, one of the experts, told a news conference.

Mel B and her ex-husband Stephen Belefonte Earlier this month a US judge dismissed claims the singer had made against her ex-husband Stephen Belefonte. In court papers Mel B claimed that the film producer was abusive and that he'd threatened to destroy her career by releasing a sex tape. Stephen Belafonte's legal team described the claims as ""outrageous and unfounded"". After being cleared of the abuse allegations, a judge refused to grant restraining orders that the pair had both filed against each other. Mel B was ordered to pay her former husband Â£270,000 in legal fees and more than Â£3,000 a month in child support payments. Allow Instagram content?

"Flames destroyed the clock at the top of the landmark city centre building There are ""grave concerns"" that the Primark building in Belfast city centre could collapse, the fire service has told the BBC. A fire broke out in the listed five-storey Bank Buildings at about 11:00 BST on Tuesday. Firefighters remain at the scene and the roof and some floors have collapsed. There are no reports of any injuries and it is not yet clear how the fire started. History of Belfast's Bank Buildings In pictures: Primark building destroyed in fire This video can not be played The landmark building was gutted by the fire within a matter of hours The fire service said the blaze started on the fifth floor or the roof. The flames died down on Tuesday evening but firefighters are expected to remain at the scene into Wednesday morning. Firefighters have pieced together 1km (3,280ft) of hose to bring water from the River Lagan to the building. ""We certainly can't guarantee the structural integrity of the building at this time,"" said Assistant Chief Fire Officer Michael Graham. ""Our expectation is that the internal floors will collapse where the fire has been burning at its greatest intensity. ""We actually hope that might help the overall structure."" This video can not be played Senior fire officer Michael Graham warned of ""grave concerns"" that the building could collapse A police officer at the scene told BBC News NI earlier on Tuesday that structural engineers had assessed the building and said it was ""at risk of imminent collapse"". Police are advising people to avoid Castle Street and Royal Avenue. Royal Avenue has been cordoned off and pieces of debris have fallen from the side of the historic building. Clothing giant Primark confirmed that the building was safely evacuated. It is believed that more than 350 people work in the store. The fire spread rapidly through the whole building, causing floors to collapse Mr Graham said it had been ""an intense six hours"" for firefighters. ""The priority for us was to stop any fire spreading to any other building and keep our firefighters and the community safe,"" he added. ""We feel we've achieved all of those things."" Alice Murdoch told BBC News NI that she was inside the building just before it was evacuated. ""I just popped inside and you could smell the smoke already,"" she said. ""Staff were sort of looking at each other and then the alarm started going off and they said: 'Get out as quickly as you can.' Ms Murdoch said it was ""quite scary"" but that the evacuation was well organised. Alice Murdoch was shopping in Primark when the fire started on Tuesday morning Caitlin Hunter said there was a sense of ""controlled panic"" as people inside the store tried to get out. ""I was inside on the bottom floor just having a nosey around at the make-up section and all of a sudden I could smell a weird smell of smoke,"" she said. ""Nothing had been said at this point what about was happening but people [had] their gut instinct, knowing something wasn't right. ""It was a race for people to come down the lifts and stairs... we were all rushing out."" By Catherine Morrison, BBC News NI A large crowd of several hundred people has gathered at the police cordon on High Street as firefighters continue to tackle the fire. They are watching one of the biggest fires in Belfast city centre in peacetime. There are gasps from the crowd as small internal sections of the building collapse every few minutes. Flames are now contained to a small section of the third and fourth floors. But the fire service has said it will continue with this operation for the next three to four hours. The Belfast city centre branch of the Primark clothing and homeware chain was undergoing a major refurbishment. It was being extended along Castle Street in a project costing an estimated Â£30m. The original Bank Buildings was designed by Sir Robert Taylorand erected by Waddell Cunningham in 1785. WH Lynn designed the new Bank Buildings in 1900. Firefighters used aerial equipment to try to tackle the blaze at the top of the building He intended it as a bridge to the 20th Century, with a compromise between the classical style of the upper part of the building and the great expanse of plate glass below. Three bombs exploded in the Bank Buildings in 1975 - a huge fire broke out shortly afterwards and damaged parts of the building. In 1979, it was taken over by the Dublin-based group Primark. Within 18 months, the store was totally refurbished and the exterior restored to its 1903 glory. Primark CEO Paul Marchant said he was ""deeply shocked and saddened"" by the fire. Thick smoke from the fire could be seen over Belfast throughout Tuesday afternoon ""The safety and wellbeing of our customers, colleagues and construction team is of course the most important consideration and we are truly relieved that all were evacuated safely,"" he added. Rajesh Rana, the president of Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said he was sorry to hear about the fire. ""It is a sad day for Belfast and for one of our city's leading retailers, which was in the midst of completing a Â£30m expansion project,"" he said.

"Protesters marched through the Parisian park on Friday where the prostitute was killed Five people have been charged in the French capital Paris with murdering a Peruvian transgender prostitute who reportedly tried to defend her client when robbers attacked his car. Vanesa Campos, 36, was shot dead on the night of 16-17 August in the Bois de Boulogne, a city park long known as a pick-up area for prostitutes. Her brutal murder sparked anger among sex workers and LGBT activists. Hundreds marched on Friday to demand greater protection for prostitutes. Campaigners demanded the repeal of a 2016 law which criminalised the purchase of sex in France, saying it forced prostitutes to work in more isolated locations to avoid police. Campos, who had worked illegally in France for two years, was attacked by about 10 men armed with knives, sticks and a handgun after she tried to stop them robbing her client's car, a police source told Le Parisien newspaper. France outlaws paying for sex 'I was kidnapped in London and trafficked for sex' 'Selling sex made me rethink decriminalisation' Protesters carried placards demanding ""Justice for Vanesa"" In an interview with TÃªtu magazine,other Latina prostitutes working in the area said they heard gunshots,externaland Campos shouting ""Todas!"" (a Spanish word roughly translating as 'all women'), which was a code word they used when they needed each other's help. The friends said they ran to the scene and one of them tried to approach her, before having to retreat when more shots were fired. Campos was killed by a bullet to the chest. It was not known if the client was also hurt in the incident. Eight people were arrested last week and five have now been charged with murder and robbery, AFP news agency reports. The protesters who turned out on Friday carried placards demanding ""Justice for Vanesa"" but also accusing the French state of ""complicity"" in the murder of a transgender woman by driving prostitutes to take greater risks with their safety. ""The law is 100% responsible for Vanesa's death,"" campaigner Giovanna Rincon told AFP. Around 10 prostitutes have been murdered in the Bois de Boulogne in recent years, Le Parisien reports. Supporters of the 2016 law argued it increases safety by improving police protection for sex workers and helping foreign prostitutes to get temporary residence permits in France if they agreed to seek jobs outside prostitution.

"There has been no power-sharing government at Stormont since January 2017 The Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action (NICVA) has called on Secretary of State Karen Bradley to restore decision-making at Stormont. The  voluntary and community sector umbrella body said Brexit, education, health and public finances are at risk. There has been no executive since January 2017, whenthe DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. ""Future generations will not thank us for ducking these issues,"" said NICVA chief executive Seamus McAleavey. The secretary of state has previously said she is aware of concerns about decision making at Stormont in the absence of ministers Who's calling the shots at Stormont? NI 'not eligible' for no government record Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide ""The challenges we are facing as a society cannot be dealt with by a hands-off, 'do nothing' approach that relies on short-term fixes to long-term issues,"" he said. Northern Ireland's power-sharing Assembly collapsed over the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme. That led to a snap assembly election in March last year, which saw theDUP and Sinn FÃ©in re-emerge as the largest parties, but so far they have been unable to reach a deal to restore the institutions. NICVA is currently surveying its 1,100-member organisations to find out how the absence of a functioning government is affecting them and the people they work with, and asking their views on the future. NICVA chief executive Seamus McAleavey said plans for the future cannot be made without a functioning executive ""It is NICVA's belief that only a functioning government with decision-making ministers can bring an end to the deadlock,"" added Mr McAleavey. ""While it continues, we are storing up hundreds of unmade decisions and ever greater problems that will be harder to deal with the longer they go un-tackled. ""The secretary of state needs to act today, to restore decision making in Northern Ireland."" The SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Brexit made the restoration of Stormont even more urgent SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said legislators should be embarrassed by the length of time Stormont has been out of action and that with Brexit looming the impasse must not go unchallenged. ""With Brexit our politics has now reached a defining moment. We cannot allow a hard Brexit to be thrust upon our people without a functioning Assembly to mitigate its devastating impacts.""

"This bell from the SS Mendi which sank in the Channel in 1917 killing more than 600 South Africans A World War One relic linked to one of the worst maritime disasters in English waters is to be given to South Africa by Theresa May. The SS Mendi sank off the Isle of Wight in 1917 killing more than 600 South Africans en route to the Western Front to support British troops. The vessel was rammed by a British merchant ship in thick pre-dawn fog. The prime minister will hand it to President Cyril Ramaphosa in Cape Town on Tuesday. The ship's bell was given to BBC reporter Steve Humphrey in 2017 in a plastic bag at Swanage Pier, Dorset, after an anonymous phone call. May to visit Africa for first time as PM 'Lost' WW1 Mendi bell handed to museum The sinking of the SS Mendi A note in the bag read: ""If I handed it in myself it might not go to the rightful place. ""This needs to be sorted out before I pass away as it could get lost."" A note was left with the bell, entrusting it to a BBC reporter The SS Mendi sank on 21 February 1917 when it was accidentally rammed in thick fog by the Royal Mail packet-boat SS Darro. A government inquiry said the Darro failed to lower lifeboats, leaving 646 men to drown. Most of the dead were members of the South African Native Labour Corps (SANLC), heading to France to carry out manual labour on the Western Front. More than 800 members of the South African Native Labour Corps were on board the Mendi at the time of the disaster The Darro's captain, who was blamed for the tragedy by the Board of Trade, was handed a one-year suspension of his master's certificate. The story became a symbol of racial injustice in South Africa, where successive white-led governments discouraged annual Mendi Day commemorations. In 1995, the Queen and Nelson Mandela unveiled a memorial to the Mendi victims in Soweto. The BBC's Steve Humphrey with the bell at Southampton's SeaCity Museum It's thought the bell was taken from the shipwreck in the early 1980s. Until recently it had been on display at the Sea City Museum in Southampton. On Tuesday the bell will be presented to the President of South Africa at a ceremony in Cape Town. The Prime Minister's deputy official spokeswoman said: ""This was the bell from the SS Mendi which sank in the Channel in 1917, killing more than 600 South Africans. ""It's a really important relic for them and the kind of focal point of their First World War remembrance.""

"China is a developing country with severe air pollution in its cities Chronic exposure to air pollution could be linked to cognitive performance, a new study in China suggests. Researchers believe that the negative impact increases with age, and affects men with less education the worst. Over four years, the maths and verbal skills ofsome 20,000 people in China were monitored by the US-Chinese study.,external Researchers believe the results have global relevance, with more than 80% of the world's urban population breathing unsafe levels of air pollution. However, while establishing a link between pollution and lower test scores, the study did not prove cause and effect. The study - which includes researchers from Beijing's Peking University and Yale University in the US - was based on measurements of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulates smaller than 10 micrometres in diameter where participants lived. It is not clear how much each of these three pollutants is to blame. Carbon monoxide, ozone and larger particulates were not included in the study. Described as an invisible killer, air pollution causes an estimated seven million premature deaths a year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Even low air pollution may damage heart India smog: How many cigarettes did you smoke this week? Reality Check: Do clean air zones work? ""We provide evidence that the effect of air pollution on verbal tests becomes more pronounced as people age, especially for men and the less educated,"" the study published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said. This video can not be played People in Beijing talk about smog in 2017 Pollution also increases the risk of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, the study suggests. ""Our sample enables us to examine the impact of air pollution as people age. So our results across the life course are quite new,"" one of the co-authors, Xi Chen of the Yale School of Public Health, told the BBC. In this study, researchers tested people of both sexes aged 10 and above between 2010 and 2014, with 24 standardised maths questions and 34 word-recognition questions. Previous studies found air pollution had a negative impact on students' cognitive abilities. ""This latest study matches with previous research,"" says Derrick Ho of Hong Kong Polytechnic who has worked on the health effects of extreme weather events like haze. ""What's new in this paper is the focus on the China scenario and the fact that it's a very detailed study compared to many other ones,"" he told the BBC. ""Also the differentiation between gender and age in this detail is new."" Many pollutants are thought to directly affect brain chemistry in a variety of ways - for instance, particulate matter can carry toxins through small passageways and directly enter the brain. Some pollutants can also have a psychological impact, increasing the risk of depression. About seven million people die every year from exposure to polluted air Air pollution caused 4.2 million deaths globally in 2016 91% of the world's population lives in places where air quality exceeds WHO guideline limits 14 Indian cities are among the world's 20 most polluted, with the northern city of Kanpur topping the list Nine out of 10 people in the world breathe polluted air Source: World Health Organization One of the reasons the researchers suggest older men with less education were worst affected by chronic exposure to air pollution is because those subjects often work outdoor manual jobs. This video can not be played A hair-raising drive through the Delhi smog ""Our findings about the damaging effect of air pollution on cognition,"" the study concludes, ""particularly on the aging brain, imply that the indirect effect on social welfare could be much larger than previously thought."" ""For older persons (in our study those age 55-65 or 65+) the effects can be very difficult to mitigate given the long term cumulative exposure,"" Mr Xi says. ""This is very worrisome as we all know that people often have to make important financial decisions in old age, such as when we should retire, which health insurance plan is better."" The study suggests that while the research findings are specific to China, it can shed light on other developing countries with severe air pollution.

Many pollutants are thought to directly affect brain chemistry in a variety of ways - for instance, particulate matter can carry toxins through small passageways and directly enter the brain. Some pollutants can also have a psychological impact, increasing the risk of depression. About seven million people die every year from exposure to polluted air Air pollution caused 4.2 million deaths globally in 2016 91% of the world's population lives in places where air quality exceeds WHO guideline limits 14 Indian cities are among the world's 20 most polluted, with the northern city of Kanpur topping the list Nine out of 10 people in the world breathe polluted air Source: World Health Organization One of the reasons the researchers suggest older men with less education were worst affected by chronic exposure to air pollution is because those subjects often work outdoor manual jobs. This video can not be played A hair-raising drive through the Delhi smog ""Our findings about the damaging effect of air pollution on cognition,"" the study concludes, ""particularly on the aging brain, imply that the indirect effect on social welfare could be much larger than previously thought."" ""For older persons (in our study those age 55-65 or 65+) the effects can be very difficult to mitigate given the long term cumulative exposure,"" Mr Xi says. ""This is very worrisome as we all know that people often have to make important financial decisions in old age, such as when we should retire, which health insurance plan is better."" The study suggests that while the research findings are specific to China, it can shed light on other developing countries with severe air pollution.

"This video can not be played Cystic fibrosis means gruelling sessions of physiotherapy every day for three-year-old Ivy ""I don't want to bury my daughter - but that's the reality of cystic fibrosis."" Kimberly Roberts is the mum of three-year-old Ivy, who hascystic fibrosis,external- or CF - which is a genetic lung disease with no cure. Along with her friend Alison Fare, who has two daughters with the condition, they want access to one of the most advanced treatments - the drug Orkambi. But the manufacturer and NHS bosses have been locked in arguments over its Â£100,000-a-year price tag since 2015. ""Our children deserve to have it - deserve to live a healthy long life. Without that drug they won't have one,"" said Mrs Roberts, who lives near Conwy in north Wales. Nice,external- the body which recommends whether a drug or treatment is available on the NHS - has said that the ongoing bills for the drug would be ""considerably higher than what is normally considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources,external"". Like many in the CF community, the two friends have been campaigning hard for access to the drug Orkambi to help control the condition. The choir that can never sing together Fashion range inspired by CF ""We just want the medicines for our kids,"" said Mrs Fare, who is also from Conwy. Both her daughters, six-year-old Imogen and three-year-old Annabelle, have CF. She would love the chance for her girls, especially Annabelle, to be able to play with Ivy - but the risk of cross-infection means that can never happen. Mothers Alison Fare, left, and Kimberly Roberts are campaigning for access to the cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi ""It's not great, because me and Kim are friends, so it would be nice - even just to go out to take them playing, to a playground or whatever,"" said the girls' mother. ""But we can't risk it - just in case they pass anything to each other."" The fear of infection dominates the lives of the two mothers, as they know it can lead to lengthy stays in hospital - or worse. ""It's very unpredictable and that's what's scary for us,"" said Ivy's mother. ""One day they can be absolutely fine, and it only takes them to pick-up the wrong bug or an infection from somebody else, and that can lead to long term lung damage, which is irreversible."" A build-up of mucus in the chest can lead to infections for those with CF Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition in which the lungs and digestive system can become clogged with thick, sticky mucus It can cause problems with breathing and digestion from a young age. Some of the main symptoms of cystic fibrosis can include recurring chest infections, difficulty putting on weight and frequent, wet-sounding coughs There's currently no cure for cystic fibrosis, but a number of treatments are available to help control the symptoms The condition can be fatal if it leads to a serious infection or the lungs stop working properly It is the battle to maintain lung function - the simple task of breathing - that makes Vertex's drug so important for campaigners. According to the American manufacturers, Orkambi can slow down the loss of lung function in CF patients by over 40% - and is suitable for use with the most common form of the disease - the variant that Ivy, Imogen and Annabelle all have. But while the drug was approved by the EU in November 2015, no health service in the UK can routinely prescribe it. Nice,externalhas said the cost for the drug would be ""considerably higher than what is normally considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources,external"". In July,NHS England made an offer of Â£500mfor five years to have the treatment, with Â£1bn over 10 years. But while that offer remains on the table - the deal has not been done. Orkambi has been hailed as life-changing - but at a price In Wales, the Welsh Government said it was guided by the Nice recommendation, along with the views of the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group (AWMSG). Officials from the Welsh Government said its medicines group was willing to review its position - but claimed the ball was in the drug company's court. ""We are still waiting for Vertex to submit a reappraisal including the new clinical data they say is now available,"" said a Welsh Government health spokesman. ""It is frustrating that Vertex refuses to engage in any meaningful way with the established and well-respected appraisal processes in Wales."" Vertex has insisted it is ready and willing to talk. ""We are keen to get back round the table as quickly as possible to resume discussions with NHS Wales All Wales Medicines Procurement,"" one of the company's UK representatives said. ""We submitted a portfolio proposal to All Wales Medicines Procurement on 12 July and stand ready to discuss this proposal in detail with NHS Wales, the Welsh Government and other key stakeholders to find a solution for cystic fibrosis patients."" Ivy uses a nebuliser as part of her treatment But the parents of the three Conwy girls said they were ""angry and frustrated"" by the ongoing delays in accessing treatment. ""We've got an impasse at the moment between the drug company Vertex and the NHS,"" said Mrs Fare. ""One needs to lower its prices, the other needs to step-up the offer they've given and meet somewhere in the middle, because at the moment it's not going anywhere."" Both mothers said their message was clear to all involved: ""Just get the deal done. Get round the table, talk, and don't leave the room until you've done the deal."" Ivy's mother is frustrated at the uncertainty. ""We don't want to outlive our children,"" said Mrs Roberts. ""That's the fear we live with daily. ""This is due to greed on Vertex's behalf and the NHS not moving. Something needs to give, because while we are waiting for this drug, people are losing their lives.""

"Anne Wafula-Strike has spoken out over difficulties on public transport in the past A Paralympian says she was ""neglected"" and left to wait on a plane for 45 minutes before airport staff helped her. Anne Wafula-Strike was on a Ryanair flight to Stansted on Friday and had booked assistance a month in advance. However, when the plane landed two hours behind schedule she found herself waiting as the other passengers collected their bags and left. Stansted said it was investigating the incident. Mrs Wafula-Strike, 49, from Harlow in Essex, said: ""I felt angry and very neglected, it's not good when you are abandoned on a flight and everyone else is picking up their bags and walking off. ""That's the time you start to think 'I wish I could just walk like them and get my luggage and walk off the plane' but I have to rely on assistance to get off, it was bad."" Anne Wafula-Strike (second left) competed at the London Paralympic Games in 2012 When a staff member arrived to help the wheelchair racer she said they told her they were short staffed and had been unsure if her flight from Berlin had arrived. Mrs Wafula-Strike said: ""When someone like me speaks up or raises their voice people will think it is only happening to one or two people but it is becoming a common occurrence for people with disabilities to be left neglected on planes or not able to get into trains. ""These things should not be happening when men have walked on the moon."" Paralympian wins train toilet payout BBC's Gardner left stuck on plane again Disabled comedian 'humiliated' on train Ryanair said a company called Omniserv was responsible for assisting disabled passengers at Stansted. A spokesman for the airport added: ""We are disappointed to hear about Anne's experience at Stansted on Friday evening. ""We are in the process of investigating how such a situation arose and have asked Omniserv, the company responsible for looking after passengers with reduced mobility, for a full explanation of why Anne had to wait for such a long time on the aircraft."" Mrs Wafula-Strike received a payout after being forced to wet herself on a train last year. Earlier this month, the BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said he had been left ""stuck on an empty plane"" at Heathrow Airport for a second time in six months.

"China is a developing country with severe air pollution in its cities Chronic exposure to air pollution could be linked to cognitive performance, a new study in China suggests. Researchers believe that the negative impact increases with age, and affects men with less education the worst. Over four years, the maths and verbal skills ofsome 20,000 people in China were monitored by the US-Chinese study.,external Researchers believe the results have global relevance, with more than 80% of the world's urban population breathing unsafe levels of air pollution. However, while establishing a link between pollution and lower test scores, the study did not prove cause and effect. The study - which includes researchers from Beijing's Peking University and Yale University in the US - was based on measurements of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulates smaller than 10 micrometres in diameter where participants lived. It is not clear how much each of these three pollutants is to blame. Carbon monoxide, ozone and larger particulates were not included in the study. Described as an invisible killer, air pollution causes an estimated seven million premature deaths a year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Even low air pollution may damage heart India smog: How many cigarettes did you smoke this week? Reality Check: Do clean air zones work? ""We provide evidence that the effect of air pollution on verbal tests becomes more pronounced as people age, especially for men and the less educated,"" the study published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said. This video can not be played People in Beijing talk about smog in 2017 Pollution also increases the risk of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, the study suggests. ""Our sample enables us to examine the impact of air pollution as people age. So our results across the life course are quite new,"" one of the co-authors, Xi Chen of the Yale School of Public Health, told the BBC. In this study, researchers tested people of both sexes aged 10 and above between 2010 and 2014, with 24 standardised maths questions and 34 word-recognition questions. Previous studies found air pollution had a negative impact on students' cognitive abilities. ""This latest study matches with previous research,"" says Derrick Ho of Hong Kong Polytechnic who has worked on the health effects of extreme weather events like haze.

"This video can not be played ""I lived and died a proud American"" - McCain's posthumous speech US President Donald Trump has announced the White House flag will be returned to half-staff, after critics attacked his response to the death of Republican senator John McCain. Flags at some federal buildings were fully raised on Monday, earlier than would normally be expected after such an event. Mr Trump tweeted his condolences to the McCain family, but has not offered a tribute to the veteran's life. The pair had a fractious relationship. Mr Trump appeared to repeatedly ignore media questions about the flag before announcing that it would be lowered again. But on Monday afternoon, he said in a statement: ""Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain's service to our country and, in his honour, have signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment."" On Monday night, Mr Trump spoke about McCain during a dinner for evangelical leaders, saying ""our hearts and prayers"" are going to the late senator's family ""and we very much appreciate everything that Senator McCain has done for our country"". Reality Check: When should the US flag fly at half mast? The angry politics of McCain's death Five times McCain clashed with Trump Mr Trump will not attend McCain's funeral next weekend. Other members of the Trump administration, including his chief of staff and secretary of defence, will attend instead. Flags at the White House returned to full-staff on Monday, two days after the death of John McCain Former Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama will pay tribute to McCain during his funeral ceremony on Saturday at the National Cathedral. Vice-President Mike Pence will also address a service in McCain's honour at the capitol on Friday. Earlier on Monday, before the flag U-turn, McCain family friend Rick Davis read out a posthumous message prepared by the senator before his death from brain cancer on Saturday. Parts of the speech could be interpreted as taking aim at President Trump's policies. It urged the nation not to ""hide behind walls"" and said the American people are ""a nation of ideals, not blood and soil"". The key moments in John McCain's life ""We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe,"" McCain had said. ""We weaken it when we hide behind walls rather than tear them down."" This video can not be played John McCain: US war hero, maverick and political titan McCain also told his country folk: ""Do not despair of our present difficulties, but believe always in the promise and greatness of America"". Traditionally, the death of somebody of McCain's stature would see flags flying at half-staff until their burial. The White House was urged by senators of both parties to honour that protocol, and critics asked why a proclamation had not been issued as it was after the deaths of other political figures, such as former First Lady Barbara Bush. Senior Democrat Chuck Schumer and top Republican Mitch McConnell said the flags on all government buildings should be at half-staff for the late senator until his burial next Sunday. Former presidents lead McCain tributes Flags at the US Capitol and other Washington landmarks remained at half-staff earlier on Monday, but the White House had returned to its usual levels. This video can not be played Visitors to the Vietnam memorial in Washington DC paid tribute to John McCain. Some said the White House was simply following proper procedure, however, because US Flag Code states that flags be lowered ""on the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress"". The rather sparing statement on Monday was the first from the White House to reference McCain's death. None was issued over the weekend, though one was drafted, according to US media. Instead, both the president and vice-president offered their condolences to the senator's family via Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The antipathy between the president and McCain has been well documented since Mr Trump took office. Earlier this month, when he signed a multi-billion dollar defence bill named after McCain, the president did not say his name. Mr McCain's body will lie in state in the Arizona State Capitol on Wednesday and at the US Capitol Rotunda on Friday, giving his colleagues and the public a chance to pay their respects. He will then be laid to rest on Sunday in a private ceremony at the US Naval Academy chapel. This video can not be played What makes a hero? McCain's farewell statement to Americans.

"Coalition air strikes have caused most direct civilian casualties UN human rights experts believe war crimes may have been committed by all parties to the conflict in Yemen. In their first such report,external, they allege Yemeni government forces, the Saudi-led coalition backing them, and the rebel Houthi movement have made little effort to minimise civilian casualties. They point to attacks on residential areas in which thousands have died. The warring parties are also accused of arbitrary detentions, torture, enforced disappearances and recruiting children. The experts will present their report to the UN Human Rights Council next month. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. They have received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France. This video can not be played The conflict in Yemen has been raging for years - but what is it all about? At least 6,660 civilians have been killed and 10,563 injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition has also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have affected 1.1 million people. The so-called Group of Experts note that coalition air strikes have caused most direct civilian casualties,external, and that they have hit residential areas, markets, funerals, weddings, detention facilities, civilian boats and medical facilities. The report says they ""have reasonable grounds to believe that individuals in the government of Yemen and the coalition may have conducted attacks in violation of the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution that may amount to war crimes"". This video can not be played Aftermath of an attack that shocked the world They add that the naval and air restrictions imposed by the coalition on rebel-held areas to halt alleged weapons smuggling may also constitute a violation of the proportionality rule of international humanitarian law, while the effective closure of Sanaa airport may violate the principle of protection for the sick and wounded. The experts also expressed concern at the situation in the southern city of Taiz, where the Houthis have been besieging a government-held area for three years. Ending Yemenâs never-ending war The girl with the strawberry ring Who is fighting whom in Yemen? The report says civilians, including women and children, have been hit by shelling and snipers from the Houthis and other parties while in their homes, fetching water at local wells, or on their way to purchase food or seek medical attention. The Houthis are accused of indiscriminately using ""weapons with wide area effect"" in Taiz and other urban settings, which would constitute a war crime. Three million people have been displaced by the conflict The experts also found evidence of widespread arbitrary detention throughout the country by all parties, and ill-treatment and torture of some facilities. Victims and witnesses also described to the experts ""persistent and pervasive aggressive behaviour"", including sexual violence perpetrated by a pro-government force known as the Security Belt and UAE personnel, according to the report. The experts say they also received information indicating all parties had conscripted or enlisted children - some as young as eight years old - and used them to participate actively in hostilities. Houthi officials did not immediately respond to the UN report, but a spokesperson for the coalition said it had referred the document to its legal team. ""The coalition will take an appropriate position on this matter and make an announcement about it once the legal team submits its observations,"" the spokesperson added. The UN's special envoy has warned that if the conflict is left unresolved, Yemen could collapse On Monday, the coalition accused the UN team in Yemen of bias afterit called for expressing condolences to the families of more than 30 civilians, including 22 children, reportedly killed in two air strikes,externallast week. The experts say they have identified, where possible, individuals who may be responsible for war crimes and passed a confidential list of their names to the UN high commissioner for human rights. They also urged the international community to ""refrain from providing arms that could be used in the conflict"" - an apparent reference to Western countries, who are selling weapons to the coalition, and to Iran, which the coalition alleges is smuggling weapons the Houthis. ""Despite the severity of the situation, we continue to witness the total disregard for the suffering of the people of Yemen. This crisis has reached its peak with no apparent sight of light at the end of the tunnel,"" Charles Garraway, one of the experts, told a news conference.

"Wonga ended its sponsorship of Newcastle United in 2016 Six years ago the founder of Wonga described the payday lender as a""platform for the future of financial services"". But it seems the future has not turned out quite the way Errol Damelin had hoped. This week, the company isconsidering ""all options""after reports suggested it was close to collapse. Its reversal of fortunes has been prompted by a deluge of compensation claims for loans taken out before 2014. The Financial Conduct Authority ruled four years ago that Wonga'sdebt collection practices were unfairand ordered it to pay Â£2.6m in compensation to 45,000 customers. Since then tougher rules and price caps have hit profits for payday lenders and dealt a seemingly fatal blow to their business model. Wonga was founded in 2007 to offer loans for less than 30 days to consumers without the need to go through a lengthy application process. ""We have dared to ask some hard questions, like how can we make loans instant, how can we get money to people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, how can we be totally transparent?"" Mr Damelin told the BBC in 2012. ""So what we have built is a solution around speed and convenience, and helping people by dealing with them when they want to deal with us."" However, the catch was astronomical interest rates of more than 4,000%, which could soon substantially increase the cost of even a small loan taken out for a few days. One Wonga customer told the BBC about the sleepless nights caused by her Â£300 loan soon mushrooming into a Â£2,000 debt. Wonga was forced to abandon its TV ads featuring puppets in 2014 Wonga started to attract criticism in 2012 after runningadverts encouraging students with jobs to borrow moneyfor activities such as overseas holidays. Shortly afterwards fans of some football clubs called for its ads to be removed from their clubs' websites. The following year, prominent figures took aim at such lenders, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, saying he wanted to put firms like Wonga ""out of business"". Wonga claimed its business practices were being misrepresented and that 99% of its one million UK customers were satisfied. Slowing lending volumes and customer numbers - down almost half to 575,000 for 2014 - were compounded by theFCA's decision to cap the cost of payday loansat 0.8% of the amount borrowed per day and impose a Â£15 limit on default charges. Overnight, what had been something of a golden goose stopped laying eggs. The FCA crackdown prompted the firm towrite off debts of Â£220m for 330,000 customersafter putting new affordability checks in place. That helped send Wonga spiralling into the red, reporting an annual loss of more than Â£37m for 2014 - a huge reversal of fortune considering it made an Â£84m profit just two years earlier. Occupy London highlighted Wonga's sky-high interest rates at a protest on May Day in 2014 Its losses doubled in 2015 to just over Â£80m. Despite a move to focus on slightly longer-term loans with more flexible repayment rules,Wonga still lost Â£65m in 2016and admitted it had ""lost its way"" under previous management. The privately owned company has yet to release its results for 2017 - but they are unlikely to reflect a return to profitability. The number of complaints about payday loans more than tripled to 10,529 in 2016-17 despite strict new regulations limiting interest charges, according to the Financial Ombudsman Service. That figure, however, was far lower than the 168,769 inquiries about payment protection insurance (PPI) in the same period. Debt charities maintain that payday lenders are part of the problem - rather than the solution - to unaffordable consumer debt. Despite a recent Â£10m lifeline from investors to keep Wonga afloat, Grant Thornton is understood to be waiting in the wings if it does collapse into administration.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump speaks with the Mexican leader on the phone through an interpreter The US and Mexico have agreed to revamp Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement, in what Donald Trump called a ""really good deal"" for both countries. The US President, who has frequently criticised the existing deal, made the announcement on Monday. Canada - the other member of Nafta - is yet to agree to the new terms and will hold more discussions on Tuesday. Mr Trump had threatened to pull out of the deal, triggering a year of talks. He demanded a renegotiation of the 1994 trade agreement, which he blames for a decline in US manufacturing jobs, especially in the car industry. What is a trade war and should I worry? What is the Nafta trade deal? Is Trump right about trade? US shares rose and the Mexican peso strengthened on news of the preliminary deal on Monday. Mr Trump said the US and Mexico had agreed on terms that would make for a deal that was ""much more fair"". Negotiators have been rewriting the Nafta treaty over the past year, but in the past five weeks, Canada has not been part of the discussions. ""We will see whether or not we decide to put up Canada or just do a separate deal with Canada,"" Mr Trump said. He also threatened Canada with tariffs on cars and said he wanted to get rid of the name Nafta, which he said has ""bad connotations"". Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has had a ""constructive conversation"" with Mr Trump since the deal with Mexico was announced, his office said. Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland is expected to travel to Washington DC for talks on Tuesday. US President Trump announced the new trade deal in front of a Mexican delegation Negotiators want to agree a deal before the newly elected Mexican president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, takes office in December. He has been reluctant to continue Enrique Pena Nieto's police of opening up of Mexico's energy sector, which could complicate negotiations. In order to meet that deadline, the Trump administration must present Congress with a deal at least 90 days in advance - meaning the deadline is this Friday. However, Mr Obrador said on Monday that the two-way agreement with the US was just the first step in a new treaty. ""We're very interested in it remaining a three-country deal,"" he said. ""The free-trade agreement should remain as it was originally conceived."" A spokesman for Ms Freeland said the country was ""encouraged"" by the progress made by the US and Mexico but did not comment on the specific terms. The US and Canada have been at loggerheads on a range of trade matters, including Canadian protections for its dairy industry and US tariffs on steel and aluminium. ""We will only sign a new Nafta that is good for Canada... Canada's signature is required,"" said spokesman Adam Austen. A senior US trade official said: ""There are still issues with Canada but I think they could be resolved very quickly."" In a televised telephone call with Mr Trump, Mr Pena Nieto stressed the importance of an agreement that includes Canada. However, Mexican foreign minister Luis Videgaray said his country was prepared to strike a bilateral US-Mexico deal. Nafta covers more than $1tn (Â£780bn) in annual trade. The update is to include provisions to govern intellectual property, digital trade and investor disputes, among other issues. In the preliminary agreement announced on Monday, the US and Mexico agreed that 75% of a product must be made in the two countries to receive tax-free treatment - higher than in the existing deal. This video can not be played If Nafta trade deal was a hamburger... On cars, the two sides also settled on rules that will require 40% to 45% of each vehicle to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour to discourage firms from moving production to lower-wage Mexico. The pact would last for 16 years, the US said, and be reviewed every six years - but will not carry the threat of automatic expiration. Politicians in all three countries have the final say over trade agreements. In the US, Republicans, who typically support free trade, have pressed the White House to strike a deal, arguing that the relatively open borders have benefited American farmers and other groups. 'It would be a disaster for Texas' Where does Trump's 'America First' leave Canada? Senator John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, called the development a ""positive step"", adding: ""Now we need to ensure the final agreement brings Canada into the fold and has bipartisan support."" The US Chamber of Commerce also said it was critical that the agreement continued to include Canada. Reality Check: Is Trump right about trade? What is a trade war and why should I worry?

Leia Pierce told KDVR-TV,externalthat her son, Jamel Myles, revealed to her over the summer that he was gay. She said Jamel wanted to go to school and tell his classmates because he was ""proud"" to be gay. Denver Public Schools (DPS) say crisis counsellors have been made available to students at Jamel's elementary school. The school system sent letters to families on Friday about the additional counselling services for students. The letter, addressed to the families of Joe Shoemaker Elementary School pupils, says Jamel's death ""is an unexpected loss for our school community"" and offers parents signs of stress to watch for in their children. DPS Spokesman Will Jones told the BBC on Monday that the district is ""deeply committed to ensuring that all members of the school community are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender status"". His statement added that administrators have taken steps ""ensuring that our LGBTQ+ students can pursue their education with dignity"". Policies and practices, Mr Jones said, include anti-bullying programmes and ""guidance materials that fully respect gender identity (including use of preferred pronouns and restrooms)"".

"Malcolm Turnbull with granddaughter Alice at his final press briefing as PM on Friday Malcolm Turnbull has said he will quit Australia's parliament on Friday following his removal as prime minister by party rivals, local media report. Mr Turnbull was replaced by Scott Morrison last week in a bid to end infighting that had crippled the centre-right government. The ousted leader said Australians would be ""appalled"" by recent events. His departure will trigger a by-election and place Mr Morrison's parliamentary majority at risk. In explaining his decision, Mr Turnbull again took a thinly veiled swipe at his predecessor, Tony Abbott - who had been accused of undermining the government. ""Former prime ministers are best out of parliament not in it, and I think recent events best underline the value of that observation,"" Mr Turnbull told party members on Monday, in a speech reported by multiple outlets. Without Mr Turnbull, Mr Morrison will command 75 of a reduced 149 seats in the House of Representatives. Turnbull 'felled by revolts and revenge' Six moments that defined Turnbull as PM Who is Scott Morrison? A by-election for Mr Turnbull's seat will most likely take place in October, Australian media reported. If the government loses the seat, Mr Morrison will be forced to rely on independents to pass legislation in a 150-member parliament. The Labor opposition currently has 69 seats.

"China is a developing country with severe air pollution in its cities Chronic exposure to air pollution could be linked to cognitive performance, a new study in China suggests. Researchers believe that the negative impact increases with age, and affects men with less education the worst. Over four years, the maths and verbal skills ofsome 20,000 people in China were monitored by the US-Chinese study.,external Researchers believe the results have global relevance, with more than 80% of the world's urban population breathing unsafe levels of air pollution. However, while establishing a link between pollution and lower test scores, the study did not prove cause and effect. The study - which includes researchers from Beijing's Peking University and Yale University in the US - was based on measurements of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulates smaller than 10 micrometres in diameter where participants lived. It is not clear how much each of these three pollutants is to blame. Carbon monoxide, ozone and larger particulates were not included in the study. Described as an invisible killer, air pollution causes an estimated seven million premature deaths a year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Even low air pollution may damage heart India smog: How many cigarettes did you smoke this week? Reality Check: Do clean air zones work? ""We provide evidence that the effect of air pollution on verbal tests becomes more pronounced as people age, especially for men and the less educated,"" the study published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said. This video can not be played People in Beijing talk about smog in 2017 Pollution also increases the risk of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, the study suggests. ""Our sample enables us to examine the impact of air pollution as people age. So our results across the life course are quite new,"" one of the co-authors, Xi Chen of the Yale School of Public Health, told the BBC. In this study, researchers tested people of both sexes aged 10 and above between 2010 and 2014, with 24 standardised maths questions and 34 word-recognition questions. Previous studies found air pollution had a negative impact on students' cognitive abilities. ""This latest study matches with previous research,"" says Derrick Ho of Hong Kong Polytechnic who has worked on the health effects of extreme weather events like haze. ""What's new in this paper is the focus on the China scenario and the fact that it's a very detailed study compared to many other ones,"" he told the BBC. ""Also the differentiation between gender and age in this detail is new."" Many pollutants are thought to directly affect brain chemistry in a variety of ways - for instance, particulate matter can carry toxins through small passageways and directly enter the brain. Some pollutants can also have a psychological impact, increasing the risk of depression. About seven million people die every year from exposure to polluted air Air pollution caused 4.2 million deaths globally in 2016 91% of the world's population lives in places where air quality exceeds WHO guideline limits 14 Indian cities are among the world's 20 most polluted, with the northern city of Kanpur topping the list Nine out of 10 people in the world breathe polluted air Source: World Health Organization One of the reasons the researchers suggest older men with less education were worst affected by chronic exposure to air pollution is because those subjects often work outdoor manual jobs. This video can not be played A hair-raising drive through the Delhi smog ""Our findings about the damaging effect of air pollution on cognition,"" the study concludes, ""particularly on the aging brain, imply that the indirect effect on social welfare could be much larger than previously thought."" ""For older persons (in our study those age 55-65 or 65+) the effects can be very difficult to mitigate given the long term cumulative exposure,"" Mr Xi says. ""This is very worrisome as we all know that people often have to make important financial decisions in old age, such as when we should retire, which health insurance plan is better."" The study suggests that while the research findings are specific to China, it can shed light on other developing countries with severe air pollution.

"This video can not be played How weather forecasts are used to prevent cholera outbreaks Cholera cases in Yemen have been slashed by a new system that predicts where outbreaks will occur. Last year, there were more than 50,000 new cases in just one week - this year, the numbers plummeted to about 2,500. The system has enabled aid workers to focus efforts on prevention several weeks in advance of an outbreak - by monitoring rainfall. It comes as the UN says it is concerned about a possible ""third wave"" of the epidemic. The deployment of the technology has been coordinated by the UK's Department for International Development. Prof Charlotte Watts, the department's chief scientific adviser, said that the system had helped aid workers bring a rampant epidemic under control. ""We have thousands of people around the world that died from cholera each year,"" he said. ""And I think this approach could really help put a dent into that figure. ""What this technology enables us to do is really home in to where we're going to get new outbreaks, and respond really effectively."" Last year, there werea million cases of the waterborne disease in Yemen. More than 2,000 people died and many of them were children. It was the largest and fastest-spreading epidemic on record - and its rapid spread was caused by the destruction of sewerage and sanitation systems during the country's civil war. Although cases have reduced dramatically in 2018, the UN says it is concerned about a possible ""third wave"" of the epidemic. The UK's overseas aid department has worked with the Met Office to develop a system that predicts where cholera will occur four weeks ahead of time. The Met Office produces a rainfall forecast for Yemen. Using its supercomputers, it is to determine the specific amount of rain that will fall and pinpoint the areas it will hit within a 10km (six-mile) radius. The system combines heavy rainfall forecasts, in red, with local cholera risk data These are important because downpours overwhelm the sewerage system and spread the infection. The forecasts are used in conjunction with a computer model developed by Prof Rita Colwell, at the University of Maryland, and Dr Antar Jutla, at West Virginia University. It draws on a variety of local information such as: population density access to clean water seasonal temperature Together, this information enables scientists to predict the areas most likely to experience an outbreak, up to four weeks in advance. First global pledge to end cholera Yemen cholera cases exceed half a million Yemen faces 'worst cholera outbreak' The information is passed on to the UN's children's charity, Unicef, which uses it to to deploy its limited resources on the ground. It distributes hygiene kits, jerrycans and chlorine tablets to prevent the spread of disease. Most importantly, it coordinates local health education campaigns. The information is simple sanitation advice, such as washing hands and drawing water from safe sources - but the early intervention has prevented tens of thousands of cases. But the promising early impact of the cholera prediction system should be treated with caution, according to Prof Watts. There are many factors that can influence the number of cases, such as local structures and geography. But she believes that the reduction in cases and deaths has been so dramatic that the system must be having some effect and is keen to develop it further. Yemen experienced the worst cholera outbreak on record, with more than one million cases last year ""We would like to extend the predictions from four weeks to eight weeks because that would enable us to not only plan prevention activities in terms of clean access to clean water and health education but also potentially deploy a vaccine campaign, which takes a little bit longer to plan and implement,"" she told BBC News. Across the world, an estimated 30,000 people die of cholera each year - mostly in South Asia and Africa. The new predictive system has the potential to slash that number, according to Helen Ticehurst, who is the Met Office's international development manager. ""The project is really exciting in understanding the application of forecasting to cholera prevention,"" she said. ""We can use what we have learned from this project and use it in other parts of the world where there is cholera prevention and also to prevent other diseases that are associated with temperature and rainfall, such as dengue fever and malaria"".

"This video can not be played Theresa May was all smiles as she joined school children for a dance Theresa May has announced plans to boost Britain's investment in Africa after Brexit, during her first trip to the continent as prime minister. In a speech in Cape Town, she pledged Â£4bn in support for African economies, to create jobs for young people. She also pledged a ""fundamental shift"" in aid spending to focus on long-term economic and security challenges rather than short-term poverty reduction. She will also visit Nigeria and Kenya during the three-day trade mission. On her way to South Africa, the prime minister played down warnings from the chancellor about the economic damage a no-deal Brexit could cause. Talking to journalists on board RAF Voyager on Tuesday morning, Mrs May reiterated that she believed a no-deal Brexit was still better than a bad deal - adding no-deal ""wouldn't be the end of the world"". Last week Chancellor Philip Hammond warned in a letter that a no-deal Brexit could damage the economy. Mrs May's trip - which will see her meet the presidents of all three countries - aims to deepen economic and trade ties with growing African economies ahead of Britain leaving the EU in 2019. May's mission to woo Africa after Brexit Brexiteer anger at Hammond's 'project fear' WW1 shipwreck bell returns to South Africa No-deal Brexit 'risks break-up of UK' Arriving in South Africa on Tuesday morning, Mrs May said she wanted the UK to overtake the US to become the G7's biggest investor in Africa by 2022. She promised to continue existing economic links based on the UK's EU membership - including an EU-wide partnership with the Southern African Customs Union and Mozambique - after Brexit next year. Promising an extra Â£4bn in direct UK government investment - which she expects to be matched by the private sector - she said while the UK could not match the ""economic might"" of some foreign investors - such as China or the US - it offered long-term opportunities of the ""highest quality and breadth"". Mrs May said young people were the future of the continent She defended the UK's aid spending in Africa, a target of criticism from some Tory MPs, saying it had ""worked"" to give millions of children and women an education and immunise millions against deadly diseases. But she said she was ""unashamed"" that it had to work in the UK's own interest and pledged a new approach in future, focusing on helping British private sector companies invest in fast-growing countries like Cote D'Ivoire and Senegal while ""bolstering states under threat"" from Islamist extremism such as Chad, Mali and Niger. ""True partnerships are not about one party doing unto another, but states, governments, businesses and individuals working together in a responsible way to achieve common goals,"" she said. The UK's overseas aid budget totalled Â£13.9bn in 2017, an increase of Â£555m in 2016. UK direct investment in Africa was Â£42.7bn in 2016, compared with Â£44.3bn from the US, Â£38bn from France and Â£31bn from China, according to data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. By BBC News reporter Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg Mrs May addressed business leaders at the offices of First National Bank in Cape Town Theresa May is on a charm offensive. This is the first visit by a UK prime minister to South Africa in five years - the last visit was by David Cameron when he came for Nelson Mandela's memorial in 2013. But this trip was prompted by Brexit, as with the UK leaving the European Union next year, it needs to strengthen its trade agreements around the world. Mrs May's address to business leaders was peppered with flattery about the continent's potential, as well as noting concerns about challenges around security and poverty, and she promised a mutually beneficial relationship. But some say the UK is late to the trade party, with countries like China already having firm trade partnerships across Africa. Africa is changing, re-imagining itself and rejecting the label of the ""dark continent"". Many in South Africa, and indeed across the continent, will be keen to see how the UK, which has at times been criticised for being too focused on aid rather than trade, demonstrates its shift to seeing the continent as an equal partner at the table. Mrs May said national self-interest and global co-operation were not in conflict and the UK could play a key role in harnessing the ""innovation and creativity"" of young people in Africa, 60% of whose population is under the age of 25. ""The challenges facing Africa are not Africa's alone,"" she said. ""It is the world's interest to see these jobs created."" Lord Boateng, chair of the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund, praised the government's ""proactive spirit"" at making more opportunities for British business on the continent, but said the UK was ""late to the party"". New Zimbabwe leader vows brighter future NI firm in PM's trade mission to Africa May pays tribute to 'great leader' Annan He told BBC Radio 4's World At One:  ""The reality is that the Chinese, the French, the Indians, indeed Korea, Japan, Germany even, tend to have had a much more proactive response to business in Africa than we traditionally have had. ""We have a lot of catching up to do if we are to make the most of what is an historic opportunity to recast the relationship between Africa and the UK away from it being seen solely as a philanthropic exercise, a basket case suitable only for [oversees aid], to an opportunity that requires investment, that requires risk taking and support by government for British companies."" Sharon Constancon, chair of the South African Chamber of Commerce in London, said the UK's aims were ambitious given that it currently ranked seventh and eighth respectively in terms of exports and imports to South Africa, the continent's largest economy. During talks with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Mrs May said she raised the issue of his government's controversial land reform program, which has been criticised by US President Donald Trump - who last week claimed that white farmers were being murdered and their property expropriated. The UK PM said she supported measures that were legal, transparent and had democratic approval, welcoming Mr Ramaphosa's assurances there would be ""no smash and grab"" seizures of land. By Larry Madowo, BBC Africa business editor The UK's historical relationship with many African countries still counts for something, but, as Prime Minister Theresa May will find on her trip to the continent, the UK now vies for attention with larger economies offering greater riches. The continent's leaders need to decide who to prioritise: an ambitious but friendly China, the huge European Union bloc, the potential riches of the United States, or the historically-linked United Kingdom. The prime minister's trip comes a week before the huge Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing. Dozens of African heads of state are expected there and China may offer new trade and finance deals. Mrs May's trip seems rather low key in comparison. Theresa May has met her South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa Tuesday- Mrs May flew into Cape Town where she met young people, before delivering a keynote speech on trade and how UK private sector investment could be brought into Africa. After a bilateral meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, she visited Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for 18 years. She had a guided tour and was handed a key to open the cell Mr Mandela was imprisoned in, before writing in the guestbook: ""His legacy lives on in the hopes and dreams of young people here in South Africa and around the world."" Wednesday- Mrs May intends to meet Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in the capital Abuja before meeting victims of modern slavery in Lagos. Thursday- In Kenya, Mrs May will meet president Uhuru Kenyatta before visiting British troops and a business school. A state dinner hosted by Mr Kenyatta will conclude the trip.

"President Trump has imposed tariffs on a range of Chinese goods US President Donald Trump has shaken the foundations of global trade, slapping steep tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods from the EU, Canada, Mexico and China. All these countries are responding in kind, retaliating with levies on thousands of US products. This puts the world's largest economies at each other's throats. But what is a trade war? How does protectionism work? And how will it all affect you? It's what it sounds like - a trade war is when countries try to attack each other's trade with taxes and quotas. One country will raise tariffs, a type of tax, causing the other to respond, in a tit-for-tat escalation. This can hurt other nations' economies and lead to rising political tensions between them. US President Donald Trump reckons trade wars are ""good"" and easy. He's not afraid to raise tariffs. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Four reasons Trump is hanging tough on trade It's a tax on a product made abroad. In theory, taxing items coming into the country means people are less likely to buy them as they become more expensive. The intention is that they buy cheaper local products instead - boosting your country's economy. The president has placed tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods from around the world, in particular China. He's imposed a 10% levy on $200bn (Â£150bn) worth of Chinese products so far. In May, he announcedplans to impose a 25% tariff on $325bn of other Chinese goods,external. Mr Trump said the $100bn gained from the tariffs will be used to buy US agricultural products, which will then be sent to ""poor and starving countries"" for ""humanitarian assistance"". He also wants to cut the trade deficit with China - a country he has accused of unfair trade practices since before he became president. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump made a big point on the campaign trail about cutting the country's trade deficits. He's convinced it hurts US manufacturing, and has said time and time again on the stump and on Twitter thatthe US must do more to tackle them,external. It's a term meaning the difference between how much your country buys from another country, compared with how much you sell to that country. And the US has a massive trade deficit with China. Last year,it widened by $43.6bn to $419.2bn. He wants to cut back this trade deficit, and he intends to use tariffs to do it. But while the president hates them, trade deficits are not necessarily a bad thing. Many wealthier countries have in recent decades shifted from manufacturing economies to service economies - focusing on areas like banking, travel and tourism. Reality Check: Is Trump right about US trade deficit? Services contribute to the majority of the US economy's net income. China, in contrast, doesn't export nearly as many services as it does manufactured goods. So the president's obsession with trade deficits is not always popular, with critics damning the administration's moves as protectionism. This video can not be played Trump constantly worries about the trade deficit - should we? Protectionism is trying to use restrictions such as tariffs to boost your country's industry, and shield it from foreign competition. Take Mr Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs. In May 2018, the president announceda 25% tariff on all steel imports, and 10% on aluminium. The Trump administration claims the US relies too much on other countries for its metals, and that it couldn't make enough weapons or vehicles using its own industry if a war broke out. Critics point out the US gets most of its steel from Canada and the EU - staunch US allies. In theory, taxing foreign steel and aluminium will mean US companies will buy local steel instead. The thinking is that will boost the US steel and aluminium industries, as more companies will want to buy their goods. Steel and aluminium prices will go up in the US because there will be less of these goods coming in from abroad - so the greater demand for local steel will push up the price, lifting profits for steel makers. Protectionism: What Trump has in common with Lincoln and Ferris Bueller The number of people employed in the US steel industry fell by almost 50,000 between 2000 and 2016 Sort of. US steel makers could get a boost - demand will drive new hires and bigger profits. But the US companies that need raw materials, like car and aeroplane makers, will see their costs rise. Could Trump tariffs damage US steel? Steel tariffs - what impact will they really have? That means they might have to put up the prices on their finished products. That would hurt consumers. So car prices could go up in the US. As could prices for gadgets, plane tickets and even beer - the price of making a can could rise. Making beer cans could become more pricey - and that cost could be pushed onto consumers They could affect people around the world - especially since China has retaliated. The world's second-largest economy has taxed US agricultural and industrial products, from soybeans, pork and cotton to aeroplanes, cars and steel pipes. It has also pledged to take ""necessary countermeasures"" over Trump's latest proposed tariffs. Charting the US-China trade battle How a US-China trade war could hurt us all In theory, China could also tax US tech companies like Apple. That would hit the tech giant, and it could be forced to raise its prices to compensate. A global trade war could hurt consumers around the world by making it harder for all companies to operate, forcing them to push higher prices onto their customers. Depends who you ask. Free trade is the opposite of protectionism - it means as few tariffs as possible, giving people the freedom to buy cheaper or better-made products from anywhere in the world. This is great for companies trying to cut costs, and that's helped drive prices down and boost the world economy. Free trade has led to a vast expansion of shipping and transfer of goods around the world Cars, smart phones, food, flowers - free trade has brought affordable products from around the world to your home. But at the same time, that means companies are less likely to buy local products. Why buy domestic when you can get more, cheaper, from a different country? This means the loss of jobs in wealthier countries, and uneven growth - while free trade has made some people richer, it's made others poorer. No idea. Historians have pointed out that tariffs often lead to higher costs for the consumer, while economists across the board are against the plans. The Republican Party is also overwhelmingly against Mr Trump on tariffs - they're big supporters of free trade. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Trump constantly worries about the trade deficit - should we? President Donald Trump haslashed out at his partners in the G7 group of leading rich economies following a summit in Canada. He wrote some highly critical tweets which appear to be a response to comments from the host, the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said that Canada would respond to new tariffs - taxes on imports - imposed by the US on steel and aluminium. President Trump's tweets complained about the defence spending of US allies (too low in his view) and the trade barriers they impose (too high). He also reminded the world that he is considering extra tariffs on imports of cars. So does he have a point? Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. On trade he mentioned the possibility of further tariffs on ""automobiles flooding the US market "". It is certainly true that the US imports more cars than it exports. Last year, the US exported 52 billion dollars' worth of passenger cars but imported more thanthree times that amount,external. It's also true that the US tariff on imported cars is relatively low - 2.5% compared to the EU's 10%, although Japan's are zero. But it's often possible to pick particular products to make a point about how unfair a particular country is. In the case of the US, you could take its tariffs of 25% on light vans. To get a better indication of how much a country protects its own industry it makes more sense to look at average tariffs.  There are several ways of calculating an average but the general picture that emerges is that the US has tariffs that are among the lowest.  Other rich countries do tend to have slightly higher averages, though not by very much. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If we pick out agriculture, then the developed countries, including the US, do generally have higher tariffs than for industrial goods. For farm trade the US averages are lower than other rich countries by a more significant margin. President Trump in one of his latest tweets complained about Canada's 270% tariff on dairy imports. Canada does indeed have a highly regulated and protected dairy sector and one of the tariffs (on a specific type of dairy product) listed in the World Trade Organization database is indeed precisely that. There are others that are in the same very high range. This video can not be played Dairy wars: Why is Trump threatening Canada over milk? But the levels of tariffs that countries impose are to a large extent the outcome of negotiated agreements - globally within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or between smaller groups of countries with trade deals such as the US, Canada and Mexico in the North American Trade Agreement (Nafta). That is why President Trump often criticises previous administrations over the trade deals they have done. He also often uses trade imbalances as evidence to demonstrate his view that the US is treated unfairly. It is indeed true that the US has a deficit with the rest of the world - it imports more than it exports, to the tune of about half a trillion dollars. President Trump gave a larger figure of $800 billion, which is the deficit for goods only. It's partly offset by a surplus in services. In any event most economists take the view that the trade balance is driven by savings and investment rather than trade policies. If a country saves less than it invests, it will have a trade deficit. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In another tweet, President Trump complained about the EU and Canada imposing what he called ""non-monetary trade barriers against the US"". All countries have them, usually known as non-tariff barriers, or NTBs. There is a wide range. They include regulatory restrictions for safety or environmental reasons, labelling rules and restrictions on who can provide certain services. Compared with tariffs, NTBs are much harder to quantify and compare. There is often a perfectly good reason for the rules, but they can also make it more difficult for suppliers in other countries and it is possible that in some cases that is the aim. To take some examples of NTBs in agriculture and food - and there are examples in many other areas too - US farm groups often complain that their products are excluded from the EU market by rules limiting the use of genetically modified crops, hormones in cattle and the now famous issue of chicken washed with chlorine. The US also has its own regulatory barriers, including for example restrictions on some offal and on cheese made from unpasteurized milk. Haggis and many European cheeses are excluded by these rules.

On defence, President Trump wrote ""....the U.S. pays close to the entire cost of NATO"". The US accounts for more than two thirds of all defence spending by Nato members. In terms of total defence spending, Nato has a guideline for its members - 2% of national income or GDP.  The US is one of only six countries that meet the target (the UK is another). Calling that ""close to the entire cost"" is perhaps a bit of an exaggeration, but there is no question that the US does carry far more than its share of the financial burden. He gave specific figures for the US (4% of GDP) and Germany (1%). The figures are correct but rounded to the nearest whole number. Accordingto Nato the figures,externalfor 2017 are 3.58% for the US and 1.22% for Germany. That's a large gap, although rounding the numbers makes it look even bigger. These figures refer to all defence spending. Spending onNato's own costs,externalis allocated in line with national GDP. The US pays 22.1% and Germany 14.8%. But this is a very small share of defence spending.  It makes more sense to focus on total budgets in this area. A Nato official put it like this: ""These national figures can be considered indirect contributions to NATO, because Allied armed forces contribute to our collective security.""
