It was their biggest ever margin of defeat in a home knockout game
in European competition. Real are the first reigning Champions
League winners to fail to qualify for the quarter-final stage since Chelsea in
2012-13. Read theTottenham match report here. Read theReal report here. Here is the best reaction... Real Madrid 1-4 Ajax (Agg: 3-5) Guillem BalagueSpanish football journalist on BBC Radio 5 live Just wait until the summer! There are big big problems at Real. One of the top players, one of the captains at Real, said that they only need to play well for four games a season to win the Champions League. That attitude in the long term is a massive problem. It's the worst defeat at home in their European history. There was resignation from the fans, they just went home without making any noise. They cannot compete in the market like they used to, they stopped getting Galacticos in 2014 and the squad is thinner and thinner. Who would you say is a superstar in this team? Everyone has disappointed. Gareth Bale did not start which is frustrating him big time but they do not see him as one of them. When he has been given the responsibility he hasn't shone but he won't shine if he's only given 15 or 20 minutes. Real Madrid 1-4 Ajax (Agg: 3-5) Alistair Bruce-BallBBC Radio 5 live commentator at Bloomfield Road It's a truly seismic result in terms of European football and possibly the end of an era. This Real team have won four of the last five Champions League and they have been humiliated on their own pitch. Real Madrid 1-4 Ajax (Agg: 3-5) David MoyesFormer Everton & Man Utd manager on BBC Radio 5 Live After their results, knowing they're not going to win the league and going out of the Copa del Rey, Real Madrid needed a result tonight but they have been well and truly beaten. It should have been more, you've got to give lots of praise to Ajax, but I think a lot of people will know be looking to see what's going to change at Real Madrid. It's probably the end of an era. They've been so good over the years but Cristiano Ronaldo left in the summer and now you might see Luka Modric or Toni Kroos leave. I don't know if you'd put Sergio Ramos in that position but it wouldn't surprise me if there was a complete change at Real Madrid. Real Madrid 1-4 Ajax (Agg: 3-5) Real Madrid boss Santiago Solari:""It's still a painful week, the fans have been spectacular, they've been supporting a difficult moment, they have not caught up with us. ""They are three times European champions, today we have been eliminated, it is a very sad moment and it puts in context what they have done before, it is very difficult to win. ""Without talking bad about any player, of course we missed the captain. ""Madrid always comes back and always comes back stronger."" Real Madrid 1-4 Ajax (Agg: 3-5) Ajax coach Erik ten Hag: ""This was pretty close to perfection. Over the two matches we definitely deserve to progress to the next round. I enjoyed watching my team immensely this evening. âLetâs not forget that we started in the qualifying rounds. But we are still in the running for three prizes, and we want to win them all. I have no influence on the draw, so Iâm not going to think about it. All the possible opponents are big teams. But so were Real Madrid.â England 2-0 Japan What a start for Phil Neville's side! They are 2-0 up already. You can follow and watchhere. Real Madrid 1-4 Ajax (Agg: 3-5) Real Madrid defender Nacho- who was sent off: âWeâre devastated. Itâs very complicated. Weâre not used to being at this stage of a season with practically no title left to play for. ""La Ligaâs practically impossible, weâre out of the Copa and the Champions League. Itâs tough.â Spurs fans, you've got a bit of a wait. The draw for the Champions League quarter finals takes place on 15 March. Borussia Dortmund 0-1 Tottenham (Agg: 0-4) Chris WaddleEx-Tottenham and England winger on BBC Radio 5 Live Tottenham can play different systems and I think it's great when you've got that. They can change, they've got quality players who understand the game. People will say Tottenham are not going to win the Champions League but you never know. You don't know whether the draw's going to be kind, and if they can play the way they can play, they can go a long way. Borussia Dortmund 0-1 Tottenham (Agg: 0-4) David MoyesFormer Everton & Man Utd manager on BBC Radio 5 Live It's a great achievement for Tottenham to get to the quarter-finals. If the draw's kind to them... If Paris St-Germain, Barcelona and Man City go through, I would put them as favourites above Tottenham. But Tottenham have got some good young players and they're waiting on Dele Alli to come back as well so I think they could finish strong. Just a reminder of how things looked for Tottenham halfway through the group stage afterdrawing 2-2 at PSV Eindhoven. Mauricio Pochettino said that his side's chances of reaching the knockout stageswere ""nearly over"".Now look at them! Real Madrid 1-4 Ajax (Agg: 3-5) Ajax forward Dusan Tadic: ""This is probably the best game of football Iâve ever played. We beat the best club in the world. ""Iâm very proud and I think we made a lot of people happy. In football you just have to relax and enjoy your game.â BBC Radio 5 live Marcel van der Crane, journalist at the Telegraaf in the Netherlands, speaking on 5 Live Final Score: ""Our top three clubs (in the Netherlands) every year lose all their best players. ""It is something we cannot stop. ""Marc Overmars, the technical director of Ajax, the former Arsenal winger, was explaining today that Gareth Bale, on his own, has exactly the same in wage package per season as the entire Ajax squad. ""Well that really sums it up, it just means that the players go for a bigger package."" Real Madrid 1-4 Ajax (Agg: 3-5) Real Madrid defender Dani Carvajal:""I do not see the end of the cycle, we have a young team and the margin for improvement is enormous, we have to face and not hide, we have had a #'$Â£@## season."" Borussia Dortmund 0-1 Tottenham (Agg: 0-4) Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino speaking to BT Sport: ""We are in the quarter-finals. I'm so happy for the players, and the fans. It's an important victory. Of course we suffered a bit but it's ok and we fully deserved to be to be in the quarter-final. ""Hugo Lloris was great. We conceded more chances than we expected but that's football. After losing in the first leg they had nothing to lose. ""It's tough but overall, the objective was to be in the quarter-final and we are there. ""In the last 10 minutes of the first half it was difficult for us. They started to play a little but more and then in the first action when we were able to connect we managed to score the goal. ""Now it's about enjoying that we are in the quarter-final. We need to feel proud. The experience is so important to improve and get better. There's a lot of things we can take from this type of game to make us a better team."" Andy WestSpanish football writer Girona, Alaves, CSKA Moscow, Levante, Real Sociedad, Leganes, Eibar, Ajax, BarÃ§a, Atleti have all beaten Real Madrid this season. They're clearly not a very good team. Question is...why? Players? Coach? Attitude? Combination of the above? Real Madrid 1-4 Ajax (Agg: 3-5) David MoyesFormer Everton & Man Utd manager on BBC Radio 5 Live Real Madrid are a lot of goals down on last season and that's because of Cristiano Ronaldo's exit but I still don't think you expect to go to the Bernabeu and win the way teams are doing it at the moment. 'The Galacticos' title Real Madrid had is not there at the moment, that's for sure, but they've got a really strong president and they're a massive club, so I'm sure they're already thinking about how they rebuild and get back to where they've been. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Now can Man Utd do to Paris St-Germain what Ajax have just done to Real Madrid?

"Harry Kane scored his 24th goal in Europe for Tottenham Tottenham eased past Borussia Dortmund to reach the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since 2011 as Harry Kane became the club's top scorer in European competition. Leading 3-0 from the first leg, Spurs were forced to survive a first-half barrage from the Bundesliga leaders in the crackling atmosphere of the Westfalenstadion. But Kane's intervention just after half-time ensured a comfortable second period in which the hosts failed to register a shot on target. Latching on to Moussa Sissoko's pass, the England captain clinically lifted the ball past home goalkeeper Roman Burki into the right corner. It was Kane's first effort on goal and confirmed a 4-0 aggregate win for a Tottenham side that defended resolutely throughout. Kane's 24th European goal moves him one clear of the club record he previously shared with Jermain Defoe. The draw for the quarter-finals takes place on Friday, 15 March. New Tottenham stadium could stage quarter-final, says Pochettino Football Daily podcast: Real Madrid crash out but Spurs progress Reaction to Tuesday's Champions League action Mauricio Pochettino's Spurs side have kept just one clean sheet in the Premier League in 2019, but they looked solid in Germany after deploying the same three-man defence that helped them to a commanding first-leg lead. Jan Vertonghen's 10th-minute tackle on Marco Reus exemplified their early resolve. Timing his challenge to perfection, the Belgian nipped the ball away from the Dortmund attacker who had broken clear inside the area. When Dortmund did break through, Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris made brilliant saves from Reus, Julian Weigl Mario Gotze and Jadon Sancho, while Weigl was denied a second time by a superb Ben Davies block. Dortmund bombarded Lloris' goal with five shots on target in the latter stages of the opening half, but Tottenham carried a threat on the break with the pace and movement of Son Heung-min and Kane. Son clipped an effort just wide of the left post before Kane's clinical finish inflicted a first home defeat on Dortmund under manager Lucien Favre. It also ensured only Tottenham's third appearance in the last eight of the competition. Despite a strong first-half showing in which they monopolised possession and chances on goal, it proved a disappointing evening for Dortmund. Former Borussia Monchengladbach and Nice coach Favre has taken the club back to the top of the Bundesliga as they aim for their first league title since 2012. However, their attacking threat was blunted by a strong Tottenham defence with centre-forward Paco Alcacer managing just 27 touches during the game. That impacted on Dortmund's other attackers, particularly after the break, with the likes of England winger Jadon Sancho struggling to make an impact as a result. With no central thrust to the Germans' play, the 18-year-old - who has registered nine goals this term - was shackled throughout and snatched at his only shot on target. With just five touches in the Tottenham penalty area, Sancho was unable to influence the game in the final third. Instead he was restricted to the middle of the pitch where he was well marshalled by a combination of Davies and Harry Winks. Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was in superb form for Tottenham, making seven saves Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BT Sport:""We are in the quarter-finals. I'm so happy for the players and the fans. It's an important victory. Of course we suffered a bit but it's OK and we fully deserve to be in the quarter-finals. ""Hugo Lloris was great. We conceded more chances than we expected but that's football. After losing in the first leg they had nothing to lose. ""In the last 10 minutes of the first half it was difficult for us. They started to play a little bit more and then in the first action, when we were able to connect, we managed to score the goal. ""Now it's about enjoying that we are in the quarter-finals. We need to feel proud."" Tottenham have qualified for the quarter-finals of the Champions League for just the second time in the club's history, last doing so back in 2010-11. Dortmund have now been eliminated at the last-16 stage of the Champions League on two of the last three occasions they have reached this stage (also in 2014-15 v Juventus). Tottenham have beaten Dortmund in each of their four Champions League meetings, meaning the German side have become the fourth side in the competition's history to lose each of their opening four such matches against a single English side (also Olympiakos v Manchester United, SK Sturm Graz v Manchester United and Sparta Prague v Arsenal). Having lost just two of their first 12 home European contests against English sides (W6 D4 L2), Borussia Dortmund have now lost back-to-back such matches (both against Spurs). 12 of Tottenham's 13 goals in the Champions League this season have come in the second-half (92%). Harry Kane's opener for Tottenham made him their highest goalscorer in European competition in the club's history (24). Kane is just the second Englishman to score at least five goals in multiple Champions League campaigns after Steven Gerrard, who did so in 2007-08 and 2008-09. Tottenham resume their Premier League duties when they travel to Southampton on Saturday (15:00 GMT).

"Kylie Jenner is the youngest self-made billionaire of all time Kylie Jenner has become the world's youngest self-made billionaire, according to Forbes billionaires' list. The youngest Kardashian family member is making her fortune from her best-selling cosmetics business. The 21-year-old founded and owns Kylie Cosmetics, the three-year-old beauty business that generated an estimated $360m in sales last year. She reached the milestone earlier than Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg who became a billionaire aged 23. ""I didn't expect anything. I did not foresee the future. ""But [the recognition] feels really good. That's a nice pat on the back,"" Ms Jenner told Forbes. What does it take to be a billionaire? How a reality TV teen became a beauty giant The list shows,externalAmazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, remains the world's richest man. His fortune totals $131bn, according to Forbes, up $19bn from 2018. But the billionaires' combined worth is down from $9.1 trillion at $8.7tn. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's wealth is among those falling. It has dropped by $8.7bn (Â£6.6bn) in the past year to $62.3bn, according to the Forbes list. His shares in Facebook at one point lost a third of their value as the company battled privacy scandals. Amazon's share price has been good for Mr Bezos' bank balance and the gap between him and the number two, Bill Gates, is a little wider, even though Mr Gates' fortune has swelled to $96.5bn from $90bn last year. Of all the billionaires on the list only 252 are women, and the richest self-made woman is real estate mogul Wu Yajun of China, worth an estimated $9.4bn. The number of self-made women reached 72 for the first time, up from 56 a year ago. Jeff Bezos - still number one and getting richer The Forbes billionaires list is a snapshot of wealth taken on 8 February 2019. The magazine uses that day's stock prices and exchange rates from around the world. According to Forbes there are fewer billionaires around - 2,153 of them on the 2019 list, down from 2,208 in 2018. This, in part, explains why their average net worth is $4bn, down from $4.1bn. Forbes also found that 994 of them are less well off than a year ago. Luisa Kroll, assistant managing editor of wealth at Forbes, said: ""Even with strong headwinds, resourceful and relentless entrepreneurs find new ways to get rich."" There are 52 UK citizens on the list. At the top are the Hinduja brothers, Srichand and Gopichand, who control the Hinduja Group conglomerate, with a net worth of $16.9bn. Behind them, ranked as the wealthiest single individual in the UK, is James Ratcliffe, founder of the chemical group Ineos, and worth $12.1bn. Jim Ratcliffe owns 60% of Ineos, the chemicals company he founded Another newcomer is Safra Catz co-chief executive of software firm Oracle, who according to Forbes earns a $41m salary and ranks as one of the world's highest paid female executives. Facebook's share price fall has cut Mark Zuckerberg's wealth The US has 607 billionaires, more than any other country. China has the next largest number with 324. But the list of Chinese billionaires has seen some big changes - it has 44 newcomers to the list while 102 have dropped off. The weakness of the euro has not been kind to European billionaires who make a poor showing with only two in the top 20: Bernard Arnault (ranked 4th), the chief executive of the French luxury goods company LVMH, and Amancio Ortega (ranked 6th), who founded retail group Inditex which owns brands such as Zara. Forbes said 247 people who were on the billionaires list last year have now dropped off. Among them are Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, fashion designers and co-founders of Dolce & Gabbana. The group chairman of supply chain management company Li & Fung, Victor Fung, is also no longer classed as a billionaire by Forbes, after being on the list for 18 years in a row.

"Ms Onasanya was convicted in January at the Old Bailey An MP jailed for lying about a speeding offence has lost an appeal against her conviction. Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya wassentenced to three monthsin January for perverting the course of justice. Sir Brian Leveson said at the Royal Courts of Justice there was ""absolutely no basis"" for the challenge. Commons Speaker John Bercow has begun a recall petition process which could lead to Ms Onasanya's removal as an MP, with a by-election held to replace her. Ms Onasanya, 35, had claimed someone else was driving her car when it was seen speeding on 24 July 2017. The MP's Nissan Micra was clocked doing 41mph in a 30mph zone in Thorney, Cambridgeshire. The MP's Nissan Micra was caught by a speed camera in Thorney Representing herself, Ms Onasanya said: ""The charge against me was perverting the course of justice. I said from the outset, and I still maintain my innocence, that I did not do that."" Rejecting the appeal bid, Sir Brian said: ""This applicant was tried fairly by a jury, who rejected her evidence on oath. ""There was no error of law in the approach of the judge, whose directions... were clear and accurate, nor was there any other irregularity with the trial. ""It is a tragedy that she has damaged, probably irreparably, a promising political career, but there is absolutely no basis for challenging her conviction."" MP convicted of speeding driver lie MP jailed over speeding driver lie Jailed MP to appeal against conviction Addressing MPs in the House of Commons, Mr Bercow said the decision triggered the provision of the Recall of MPs Act 2015. ""I will accordingly be writing to the relevant petition officer to inform that person that Fiona Onasanya is therefore subject to a recall petition process,"" he said. This means a six-week petition will be open for Ms Onasanya's constituents. If 10% of them - about 7,000 people - sign the petition, a by-election will be held for the seat. Fiona Onasanya served less than four weeks at Bronzefield Prison in Surrey and was released on 26 February Ms Onasanya served less than four weeks at Bronzefield Prison in Surrey and was released on 26 February. The day before, the attorney general's office had concluded her sentencewas not unduly lenient. Jurors at the Old Bailey were told she colluded with her brother Festus, 34, who was jailed for 10 months after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice. Ms Onasanya stepped down as a party whip in November and was expelled from the Labour partyfollowing her conviction, when she became the first sitting MP for nearly three decades to be jailed. But she did not give up her Peterborough seat, a move which would have triggered a by-election. A Labour spokesman repeated the party's call for her to ""do the decent thing"" and stand down. ""If she refuses to stand down, Labour will actively support local residents in their efforts to trigger a by-election through a recall petition,"" he said.

"Five new houses belonging to McCarthy and Stone were damaged A builder who caused nearly Â£1m in damage when he wrecked five newly built houses with a digger has been jailed. Daniel Neagu, 31, filmed himself and whooped in delight as he destroyed the properties in a dispute over wages. The 31-year-old of Harrow, north-west London had admitted criminal damage to the homes in Buntingford, Hertfordshire, on 11 August. Sentencing Neagu to four years, Judge Stephen Warner said the ""wanton vandalism"" was a ""pure act of revenge"". Daniel Neagu destroyed the five houses using a digger The retirement homes - valued at between Â£425,000 and Â£475,000 - had to be fully rebuilt by McCarthy & Stone Retirement Living at a cost of nearly Â£1m. St Albans Crown Court heard former plant operator Neagu claimed his firm was owed Â£16,000 in unpaid wages by a subcontractor, Fenton, meaning he could not pay his team. Fentons had withheld the money because one of its vehicles, which was fitted with a tracker, was found to be in Neagu's native Romania. He said he would return it when he was paid, the court heard. The homes were part of a retirement complex Judge Warner said the footage of Neagu destroying the buildings while singing and whistling - was ""truly shocking"". ""You were perfectly relaxed and not ashamed. This was planned, deliberate and wanton vandalism involving the destruction of other people's property undertaken by you as a pure act of revenge,"" he said. The homes were on Ermine Street, Buntingford When neighbours called the police, Neagu told them: ""They haven't paid me. I decided even if I got into trouble I did it for a reason... I wanted to give them a lesson."" In police interviews he said he was ""helpless, angry, disappointed and scared"" because he did not have money to pay his staff, and claimed he and his family had been threatened. When he was charged, he said: ""I did it because they owed me money and I thought it was more healthy for me to be inside rather than outside.""

"EasyJet has come top of the league for airlines trying to cut carbon emissions to tackle climate change. A report,externalsuggests that by 2020 its emissions per passenger kilometre will be less than half that of some rivals. The firm's performance is partly down to its modern, efficient fleet and its push to fill every seat. Companies named as having the weakest plans to cut emissions are Air China; China Southern; Korean Air; Singapore Airlines and Turkish Airlines. Aviation industry agrees emissions deal How dirty is jet travel? EU compromise on plane CO2 emissions EasyJet's aircraft are expected to be emitting 75g of CO2 per passenger km by 2020, compared with 172g for Korean Air. International Airlines Group (IAG), which includes British Airways, is expected to emit 112g. The industry has volunteered to freeze its overall emissions by 2020, and halve emissions by 2050. This is a more generous target than those given to other industrial sectors, but the report says only EasyJet is meeting those aviation targets so far. The report from the London School of Economics is backed by a group of institutional investors, the Environment Agency Pension Fund. It is anxious for their funds to support firms committed to reducing emissions. Faith Ward from the fund said: ""Investors have a clear message to the aviation sector: when it comes to carbon performance, they must be in it for the long haul. ""That means setting stretching emissions reduction targets to 2030 and beyond. It's clear this is not currently the case."" The investors also complain that the airlines are trying to achieve their targets using the controversial process of offsetting â where firms plants trees to compensate for their own CO2 emissions. ""Offsetting is no substitute for a clear strategy to reduce emissions,"" Ms Ward said. Aviation creates 12% of transport-related emissions. The industry body ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) told BBC News it couldn't comment on individual airlines, but said the industry's carbon-cutting plans were ""on track"". Aviation has been given easier targets than other industrial sectors because although aircraft are becoming more efficient, this trend has been overwhelmed the by the relentless increase in people wanting to fly. Some caveats must be applied to the LSE research. First, it doesnât take into account that some airlines allow much more baggage than others, which alter the notional weight per passenger and thus their CO2 tally. There is also some cause for caution over EasyJet's carbon virtue. Remember that the figures are based on CO2per passenger kilometre. This means EasyJet can improve its per capita performance by stuffing planes with cut-price ticket-holders, thereby potentially encouraging a new generation of frequent flyers. Korean Air told us the calculation method for the assessment didn't take into account that it and Singapore Airlines tend to carry more freight than average airlines - and this increases their carbon emissions.

"The Farnborough International Airshow usually hosts a two-day public weekend, but organisers said its popularity had dwindled The Farnborough International Airshow will no longer host a public weekend after ""negative and vitriolic"" feedback for displays, it has been announced. Organisers said the Shoreham air crash had ""expedited"" the decision, which comes amid a ""dwindling number"" of spectators. A spokeswoman said organisers could ""no longer provide an airshow the public want"". The event will focus on its five-day trade show. The Farnborough Airshow will still include trade flying displays when the biennial event takes place in July 2020. In a statement, organisers said the exhibition halls would be open to the public on the Friday of the airshow, while it would ""focus on inspiring the next generation and showcasing the technologies driving new products and manufacturing processes"". Spokeswoman Mary Kearney said the airshow appreciated the affection plane lovers had for the public weekend, but it received ""very negative and vitriolic feedback from 2018"". She added the effects that the Shoreham air crash had on air displays ""certainly had an impact"" and ""expedited this decision"".

"Jodie Chesney was the fifth teenager to be stabbed to death in London this year A man has been arrested in connection with the murder of a 17-year-old girl who was stabbed to death in a park in east London. Jodie Chesney was attacked while playing music in a park with friends in Harold Hill on Friday. Police said a 20-year-old man had been arrested in Leicester and taken into custody in the capital. Officers previously said two men walked up to the groupand one knifed Jodie once in the back. She was pronounced dead just over an hour after police were called to the park at 21:25 GMT. People have been laying flowers near the entrance to the park Jodie was the fifth teenager to be stabbed to death in the capital so far this year. Former classmates described her as a ""bundle of joy and such a good person"" and said she was ""so beautiful - inside and out"". One said: ""She was kind, wouldn't hurt anyone and would do anything to make anyone happy."" London killings: All the victims of 2018 London train station murder victim named Can knife crime be stopped before it starts? Jodie's family issued appeals on social media for witnesses to come forward, as well as backing action to tackle knife crime. Relative Karen Chesney urged people to sign a petition calling for 25 years for using knives, and 10 years for carrying them. It has been signed more than 33,000 times, and will be considered for debate by MPs in Parliament if it passes 100,000 signatures.

"This video can not be played The teenager's story was shared widely online in December 2018 A teenager who made headlines for getting vaccinated despite his family's wishes has testified about his experience to US lawmakers. Ethan Lindenberger, from Ohio, sought immunisations aged 18 after turning to the internet for advice. Federal data suggeststhe proportion of US children under two not being immunised has quadrupled since 2001.,external Doctors at the hearing blamed online misinformation and discredited science for scaring parents away from vaccines. Mr Lindenberger, who is still a senior in high school, spoke on Tuesday at the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions alongside four doctors who are experts in the field. He said much of his mother's opposition to routine vaccines came from fear they could cause side-effects like brain damage or autism. In 1998, a study by a British doctor Andrew Wakefield incorrectly linked the MMR (Measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine to autism. His research has since been completely discredited and Mr Wakefield has been struck off - but the theory has endured within the global anti-vaccination community. Measles resurgence 'due to vaccine hesitancy' 'Don't be taken in by social media vaccine myths' Russian trolls 'spreading vaccine misinformation' All four doctors at Tuesday's hearing echoed that there was ""absolutely no evidence"" that exists which supports the link. This is also affirmed in new Danish research released on Tuesday.The study examined 650,000 children over 10 years,externaland categorically concludes that MMR does not increase the risk of autism or trigger it in those susceptible. Mr Lindenbenger, doctors and members of Congress at the hearing all pointed out the internet fuels the spread of misinformation. ""My mother would turn to anti-vax groups online and social media rather than health officials and critical sources,"" the teenager told the hearing. He also pointed out his mother's decision had come from concern, not malice. ""There's a lot of emotional appeals talking about families, children and appealing to a parent's love, and manipulating that to convince them vaccines are dangerous,"" he told the hearing about the nature of online posts. ""That's the issue I take. I have tried to convey to my parents I don't think they are stupid for believing that, but people are very convincing and that's very dangerous."" Some anti-vaccination advocates also attended the hearing Mr Lindenberger's story went viral in late 2018when he asked online forum Reddit about the subject. At one point during Tuesday's hearing, Republican Senator Johnny Isakson joked that he would ""love"" to be a guest at the Linderberger family home for Thanksgiving dinner. ""Would be a heck of a discussion everybody would have,"" he said about the family's public disagreement. Health experts have long warned about the risk posed by parents who do not vaccinate. They say the decision affects not only their families but everyone else because high vaccination rates are integral to keep communities protected. This concept, which is known as herd immunity, offers protection for people like newborns and people with auto-immune diseases who are not able to be vaccinated. The US has been battling a number of outbreaks of preventable diseases in recent years. Senator Patty Murray, from Washington state, spoke at the hearing about a recent measles outbreak in her local Clark County where 70 cases have been confirmed. Less than 80% of nursery-age children were immunised there in 2017 - well below the target rate of about 95% for herd immunity. This video can not be played There have also been outbreaks of measles in Europe At Tuesday's hearing, doctors implored the federal government to increase funding for vaccine education. They also asked state lawmakers to increase limits on non-medical vaccination exemptions for parents. California is one state that has already cracked down on exemptions, following an outbreak of measles linked to Disneyland in 2015. Similar outbreaks are not isolated to the US - there have been increases recorded elsewhere around the world. In 2018,Europe saw three times more measles case than the year before. The World Health Organisation (WHO) have blamed growing vaccine hesitancy for the outbreaks. ""Industrialised countries must not be complacent and forget that the disease can come back like a storm,"" WHO's Dr Martin Friede told the BBC after the data was released.

"Hospitals are likely to experience delays to cancer testing and treatment regardless of the result of next week's Brexit vote, BBC Newsnight has learned. The Royal College of Radiologists has told doctors to prepare for possible delays for some drugs used to detect cancer if there is a no-deal Brexit. It says clinicians should reduce their workload in the days after 29 March, when the UK is due to leave the EU. The government said it had ""robust"" plans for however the UK leaves the EU. MPs will vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement by 12 March. If Parliament does not vote in favour of her deal and there is no extension of Article 50 - the two-year process for leaving the EU - the UK will leave with no withdrawal agreement, known as a no-deal Brexit. No-deal Brexit: Should patients worry? Six key questions Brexit poses for the NHS NHS 'not prepared' for no-deal Brexit The five-page guidance to doctors from the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR), seen by Newsnight, warns that some radiopharmaceutical suppliers ""anticipate there may be some delay to their delivery times"". It advises clinicians to: ""Keep [your] workload lighter for the first week following a no-deal Brexit, in order to see more clearly what the impact is likely to be."" It adds: ""In the weeks leading up to Brexit you should consider how to prioritise requests based on clinical need, should supplies be compromised."" The guidance refers to the radioisotopes commonly used in the diagnosis and treatment of some cancers. These cannot be stockpiled in advance because of the rapid decay of their radioactivity and ""a one-day delay to delivery would reduce available activity by approximately 20%"", according to the guidance from the RCR. A spokesman for the RCR told Newsnight the organisation now believed it was ""inevitable"" that uncertainty over Brexit would cause delays to some cancer tests and treatments. Dr Richard Graham said: ""Of course, now there will inevitably be delays to treatment as a result of the Brexit process because we need to start booking our lists for the post-Brexit date. ""We will need to book clinics less heavily so that we've got more wriggle room if we don't have the radioisotopes in order to diagnose and treat the patients."" Dr Graham said the RCR had met with the Department of Health and Social Care several months ago ""when they were very optimistic that there would be a deal"" and that the guidance would not be necessary. ""But unfortunately now it looks like no deal really is a tangible possibility, so it's vital that we get this guidance out now so patients treatment and diagnosis is disrupted at the bare minimum."" Dr Graham said it would have been ""much easier"" for medics if they had known that a no-deal Brexit was not going to happen. ""But of course we understand that might be a negotiating strategy to get the best deal for the country. ""Putting patients' health at risk for the sake of getting a good Brexit deal is a difficult priority to balance."" The Department of Health and Social Care has asked radiopharmaceutical suppliers to use air freight in the event of a no-deal Brexit, as that is expected to cause road disruption. But the guidance states that ""some companies feel their plans will ensure no delays but others anticipate there may be some delay to their delivery times"". And on one specific type of treatment, known as radionuclide therapy, it states that ""only one supplier has been confident it will be able to deliver therapy doses on particular required days"". The radiologists' warning that it is now too late to escape some disruption - even if Mrs May secures majority Parliamentary support for her withdrawal agreement - follows similar statements from other sectors. UK-based financial firms have already had to establish offices elsewhere in the EU in case they suddenly find themselves unable to service European clients from 29 March. And surveys show that stockpiling by manufacturing firms is at the highest level on record due to the fear of a no-deal Brexit. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Leaving the EU with a deal remains the government's top priority. ""As a responsible government we have robust contingency plans in place so patients can continue to have access to medicines, including medical radioisotopes, whatever the EU Exit outcome. ""We have worked with the pharmaceutical industry to ensure that planes are contracted to bring in medical radioisotopes under the appropriate specialist conditions and suppliers are working closely with the NHS to minimise any potential impact of changes to delivery times.""

"This video can not be played Toyota Europe boss in stark no-deal Brexit warning Car giants Toyota and BMW have both warned a no-deal Brexit threatens the production of their cars in the UK. BMWtold Sky News,externalit could consider moving production of its Mini from the UK in a no-deal scenario. Separately, the head of Toyota's European operations said a negative outcome could put future investment at its UK factory near Derby at risk. Johan van Zyl told the BBC that if the Brexit ""hurdles"" are too high it would undermine Toyota's competitiveness. Speaking to Sky News, BMW board member Peter Schwarzenbauer said if a ""worst case"" no-deal scenario happened, ""we would need to consider what it exactly means for us in the long run"". ""For Mini, this is really a danger,"" he added. Asked if BMW could move Mini production out of Cowley near Oxford, he said: ""We at least have to consider it."" Earlier, BMW chief executive Harold Krueger told the BBC that the carmaker was preparing ""for a lot of scenarios"" and was ""very flexible"" in its approach to production. He said the company had ""reserved some air flight capacity for the transportation of bigger materials"" and had prepared its suppliers. ""The logistics network is very flexible to adjust to changes,"" he said. This video can not be played How British is a Mini? The warnings come after Japanese rivals Nissan and Honda both recently dealt major blows to the UK motor industry. Last month,Nissan reversed a decision to build a new car in the UK, andHonda said it was closing its Swindon plant, although both cited non-Brexit reasons. The world's fastest road car revealed - and it's electric Car industry revs up for an electrified motor show The motor industry has become increasingly outspoken on the consequences of a no-deal as the 29 March approaches. Aston Martin's chief executive Andy Palmer this week warned of""a bloodbath"" for the industry. Ford warned thatleaving without a deal would be ""catastrophic""and the body that represents the UK motor industry, the SMMT said investment had already been hit. The firm employs 2,500 people at the Burnaston plant Like many other car industry executives, Mr van Zyl said it was vital that there was frictionless trade with the European Union. Speaking at the Geneva Motor Show, he said: ""We want a regulatory framework between the UK and EU which is the same. We hope still that that can be the outcome."" But he admitted that, with just over three weeks before the UK is due to leave the EU, ""we thought that by now we would have had a decision already about what is going to happen"". He said Toyota would overcome any short-term problems at its Burnaston car plant near Derby, such as logistics, caused by leaving without a deal. But preparation for no-deal has been costly, he said, and in the long term things could be ""very difficult"". Could work at Burnaston dry up after the current production cycle comes to an end? ""The long term effect could be that if it [Brexit] is very negative, that outcome is possible."" Constantly improving competitiveness is vital, he said, adding: ""But if the hurdles are becoming so high that you cannot achieve it then of course you can't avoid it [hitting investment]."" The Brexit uncertainty comes after a Â£240m investment in a new Corolla and the ramping up of production at Burnaston. ""It's critical that we don't have any disruptions in the production process,"" Mr van Zyl said. ""So the next week or two is going to be critical.""

"This video can not be played Baroness Warsi on Theresa May: ""She doesn't listen, she fails to acknowledge when there is a problem."" Theresa May has been accused of ""burying her head in the sand"" over Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. Former party chairwoman Baroness Warsi said the PM had failed to ""acknowledge"" or ""tackle"" the problem and this was ""symptomatic"" of her wider leadership. Shortly after her comments, the party said 14 members had been suspended for Islamophobic Facebook posts. The Conservatives said ""decisive action"" would be taken against anyone making offensive remarks. The suspensions followed messages posted on a Facebook group called the ""Jacob Rees-Mogg Supporters Group"". The page was not affiliated with the MP or the party as a whole but Conservative members identified as using it have been suspended pending an investigation. ""When we find evidence of members making offensive or inappropriate comments, we consistently take decisive action,"" a spokesman said. But Baroness Warsi, who was the UK's first female Muslim cabinet minister, has said her party had ""turned a blind eye"" to prejudice and become ""institutionally Islamophobic"". She suggested the ""rot had set in"" several years ago and accused senior party officials of being ""in denial"" and presiding over an ""opaque"" complaints process. Falconer pressured over anti-Semitism role Tory peer calls for Islamophobia inquiry In a personal attack on the prime minister, she said Mrs May had ""failed to tackle the problem head on"". ""She doesn't listen, she fails to acknowledge when there is a problem. It's probably symptomatic of the way in which her leadership has dealt with other matters. ""Burying your head in the sand is not going to make problems go away."" She said efforts to modernise the party had ""gone into reverse"" since Mrs May succeeded David Cameron as leader, but she ruled out quitting the party, as others have done. ""If my party's going though a process of 're-UKIPification' of itself, then it's my job to stand within that party and fight to bring it back to the centre ground."" This video can not be played Conservative deputy chairman James Cleverly âWhen something happens, we take immediate actionâ She has written to the party's chief executive Sir Mick Davis urging him to ""show leadership"" on the issue, because, she said, Mrs May and party chairman Brandon Lewis had not. She said Sir Mick, a former chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, had a ""long history of fighting bigotry"" and was ""uniquely placed to understand consequences of unchecked hate"". This video can not be played Conservative MP Henry Smith MP says he has ""never come across"" Islamophobia in his party Baroness Warsi has been warning about anti-Muslim prejudice in the party for years. Her latest intervention follows a row over former candidate Peter Lamb, who was was due to stand in the Staple Tye ward, in Harlow, Essex, in May's local elections and had previously stood in the Toddbrook ward. Mr Lamb was disciplined by the party after it emerged that he had posted a message on Twitter in 2015, saying ""Islam like alcoholism [sic]"" and ""the first step to recovery is admit you have a problem"". Later in the same year, he tweeted: ""Turkey buys oil from ISIS. Muslims sticking together,"" adding: ""Do they want us to call ISIS Daesh now so that we don't associate them with Islam?"" Mr Lamb was reinstated as a candidate but local party sources said he had quit the party earlier on Tuesday, following the row about his comments. In a statement on Twitter, he apologised for the remarks, saying they were ""aimed at the extremists that have hijacked Islam and are cowardly hiding behind the religion"". Justice Secretary David Gauke rejected suggestions the party had ignored warnings on the issue. ""Where there is evidence, we take action, as a political party should. ""Whether it is Islamophobia or whether it is anti-Semitism, there is an obligation on political parties to take action and address it. ""That is what the Conservative Party does and will continue to do. So I don't accept that criticism."" But the Muslim Council of Britain said the level of prejudice within the party was ""astonishing"" and the claims should be independently investigated. ""We've seen MPs, councillors and members engage in bigotry that should have no place in a modern Conservative Party,"" a spokesman said. ""Yet the constructive call by Muslim communities for an independent inquiry into the issue has been ignored again and again. Instead we hear excuses, denials and the responses we would expect when there is an institutional problem.""

"David Sterling said cross-border trade could be a ""serious dilemma"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit Northern Ireland's chief civil servant has warned a no-deal Brexit could have ""grave"" consequences for the region. In a letter to Stormont's political parties, David Sterling comes close to suggesting there may have to be some hardening of the Irish border. He refers to a ""serious dilemma"" in finding a solution for trading agri-food products with the Irish Republic. A no-deal exit could have a ""profound and long-lasting impact"" on society in Northern Ireland, he added. Brexit: A really simple guide Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: Your questions answered Some of the content is similar to aletter Mr Sterling sent to Whitehall departments in December. But in some areas the language has been toughened including a warning of a ""sharp increase in unemployment"". The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March. Brexit talks arecontinuing in Brussels to reach a breakthrough on the backstop. It is the insurance policy to maintain an open Irish border unless and until another solution is found. The most significant part of Mr Sterling's letter is a section dealing with cross-border trade. He writes that in event of no deal agri-food products from Northern Ireland could only continue to enter the Republic of Ireland if arrangements were put in place to collect tariffs and ""fulfil other regulatory obligations"". If new controls are not in place Mr Sterling said there would be no ""legal basis"" for this trade. He said this dilemma could only be resolved by a ""material shift in the fundamental position, including the statutory obligations, of one or more of the authorities"". In effect this means that unless the EU waived its usual rules, Northern Ireland produce would not be able to enter the Republic. Ireland and the EU: A special case What does Ireland do if there's no deal? The EU normally requires that food products from countries with which it does not have a deal have to enter through a border inspection post. The letter continues: ""In effect, there is currently no mitigation available for the severe consequences of a no-deal outcome. ""These consequences do not arise from the possibility of checks or controls on either side of the land border, but would simply be the direct consequence of the legal position that would apply."" Democratic Unionist Party MP (DUP) Gavin Robinson said the civil service plans for dealing with Brexit ""should be taken forward by a functioning"" devolved government at Stormont. The Northern Ireland Executive collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter split between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. ""Sinn FÃ©in walked away and like so many other areas they seem to prefer standing on the sidelines rather than engage in anything positive or productive,"" said Mr Robinson. Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said the letter outlined how ""catastrophic"" a no-deal Brexit would be. And she said the DUP should ""start listening"" to the civil service and business and farming groups ""who are all warning about the disastrous impact"".

This video can not be played ""Difficult discussions"" with the EU and UK if there is a no-deal Brexit, Irish PM says Mr Sterling's letter comes as the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) announced that the Republic of Ireland would have to have ""difficult discussions"" with the EU and UK if there was a no-deal Brexit.

Speaking at leaders' questions, Mr Varadkar said the Irish government had still made no plans for physical infrastructure on the Irish border, under any scenario. But he added: ""If we do end up with no deal in a few weeks' time, we will have to have difficult discussions involving the European Commission and the UK government about how to protect the single market and the customs union, while avoiding the emergence of a hard border on the island."" He said the only ""workable"" solution so far had been the backstop proposed in the withdrawal agreement and he again dismissed suggestions of alternative arrangements to it. Meanwhile Mr Varadkar's deputy, Simon Coveney, urged everyone in Ireland to continue to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.

"This video can not be played Aerials show Alabama tornado destruction Seven members of one family were among the 23 victims identified after an outbreak of tornadoes devastated the US state of Alabama, officials have said. Every victim, including four children, was found close to their homes, rescue crews say. The victims range in age from six to 89, Lee County Coroner Bill Harris told a news conference. Up to eight people remain missing, officials say, and there are fears the death toll could rise. ""We believe that every victim was in the residence when it hit. They all ended up, with the exception of two, outside the residence,"" Mr Harris told reporters, adding that their homes ""aren't there"". Taylor Thornton was listed among the dead ""They're not there."" He added that one survivor lost seven members of his family, and warned that he may be facing ""financial issues"" because of multiple funeral costs. ""They're going to have seven funerals that they have to finance somehow,"" he said, adding that donors have been reaching out to help the family with the expenses. The tornadoes struck eastern Alabama on Sunday, levelling homes and carving a path of at least a half mile (0.8km) wide in some parts of the state. About 50 structures have been reduced to rubble Chris Buckler, BBC News, in Beauregard On the edge of where the tornado struck, there is the constant buzzing of chainsaws as they try to clear up the hundreds of fallen trees. But up in the Beauregard neighbourhood which was directly in its path, there is silence. Where once there were homes there is now what can only be described as an emptiness.  All of the buildings have been levelled and from the road it's difficult to see that a community was once even here. There's no doubt that some of the most striking images are the cars, which have been smashed, overturned and in one case actually wrapped around a tree. When you wander through what was a garden and look through the flattened remains, you discover the remnants of people's lives. Single shoes, an iron and what looks like an old schoolbag. There are a few figures wandering around amid all of the devastation looking numb and bewildered. At times they seem to be struggling to remember what was once here on this flattened landscape.

"This video can not be played Knife crime victims' stories from Sheffield: ""I don't want to not have a mum"" There is ""some link"" between falling police numbers and a rise in violent crime, the UK's top police officer, Cressida Dick, has said. The Met Police commissioner was talking a day after Prime Minister Theresa May said there was ""no direct correlation"". It comes aftertwo 17-year-olds were killedin separate stabbings in London and Greater Manchester at the weekend. Ms Dick told LBC Radio the deaths show ""how big of a challenge this is"" and that it is not a London-only issue. Jodie Chesney was killed in an east London park as she played music with friends, while Yousef Ghaleb Makki was stabbed to death in the village of Hale Barns, near Altrincham. A 17-year-old boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been charged with the murder of Mr Makki,Greater Manchester Police said. A second 17-year-old boy has been charged with assisting an offender and possession of a bladed article. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police said aman had been arrested in Leicester in connection with the murder of Ms Chesney. Her grandmother, Debbie Chesney, previously said: ""This has to stop - there are too many young people having their lives cut short by needless violence."" Meanwhile,six people have been arrestedover a gang attack at a Lancashire sixth form college. A machete was found near Runshaw College in Leyland, following Monday's incident. Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart Home Secretary Sajid Javid has said he will meet police chiefs to look at ways to combat violence. He raised the issue of resources for police to tackle knife crime at a meeting of the Cabinet this morning. The Home Office has pledged to ""urgently coordinate"" further meetings across government to ""accelerate"" support for local authorities and police. The PM has asked officials to make this a priority. 'I don't know how many people I've stabbed' 'Treat knife crime like terrorism' The unit tackling knives Speaking about policing numbers, Ms Dick said a reduction in police officer numbers and cuts to public services in the last few years had coincided with an increase in demand for policing. She said: ""I agree that there is some link between violent crime on the streets obviously and police numbers, of course there is, and everybody would see that."" Ms Dick also agreed that middle class recreational drug users had ""blood on their hands"" over recent deaths, adding the drugs trade was a key driver behind street violence. Her comments followed those on Monday from the prime minister, who said there was ""no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers"". Senior police officers have called for a reverse to recent cuts in staffing levels. ""Jay"" - not his real name - first started carrying a knife when he was in Year 8 at school. He argues that knife crime is not being driven by disputes between drug gangs or the increasing availability of cocaine, as is sometimes suggested. Jay told the BBC: ""When you talk about black street gangs, they're financed by drugs but their disputes and their beef has nothing to do with drugs. ""If that was the case then it would be a free-for-all - every single gang would be beefing each other, but that's not the situation. ""Each gang has a particular enemy and it has nothing to do with drugs."" Listen to the Beyond Today podcast on knife crime. 1,000 young victims hospitalised Fatal stabbings at highest level since records began Can knife crime be stopped before it starts? Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hastweeted,externala video linking the rise in violent crime to government cuts and said young people ""shouldn't pay the price for austerity with their lives"". Mr Corbyn earlier said that Mrs May ""must start listening"" to police chiefs over the impact of cutting 21,000 officers, adding: ""You cannot keep people safe on the cheap."" Vernon Coaker, a former Home Office minister under Labour, said the government shouldtreat knife crime with the same urgency as terrorism. Former Met commissioner Lord Hogan-Howe has called for 20,000 officers to be recruited to bring forces in England and Wales back to their 2010 levels, and says ministers have to ""get a grip on the crisis"". Ms Dick is recruiting 3,000 officers after receiving an increase in funding. She welcomed the boost to police numbers in London - but said they were still below the levels they were in 2013-14. This video can not be played Metropolitan Police chief Cressida Dick: ""There must be some link"" Figures released in February showed the number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales last year - 285 - was the highest since records began in 1946. Ms Dick said that when she became commissioner tackling violent crime on the streets was her top priority - and it remained so. ""We are taking more weapons off the streets, we are arresting more people, we are doing more disruptive activity, as well as record numbers in the last few years of stop and search,"" she said. Ms Dick also noted that the number of homicides in London had fallen, with 20 so far this year compared to 29 this time last year.

"Inquiry chairwoman, Prof Alexis Jay, led the probe into child abuse in Rotherham Insufficient evidence has been found in 36 out of 37 investigations into recent allegations that police covered up child abuse in the past. Investigations overseen by the Independent Office For Police Conduct were disclosed to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse. It's the first time the results of the long-running series of investigations have been made public. In one case evidence was found, but the officer has since died. Police 'not told' of 1980s MP abuse claim How the child sexual abuse inquiry works The report by the IOPC says a string of claims made during recent years - by retired police officers, social workers and journalists - were not supported by available evidence. Often the allegation was that senior officers stopped an inquiry after finding out that prominent people were involved. Some of the claims were widely reported in the media. The cases largely date back to the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. In 23 cases, no evidence at all was found of the allegation. In eight of these cases, this was because relevant information could not be obtained. In the other 15, evidence was discovered which undermined the claims. In the remaining cases insufficient evidence was found. In just one case evidence was found to support a claim: that in the 1980s, a senior police officer entered a cell containing property seized in Operation Circus, an inquiry into child abuse in Piccadilly and London stations. The officer has since died, meaning no further action can be taken. The 37 investigations included: An anonymous letter was sent to the Metropolitan Police in 2015 claiming to be from a retired officer at Aldgate police station. It said an investigation into sexual abuse and corruption among prominent people in the 1970s and 1980s was dropped. An investigation in 2015 found there was no such police station and the letter used language unlikely to have come from someone who had served as a police officer. The sender of the letter was not traced. A former children's home manager claimed high-profile people were involved in abuse from 1986 to 1987. She met police at Wimbledon at the time and says she was told to report anything unusual. She then said she was later told to forget what she was told and the case was closed. No living person could be found who could substantiate rumours that subsequently spread that the case was closed due to links with Westminster. A care worker claimed high-profile people attended Elm Guest House in south-west London, where abuse was said to have taken place. He said he was visited in 1989 by two men with guns, who were Special Branch officers. He said three shots were fired through his kitchen window. The care worker gave two statements which contained significant inconsistencies. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) in England and Wales is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. The inquiry is being led by Prof Alexis Jay, a former director of social services who headed the inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. The inquiry's public hearings consist of 13 separate investigations, which are expected to last until 2020.

"Mr Prasek had previously clashed with local authorities over the big cat, which he bought in 2016 A man has been mauled to death by a lion caged at his family home in the eastern Czech Republic. Michal Prasek owned the nine-year-old big cat and another lioness for breeding, reportedly drawing concern from local residents. Mr Prasek's father found his body in the lion's cage and told local media it had been locked from the inside. The animals - living in separate pens - were shot dead by police called to the scene. A police spokesperson told local media that the shootings were ""absolutely necessary for them to get to the man"". Why lion cubs are turning up across Europe Mr Prasek, 33, bought the lion in 2016 and the lioness last year, and kept them both in home-made enclosures in his back yard in the village of Zdechov. He had previously been denied planning permission to build the pens, and was subsequently fined for illegal breeding. But his conflict with the authorities reached a stalemate after he refused to let anyone onto his property. A lack of alternative facilities in the Czech Republic, or any evidence of animal cruelty, also meant the lions could not be forcibly removed. Mr Prasek made headlines last summer after a cyclist collided with the lioness as he was taking her for a walk on a leash. After intervention by police, the incident was deemed a traffic accident. ""Today's incident will perhaps finally help to resolve this long-term problem,"" said Zdechov mayor Tomas Kocourek.

"The device sent to Heathrow Airport caught fire when staff opened it Counter-terror police are investigating three packages containing explosives found at Heathrow Airport, London City Airport and Waterloo station. The ""small improvised explosive devices"" were found in A4 postal bags, the Metropolitan Police said. The force's Counter Terrorism Command is treating it as a ""linked series"" and ""keeping an open mind"" about motives. Irish police are assisting the Met as the Heathrow and Waterloo packages had Republic of Ireland stamps. Heathrow's Compass Centre was evacuated after a package was reported to police at about 09:55 GMT. The device caught fire when staff opened the bag. A second explosive was found in the post room at Waterloo station with the same ""Love & Wedding"" stamps Scotland Yard said: ""The packages - all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags - have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices. ""These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened."" A Heathrow spokeswoman said the airport would support the police investigation into the ""criminal act"". The GardaÃ­ confirmed it was also assisting the Met. Ireland's postal service identified the stamps as its ""Love & Wedding"" design for greeting cards, wedding invitations and thank-you cards. The Compass Centre, which is an office for Heathrow staff rather than part of the passenger terminals, remains closed. The picture of the jiffy bag addressed to Waterloo appears to show its sender's address as Bus Eireann, Dublin. The operator said police had not been in touch, with a spokeswoman saying: ""Bus Eireann are currently not aware of this and we have no further comment."" Working explosive devices being sent through the mail - or letter bombs - are very rare in the UK. Fortunately these packages only appear to be designed to start a very small fire - the one that went off just melted part of its own plastic envelope, and the other two were not opened. But there is sufficient concern about today's incidents for them to be investigated as a linked series by Scotland Yard's Counter Terrorism Command. This means the full weight of resources and expertise of one of the world's most experienced counter terrorism teams will be trying to get to the bottom of who sent the packages and why. The motive is unclear. It could be anything from Irish republicanism to a grievance against transport companies. Other possibilities include someone with strong opinions about Brexit or someone with mental health problems. The devices do not seem to be capable of causing serious injury, so they were probably intended to have a nuisance effect and to generate publicity, which they have successfully done. Police will be hoping the series is now over. Two more packages were found in the capital over the next three hours. An area of Waterloo station was cordoned off after a second package was discovered in the post room at about 11:40, the BBC understands. One worker among a group of staff outside the Network Rail office said he found the package. Asked about the discovery, he said: ""I'm sorry, I've been told I can't talk about it."" About 100 workers were evacuated from City Aviation House at City Airport in Newham after a third package was reported at about 12:10. City Aviation House is a two-minute walk from the passenger terminal. Staff returned to the office at about 16:00. The second and third packages were not opened and have since been ""made safe"", police said. Flights were not affected but Docklands Light Railway trains did not stop at City Airport for about an hour during the investigation. A cordon was in place at Waterloo station, where one of the devices was found at 11:40 Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan, from British Transport Police, said commuters should feel ""safe and reassured"" while travelling. ""Officers will be highly visible on station concourses, on board trains as well as the London Underground network,"" he added. ""Passengers are of course the eyes and ears of the network and we want to hear from you if you see something that doesn't look right."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling urged people to report ""anything suspicious"" to police, while Mayor of London Sadiq Khan added: ""Our thanks go to police, security, transport staff and all involved for their swift actions to keep our city safe.""

"Jodie Chesney was the fifth teenager to be stabbed to death in London this year The family of a 17-year-old girl killed in east London have backed a call for longer jail terms for people carrying knives. Jodie Chesneydied after being stabbed in the back in a park in Romford. Relative Karen Chesney wants people to be jailed for 25 years for using knives, and 10 years for carrying them. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said officers were doing ""everything in their power"" to catch Jodie's killer. An online petition calling for harsher punishments has been signed more than 33,000 times. Ms Chesney shared the petition on Facebook and urged people to ""please sign"" it. The current maximum penalty for an adult carrying a knife is four years in jail and an unlimited fine, with prison sentences only handed to repeat offenders. Jodie was killed as she played music with friends in the park in Harold Hill on Friday. People have been laying flowers near the entrance to the park Her grandmother Debbie Chesney said the family were in ""shock"" after a ""nightmare"" few days. In a previous social media appeal, she said: ""We don't want anyone else to go through what our family is suffering right now. ""This has to stop, there are too many young people having their lives cut short by needless violence."" This video can not be played Cressida Dick: 'Violent crime linked to policing numbers' Ms Dick said police ""need help"" in thesearch for two suspectsinvolved in the killing. ""We've already had lots of calls from the public but anybody who was in that area... on Friday evening, please get in touch, give us information,"" she said. ""Somebody out there knows who committed this crime."" The deaths of Jodie and 17-year-oldYousef Makki, who was killed near Altrincham on Saturday, have sparked a national debate about ways to tackle knife crime. Hunt for pair over stabbing of girl, 17 Tributes paid to 'amazing' Jodie News and updates from across London Prime Minister Theresa May said there was ""no direct correlation"" between falling police numbers and a rise in violent crime. However, Ms Dick disagreed,saying there was ""some link"". Mrs May has asked the Home Office to co-ordinate a series of urgent meetings and engagements on knife crime. Her spokesman said the prime minister had told cabinet Jodie and Yousef's murders were ""absolutely appalling crimes"".

"HIV was no longer detected in the patient's body after the transplant A UK patient's HIV has become ""undetectable"" following a stem cell transplant - in only the second case of its kind, doctors report inNature.,external The London patient, who was being treated for cancer, has now been in remission from HIV for 18 months and is no longer taking HIV drugs. The researchers say it is too early to say the patient is ""cured"" of HIV. Experts say the approach is not practical for treating most people with HIV but may one day help find a cure. The male London patient, who has not been named, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2012. He had chemotherapy to treat the Hodgkin's cancer and, in addition, stem cells were implanted into the patient from a donor resistant to HIV, leading to both his cancer and HIV going into remission. Researchers from University College London, Imperial College London, Cambridge and Oxford Universities were all involved in the case. This is the second time a patient treated this way has ended up in remission from HIV. Ten years ago, another patient in Berlin received a bone-marrow transplant from a donor with natural immunity to the virus. Timothy Brown, said to be the first person to ""beat"" HIV/Aids, was given two transplants and total body irradiation (radiotherapy) for leukaemia - a much more aggressive treatment. ""By achieving remission in a second patient using a similar approach, we have shown that the Berlin patient was not an anomaly and that it really was the treatment approaches that eliminated HIV in these two people,"" said lead study author Prof Ravindra Gupta, from UCL. By BBC Online Health Editor, Michelle Roberts Although the finding is exciting, it is not offering up a new treatment for the millions of people around the world living with HIV. The aggressive therapy was primarily used to treat the patient's cancer, not his HIV. Current HIV therapies are really effective, meaning people with the virus can live long and healthy lives. But the reason this case is so significant is that it could help experts who are looking for new ways to tackle HIV and achieve a cure. Understanding how the body can naturally resist the infection does offer up hope of this, even if it is still a long way off. Prof Eduardo Olavarria, also involved in the research, from Imperial College London, said the success of stem cell transplantation offered hope that new strategies could be developed to tackle the virus. But he added: ""The treatment is not appropriate as a standard HIV treatment because of the toxicity of chemotherapy, which in this case was required to treat the lymphoma."" The patient was able to stop taking antiretroviral therapy drugs to control his HIV CCR5 is the most commonly used receptor by HIV-1 - the virus strain of HIV that dominates around the world - to enter cells. But a very small number of people who are resistant to HIV have two mutated copies of the CCR5 receptor. This means the virus cannot penetrate cells in the body that it normally infects. The London patient received stem cells from a donor with this specific genetic mutation, which made him resistant to HIV as well. But a reservoir of cells carrying HIV can still remain in the body, in a resting state, for many years. The UK researchers say it may be possible to use gene therapy to target the CCR5 receptor in people with HIV, now they know the Berlin patient's recovery was not a one-off. Why talk of a cure for HIV is premature How has life with HIV changed? Bone marrow 'frees men of HIV drugs' Prof Graham Cooke, National Institute for Health Research research professor and reader in infectious diseases from Imperial College London, said the results were ""encouraging"". ""If we can understand better why the procedure works in some patients and not others, we will be closer to our ultimate goal of curing HIV. ""At the moment the procedure still carries too much risk to be used in patients who are otherwise well."" Dr Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases and honorary consultant physician at Cardiff University, said it was an ""interesting and potentially significant report"". But he said much longer follow-up would be needed to ensure the virus did not re-emerge at a later stage. ""While this type of treatment is clearly not practical to treat the millions of people around the world living with HIV, reports such as these may help in the ultimate development of a cure for HIV."" In the meantime, he said the focus needed to be on diagnosing HIV promptly and starting patients on lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). This can prevent the virus being transmitted to others and give people with HIV a near-normal life expectancy.

"This video can not be played Aerials show Alabama tornado destruction Seven members of one family were among the 23 victims identified after an outbreak of tornadoes devastated the US state of Alabama, officials have said. Every victim, including four children, was found close to their homes, rescue crews say. The victims range in age from six to 89, Lee County Coroner Bill Harris told a news conference. Up to eight people remain missing, officials say, and there are fears the death toll could rise. ""We believe that every victim was in the residence when it hit. They all ended up, with the exception of two, outside the residence,"" Mr Harris told reporters, adding that their homes ""aren't there"". Taylor Thornton was listed among the dead ""They're not there."" He added that one survivor lost seven members of his family, and warned that he may be facing ""financial issues"" because of multiple funeral costs. ""They're going to have seven funerals that they have to finance somehow,"" he said, adding that donors have been reaching out to help the family with the expenses. The tornadoes struck eastern Alabama on Sunday, levelling homes and carving a path of at least a half mile (0.8km) wide in some parts of the state. About 50 structures have been reduced to rubble Chris Buckler, BBC News, in Beauregard On the edge of where the tornado struck, there is the constant buzzing of chainsaws as they try to clear up the hundreds of fallen trees. But up in the Beauregard neighbourhood which was directly in its path, there is silence. Where once there were homes there is now what can only be described as an emptiness.  All of the buildings have been levelled and from the road it's difficult to see that a community was once even here. There's no doubt that some of the most striking images are the cars, which have been smashed, overturned and in one case actually wrapped around a tree. When you wander through what was a garden and look through the flattened remains, you discover the remnants of people's lives. Single shoes, an iron and what looks like an old schoolbag. There are a few figures wandering around amid all of the devastation looking numb and bewildered. At times they seem to be struggling to remember what was once here on this flattened landscape. Frederick Franklin was standing by the debris of one house, trying to piece together where the rooms once stood from the foundations of the building. ""It was my brother's fiancÃ©'s place,"" he told me. ""She and one of her brothers were killed in it. You can't describe it. This is nature at its worst."" Temperatures dropped below freezing on Tuesday as volunteer crews sorted through debris, looking for survivors and bodies. On Monday, weather officials upgraded the fatal twister that hit Lee County to EF-4 with wind speeds of 170 mph (275km/h). Almost 50 people were injured and numerous homes and businesses were reduced to rubble as multiple tornadoes touched down in south-east Alabama and Georgia. During Tuesday's briefing, an official with the National Weather Service said the deadliest tornado had travelled for about 70 miles, and another nearby travelled for 29 miles. Children among Alabama tornado victims Bags of ice and medications are being made available to residents, who have been told they should start bringing debris out to the street for it to be removed by county rubbish crews. Some residents who narrowly survived the onslaught have travelled to shelters to lend a hand and donate goods. ""I had a friend who lost his life, and just my heart spoke,"" Stephanie Griffith tearfully told WVTM-TV as she dropped off supplies at a shelter in Lee County. ""So I went through my home this morning I got things that I'm not going to use and I know they'll be needed here."" Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

"The work-to-rule action began on Monday but unions said it would be ""unlimited"" Traffic jams built up on Tuesday around the French port of Calais as customs officers worked to rule, carrying out tighter checks on lorries heading for the Channel Tunnel and the ferry port. The action, which began on Monday, is aimed at improving pay and staff numbers ahead of the UK's expected departure from the EU on 29 March. Dunkirk, further up the French coast, is also affected. ""Brexit is a catalyst for deeper anger,"" said one union official. The A16 motorway near Calais became snarled up early on Tuesday. The biggest queues were close to the ferry port as well as the Channel Tunnel exit, and freight companies warned of long waits at border checkpoints. For a second day, tailbacks of lorries stretched for several kilometres but ordinary traffic was still able to move. Drone footage from one TV reporter showed the extent of the queues near the Channel Tunnel. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivers hooted in frustration and Calais officials set up holding areas to deal with the weight of traffic. The local prefect banned until Wednesday lorries weighing more than 7.5 tonnes,externalfrom taking the westbound motorway route from near Dunkirk to the tunnel. Waiting times at Dunkirk port were more than two hours and every lorry was still being checked, ferry operator DFDS operator said. While 100% border checks had stopped at Calais, it said waiting time there was ""extensive"", with traffic being diverted through the town. As lorries came to a standstill there were reports that migrants had tried to board the vehicles to get across the Channel. Union officials said their ""unlimited"" action was aimed at ""showing what will happen with Brexit"", when the UK leaves the European Union. The possibility of a no-deal Brexit has led to fears of major disruption on both sides of the Channel. Brexit: What would no deal mean for lorry drivers? Customs checks simplified for no-deal Brexit The French government has announced plans to increase the number of customs officers in response to Brexit. The 300 deployed at the Channel Tunnel will be increased to 365 while the 64 at Calais port will almost double. But union officials say they want bigger numbers recruited because of Brexit, as well as better night pay and danger money. ""If the UK becomes a third country, checks will become more in-depth. This is the first, full demonstration of what will happen,"" said CGT union official Philippe Bollengier. This video can not be played Up to 90 lorries assembled at Manston airfield as part of a no-deal Brexit exercise The head of French customs, Rodolphe Gintz, said he was astonished by the ""work-to-rule strike"", which he was adamant had nothing to do with Brexit. ""They're targeting lorries that are leaving for the UK even though it's the country of destination that carries out the checks."" Budget minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said France was prepared and he insisted there would not be a ""bottleneck of the century"". The British government has also sought to allay fears, promising that lorries coming into the UK will be able to drive straight off ferries and Channel Tunnel trains by filling in a frontier declaration beforehand. In January, UK officials staged an exercise involving a convoy of 89 lorries at a disused airport in Kent as part of its contingency plans. Brexit: What would no deal mean for lorry drivers?

"Colleagues of John Robinson (in grey shirt) hugged him and tweeted ""he's not going anywhere"" after his win An English teacher who won Â£500,000 on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire said he did not expect it to create such ""a sensation"" at his school.

"This video can not be played The confrontation at the college was filmed and videos posted on social media A machete has been found near a sixth form college that an armed gang stormed for a ""pre-arranged fight"". The weapon was found by a police dog in a search after the disorder at Runshaw College in Leyland, Lancashire, on Monday. Six people were arrested after police were tipped off that a group was heading to the college ""with weapons"". Footage on social media appears to show students fleeing a confrontation with masked men. The gang of around 12 young men - some brandishing knives wearing balaclavas and face masks - arrived at the college at about 16:00 GMT to confront a rival group. Three men in a parked car were arrested nearby. A fourth person who made off on foot was also arrested. Two more were held on Monday evening, with one picked up in a car on the M55 and one arrested in Preston. A 17-year-old student was ""nicked on the arm"" during an altercation in the college grounds. He was treated in Chorley Hospital but his wound was not serious. The suspects, two men aged 18 and three 17-year-old boys, all from Preston, and a third 18-year-old man from Kirkham, were arrested on suspicion of public order offences and later released on bail. A staff member said the college had been tipped off that an armed group was on its way to the college Regular patrols are visible in the vicinity of the college this morning, as police work to reassure students. Officers say their focus will now move to the investigation and they will  be speaking to the six people in custody over the course of the day. They are also keen to hear from anybody who witnessed what happened or has any mobile footage of the incident. The MP for South Ribble Seema Kennedy has raised the issue with the Home Secretary. A search was carried out after reports of a machete-style knife being used in the attack.

"Five new houses belonging to McCarthy and Stone were damaged A builder who caused nearly Â£1m in damage when he wrecked five newly built houses with a digger has been jailed. Daniel Neagu, 31, filmed himself and whooped in delight as he destroyed the properties in a dispute over wages. The 31-year-old of Harrow, north-west London had admitted criminal damage to the homes in Buntingford, Hertfordshire, on 11 August. Sentencing Neagu to four years, Judge Stephen Warner said the ""wanton vandalism"" was a ""pure act of revenge"". Daniel Neagu destroyed the five houses using a digger The retirement homes - valued at between Â£425,000 and Â£475,000 - had to be fully rebuilt by McCarthy & Stone Retirement Living at a cost of nearly Â£1m. St Albans Crown Court heard former plant operator Neagu claimed his firm was owed Â£16,000 in unpaid wages by a subcontractor, Fenton, meaning he could not pay his team. Fentons had withheld the money because one of its vehicles, which was fitted with a tracker, was found to be in Neagu's native Romania. He said he would return it when he was paid, the court heard. The homes were part of a retirement complex Judge Warner said the footage of Neagu destroying the buildings while singing and whistling - was ""truly shocking"". ""You were perfectly relaxed and not ashamed. This was planned, deliberate and wanton vandalism involving the destruction of other people's property undertaken by you as a pure act of revenge,"" he said. The homes were on Ermine Street, Buntingford When neighbours called the police, Neagu told them: ""They haven't paid me. I decided even if I got into trouble I did it for a reason... I wanted to give them a lesson."" In police interviews he said he was ""helpless, angry, disappointed and scared"" because he did not have money to pay his staff, and claimed he and his family had been threatened. When he was charged, he said: ""I did it because they owed me money and I thought it was more healthy for me to be inside rather than outside.""

"Lord Falconer is coming under pressure to reject an offer from Labour to head an inquiry into the party's handling of anti-Semitism claims. Prominent Jewish Labour MPs have called for someone from outside the party to lead the probe. They say the former lord chancellor is not independent enough to take the action they say is needed. Lord Falconer rejects this - but says he is still deciding whether to accept the job. It comes as the Equalities and Human Rights Commission announced it was investigating allegations of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party that have been passed to it by the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism and the Jewish Labour Movement. Tories 'institutionally Islamophobic' 'You misled me,' Hodge tells Corbyn Anti-Semitism row MP suspension 'unfair' Labour peer in talks over anti-Semitism role A spokesman for the Commission said it could decide to work with the party to tackle anti-Semitism - or launch a formal inquiry into the party' handling of the issue, but its report was not likely to be published imminently. Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge has accused members of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's inner circle of interfering in disciplinary processes to make sanctions more lenient. She has referred tointernal documents leaked to the Observer,external, which show senior Labour figures last year opposed recommendations to suspend several party activists accused of anti-Semitism. This ""contradicts"" what Mr Corbyn had told her when she confronted him about it, she claims. A Labour Party spokesman said: ""Any suggestion that staff in the Leader's Office overturned recommendations on individual cases is categorically untrue."" He added: ""Since becoming general secretary,Jennie Formby has made procedures for dealing with complaints about anti-Semitism more robust,external. Dame Margaret also claims Lord Falconer had ""bombarded"" her with phone calls last summer, when she wasfacing disciplinary action- later dropped - over an angry confrontation with Mr Corbyn, to try to ""force me to give an apology"". A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Tories 'institutionally Islamophobic' Hodge stands by anti-Semitism attack on Corbyn How Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded He has said he wants to examine claims Labour is institutionally anti-Semitic and look out how to restore faith in the party's disciplinary procedures. He told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics that many Labour members believed the treatment of cases depended on ""who your friends are"". Margaret Hodge has written to Jeremy Corbyn about the party's approach to anti-Semitism She claimed his inquiry could be a repeat of the one carried out by Labour peer Baroness Chakrabarti in 2016, which found that the party was'not overrun by anti-Semitism'. ""We need somebody totally outside the Labour Party, otherwise this becomes another Chakrabarti fiasco,"" said Dame Margaret. In response, Lord Falconer said: ""I am shocked she thought I was trying to pressurise her into apologising for calling Jeremy Corbyn an anti-Semite. I was just trying to urge the party to drop their complaint against her."" He told BBC Politics Live presenter Jo Coburn he would be independent of the leadership and investigate any complaints of anti-Semitism in the strongest possible way, but he had not yet accepted the job. Speaking on the BBC News Channel, another prominent Jewish Labour MP Louise Ellman said Lord Falconer should think ""very carefully indeed"" before accepting the role of ""surveillance commissioner"" . She said Lord Falconer was ""highly respected"", but there were ""very big questions he should ask himself"" before taking up the post. ""His role is not clear,"" she said, ""and the degree of his independence isn't very clear."" Another Jewish Labour MP, Ruth Smeeth, told the Times that Labour's disciplinary processes were ""not fit for purpose"" and ""political interference on the side of anti-Semites is normal behaviour"". She added: ""Big changes are needed if we are ever to have faith in the leadership of the Labour Party.""

"The device sent to Heathrow Airport caught fire when staff opened it Counter-terror police are investigating three packages containing explosives found at Heathrow Airport, London City Airport and Waterloo station. The ""small improvised explosive devices"" were found in A4 postal bags, the Metropolitan Police said. The force's Counter Terrorism Command is treating it as a ""linked series"" and ""keeping an open mind"" about motives. Irish police are assisting the Met as the Heathrow and Waterloo packages had Republic of Ireland stamps. Heathrow's Compass Centre was evacuated after a package was reported to police at about 09:55 GMT. The device caught fire when staff opened the bag. A second explosive was found in the post room at Waterloo station with the same ""Love & Wedding"" stamps Scotland Yard said: ""The packages - all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags - have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices. ""These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened."" A Heathrow spokeswoman said the airport would support the police investigation into the ""criminal act"". The GardaÃ­ confirmed it was also assisting the Met. Ireland's postal service identified the stamps as its ""Love & Wedding"" design for greeting cards, wedding invitations and thank-you cards. The Compass Centre, which is an office for Heathrow staff rather than part of the passenger terminals, remains closed. The picture of the jiffy bag addressed to Waterloo appears to show its sender's address as Bus Eireann, Dublin. The operator said police had not been in touch, with a spokeswoman saying: ""Bus Eireann are currently not aware of this and we have no further comment."" Working explosive devices being sent through the mail - or letter bombs - are very rare in the UK. Fortunately these packages only appear to be designed to start a very small fire - the one that went off just melted part of its own plastic envelope, and the other two were not opened. But there is sufficient concern about today's incidents for them to be investigated as a linked series by Scotland Yard's Counter Terrorism Command. This means the full weight of resources and expertise of one of the world's most experienced counter terrorism teams will be trying to get to the bottom of who sent the packages and why. The motive is unclear. It could be anything from Irish republicanism to a grievance against transport companies. Other possibilities include someone with strong opinions about Brexit or someone with mental health problems. The devices do not seem to be capable of causing serious injury, so they were probably intended to have a nuisance effect and to generate publicity, which they have successfully done. Police will be hoping the series is now over. Two more packages were found in the capital over the next three hours. An area of Waterloo station was cordoned off after a second package was discovered in the post room at about 11:40, the BBC understands. One worker among a group of staff outside the Network Rail office said he found the package. Asked about the discovery, he said: ""I'm sorry, I've been told I can't talk about it."" About 100 workers were evacuated from City Aviation House at City Airport in Newham after a third package was reported at about 12:10. City Aviation House is a two-minute walk from the passenger terminal. Staff returned to the office at about 16:00. The second and third packages were not opened and have since been ""made safe"", police said. Flights were not affected but Docklands Light Railway trains did not stop at City Airport for about an hour during the investigation. A cordon was in place at Waterloo station, where one of the devices was found at 11:40 Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan, from British Transport Police, said commuters should feel ""safe and reassured"" while travelling. ""Officers will be highly visible on station concourses, on board trains as well as the London Underground network,"" he added. ""Passengers are of course the eyes and ears of the network and we want to hear from you if you see something that doesn't look right."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling urged people to report ""anything suspicious"" to police, while Mayor of London Sadiq Khan added: ""Our thanks go to police, security, transport staff and all involved for their swift actions to keep our city safe.""

Irish police are assisting the Met as the Heathrow and Waterloo packages had Republic of Ireland stamps. Heathrow's Compass Centre was evacuated after a package was reported to police at about 09:55 GMT. The device caught fire when staff opened the bag. A second explosive was found in the post room at Waterloo station with the same ""Love & Wedding"" stamps Scotland Yard said: ""The packages - all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags - have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices. ""These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened."" A Heathrow spokeswoman said the airport would support the police investigation into the ""criminal act"". The GardaÃ­ confirmed it was also assisting the Met. Ireland's postal service identified the stamps as its ""Love & Wedding"" design for greeting cards, wedding invitations and thank-you cards. The Compass Centre, which is an office for Heathrow staff rather than part of the passenger terminals, remains closed. The picture of the jiffy bag addressed to Waterloo appears to show its sender's address as Bus Eireann, Dublin. The operator said police had not been in touch, with a spokeswoman saying: ""Bus Eireann are currently not aware of this and we have no further comment."" Working explosive devices being sent through the mail - or letter bombs - are very rare in the UK. Fortunately these packages only appear to be designed to start a very small fire - the one that went off just melted part of its own plastic envelope, and the other two were not opened. But there is sufficient concern about today's incidents for them to be investigated as a linked series by Scotland Yard's Counter Terrorism Command. This means the full weight of resources and expertise of one of the world's most experienced counter terrorism teams will be trying to get to the bottom of who sent the packages and why. The motive is unclear. It could be anything from Irish republicanism to a grievance against transport companies. Other possibilities include someone with strong opinions about Brexit or someone with mental health problems. The devices do not seem to be capable of causing serious injury, so they were probably intended to have a nuisance effect and to generate publicity, which they have successfully done. Police will be hoping the series is now over. Two more packages were found in the capital over the next three hours. An area of Waterloo station was cordoned off after a second package was discovered in the post room at about 11:40, the BBC understands. One worker among a group of staff outside the Network Rail office said he found the package. Asked about the discovery, he said: ""I'm sorry, I've been told I can't talk about it."" About 100 workers were evacuated from City Aviation House at City Airport in Newham after a third package was reported at about 12:10. City Aviation House is a two-minute walk from the passenger terminal. Staff returned to the office at about 16:00. The second and third packages were not opened and have since been ""made safe"", police said. Flights were not affected but Docklands Light Railway trains did not stop at City Airport for about an hour during the investigation. A cordon was in place at Waterloo station, where one of the devices was found at 11:40 Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan, from British Transport Police, said commuters should feel ""safe and reassured"" while travelling. ""Officers will be highly visible on station concourses, on board trains as well as the London Underground network,"" he added. ""Passengers are of course the eyes and ears of the network and we want to hear from you if you see something that doesn't look right."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling urged people to report ""anything suspicious"" to police, while Mayor of London Sadiq Khan added: ""Our thanks go to police, security, transport staff and all involved for their swift actions to keep our city safe.""

"Chuka Umunna said the group had to become a party in order to present an alternative to the ""broken political system"". The Independent Group is in talks with the Electoral Commission about becoming a fully-fledged political party, group spokesman Chuka Umunna has said. He said the group had to become a party in order to present an alternative to the ""broken political system"". Eight MPs quit Labour and joined forces with three former Tories to form the group, which is joint fourth-largest in Parliament, with the Lib Dems. By registering as a party, the group can contest seats in future elections. Who are the Independent Group? Umunna made Independent Group spokesman Blair praises 'courageous' Independents Speaking outside the Electoral Commission headquarters in London, former Labour MP Mr Umunna said: ""We have been absolutely overwhelmed by the tens of thousands of people who have signed up to our website, who have shown support for what we are doing and want to see an alternative, to build an alternative."" ""So we are here at the Electoral Commission to explore with them how we do that. ""We aren't a political party but quite clearly there is an appetite for a new one, so we are here to discuss with them what that involves."" Anyone can register a new political party for a small fee but there are rules about what it can be called - it can't sound too much like an existing party or be offensive, for example. New parties must also name a leader, treasurer and nominating officer - and submit a party emblem and description. It would be required to comply with strict funding rules, but the group has promised to abide by these even if it does not formally register with the watchdog. Former Labour MPs Gavin Shuker, Ann Coffey and Chris Leslie and ex-Tory Heidi Allen joined Mr Umunna at the commission. ""We think people want an alternative,"" Mr Umunna said. Speaking later at an event in London, Mrs Coffey said the putative party ""had to have a name but it's complicated"". She also confirmed that none of 11 members of The Independent Group would stand for re-election in their seats before the next general election, due in 2022. The MPs quit their parties and joined forces to form the group last month. Among their reasons for leaving their parties were the government's handling of Brexit and Labour's Brexit stance - as well as the Labour leadership's handling of anti-Semitism. The eight former Labour MPs are all longstanding critics of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and they all support the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum.

"Struggling department store chain Debenhams has issued another profit warning as its sales continue to fall. In a trading update, the retailer said the forecast it made on 10 January, when it said full-year profits were set to hit analysts' expectations of about Â£8.2m, was ""no longer valid"". Like-for-like sales at the firm for the 26 weeks to 2 March were down 5.3%. Debenhams said talks with stakeholders to put it on a firmer footing were ""continuing constructively"". The retailer, which issued three profit warnings last year, said it would provide a further update with its interim results statement. Debenhams secures cash lifeline Debenhams 'trying to make shopping fun again' Debenhams may close stores this year Sergio Bucher, the chief executive of Debenhams, said: ""We are making good progress with our stakeholder discussions to put the business on a firm footing for the future. ""We still expect that this process will lead to around 50 stores closing in the medium term."" He said the business would need the help of landlords and local authorities to address rent and rate levels and lease commitments. Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter Oddly timed announcements to the stock exchange normally do not contain good news - a market maxim that Debenhams, the beleaguered department store chain, proved this morning. Companies generally make their statements at 7am on the dot, exactly an hour before the start of trading. Debenhams made this morning's announcement 45 minutes later, giving the impression that the statement had to be rushed out. There is a profit warning - perhaps not that much of a surprise given the uncertainty surrounding the company, and the bleak trading conditions across the High Street - but there is also a coded admission that the company is looking in earnest at a sweeping financial restructuring - a debt-for-equity swap, where shareholders are wiped out and lenders take control, or a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency that lets a company get rid of unwanted liabilities such as pensions and long-term leases. Of the two, the latter is more likely; Debenhams' equity - the total value of the shares listed on the London exchange - is just Â£36m. A month ago, the department store chain said it had been granted a cash injection of Â£40m to buy it extra time as it battled to secure a longer-term deal with lenders. At the time, the companycalled it a ""first step"",externaltowards a sustainable future. It is also reportedlytrying to accelerate plans to close storesand is expected to close around 20 outlets this year. High Street retailers have been under increasing pressure as more people choose to shop online and visit stores less. Laith Khalaf, from stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Debenhams' future is hanging in the balance, and with short sellers circling too [share traders who believe the shares have further to fall], we can expect share price movements to be volatile. ""The department store needs to stage a Lazarus-like recovery to turn things around from here."" Debenhams - which has 165 stores and employs about 25,000 people - reported a record pre-tax loss of Â£491.5m last year and said more recently that sales had fallen sharply over Christmas. Last year, rival department store chain House of Fraser fell into administration before Mike Ashley, the billionaire Sports Direct founder, bought its assets for Â£90m. Mr Ashley is also a major shareholder in Debenhams, with a 29% stake, and he recently joined together with investor Landmark Groupto vote the retailer's chairman and chief executive off the board. Mr Bucher is chief executive of Debenhams but no longer sits on the board.

"This video can not be played Baroness Warsi on Theresa May: ""She doesn't listen, she fails to acknowledge when there is a problem."" Theresa May has been accused of ""burying her head in the sand"" over Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. Former party chairwoman Baroness Warsi said the PM had failed to ""acknowledge"" or ""tackle"" the problem and this was ""symptomatic"" of her wider leadership. Shortly after her comments, the party said 14 members had been suspended for Islamophobic Facebook posts. The Conservatives said ""decisive action"" would be taken against anyone making offensive remarks. The suspensions followed messages posted on a Facebook group called the ""Jacob Rees-Mogg Supporters Group"". The page was not affiliated with the MP or the party as a whole but Conservative members identified as using it have been suspended pending an investigation. ""When we find evidence of members making offensive or inappropriate comments, we consistently take decisive action,"" a spokesman said. But Baroness Warsi, who was the UK's first female Muslim cabinet minister, has said her party had ""turned a blind eye"" to prejudice and become ""institutionally Islamophobic"". She suggested the ""rot had set in"" several years ago and accused senior party officials of being ""in denial"" and presiding over an ""opaque"" complaints process. Falconer pressured over anti-Semitism role Tory peer calls for Islamophobia inquiry In a personal attack on the prime minister, she said Mrs May had ""failed to tackle the problem head on"". ""She doesn't listen, she fails to acknowledge when there is a problem. It's probably symptomatic of the way in which her leadership has dealt with other matters. ""Burying your head in the sand is not going to make problems go away."" She said efforts to modernise the party had ""gone into reverse"" since Mrs May succeeded David Cameron as leader, but she ruled out quitting the party, as others have done. ""If my party's going though a process of 're-UKIPification' of itself, then it's my job to stand within that party and fight to bring it back to the centre ground."" This video can not be played Conservative deputy chairman James Cleverly âWhen something happens, we take immediate actionâ She has written to the party's chief executive Sir Mick Davis urging him to ""show leadership"" on the issue, because, she said, Mrs May and party chairman Brandon Lewis had not. She said Sir Mick, a former chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, had a ""long history of fighting bigotry"" and was ""uniquely placed to understand consequences of unchecked hate"". This video can not be played Conservative MP Henry Smith MP says he has ""never come across"" Islamophobia in his party Baroness Warsi has been warning about anti-Muslim prejudice in the party for years. Her latest intervention follows a row over former candidate Peter Lamb, who was was due to stand in the Staple Tye ward, in Harlow, Essex, in May's local elections and had previously stood in the Toddbrook ward. Mr Lamb was disciplined by the party after it emerged that he had posted a message on Twitter in 2015, saying ""Islam like alcoholism [sic]"" and ""the first step to recovery is admit you have a problem"". Later in the same year, he tweeted: ""Turkey buys oil from ISIS. Muslims sticking together,"" adding: ""Do they want us to call ISIS Daesh now so that we don't associate them with Islam?"" Mr Lamb was reinstated as a candidate but local party sources said he had quit the party earlier on Tuesday, following the row about his comments. In a statement on Twitter, he apologised for the remarks, saying they were ""aimed at the extremists that have hijacked Islam and are cowardly hiding behind the religion"". Justice Secretary David Gauke rejected suggestions the party had ignored warnings on the issue. ""Where there is evidence, we take action, as a political party should. ""Whether it is Islamophobia or whether it is anti-Semitism, there is an obligation on political parties to take action and address it. ""That is what the Conservative Party does and will continue to do. So I don't accept that criticism."" But the Muslim Council of Britain said the level of prejudice within the party was ""astonishing"" and the claims should be independently investigated. ""We've seen MPs, councillors and members engage in bigotry that should have no place in a modern Conservative Party,"" a spokesman said. ""Yet the constructive call by Muslim communities for an independent inquiry into the issue has been ignored again and again. Instead we hear excuses, denials and the responses we would expect when there is an institutional problem.""

"Kylie Jenner is the youngest self-made billionaire of all time Kylie Jenner has become the world's youngest self-made billionaire, according to Forbes billionaires' list. The youngest Kardashian family member is making her fortune from her best-selling cosmetics business. The 21-year-old founded and owns Kylie Cosmetics, the three-year-old beauty business that generated an estimated $360m in sales last year. She reached the milestone earlier than Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg who became a billionaire aged 23. ""I didn't expect anything. I did not foresee the future. ""But [the recognition] feels really good. That's a nice pat on the back,"" Ms Jenner told Forbes. What does it take to be a billionaire? How a reality TV teen became a beauty giant The list shows,externalAmazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, remains the world's richest man. His fortune totals $131bn, according to Forbes, up $19bn from 2018. But the billionaires' combined worth is down from $9.1 trillion at $8.7tn. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's wealth is among those falling. It has dropped by $8.7bn (Â£6.6bn) in the past year to $62.3bn, according to the Forbes list. His shares in Facebook at one point lost a third of their value as the company battled privacy scandals. Amazon's share price has been good for Mr Bezos' bank balance and the gap between him and the number two, Bill Gates, is a little wider, even though Mr Gates' fortune has swelled to $96.5bn from $90bn last year. Of all the billionaires on the list only 252 are women, and the richest self-made woman is real estate mogul Wu Yajun of China, worth an estimated $9.4bn. The number of self-made women reached 72 for the first time, up from 56 a year ago. Jeff Bezos - still number one and getting richer The Forbes billionaires list is a snapshot of wealth taken on 8 February 2019. The magazine uses that day's stock prices and exchange rates from around the world. According to Forbes there are fewer billionaires around - 2,153 of them on the 2019 list, down from 2,208 in 2018. This, in part, explains why their average net worth is $4bn, down from $4.1bn. Forbes also found that 994 of them are less well off than a year ago. Luisa Kroll, assistant managing editor of wealth at Forbes, said: ""Even with strong headwinds, resourceful and relentless entrepreneurs find new ways to get rich."" There are 52 UK citizens on the list. At the top are the Hinduja brothers, Srichand and Gopichand, who control the Hinduja Group conglomerate, with a net worth of $16.9bn. Behind them, ranked as the wealthiest single individual in the UK, is James Ratcliffe, founder of the chemical group Ineos, and worth $12.1bn. Jim Ratcliffe owns 60% of Ineos, the chemicals company he founded Another newcomer is Safra Catz co-chief executive of software firm Oracle, who according to Forbes earns a $41m salary and ranks as one of the world's highest paid female executives. Facebook's share price fall has cut Mark Zuckerberg's wealth The US has 607 billionaires, more than any other country. China has the next largest number with 324. But the list of Chinese billionaires has seen some big changes - it has 44 newcomers to the list while 102 have dropped off. The weakness of the euro has not been kind to European billionaires who make a poor showing with only two in the top 20: Bernard Arnault (ranked 4th), the chief executive of the French luxury goods company LVMH, and Amancio Ortega (ranked 6th), who founded retail group Inditex which owns brands such as Zara. Forbes said 247 people who were on the billionaires list last year have now dropped off. Among them are Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, fashion designers and co-founders of Dolce & Gabbana. The group chairman of supply chain management company Li & Fung, Victor Fung, is also no longer classed as a billionaire by Forbes, after being on the list for 18 years in a row.

In the business statement, Andrea Leadsom announced MPs will vote again on whether to approve the PM's Brexit deal on Tuesday - with the motion tabled on Monday. Debate on the Commonwealth House of CommonsParliament Summing up the debate on 70 years of the Commonwealth, Foreign Office Minister Harriett Baldwin says it is ""a remarkable organisation with a remarkable reach"". She says moves must be made towards a fairer, more stable and prosperous Commonwealth, but that great progress is being made. ""We must ensure a modern Commonwealth can meet future challenges - from climate change to cyber attacks,"" she says. Debate on the Commonwealth House of CommonsParliament MPs are now on to the second backbench debate of the day on the opportunities and challenges facing the modern Commonwealth in its 70th year. The debate is led by Conservative MP James Duddridge and can continue until 5pm. Debate on International Women's Day House of CommonsParliament Jess Phillips, as she has done in previous years, reads out the names of the women who have been killed by men in the past year, as recorded by the Counting Dead Women project. The Labour MP says these women are no longer here because ""they are hard to see, hard to hear and hard to believe"". After finishing reading out the list - which takes nearly seven minutes - Ms Phillips tells MPs: ""These women needs us, in this place, to hear their names and hear their stories."" Debate on International Women's Day House of CommonsParliament Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee Maria Miller is now opening the backbench debate on International Women's Day, which is celebrated tomorrow. 100 years ago Nancy Astor was the first woman to take her seat in the House of Commons, Ms Miller says. The gender pay gap for women under 30 has all but disappeared she says, adding that great progress has been made with companies now forced to publish their gender pay gap: ""The issue is on the agenda"". But, she continues, ""there has not been enough progress at all"", and ""discrimination is still blatant."" Just one in three MPs are women, Ms Miller says, adding that this ""must be improved"". Public Accounts Committee report on Windrush House of CommonsParliament Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott says the most important sentence in the report is that the Home Office has reviewed 11,800 Caribbean cases, but that around 160,000 non-Caribbean Commonwealth cases were excluded. She asks Ms Hillier if she agrees that these large numbers of people cannot be ignored. Public Accounts Committee Chair Meg Hillier says the government must ""get a grip on this"", and that it is absolutely right that all those affected should receive support. ""It is very important that the government deals with this more effectively,"" she adds. Public Accounts Committee report on Windrush House of CommonsParliament Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Meg Hillier says the Home Office ""failed to understand the real life impacts"" that it was implementing. The government created ""huge problems"" for people by changing the rules, but were ""seemingly unaware"", she says, adding that the Home Office was warned about these problems and their potential impacts in 2014. ""Some people went on holiday to be told they could never come back,"" Ms Hillier adds. The government's Windrush Scheme ""has not helped everybody as it should have done"", she says. Public Accounts Committee report on Windrush MPs are now hearing a statement on the Commons Public Accounts Committee's (PAC) report on Windrush and the Home Office. The report says the Home Office had failed to ""take ownership"" of problems it had created. It also accused the department of  ""complacency"" and shirking its responsibility in response to theWindrush scandal. The committee of MPs further criticised a decision to exclude up to 160,000 non-Caribbean Commonwealth cases from a review carried out to identify how many people may have been affected. The Windrush scandal involved wrongful detentions and deportations of some members of the Windrush generation. The Home Office said it was determined to ""right the wrongs"" experienced.

Kashmir Statement House of CommonsParliament Shadow foreign office minister Liz McInnes calls for the prosecution of the head of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist group, Masood Azhar. ""Both sides have a responsibility to dial down the rhetoric, de-escalate the tension and avoid taking any further military action which could inflame the situation further,"" she says. A major incident will occur from which there will be no going back, Ms McInnes adds, calling for ""immediate talks to prevent further military action"". It is time to break the cycle of children growing up surrounded by conflict and in fear, she concludes, adding: ""peace and stability must be brought to the people of Kashmir."" Kashmir Statement House of CommonsParliament Foreign Office Minister Mark Field says there has been a ""welcome pause"" in the escalation of tensions, but the government remains ""deeply concerned"". The situation ""remains fragile"", and both militaries remain on heightened alert, he adds. ""The situation could move quickly back into crisis"", Mr Field says, noting reports that a deadly grenade attack was carried out this morning. The captured Indian Wing Commander being reunited with his family ""is an important and welcome step by Pakistan to reduce tensions"", he adds. He calls on both countries to find a diplomatic solution to resolve the conflict and to ensure longer term regional stability in Kashmir. The UK ""stands ready to support discussions"" between the two countries, he adds, but notes that it is ""not for the UK to supply a solution or act as a mediator"". Foreign Office Minister Mark Field is now delivering a statement on Kashmir. Yesterday it was announced thatPakistan has detained dozens of suspected militantsfollowing an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which sparked a crisis with India. They include the brother and another relative of Masood Azhar, the founder of the group that claimed the attack. The latest tensions began to unfold on 14 February when asuicide bomber killed more than 40 Indian soldiersin Indian-administered Kashmir. Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) said it carried out the attack, and on 26 February, India retaliated by carrying outair strikeson what it said was a JeM militant camp in Pakistan. Pakistan - which denies any involvement in the 14 February attack - said it had no choice but to respond and the day after the strike, a dogfight between the sides led to anIndian fighter jet being shot downin Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

Business Statement House of CommonsParliament SNP MP Pete Wishart asks how long MPs will have to debate the approval motion on the PM's Brexit deal that will be voted on next Tuesday. Andrea Leadsom says the debate would normally be for 90 minutes, but she ""expects"" to bring forward a motion to allow for a longer debate. She says she can confirm that ""each of the motions the prime minister has committed to next week"" will be amendable. The approval motion on the Brexit deal will be tabled on Monday, she adds. Business Statement House of CommonsParliament Shadow leader of the house Valerie Vaz says it would have been ""more appropriate"" to fulfill the PM's commitment on subsequent Brexit votes by scheduling them now. She alsoasks againwhether the post-Brexit Easter recess will be cancelled, and when a post-Brexit financial services bill will return to the Commons. Ministerspulled discussion of the billfrom Monday's agenda ahead of a likely defeat on amendments to secure tax transparency in British Crown dependencies. Andrea Leadsom says the subsequent votes on Brexit promised by the PM are ""contingent"" on the result of the vote next Tuesday. She repeats comments she has previously made about MPs Easter break being ""subject"" to the progress of legislation. On the financial services bill, she says it is right that the government can ""look properly"" at the amendments before they are voted on. Leader's Office tweets...  Allow Twitter content?

In a lighter Brexit moment, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox makes reference to his role in trying to make changes to the Northern Ireland backstop. Urgent question on knife crime House of CommonsParliament Labour's Yvette Cooper says there is ""no real sense from the government that they are doing anything on the scale and the urgency that is needed."" ""One summit is just not enough,"" she says, adding there should be ""weekly meetings"" on the issue either within the Home Office or Cobra, the government's emergency committee. Victoria Atkins says the government is working with police crime commissioners to reach vulnerable people who need help, and is putting money into new initiatives. ""There is more that we as a society can do to say it is not normal to carry knives,"" she says, but notes that the issue is ""complex"". Urgent question on knife crime House of CommonsParliament Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott says ""this is not a few newspaper stories, this is people's lives."" On the issue of police numbers, Ms Abbott says ""it is not just front line police officers, it is the need for community police officers"". She asks Ms Atkins if she agrees with Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick that ""there is a clear correlation between the fall in police numbers and the rise in violent crime"". ""We need more resources for the police and we need them now,"" she concludes. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Lord Falconer is coming under pressure to reject an offer from Labour to head an inquiry into the party's handling of anti-Semitism claims. Prominent Jewish Labour MPs have called for someone from outside the party to lead the probe. They say the former lord chancellor is not independent enough to take the action they say is needed. Lord Falconer rejects this - but says he is still deciding whether to accept the job. It comes as the Equalities and Human Rights Commission announced it was investigating allegations of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party that have been passed to it by the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism and the Jewish Labour Movement. Tories 'institutionally Islamophobic' 'You misled me,' Hodge tells Corbyn Anti-Semitism row MP suspension 'unfair' Labour peer in talks over anti-Semitism role A spokesman for the Commission said it could decide to work with the party to tackle anti-Semitism - or launch a formal inquiry into the party' handling of the issue, but its report was not likely to be published imminently. Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge has accused members of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's inner circle of interfering in disciplinary processes to make sanctions more lenient. She has referred tointernal documents leaked to the Observer,external, which show senior Labour figures last year opposed recommendations to suspend several party activists accused of anti-Semitism. This ""contradicts"" what Mr Corbyn had told her when she confronted him about it, she claims. A Labour Party spokesman said: ""Any suggestion that staff in the Leader's Office overturned recommendations on individual cases is categorically untrue."" He added: ""Since becoming general secretary,Jennie Formby has made procedures for dealing with complaints about anti-Semitism more robust,external. Dame Margaret also claims Lord Falconer had ""bombarded"" her with phone calls last summer, when she wasfacing disciplinary action- later dropped - over an angry confrontation with Mr Corbyn, to try to ""force me to give an apology"". A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Tories 'institutionally Islamophobic' Hodge stands by anti-Semitism attack on Corbyn How Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded He has said he wants to examine claims Labour is institutionally anti-Semitic and look out how to restore faith in the party's disciplinary procedures. He told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics that many Labour members believed the treatment of cases depended on ""who your friends are"". Margaret Hodge has written to Jeremy Corbyn about the party's approach to anti-Semitism She claimed his inquiry could be a repeat of the one carried out by Labour peer Baroness Chakrabarti in 2016, which found that the party was'not overrun by anti-Semitism'. ""We need somebody totally outside the Labour Party, otherwise this becomes another Chakrabarti fiasco,"" said Dame Margaret. In response, Lord Falconer said: ""I am shocked she thought I was trying to pressurise her into apologising for calling Jeremy Corbyn an anti-Semite. I was just trying to urge the party to drop their complaint against her."" He told BBC Politics Live presenter Jo Coburn he would be independent of the leadership and investigate any complaints of anti-Semitism in the strongest possible way, but he had not yet accepted the job. Speaking on the BBC News Channel, another prominent Jewish Labour MP Louise Ellman said Lord Falconer should think ""very carefully indeed"" before accepting the role of ""surveillance commissioner"" . She said Lord Falconer was ""highly respected"", but there were ""very big questions he should ask himself"" before taking up the post. ""His role is not clear,"" she said, ""and the degree of his independence isn't very clear."" Another Jewish Labour MP, Ruth Smeeth, told the Times that Labour's disciplinary processes were ""not fit for purpose"" and ""political interference on the side of anti-Semites is normal behaviour"".

"Struggling department store chain Debenhams has issued another profit warning as its sales continue to fall. In a trading update, the retailer said the forecast it made on 10 January, when it said full-year profits were set to hit analysts' expectations of about Â£8.2m, was ""no longer valid"". Like-for-like sales at the firm for the 26 weeks to 2 March were down 5.3%. Debenhams said talks with stakeholders to put it on a firmer footing were ""continuing constructively"". The retailer, which issued three profit warnings last year, said it would provide a further update with its interim results statement. Debenhams secures cash lifeline Debenhams 'trying to make shopping fun again' Debenhams may close stores this year Sergio Bucher, the chief executive of Debenhams, said: ""We are making good progress with our stakeholder discussions to put the business on a firm footing for the future. ""We still expect that this process will lead to around 50 stores closing in the medium term."" He said the business would need the help of landlords and local authorities to address rent and rate levels and lease commitments. Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter Oddly timed announcements to the stock exchange normally do not contain good news - a market maxim that Debenhams, the beleaguered department store chain, proved this morning. Companies generally make their statements at 7am on the dot, exactly an hour before the start of trading. Debenhams made this morning's announcement 45 minutes later, giving the impression that the statement had to be rushed out. There is a profit warning - perhaps not that much of a surprise given the uncertainty surrounding the company, and the bleak trading conditions across the High Street - but there is also a coded admission that the company is looking in earnest at a sweeping financial restructuring - a debt-for-equity swap, where shareholders are wiped out and lenders take control, or a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency that lets a company get rid of unwanted liabilities such as pensions and long-term leases. Of the two, the latter is more likely; Debenhams' equity - the total value of the shares listed on the London exchange - is just Â£36m. A month ago, the department store chain said it had been granted a cash injection of Â£40m to buy it extra time as it battled to secure a longer-term deal with lenders. At the time, the companycalled it a ""first step"",externaltowards a sustainable future. It is also reportedlytrying to accelerate plans to close storesand is expected to close around 20 outlets this year. High Street retailers have been under increasing pressure as more people choose to shop online and visit stores less. Laith Khalaf, from stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Debenhams' future is hanging in the balance, and with short sellers circling too [share traders who believe the shares have further to fall], we can expect share price movements to be volatile. ""The department store needs to stage a Lazarus-like recovery to turn things around from here."" Debenhams - which has 165 stores and employs about 25,000 people - reported a record pre-tax loss of Â£491.5m last year and said more recently that sales had fallen sharply over Christmas. Last year, rival department store chain House of Fraser fell into administration before Mike Ashley, the billionaire Sports Direct founder, bought its assets for Â£90m. Mr Ashley is also a major shareholder in Debenhams, with a 29% stake, and he recently joined together with investor Landmark Groupto vote the retailer's chairman and chief executive off the board. Mr Bucher is chief executive of Debenhams but no longer sits on the board.

"Ministers will resume efforts later to secure legally-binding changes to Theresa May's Brexit deal that might get MPs' backing in a week's time. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will meet EU officials in Brussels in search of guarantees over the backstop plan to avoid border checks in Ireland. Mr Cox has dismissed reports he has given up on securing a firm end date to ensure the UK is not stuck. MPs will vote on the deal by 12 March. The UK is currently scheduled to leave the European Union on 29 March. If MPs reject the withdrawal agreement for a second time, they will have the opportunity to vote on whether to go ahead in just over three weeks' time without any kind of negotiated deal. If they decide against, they will then have a vote on whether to extend negotiations and push the date of departure back by several months. Separately,Scottish and Welsh politicians have joined forcesto call for Brexit to be delayed in the first joint motion passed by the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly in 20 years. Brexit: A really simple guide Macron urges reforms to protect EU Toyota and BMW warn on no-deal Brexit Leading Brexiteers are hoping Mr Cox will be able to change his legal advice to satisfy them that the backstop - a controversial plan which will see the UK aligned with EU customs rules until the two sides' future relationship is agreed or alternative arrangements worked out - will not endure indefinitely. They have set a number of tests for the government's chief law officer and other ministers ahead of next week's votes. Many MPs are relying on the attorney general's legal advice Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that signals from the EU were ""reasonably positive"" but there was ""still a lot of work to do"". ""Time is very short, but what I would say compared to where we were a month ago the situation has been transformed,"" he said. ""We need substantive changes that would allow the attorney general to change his advice to the government that says that at the moment, theoretically, we could be trapped in the backstop indefinitely. ""And I think the EU understands that we need that change."" Michael Tomlinson, one of an eight-strong group of Conservative MPs who will scrutinise what is brought back from Brussels, said only significant changes to the backstop would do. ""We support the prime minister in seeking treaty-level changes,"" he said after the group's first meeting on Monday. A ""proper analysis"" of any new text would be needed to allow them to ""form a judgement"", he added. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the group of Eurosceptics, who are also lawyers, will ""pore over whatever Cox gets from Brussels"", adding: ""They will ultimately make a political call. The crucial bit for government is for the attorney general to feel he has enough to go on to change his legal opinion on the backstop."" Brexit: Your questions answered Struggling towns to get post-Brexit funding Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar has said talks were continuing in Brussels, but maintained that the only ""workable"" solution so far had been the backstop proposed in the withdrawal agreement. He said the Republic of Ireland will have to have ""difficult discussions"" with the EU and UK on how to avoid a hard border and protect the single market and customs union in the event of no deal. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Mr Cox took to Twitter on Monday after newspaper reports suggested he had turned his attention away from the concrete ""freedom clause"" demanded by many MPs to assurances that the backstop would fall away if talks on a future relationship break down. He said while some of the reporting was accurate, ""much more of it isn't"". He added: ""Complex and detailed negotiations cannot be conducted in public."" Meanwhile, Mr Barclayhas written to EU negotiator Michel Barnier on protecting UK and EU citizen's rights after Brexit,external, following government support in Parliament for an amendment from Tory MP Alberto Costa. In the letter, he said the government's position was that the withdrawal agreement provided ""the best way of providing confidence to citizens"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But, he said given their ""shared commitment to protecting the rights of citizens in all scenarios"", he would welcome Mr Barnier's views on the proposal to ring-fence rights. Mr Barclay added that more than 130,000 applications from EU nationals for settled status in the UK after Brexit have already been granted by the Home Office. Environment minister George Eustice, who quit his jobin order to oppose attempts to delay Brexit, has been replaced by Robert Goodwill, the MP for Scarborough and Whitby.

"Ms Onasanya was convicted in January at the Old Bailey An MP jailed for lying about a speeding offence has lost an appeal against her conviction. Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya wassentenced to three monthsin January for perverting the course of justice. Sir Brian Leveson said at the Royal Courts of Justice there was ""absolutely no basis"" for the challenge. Commons Speaker John Bercow has begun a recall petition process which could lead to Ms Onasanya's removal as an MP, with a by-election held to replace her. Ms Onasanya, 35, had claimed someone else was driving her car when it was seen speeding on 24 July 2017. The MP's Nissan Micra was clocked doing 41mph in a 30mph zone in Thorney, Cambridgeshire. The MP's Nissan Micra was caught by a speed camera in Thorney Representing herself, Ms Onasanya said: ""The charge against me was perverting the course of justice. I said from the outset, and I still maintain my innocence, that I did not do that."" Rejecting the appeal bid, Sir Brian said: ""This applicant was tried fairly by a jury, who rejected her evidence on oath. ""There was no error of law in the approach of the judge, whose directions... were clear and accurate, nor was there any other irregularity with the trial.

MP convicted of speeding driver lie MP jailed over speeding driver lie Jailed MP to appeal against conviction Addressing MPs in the House of Commons, Mr Bercow said the decision triggered the provision of the Recall of MPs Act 2015. ""I will accordingly be writing to the relevant petition officer to inform that person that Fiona Onasanya is therefore subject to a recall petition process,"" he said. This means a six-week petition will be open for Ms Onasanya's constituents. If 10% of them - about 7,000 people - sign the petition, a by-election will be held for the seat. Fiona Onasanya served less than four weeks at Bronzefield Prison in Surrey and was released on 26 February Ms Onasanya served less than four weeks at Bronzefield Prison in Surrey and was released on 26 February. The day before, the attorney general's office had concluded her sentencewas not unduly lenient. Jurors at the Old Bailey were told she colluded with her brother Festus, 34, who was jailed for 10 months after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice. Ms Onasanya stepped down as a party whip in November and was expelled from the Labour partyfollowing her conviction, when she became the first sitting MP for nearly three decades to be jailed. But she did not give up her Peterborough seat, a move which would have triggered a by-election. A Labour spokesman repeated the party's call for her to ""do the decent thing"" and stand down. ""If she refuses to stand down, Labour will actively support local residents in their efforts to trigger a by-election through a recall petition,"" he said.

"The work-to-rule action began on Monday but unions said it would be ""unlimited"" Traffic jams built up on Tuesday around the French port of Calais as customs officers worked to rule, carrying out tighter checks on lorries heading for the Channel Tunnel and the ferry port. The action, which began on Monday, is aimed at improving pay and staff numbers ahead of the UK's expected departure from the EU on 29 March. Dunkirk, further up the French coast, is also affected. ""Brexit is a catalyst for deeper anger,"" said one union official. The A16 motorway near Calais became snarled up early on Tuesday. The biggest queues were close to the ferry port as well as the Channel Tunnel exit, and freight companies warned of long waits at border checkpoints. For a second day, tailbacks of lorries stretched for several kilometres but ordinary traffic was still able to move. Drone footage from one TV reporter showed the extent of the queues near the Channel Tunnel. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivers hooted in frustration and Calais officials set up holding areas to deal with the weight of traffic. The local prefect banned until Wednesday lorries weighing more than 7.5 tonnes,externalfrom taking the westbound motorway route from near Dunkirk to the tunnel. Waiting times at Dunkirk port were more than two hours and every lorry was still being checked, ferry operator DFDS operator said. While 100% border checks had stopped at Calais, it said waiting time there was ""extensive"", with traffic being diverted through the town. As lorries came to a standstill there were reports that migrants had tried to board the vehicles to get across the Channel. Union officials said their ""unlimited"" action was aimed at ""showing what will happen with Brexit"", when the UK leaves the European Union. The possibility of a no-deal Brexit has led to fears of major disruption on both sides of the Channel. Brexit: What would no deal mean for lorry drivers? Customs checks simplified for no-deal Brexit The French government has announced plans to increase the number of customs officers in response to Brexit. The 300 deployed at the Channel Tunnel will be increased to 365 while the 64 at Calais port will almost double. But union officials say they want bigger numbers recruited because of Brexit, as well as better night pay and danger money. ""If the UK becomes a third country, checks will become more in-depth. This is the first, full demonstration of what will happen,"" said CGT union official Philippe Bollengier. This video can not be played Up to 90 lorries assembled at Manston airfield as part of a no-deal Brexit exercise The head of French customs, Rodolphe Gintz, said he was astonished by the ""work-to-rule strike"", which he was adamant had nothing to do with Brexit. ""They're targeting lorries that are leaving for the UK even though it's the country of destination that carries out the checks."" Budget minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said France was prepared and he insisted there would not be a ""bottleneck of the century"". The British government has also sought to allay fears, promising that lorries coming into the UK will be able to drive straight off ferries and Channel Tunnel trains by filling in a frontier declaration beforehand. In January, UK officials staged an exercise involving a convoy of 89 lorries at a disused airport in Kent as part of its contingency plans. Brexit: What would no deal mean for lorry drivers?

"An HIV vaccine that has the potential to protect people around the world from the virus has shown promising results. The treatment, which aims to provide immunity against various strains of the virus, produced an anti-HIV immune system response in tests on 393 people,a study in the Lancet found,external. It also protected some monkeys from a virus that is similar to HIV. More testing is now needed to determine if the immune response produced can prevent HIV infection in people. 'Mind-blowing' cows hold clue to beating HIV The man who saved thousands of people from HIV New antibody attacks 99% of HIV strains About 37 million people worldwide live with HIV or Aids, and there are an estimated 1.8 million new cases every year. But despite advances in treatment for HIV, both a cure and a vaccine for the virus have so far remained elusive. The drugPrep, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is effective at preventing HIV infection, but, unlike a vaccine, it needs to be taken regularly, even daily, to prevent the virus from taking hold. Inventing a vaccine has proved an immense challenge for scientists, in part because there are so many strains of the virus, but also because HIV is adept at mutating to elude attack from our immune systems. Previous attempts at HIV vaccines have been limited to specific strains of the virus found in certain parts of the world. But for this ""mosaic"" vaccine, scientists have developed a treatment made up of pieces of different HIV viruses. The hope is that it could offer much better protection against the almost unlimited number of HIV strains found across the world. In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, scientists tested various combinations of the mosaic vaccine in people aged 18 to 50 who did not have HIV and were healthy. The participants, from the US, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, and Thailand, received four vaccinations over the course of 48 weeks. All of the vaccine combinations produced an anti-HIV immune system response and were found to be safe. Scientists also carried out a parallel study where they gave rhesus monkeys the vaccine to protect them from getting simian-human immunodeficiency virus - a virus similar to HIV that infects monkeys. The mosaic vaccine combination that showed the most promise in humans was found to protect 67% of the 72 monkeys from getting the disease. ""These results represent an important milestone,"" said Dan Barouch, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the study. However, Prof Barouch also cautioned that the findings needed to be interpreted with caution. Though the vaccine triggered a response in the immune system of the people who took it, it is not clear if this would be enough to fight off the virus and prevent infection. ""The challenges in the development of an HIV vaccine are unprecedented, and the ability to induce HIV-specific immune responses does not necessarily indicate that a vaccine will protect humans from HIV infection,"" he added. Nevertheless, the promising results of the study mean researchers will next test the treatment on 2,600 women in southern Africa who are at risk of getting the illness - one of only five vaccines to make it to this stage of so-called efficacy trials. Only one vaccine has ever shown evidence of protecting against HIV. A vaccine tested in Thailand lowered the rate of human infection by 31%, but the effect was considered too low to advance it to common use. Dr Michael Brady, medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said it was early days for the vaccine but the signs were ""promising"". ""However, it's important to be cautious and be clear that there's a lot of work to do before an effective HIV vaccine is readily available."" Dr Brady added that in the meantime there were already tools that were effective for preventing the disease from spreading, such as contraception and treatments for HIV-positive people that prevent them from passing on the virus.

"The knife has long been the most common murder weapon in Britain, but increasingly it has become the weapon of choice for teenage gangs in the big cities. Two-thirds of police forces in England and Wales recently responded to a Freedom of Information request from Channel 4's Dispatches which showed that, in those force areas, the number of teenagers recorded as having killed with a knife had risen from 26 in 2016 to 46 last year. Patient records from hospitals in England show that seven years ago 141 teenagers were admitted after assaults with a sharp implement like a knife. Last year it was almost twice that - with a clear rising trend. In London, where knife crime incidents are higher than any other part of the country, both the victims and perpetrators of stabbings are disproportionately young black men from poorer neighbourhoods. In other cities the profile may be different. 'I don't know how many people I've stabbed' How Scotland stemmed the tide of knife crime The city curing violence like a disease It is a crime that feeds on itself. If one young person gets stabbed, similar youngsters locally are more likely to carry a knife for their own protection - and so the infection spreads. That idea of an infection is also prompting government proposals to deal with knife crime in the same way you might deal with a public health emergency. It means still treating each case as a crime, but also looking to stop knife crime before it starts - in families and places such as schools and youth centres. Evidence suggests the way to stop young people being stabbed does not lie exclusively with the criminal justice system.

"Antiretroviral drugs are currently used in HIV treatment to kill any active virus The outstanding progress in boosting the immune system to treat cancer may help unlock a cure for HIV, according to scientists meeting in Paris. The body's normal defences struggle to clear the body of HIV and cancer. But the rapidly emerging field of immunotherapy has seen some patients with terminal cancer go into complete remission. The hope is that a similar approach could clear someone of HIV, although some experts have urged caution. HIV treatment requires daily antiretroviral drugs to kill any active virus. Left unchecked, HIV can destroy the immune system, causing Aids. A cure is currently impossible because drugs and the immune system fail to detect the sleeping or ""latent"" HIV hiding in the body's cells. Nobel Prize winner and co-discoverer of HIV, Francoise Barre-Sinoussi, told the BBC: ""One of the mechanisms why [latently infected cells] persist is the fact they are proliferating very similar to tumour cells. ""Those cells are expressing molecules that are the same molecules that are expressed on tumour cells. ""So that raises the question whether we could develop a strategy for HIV-cure similar to the novel treatment in the field of cancer."" She is one of the scientists attending the HIV and Cancer Cure Forum in Paris. Prof Sharon Lewin, the director of the Doherty Institute in Australia, agrees there is much to learn from cancer. She said: ""There are a lot of parallelsâ¦ I think it's huge."" 'Mind-blowing' cows hold clue to beating HIV Aids deaths halve as more get drugs HIV life expectancy now 'near normal' Cancers evolve tricks to survive an assault by the immune system. They can produce proteins on their surface, such as PD-L1, which disable immune cells attacking the tumour. A new class of immunotherapy drugs called ""checkpoint inhibitors"" allow the immune system to keep on fighting and the results have been remarkable. In one trial, a fifth of patients with terminal melanoma had no sign of the disease after immunotherapy. However, only about 50 people with HIV have been given immunotherapy to treat their cancer. So there is little evidence of immunotherapy drugs and their effect on HIV. Prof Lewin has started doing the research in the laboratory and thinks immunotherapy drugs could reinvigorate an immune system that has become tired of fighting HIV. She said: ""The parts of the immune system that recognise HIV are often exhausted T-cells, they express immune checkpoint markers. ""In the laboratory, if you then put those cells in with an immune checkpoint blocker, the T-cells do regain function."" Antiretroviral therapy combines three or more drugs which stop the HIV virus from progressing She said there was emerging evidence that the drugs also activated HIV lying dormant inside immune cells. Prof Lewin said: ""We want the virus to wake up, any virus that wakes up gets killed [by antiretroviral drugs]."" However this is a new concept in HIV that has so far delivered nothing for patients. And there are important differences between the challenges of cancer and HIV immunology. In cancer, the immune system can recognise the threat but is not powerful enough to do anything about it, but the immune system does not recognise latently infected HIV cells at all. Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the area is ""very hot"" right now in cancer. But he cautioned: ""We have to be careful we don't assume that things that work in cancer are going to work in HIV. ""HIV is so different, that even though it's worth exploring, I wouldn't want people to think this is going to be equally successful in HIV.""

The weapon was found by a police dog in a search after the disorder at Runshaw College in Leyland, Lancashire, on Monday. Six people were arrested after police were tipped off that a group was heading to the college ""with weapons"". Footage on social media appears to show students fleeing a confrontation with masked men. The gang of around 12 young men - some brandishing knives wearing balaclavas and face masks - arrived at the college at about 16:00 GMT to confront a rival group. Three men in a parked car were arrested nearby. A fourth person who made off on foot was also arrested. Two more were held on Monday evening, with one picked up in a car on the M55 and one arrested in Preston. A 17-year-old student was ""nicked on the arm"" during an altercation in the college grounds. He was treated in Chorley Hospital but his wound was not serious. The suspects, two men aged 18 and three 17-year-old boys, all from Preston, and a third 18-year-old man from Kirkham, were arrested on suspicion of public order offences and later released on bail. A staff member said the college had been tipped off that an armed group was on its way to the college Regular patrols are visible in the vicinity of the college this morning, as police work to reassure students. Officers say their focus will now move to the investigation and they will  be speaking to the six people in custody over the course of the day. They are also keen to hear from anybody who witnessed what happened or has any mobile footage of the incident. The MP for South Ribble Seema Kennedy has raised the issue with the Home Secretary.

A second tweet published by the president shortly afterwards reads simply: ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"" The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee oversees the US justice system, including federal law enforcement agencies. Its Democratic chairman, Jerry Nadler, said in a statement: ""This is a critical time for our nation, and we have a responsibility to investigate these matters and hold hearings for the public to have all the facts. ""Over the last several years, President Trump has evaded accountability for his near-daily attacks on our basic legal, ethical and constitutional rules and norms. Investigating these threats to the rule of law is an obligation of Congress."" Seven legal headaches for Donald Trump US House to begin Trump abuse inquiry President Trump has previously dismissed Mr Nadler's probe as a ""political hoax"". In a separate development on Tuesday, New York State insurance regulators announced they were issuing subpoenas to the Trump Organization's longtime insurance broker. The move by the New York Department of Financial Services comes after Mr Trump's ex-personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress and alleged that multiple tax and finance crimes were directed by Mr Trump. And Congressman Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat who sits on the powerful Ways and Means Committee, said his party would formally demand Mr Trump's tax returns this month, report US media. Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in January. More than five House committees are now investigating alleged attempts by Russia to meddle in the 2016 election campaign, the president's tax returns and potential conflicts of interest involving Mr Trump's family. Those inquiries are in addition to the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is expected to file his report into Russian election interference and associated matters soon. What might 'Mueller report' look like? Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Mr Nadler's committee has the power to conduct impeachment hearings, which can ultimately lead to a president's removal. He said it was ""very clear"" that the president had obstructed justice and indulged in other abuses of power but added that it was too early to discuss removing the president from office. Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, long-time Trump personal assistant Rhona Graff, ex-White House counsel Don McGahn and current Trump personal lawyer Jay Sekulow are on the list of names released by the House Judiciary Committee. Both of Mr Trump's sons are on the list of requests Donald Trump Jr is also on the list. He has previously been forced by members of Congress to answer questions about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, in which he sat down with a Kremlin-linked lawyer who had offered dirt on Mr Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton. Others on the list include another of Mr Trump's sons, Eric, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former aides Steve Bannon and Hope Hicks, and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange have also been sent documents requests by the committee. The organisation, which publishes secret information and news leaks provided by anonymous sources, published emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and released them during the 2016 campaign, causing political embarrassment to Mrs Clinton and her campaign team. Roger Stone, Mr Trump's confidant, who is currently under investigation by Special Counsel Mueller for allegedly lying to prosecutors about his communications with Wikileaks during the presidential campaign, has also received a request from the committee. After Mr Stone's arrest in January, he denied that he had played a role as an intermediary between the campaign and Wikileaks. The documents would be used by the committee to determine which witnesses to call to testify in the coming months, a counsel for the House Judiciary Committee said. If they do not comply within the next few weeks, subpoenas ordering them to attend will be issued. With his announcement, Mr Nadler is taking a scattergun approach to his investigations of the president, the BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher says. He says the press release announcing the investigations doesn't mention Russia or its alleged election meddling by name. But the key components of the collusion allegations - the 2016 Trump Tower meeting, the WikiLeaks email dumps, changes to Ukraine policy in the Republican Party platform, and the Trump-Russia business dealings - are all over the document requests.

"QuadrigaCX founder Gerald Cotten died without passing on passwords for his laptop Efforts to recover millions in crypto-cash from the digital wallets of a man who died without revealing passwords to access them have hit a snag. The wallets have been found to be empty. The discovery was made by a firm appointed tooversee QuadrigaCX after the deathof founder Gerald Cotten. It expected to find the wallets full of C$180m ($137m; Â£105m) in crypto-cash deposited by the coin exchange's customers. Mr Cotten, who died in India in December, had sole responsibility for handling the funds and coins passing through the site. The master key to unlock the wallets washeld on Mr Cotten's laptopbut he died without letting anyone else know the passphrase to unlock the device. Most of the digital cash that customers deposited with the exchange was supposed to be kept in ""cold storage"" to prevent it being hacked or stolen. The cash represented the virtual currency holdings of 115,000 QuadrigaCX customers. Mr Cotten's death forced the closure of QuadrigaCX and auditor Ernst & Young was appointed to wind it up. Its investigation has secured access to Mr Cotten's laptop but also revealed that the digital wallets had been cleaned out months before he died. QuadrigaCX held the digital cash reserves of thousands of customers In a report on its discovery, E&Y investigators,externalsaid they did not know what had happened to the bitcoins they expected to find in storage. However, the company said, it found evidence that Mr Cotten had 14 other user accounts ""created outside the normal process"" that may have been used to trade on the QuadrigaCX exchange. E&Y is now trying to gather information about the trading done via these other accounts to see if it can trace how much crypto-cash passed through them. A reward of $100,000 has been offered for information about where the exchange's cash has gone. ""The unregulated nature of cryptocurrency exchanges, plus the fact that so many use them to hold their coins rather than just exchange them, invites fraud,"" said security expert Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey. ""We really need exchanges to be regulated,"" he said. ""The big question is who would do that."" He added: ""If anyone is using an exchange to hold their coins I would encourage then to do the most in-depth due diligence they possibly can.""

"The government has launched its first cervical screening advertising campaign in England, as the number of women having checks has hit a 20-year low. The campaign - being run by Public Health England - has avoided the term ""smear test"" amid concern it may be putting people off. Officials said the term was outdated and hope the term cervical screening will ""normalise"" the procedure. Adverts will run on TV, radio and online for the next eight weeks. The campaign stresses the screening is basically a health check for the cervix and shows a woman being reminded by family members and friends to go for testing. Figures last year showed just over 71% of women aged 25 to 64 had been screened at regular enough intervals. This video can not be played What happens during cervical screening? PHE director of screening Anne Mackie said the campaign was about ""breaking down barriers"". She said there were a variety of reasons for not attending but there had been a conscious move away from the term ""smear test"". ""The technical process used today no longer smears the sample of cells from the cervix on to a glass plate,"" she said. ""We now put cells that we collect into a tube of liquid, so technically 'smear' is incorrect."" The advert asks women not to ignore their invites for screening Ms Mackie said the overarching message of the campaign - cervical screening saves lives - was much more ""clear and direct"" and ""hopefully helps to normalise the term"". She added: ""The campaign shows how cervical screening is a vital preventative test which can identify potentially harmful cells and treat them before they have a chance to develop into cancer, giving us the opportunity to stop cancer before it starts."" Masters student Isha Webber, 29, from London, attended her first screening appointment when she was 25. It came back all clear. A few years later, when she was screened again, she was found to have abnormal cells that required treatment to remove. ""I can't reinforce enough how important it is to stay on top of your cervical screening appointments,"" she said. ""When you get your invitation letter, book right away and don't delay. ""I am so glad that I went when I did and had those abnormal cells removed. ""I hate to think what may have been the case if I delayed. ""I now talk to as many people as possible about my experience, to raise awareness of the importance of screening."" The NHS target is for 80% of women aged 25 to 49 to be tested every three years and the same proportion aged 50 to 64 to be screened every five years. But in some areas uptake has dropped below 50%. Experts have put it down to: embarrassment a lack of awareness just putting it off Research by the charity Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust suggested young women were embarrassed to attend because of: their body shape the appearance of their vulva concerns over smell A third said they would not go if they had not waxed or shaved their bikini area. And about 15% said they would miss their screening test for a gym class or a waxing appointment. Every year about 2,600 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and nearly 700 die from the disease. The advertising campaign is just one element of the government's approach to increase uptake. A review of invitation letters, leaflets and results letters is under way, while pilots to trial text messaging reminders have started. Some areas have also started to offer weekend and evening screening. Government advisers are also considering whether to recommend self-testing. Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust chief executive Robert Music said: ""We know attending screening isn't always easy for a wide range of reasons, yet cervical screening can be lifesaving as it can detect changes in the cervix before they become cancerous."" The Scottish government and NHS Scotland ran acervical screening advert,externalin 2017, telling women to ""stop fannying about"" and ""nip cancer in the bud"". While it used the term smear test, theNHS Health Scotland website,externalprimarily refers to it as cervical screening. The Cervical Screening Wales,externalsite refers to both cervical screening and smear tests, as doesthe official site in Northern Ireland,external.

"This video can not be played Toyota Europe boss in stark no-deal Brexit warning Car giants Toyota and BMW have both warned a no-deal Brexit threatens the production of their cars in the UK. BMWtold Sky News,externalit could consider moving production of its Mini from the UK in a no-deal scenario. Separately, the head of Toyota's European operations said a negative outcome could put future investment at its UK factory near Derby at risk. Johan van Zyl told the BBC that if the Brexit ""hurdles"" are too high it would undermine Toyota's competitiveness. Speaking to Sky News, BMW board member Peter Schwarzenbauer said if a ""worst case"" no-deal scenario happened, ""we would need to consider what it exactly means for us in the long run"". ""For Mini, this is really a danger,"" he added. Asked if BMW could move Mini production out of Cowley near Oxford, he said: ""We at least have to consider it."" Earlier, BMW chief executive Harold Krueger told the BBC that the carmaker was preparing ""for a lot of scenarios"" and was ""very flexible"" in its approach to production. He said the company had ""reserved some air flight capacity for the transportation of bigger materials"" and had prepared its suppliers. ""The logistics network is very flexible to adjust to changes,"" he said. This video can not be played How British is a Mini? The warnings come after Japanese rivals Nissan and Honda both recently dealt major blows to the UK motor industry. Last month,Nissan reversed a decision to build a new car in the UK, andHonda said it was closing its Swindon plant, although both cited non-Brexit reasons. The world's fastest road car revealed - and it's electric Car industry revs up for an electrified motor show The motor industry has become increasingly outspoken on the consequences of a no-deal as the 29 March approaches. Aston Martin's chief executive Andy Palmer this week warned of""a bloodbath"" for the industry. Ford warned thatleaving without a deal would be ""catastrophic""and the body that represents the UK motor industry, the SMMT said investment had already been hit. The firm employs 2,500 people at the Burnaston plant Like many other car industry executives, Mr van Zyl said it was vital that there was frictionless trade with the European Union. Speaking at the Geneva Motor Show, he said: ""We want a regulatory framework between the UK and EU which is the same. We hope still that that can be the outcome."" But he admitted that, with just over three weeks before the UK is due to leave the EU, ""we thought that by now we would have had a decision already about what is going to happen"". He said Toyota would overcome any short-term problems at its Burnaston car plant near Derby, such as logistics, caused by leaving without a deal. But preparation for no-deal has been costly, he said, and in the long term things could be ""very difficult"". Could work at Burnaston dry up after the current production cycle comes to an end? ""The long term effect could be that if it [Brexit] is very negative, that outcome is possible."" Constantly improving competitiveness is vital, he said, adding: ""But if the hurdles are becoming so high that you cannot achieve it then of course you can't avoid it [hitting investment]."" The Brexit uncertainty comes after a Â£240m investment in a new Corolla and the ramping up of production at Burnaston. ""It's critical that we don't have any disruptions in the production process,"" Mr van Zyl said. ""So the next week or two is going to be critical.""

"Scott Clayton was working part-time when he became a customer of one of the UK's rent-to own firms. Having entered into an agreement he ended up paying four times the value for a TV. But experiences such as his should come to an end next month after plans to cap rent-to-own shops have been confirmed by the City watchdog. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will limit the interest that customers pay to no more than the product's cost. The rules - which will apply to new goods from 1 April - will mean if a cooker costs Â£300, borrowers will pay no more than Â£600 in total, including the cost of credit. The move will save some of the UK's most vulnerable consumers millions of pounds from April, the FCA said. They come too late to Scott who rues the day he encountered rent-to-own. ""I wish there was a cap back then. I would have been a lot better off now,"" he said. He went to rival chain Perfect Home after his TV broke. ""The ticket price was Â£450 for a 42 inch TV, but by the end I paid about Â£2,000."" Under the new rules,externalthe interest charged will only be as much as the cost of the product, but the price of the goods themselves will also be limited. Shops will be able to charge no more than the median - the middle price - of three mainstream retailers, including delivery and installation charges. Rent-to-own stores offer people the chance to buy items they need for their home - such as TVs or washing machines - through smaller, regular payments, instead of paying for the goods in one go. But once interest charges have been added, some rent-to-own consumers have ended up paying more than four times the retail price they would have paid in normal shops. Price cap plan for rent-to-own sector New crackdown on high-interest lending Rent-to-own shops will still be able to charge for insurance and warranties on top of that, but the FCA said it would stop firms from increasing their prices for insurance premiums, extended warranties, or arrears charges, to recoup lost revenue from the price cap. ""The measures come into force from 1 April and we will be keeping a close watch on firms' compliance,"" said Mr Woolard. ""We will review the impact of the price cap in 2020 and if further work is needed to protect these customers we are prepared to intervene again."" The main companies offering rent-to-own goods are Brighthouse and PerfectHome. A BrightHouse spokesperson said: ""We remain committed to offering our customers, who are excluded from mainstream credit, great service and the best prices possible for the products they require. ""Over the coming months we will fully implement the changes that have been confirmed today."" A spokesperson at PerfectHome said: ""Our customers will start seeing changes to our agreement terms for new products in the coming weeks, in readiness for the start date set by the FCA, 1 April 2019. ""The changes will apply to new agreements only; customers with existing agreements will not be affected."" This video can not be played Michele Jacques found rent-to-own meant paying over the odds for her cooker MoneySavingExpert founder Martin Lewis welcomed the confirmation. ""The rent-to-own sector is perhaps the most visceral example of the poverty premium in the UK,"" he said. ""The fact that the most vulnerable with the least, pay four times as much for their electrical and white goods as everyone else is simply unjust, and it's rightfully about time that the FCA cracks down on it."" Andrew Hagger, finance analyst from Moneycomms, also welcomed the news. He said: ""It's good to see the regulator stepping in to protect some of the most financially vulnerable in our society. ""These people have been taken advantage of for far too long, mainly because the retailers know such customers often have nowhere else to turn. ""The credit cap of 100% is a welcome move and it's pleasing that the FCA won't let these retailers recoup their money via the back door by increasing the cost of add on insurances,"" he added.

"The average annual bill for a Band D home will increase by Â£75.60 from April Council tax bills in England will increase by an average of 4.5% from April, reaching more than Â£1,800 in some regions, research suggests. It is the second highest rise in a decade, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa) said. The Local Government Association said cuts had left councils ""little choice"". The government said they were ""responsible for managing their own resources."" A survey of 312 councils by Cipfa found eight out of 10 will impose the maximum increase permitted. Local authorities in England are allowed to raise their council tax by 2.99%, plus a further 2% if they provide social care.Any that want to exceed this must hold a referendum. Cipfa said the annual Band D bill would rise by an average of Â£75.60. The increase varies from an average of Â£71 in London to Â£86 in the north-east. Funding for the policemakes up about a third of the increase, with police and crime commissioners permitted to double their precept from Â£12 to Â£24. In 2018-19 bills increased by an average of 5.1%, the largest rise for 10 years. The effect of the referendum cap meant that bills fell in real terms between 2011 and 2015 because they did not increase in line with inflation. Gloucestershire County Council was one of the authorities to approve the full 4.99% increase. The council plans to pump more money into children's services and adult social care,the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Lewisham in London, Birmingham City Council, North Yorkshire County Council andKent County Councilare among those where council tax will rise by 4.99%. Those not rising by the maximum include Cornwall (3.99%) and York, which voted for a 3.25% increase. Rob Whiteman, chief executive of Cipfa, said the increase was a reflection of the ""incredible"" financial pressures faced by local authorities and the police. ""Local authorities have faced the most significant cuts to spending over the last ten years,"" Mr Whiteman said. ""Despite the government's announcement that austerity is ending, for local authorities this is clearly not the case."" About a third of the increase in the average council tax bill will go to the police Councillor Richard Watts from the Local Government Association said councils had lost ""60p out of every Â£1"" the government had provided for services since 2010. ""Faced with such funding pressures, many councils feel they have little choice but to ask residents to pay more council tax again this year to help them try to protect their local services,"" he said. Council spending cuts, in seven charts How the cost of living could overwhelm us Every penny earned so far goes on rent A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said: ""Councils, not central government, are responsible for managing their own resources. ""Taxpayers can veto excessive increases via a local referendum."" The local referendum rule only applies in England. The National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament have the power to cap local authorities' council tax rises. In Cardiff,council leaders set an increase of 4.9%while Pembrokeshire saw a 9.92% rise and Conwy 9.6%. Taxpayers in Scotlandwill see bills rise up to 4.79%.

"Margaret Hodge has written to Jeremy Corbyn about the party's approach to anti-Semitism Jewish Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge has expressed fresh concerns about how her party is handling accusations of anti-Semitism. In a letter to Jeremy Corbyn, she claims she has been misled over assurances that his office was not involved in any disciplinary process. ""Either you have intentionally misled me or your staff have been misleading you,"" she complained. Labour has dismissed her suggestion as ""categorically untrue"". Dame Margaret's letter refers to areport by the Observer claiming that internal documents,externalshowed senior Labour figures last year opposed recommendations to suspend several party activists accused of anti-Semitism. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Tories 'institutionally Islamophobic' Hodge stands by anti-Semitism attack on Corbyn How Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded The Barking MP wrote that she had been left ""bewildered"" by the account in the newspaper which ""contradicts what you told me to my face last week"".

Referring to a discussion she had with Mr Corbyn, she said: ""I distinctly remember it being said that it would be appalling if staff in the Leader's Office intervened or had a role in complaints. ""I was given categorical assurances that this does not happen and has never happened. ""However, it is clear from the whistleblower's account [in the Observer] that your staff did intervene and have had a direct role in complaints."" Dame Margaret also says she is disappointed that Labour peer Lord Falconer is being considered to lead an investigation into anti-Semitism in the party. Luciana Berger left Labour, claiming the party was institutionally anti-Semitic Dame Margaret told BBC Radio 4's Today that Mr Corbyn had given her ""absolute, copper-bottomed undertakings that there was no interference in the complaints process by his inner circle, by his top team"". However, she claimed ""a whole number of his top team, not just one person, lots of them"" were involved in decisions about individual complaints, adding: ""They interfere and they lower the sanctions. People aren't suspended, they're just given a warning letter. ""What is so awful about this is that Jeremy always proclaims zero tolerance of anti-Semitism. When it comes to the actual cases, if they're his mates he doesn't demonstrate zero tolerance."" She added she had seen ""so much evidence"" of political interference, adding: ""Trust in him is gone."" Dame Margaret also questioned whether Lord Falconer was the appropriate person to conduct an inquiry into the party's handling of anti-Semitism allegations. The former Lord Chancellor is considering whether to take on the role and wants reassurances from the party that he will be given the resources he says he needs. Labour is seeking to appoint Lord Falconer to carry out an inquiry He has said he wants to examine claims Labour is institutionally anti-Semitic and how to restore faith in the party's disciplinary procedures. He told BBC Radio 5's Pienaar's Politics many Labour members believed the treatment of cases depended on ""who your friends are"". But Dame Margaret said she did not think Lord Falconer was independent enough. She claimed his inquiry could be a repeat of the one carried out by Labour peer Baroness Chakrabarti in 2016, which found that the party was'not overrun by anti-Semitism'. Tories 'institutionally Islamophobic' Anti-Semitism row MP suspension 'unfair' Labour peer in talks over anti-Semitism role ""We need somebody totally outside the Labour Party otherwise this becomes another Chakrabarti fiasco,"" said Dame Margaret. She claimed Lord Falconer had ""bombarded"" her with phone calls last summer, when she wasfacing disciplinary action- later dropped - over an angry confrontation with Mr Corbyn, to try to ""force me to give an apology"". In response, Lord Falconer said: ""I am shocked she thought I was trying to pressurise her into apologising for calling Jeremy Corbyn and anti-Semite. I was just trying to urge the party to drop their complaint against her."" He told BBC Politics Live presenter Jo Coburn he would be independent of the leadership and investigate any complaints of anti-Semitism in the strongest possible way, but he had not yet accepted the job.

Ms Berger said she had come to the ""sickening conclusion"" that the party had become institutionally anti-Semitic and that she was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" to stay. Mr Corbyn has insisted he is ""committed to eliminating anti-Semitism wherever it exists"". ""Prejudice and hatred of Jewish people has no place whatsoever in the Labour Party,"" he said earlier this year. Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson has spoken of a ""complete loss of trust"" in the party's processes and has asked MPs to forward anti-Semitism complaints to him as well as the party. That call promptedMs Formby to accuse Mr Watson of ""unacceptable"" behaviourand claim he was trying to undermine her work.

"Louella Fletcher-Michie was filmed over several hours as her health deteriorated A man jailed for manslaughter after giving his girlfriend drugs at a music festival and filming her as she died will appeal, his barrister has said. Ceon Broughton gave Louella Fletcher-Michie, 24, the daughter of Holby City actor John Michie, a fatal ""bumped up"" amount of Class A drug 2CP. She was found dead in woodland near the Bestival site in Dorset in 2017. Broughton, 30, will appeal against his conviction and eight-and-a-half-year sentence, Stephen Kamlish QC said. Mr Kamlish told the BBC an application was being prepared which will go before a judge to decide whether to grant a hearing at the Court of Appeal. Ceon Broughton was found guilty of manslaughter and supplying the Class A drug 2CP Jurors heard Broughton, of Island Centre Way, Enfield, London, did little to help his yoga teacher girlfriend for six hours as he feared breaching a suspended jail term for knife possession. The trial at Winchester Crown Court was also told the couple liked to film each other when they were taking drugs. Broughton - a rapper known as CeonRPG who has worked with artists including Skepta - filmed Ms Fletcher-Michie as she became ""disturbed, agitated, and then seriously ill"" and continued recording after her apparent death on 11 September 2017. This video can not be played In footage shown to jurors by the defence, Louella Fletcher-Michie was filmed playing with fairy lights in a tent at the festival Mr Michie shouted ""evil, evil"" and ""not even sorry"" at Broughton during an angry exchange at court during the trial His defence team urged jurors to consider the evidence of medical expert Prof Charles Deakin who said he could not ""beyond reasonable doubt"" confirm whether medical intervention would have saved Ms Fletcher-Michie's life but on the ""balance of probability"" it was likely ""while she was still breathing"". Broughton was found guilty of manslaughter and supplying the Class A drug 2CP by unanimous verdict last Thursday. Boyfriend jailed for Bestival drugs death Bestival death accused 'delayed' helping He had already pleaded guilty to supplying 2CP to Ms Fletcher-Michie and her friend at Glastonbury Festival in 2017.

"This video can not be played The confrontation at the college was filmed and videos posted on social media A machete has been found near a sixth form college that an armed gang stormed for a ""pre-arranged fight"". The weapon was found by a police dog in a search after the disorder at Runshaw College in Leyland, Lancashire, on Monday. Six people were arrested after police were tipped off that a group was heading to the college ""with weapons"". Footage on social media appears to show students fleeing a confrontation with masked men. The gang of around 12 young men - some brandishing knives wearing balaclavas and face masks - arrived at the college at about 16:00 GMT to confront a rival group. Three men in a parked car were arrested nearby. A fourth person who made off on foot was also arrested. Two more were held on Monday evening, with one picked up in a car on the M55 and one arrested in Preston. A 17-year-old student was ""nicked on the arm"" during an altercation in the college grounds. He was treated in Chorley Hospital but his wound was not serious. The suspects, two men aged 18 and three 17-year-old boys, all from Preston, and a third 18-year-old man from Kirkham, were arrested on suspicion of public order offences and later released on bail. A staff member said the college had been tipped off that an armed group was on its way to the college Regular patrols are visible in the vicinity of the college this morning, as police work to reassure students. Officers say their focus will now move to the investigation and they will  be speaking to the six people in custody over the course of the day. They are also keen to hear from anybody who witnessed what happened or has any mobile footage of the incident. The MP for South Ribble Seema Kennedy has raised the issue with the Home Secretary. A search was carried out after reports of a machete-style knife being used in the attack.

"Your heart can be damaged after a sad event and it may be your brain's doing, experts believe. Swiss researchers have been studying people with a rare and unusual condition called broken heart syndrome. This weakening and failing of the heart happens suddenly, often after a stressful or emotional event such as bereavement. It is little understood but the work in theEuropean Heart Journal,externalsuggests the mind's response to stress plays a part. Also known as takotsubo syndrome - referring to the shape of the heart in people with this condition, which resembles a Japanese pot with the same name -broken heart syndrome,externalcan be brought on by shock. It's different from a heart attack caused by blocked blood vessels, but has similar symptoms, including breathlessness and chest pain. Often, an unhappy event is the trigger, but exciting big events, such as a wedding or new job, have been linked with it too. Some people won't have, or be able to identify, a specific event that caused the condition. Can you die from a broken heart? Broken heart syndrome 'lasting impact' Moments of joy can damage heart It can be temporary, with the heart muscle recovering over days, weeks or months, but for some it can be deadly. It is thought to affect around 2,500 people every year in the UK. Scan of a takotsubo heart, showing the unusual, characteristic shape The exact cause is not known, but experts believe it could be linked to raised levels of stress hormones, such as adrenaline. Dr Jelena Ghadri and colleagues at University Hospital Zurich looked at what was happening in the brains of 15 patients with broken heart syndrome. Brain scans showed up noticeable differences compared with scans from 39 healthy, control patients. There was less communication between brain regions involved with controlling emotions and unconscious or automatic body responses, such as heartbeat. These brain areas are the ones that are thought to control our response to stress. Dr Ghadri said: ""Emotions are processed in the brain so it is conceivable that the disease originates in the brain with top-down influences on the heart."" The exact pathway is still not completely understood, so more work is needed. Scans of the patients' brains before or at the time they developed broken heart syndrome were not available, so the researchers cannot say whether the decreased communication between brain regions caused the takotsubo syndrome or vice versa. Joel Rose, chief executive of Cardiomyopathy UK, said: ""This is an important piece of research that will help to shape our understanding of a form of cardiomyopathy that is often overlooked and remains something of an enigma. ""The people with takotsubo cardiomyopathy that we support will certainly welcome this new effort to understand the role that the brain plays in this condition and why some people are more susceptible than others. We hope that this research will lead to further focus in this area and greater collaboration between neuroscientists and cardiologists."" British Heart Foundation-funded researcher Prof Dana Dawson, from the University of Aberdeen, said: ""These findings support something we have long suspected - that there is a brain-heart interaction in takotsubo.""

"Disabled pensioners will no longer face ""unnecessary"" repeat assessments to continue receiving benefits, the work and pensions secretary has announced. From spring, 270,000 people in Britain will not have personal independence payments (PIPs) regularly reviewed. But a disability group said millions of younger people would ""still be stuck in a failing system"". Amber Rudd also plans to increase a government target for getting a million more disabled people into work by 2027. In a speech on Tuesday to the disability charity Scope, Ms Rudd said her blind father's experience influenced her plans to ""level the terrain"" for disabled people. ""My father became blind in 1981. For 36 years his blindness was a normal part of my family's life. Of my life,"" she said. ""Disabled pensioners have paid into our system for their whole lives and deserve the full support of the state when they need it most."" Amber Rudd will said her father's experience of blindness informed her decision Under the current system, disabled people's benefits under the PIP system require regular reviews, annually or every few years, with less severe or temporary disabilities checked more frequently. Figures from October 2018 show there were approximately 28,000 pensioners claiming PIP in Scotland and 22,500 claims in Wales. The remaining 220,000 recipients were based in England, with the largest number of claims - 43,000 - in the North West. The result of the assessment determines the payments people receive to cope with the extra costs of living with a disability, such as mobility aids or adaptations in the home. Pensioners will only face checks every 10 years and may be able to fill in a form rather than seeing an assessor in person under the new system. In Northern Ireland, the Department for Communitieshas confirmed that 7,500 people will no longer have to be regularly reassessedfollowing Ms Rudd's pledge. Disabled campaigners have criticised the PIP reviews forfailing to take proper account of mental health conditionsand forputting disabled people's independence at risk by cutting support. Ms Rudd said that she wants to ""significantly improve"" the support for disabled people from the Department for Work and Pensions. ""The benefits system should be the ally of disabled people. It should protect them and ensure that the assistance the government provides arrives in the right place to those who need it most,"" she said. She also announced a small scale trial to test the feasibility of bringing together the PIP assessments and Work Capability Assessments into one, in order to create a more ""joined-up"" approach. The work capability assessment determines what benefits people receive if their disabilities or illnesses affect their ability to work. Ms Rudd also said she plans to review the government's target to get one million more disabled people in work by 2027 to make it ""more ambitious"". This video can not be played Daphne Faloon, 45, shares the story of her struggle to claim PIPs Genevieve Edwards, director of external affairs at the MS Society, said 83% of people with multiple sclerosis who appeal against their PIP assessments are successful - and that demonstrates ""how bad the current assessment process is"". ""While it's good news that older disabled people will no longer have to go through unnecessary and stressful reassessments, millions of others will still be stuck in a failing system,"" she said. Ms Edwards said that merging the two forms of assessment without fixing their flaws would be like ""harnessing two donkeys to a farm cart and expecting it to transform into a race chariot"". Mark Hodgkinson, chief executive at disability equality charity Scope, said he welcomed the change to PIP assessments but said a ""more radical overhaul"" to the benefits system for disabled people was needed. ""Disabled people also want to see action taken to scrap counterproductive benefit sanctions. They make it harder for disabled people to get into work.""

"Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart The government should treat knife crime with the same urgency as terrorism, a former Home Office minister has said. Labour MP Vernon Coaker said Cobra, the government's emergency committee, should meet to respond to the ""national crisis"". It comes aftertwo 17-year-olds were killedin separate incidents in London and Greater Manchester at the weekend. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he would meet police chiefs to look at ways to combat violence. Mr Coaker, the MP for Gedling, in Nottingham, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he had been motivated to act after his constituent Jaden Moodie, 14, had been stabbed to death in January. ""We're seeing the murder of young people on our streets - families wrecked, communities almost under attack,"" he said. Jaden Moodie was knocked off a moped before being attacked ""If a terrorist incident occurs, of course we should deal with that really seriously - but this is also something which is a national crisis and a national emergency."" Cobra meetings, typically called following threats to national security, aim to bring together senior ministers, civil servants, emergency services, councils and others to produce a fast, effective response. ""In the face of many other national emergencies, the government quite rightly bring everybody together at Cobra. That's what they should be doing in respect to knife crime,"" said Mr Coaker. Can knife crime be stopped before it starts? Fatal stabbings at highest level since 1946 Rising knife crime in England and Wales Figures show the number of children in England aged 16 and under being stabbed rose by 93% between 2016 and 2018. Former Conservative policing minister Mike Penning said he agreed with Mr Coaker about the urgency needed to tackle the problem. He said the government's counter-terrorism strategy, known as Prevent, could act as a blueprint, ""where people go into communities and educate young people about the dangers of knives"". This video can not be played The unit tackling knives and other weapons in Nottingham Mr Penning also called for additional police powers to use stop and search. The existing powers enable officers to search people on the street if they have reasonable grounds to suspect they may be carrying weapons, illegal drugs, stolen property or items to be used to commit a crime. People can also be searched without reasonable grounds if a senior officer believes there's a risk of serious violence in a particular area. Nottinghamshire Police is the only force outside London with a dedicated team tasked with taking weapons off the streets. Between October 2017 and September 2018, six people were killed in knife attacks in the city - with 889 knife incidents recorded in 2018, a 12% rise on the previous year. Also in 2018, the East Midlands Major Trauma Centre said it had resuscitated 28 children with knife wounds, 50% more than in the previous year. Janice Morgan said on one night there were six stabbings ""The youngest patient I've treated is probably 14 but I know there has certainly been some younger than that,"" said nurse Janice Morgan. She added that on one night there had been six stabbings. A Home Office spokesman said it recognised the severity of the problem and had launched the Serious Violence Strategy and invested Â£220m in early intervention projects. He said: ""In recognition of the severity of the threat we also created the Serious Violence Taskforce, which is chaired by the home secretary and brings together ministers, MPs, the mayor of London, senior police officers - including the Met commissioner - and leaders from the public and voluntary sector. ""The taskforce meets regularly to ensure the strategy's objectives around early intervention and law enforcement are being delivered.""

"This video can not be played Knife crime victims' stories from Sheffield: ""I don't want to not have a mum"" There is ""some link"" between falling police numbers and a rise in violent crime, the UK's top police officer, Cressida Dick, has said. The Met Police commissioner was talking a day after Prime Minister Theresa May said there was ""no direct correlation"". It comes aftertwo 17-year-olds were killedin separate stabbings in London and Greater Manchester at the weekend. Ms Dick told LBC Radio the deaths show ""how big of a challenge this is"" and that it is not a London-only issue. Jodie Chesney was killed in an east London park as she played music with friends, while Yousef Ghaleb Makki was stabbed to death in the village of Hale Barns, near Altrincham. A 17-year-old boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been charged with the murder of Mr Makki,Greater Manchester Police said. A second 17-year-old boy has been charged with assisting an offender and possession of a bladed article. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police said aman had been arrested in Leicester in connection with the murder of Ms Chesney. Her grandmother, Debbie Chesney, previously said: ""This has to stop - there are too many young people having their lives cut short by needless violence."" Meanwhile,six people have been arrestedover a gang attack at a Lancashire sixth form college. A machete was found near Runshaw College in Leyland, following Monday's incident. Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart Home Secretary Sajid Javid has said he will meet police chiefs to look at ways to combat violence. He raised the issue of resources for police to tackle knife crime at a meeting of the Cabinet this morning. The Home Office has pledged to ""urgently coordinate"" further meetings across government to ""accelerate"" support for local authorities and police. The PM has asked officials to make this a priority. 'I don't know how many people I've stabbed' 'Treat knife crime like terrorism' The unit tackling knives Speaking about policing numbers, Ms Dick said a reduction in police officer numbers and cuts to public services in the last few years had coincided with an increase in demand for policing. She said: ""I agree that there is some link between violent crime on the streets obviously and police numbers, of course there is, and everybody would see that."" Ms Dick also agreed that middle class recreational drug users had ""blood on their hands"" over recent deaths, adding the drugs trade was a key driver behind street violence. Her comments followed those on Monday from the prime minister, who said there was ""no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers"". Senior police officers have called for a reverse to recent cuts in staffing levels. ""Jay"" - not his real name - first started carrying a knife when he was in Year 8 at school. He argues that knife crime is not being driven by disputes between drug gangs or the increasing availability of cocaine, as is sometimes suggested. Jay told the BBC: ""When you talk about black street gangs, they're financed by drugs but their disputes and their beef has nothing to do with drugs. ""If that was the case then it would be a free-for-all - every single gang would be beefing each other, but that's not the situation. ""Each gang has a particular enemy and it has nothing to do with drugs."" Listen to the Beyond Today podcast on knife crime. 1,000 young victims hospitalised Fatal stabbings at highest level since records began Can knife crime be stopped before it starts? Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hastweeted,externala video linking the rise in violent crime to government cuts and said young people ""shouldn't pay the price for austerity with their lives"". Mr Corbyn earlier said that Mrs May ""must start listening"" to police chiefs over the impact of cutting 21,000 officers, adding: ""You cannot keep people safe on the cheap."" Vernon Coaker, a former Home Office minister under Labour, said the government shouldtreat knife crime with the same urgency as terrorism. Former Met commissioner Lord Hogan-Howe has called for 20,000 officers to be recruited to bring forces in England and Wales back to their 2010 levels, and says ministers have to ""get a grip on the crisis"". Ms Dick is recruiting 3,000 officers after receiving an increase in funding. She welcomed the boost to police numbers in London - but said they were still below the levels they were in 2013-14. This video can not be played Metropolitan Police chief Cressida Dick: ""There must be some link"" Figures released in February showed the number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales last year - 285 - was the highest since records began in 1946. Ms Dick said that when she became commissioner tackling violent crime on the streets was her top priority - and it remained so. ""We are taking more weapons off the streets, we are arresting more people, we are doing more disruptive activity, as well as record numbers in the last few years of stop and search,"" she said. Ms Dick also noted that the number of homicides in London had fallen, with 20 so far this year compared to 29 this time last year.

"The former boss of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, has been granted bail by a Tokyo court in a surprise decision. The court set bail at one billion yen (Â£6.8m; $8.9m) and Japanese media reports said he could be released as early as Wednesday. Mr Ghosn has been charged with financial misconduct but has consistently denied any wrongdoing. The court hadrejected two previous requests for bail, saying Mr Ghosn was a flight risk and could hide evidence. On Tuesday Mr Ghosn reiterated his position, saying: ""I am extremely grateful for my family and friends who have stood by me throughout this terrible ordeal. ""I am innocent and totally committed to vigorously defending myself in a fair trial against these meritless and unsubstantiated accusations."" The latest request was filed by a new legal team, which was appointed by the Brazilian-born executive last month. On Monday, the head of his defence, Junichiro Hironaka, said he was optimistic Mr Ghosn would be granted bail. Nicknamed ""the Razor"", the Japanese lawyer has a reputation for winning tough cases. Carlos Ghosn and Japan's 'hostage justice' system Ghosn says 'plot and treason' behind arrest Five charts on the Nissan boss scandal Ghosn: The relentless 'cost killer' Prosecutors appealed against the decision but this was later rejected by the court. The 64-year-old has been in custody for more than 100 days since his arrest last November on allegations he understated his income at Nissan. He has also been charged with aggravated breach of trust. Bail is rarely granted in Japan without a confession and the length of Mr Ghosn's detention had drawn some criticism. Ghosn's France-based lawyers on Monday said that they had complained to the United Nations that their client's rights had been violated during his detention in Japan. Bail conditions require Mr Ghosn to stay in Japan and be placed under video surveillance. Mr Ghosn, a towering figure of the car industry, was the architect of the Renault-Nissan alliance. He brought Mitsubishi on board in 2016. Following his arrest, Nissan and Mitsubishi removed Mr Ghosn as chairman. Renault initially kept him on as chair, and he resigned from the French carmaker in January. In a statement, Nissan said it was not in a position to comment on the decision to grant Mr Ghosn bail as it ""does not have any role in decisions made by courts or prosecutors"". ""The company's focus is firmly on addressing weaknesses in governance that failed to prevent this misconduct."" Mr Ghosn was born in Porto Velho, Brazil, to Lebanese parents. He was once tipped as a potential president of Lebanon, a move he eventually dismissed because he already had ""too many jobs"".

"Lifting your baby in its car seat can cause pelvic organs to be displaced in some women, experts warn New mothers are being warned lifting and carrying baby car seats can put their postnatal recovery at risk. First-stage seats are heavy and awkward for women left vulnerable after giving birth and can cause or worsenpelvic organ prolapse,external, physiotherapists said. Nelly Brewer, 32, said she ""thought her life was over"" when she suffered a bladder prolapse after carrying her baby in his car seat. Manufacturers said they were limited on design and weight by regulations. Cornwall physiotherapist Laura Cullen warned seats should ideally not be removed from the car in at least the first six to eight weeks after birth. The Professional Network of Pelvic, Obstetric and Gynaecological Physiotherapy (POGP) said the seats were not well designed for carrying. Carrying and lifting a car seat can cause too much strain for some, experts said Amanda Savage, from POGP, said the seats were ""not well designed to be a way of moving a baby around"". ""You're carrying a heavy weight off to one side far away from your body often with your hand turned backwards or forwards and that's not a comfortable or ergonomic way to carry something."" Ms Savage added women were ""very, very vulnerable in those first few weeks"" and they should be lifting as little as possible and strengthening support muscles. POGP advised putting a car seat on a lightweight frame with wheels and to use the car'sIsofix fittings,externalif possible to minimise twisting. My transgender child: 'Don't you think she's happier?'

""I carried the car seat into the health visitors, ironically, and after that I felt a weird sensation,"" she said. The civil servant, who was 29 at the time, discovered the front wall of her vagina had collapsed. ""It was horrendous - I thought my life was over. ""I had had this vision that I would be going for long walks with my baby in the sling but then I couldn't even stand for five minutes without being uncomfortable."" She improved after an exercise regime. Laura Cullen, specialist physiotherapist, said car seats should stay in the car Laura Cullen runs Fit Bumps and Mums women's health physiotherapy in Newquay, Cornwall, and says women need to know the risks associated with lifting. ""Some women breeze through birth and are absolutely fine and able to be very active quite quickly postpartum, whilst others need much longer,"" she said. ""I recommend car seats are predominantly used in the car and not used as a carrying device,"" the mother of two said. She said a sling could be used to transport babies to and from the car, adding: ""As and when you do lift the car seat try to keep it as close to your body as possible and avoid any extreme twisting."" Manufacturers said parents' wellbeing was ""high on their agenda"" Luke Burns, of the Baby Products Association, said strict safety regulations hampered car seat design but ""brands are always looking at solutions to provide greater ease of use for parents as well as to protect their wellbeing"". ""Carbon fibre construction, which is extremely strong and lighter than most plastics, may be a possibility in the future, but it is extremely expensive and likely to make the manufacturing costs prohibitive and beyond the reach of most families."" Barbara Echevarria, managing director at Dorel which owns market leader Maxi Cosi, said the company hoped to launch a ""revolutionary design"" in 2020 which was ""not only lighter, but would meet the highest standards of car seat safety and will alleviate the strain on parents' bodies"". It is when one or more of the organs in the pelvis slip down from their normal position and bulge into the vagina It happens when the group of muscles and tissues that support the pelvic organs, called the pelvic floor, becomes weakened The chance of developing one is increased if you had a long, difficult birth, or if you gave birth to a large baby or multiple babies It is believed many women suffer a small prolapse postpartum without knowing or noticing any problems.

"Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart The government should treat knife crime with the same urgency as terrorism, a former Home Office minister has said. Labour MP Vernon Coaker said Cobra, the government's emergency committee, should meet to respond to the ""national crisis"". It comes aftertwo 17-year-olds were killedin separate incidents in London and Greater Manchester at the weekend. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he would meet police chiefs to look at ways to combat violence. Mr Coaker, the MP for Gedling, in Nottingham, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he had been motivated to act after his constituent Jaden Moodie, 14, had been stabbed to death in January. ""We're seeing the murder of young people on our streets - families wrecked, communities almost under attack,"" he said. Jaden Moodie was knocked off a moped before being attacked ""If a terrorist incident occurs, of course we should deal with that really seriously - but this is also something which is a national crisis and a national emergency."" Cobra meetings, typically called following threats to national security, aim to bring together senior ministers, civil servants, emergency services, councils and others to produce a fast, effective response. ""In the face of many other national emergencies, the government quite rightly bring everybody together at Cobra. That's what they should be doing in respect to knife crime,"" said Mr Coaker. Can knife crime be stopped before it starts? Fatal stabbings at highest level since 1946 Rising knife crime in England and Wales Figures show the number of children in England aged 16 and under being stabbed rose by 93% between 2016 and 2018. Former Conservative policing minister Mike Penning said he agreed with Mr Coaker about the urgency needed to tackle the problem. He said the government's counter-terrorism strategy, known as Prevent, could act as a blueprint, ""where people go into communities and educate young people about the dangers of knives"". This video can not be played The unit tackling knives and other weapons in Nottingham Mr Penning also called for additional police powers to use stop and search. The existing powers enable officers to search people on the street if they have reasonable grounds to suspect they may be carrying weapons, illegal drugs, stolen property or items to be used to commit a crime. People can also be searched without reasonable grounds if a senior officer believes there's a risk of serious violence in a particular area. Nottinghamshire Police is the only force outside London with a dedicated team tasked with taking weapons off the streets. Between October 2017 and September 2018, six people were killed in knife attacks in the city - with 889 knife incidents recorded in 2018, a 12% rise on the previous year. Also in 2018, the East Midlands Major Trauma Centre said it had resuscitated 28 children with knife wounds, 50% more than in the previous year. Janice Morgan said on one night there were six stabbings ""The youngest patient I've treated is probably 14 but I know there has certainly been some younger than that,"" said nurse Janice Morgan. She added that on one night there had been six stabbings. A Home Office spokesman said it recognised the severity of the problem and had launched the Serious Violence Strategy and invested Â£220m in early intervention projects. He said: ""In recognition of the severity of the threat we also created the Serious Violence Taskforce, which is chaired by the home secretary and brings together ministers, MPs, the mayor of London, senior police officers - including the Met commissioner - and leaders from the public and voluntary sector.

"A Lib Dem MP wants to stop items such as razors or deodorants from being priced differently based on whether they are marketed at men or women. On Tuesday Christine Jardine will introduce a bill to Parliament banning what she calls ""a sexist tax"". She says higher-priced products coupled with thegender pay gapmean women are being hit by a ""double whammy"". In recent years shops such as Boots and Tesco have been pressured into cutting the prices of razors and eye cream. An investigation by The Times newspaper,externalin 2016 found that women and girls were charged on average 37% more for clothes, beauty products and toys. In the same year,a petition accused Boots,externalof charging Â£2.29 for an eight-pack of women's razors compared to Â£1.49 for a 10-pack of male razors. The pharmacist respondedthat it would change the cost of certain items after a review of its own brand products. Similarly in 2017Tesco announcedit had ""acted on concerns about the difference in price of our female and male disposable twin-blade razors"". Christine Jardine, the MP for Edinburgh West, says her bill will remove an ""outdated and sexist tax"" Ms Jardine, the MP for Edinburgh West, said: ""It is entirely unacceptable that in 2019 women and girls are still paying more than men for basic products, such as razors and deodorant. ""Products marketed at women are on average considerably more expensive than those marketed at men. ""Often the only difference is the colour, yet this unfair price gap will have a significant financial impact on a woman over the course of her life.

"Ministers will resume efforts later to secure legally-binding changes to Theresa May's Brexit deal that might get MPs' backing in a week's time. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will meet EU officials in Brussels in search of guarantees over the backstop plan to avoid border checks in Ireland. Mr Cox has dismissed reports he has given up on securing a firm end date to ensure the UK is not stuck. MPs will vote on the deal by 12 March. The UK is currently scheduled to leave the European Union on 29 March. If MPs reject the withdrawal agreement for a second time, they will have the opportunity to vote on whether to go ahead in just over three weeks' time without any kind of negotiated deal. If they decide against, they will then have a vote on whether to extend negotiations and push the date of departure back by several months. Separately,Scottish and Welsh politicians have joined forcesto call for Brexit to be delayed in the first joint motion passed by the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly in 20 years. Brexit: A really simple guide Macron urges reforms to protect EU Toyota and BMW warn on no-deal Brexit Leading Brexiteers are hoping Mr Cox will be able to change his legal advice to satisfy them that the backstop - a controversial plan which will see the UK aligned with EU customs rules until the two sides' future relationship is agreed or alternative arrangements worked out - will not endure indefinitely. They have set a number of tests for the government's chief law officer and other ministers ahead of next week's votes. Many MPs are relying on the attorney general's legal advice Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that signals from the EU were ""reasonably positive"" but there was ""still a lot of work to do"". ""Time is very short, but what I would say compared to where we were a month ago the situation has been transformed,"" he said. ""We need substantive changes that would allow the attorney general to change his advice to the government that says that at the moment, theoretically, we could be trapped in the backstop indefinitely. ""And I think the EU understands that we need that change."" Michael Tomlinson, one of an eight-strong group of Conservative MPs who will scrutinise what is brought back from Brussels, said only significant changes to the backstop would do. ""We support the prime minister in seeking treaty-level changes,"" he said after the group's first meeting on Monday. A ""proper analysis"" of any new text would be needed to allow them to ""form a judgement"", he added. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the group of Eurosceptics, who are also lawyers, will ""pore over whatever Cox gets from Brussels"", adding: ""They will ultimately make a political call. The crucial bit for government is for the attorney general to feel he has enough to go on to change his legal opinion on the backstop."" Brexit: Your questions answered Struggling towns to get post-Brexit funding Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar has said talks were continuing in Brussels, but maintained that the only ""workable"" solution so far had been the backstop proposed in the withdrawal agreement. He said the Republic of Ireland will have to have ""difficult discussions"" with the EU and UK on how to avoid a hard border and protect the single market and customs union in the event of no deal. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Mr Cox took to Twitter on Monday after newspaper reports suggested he had turned his attention away from the concrete ""freedom clause"" demanded by many MPs to assurances that the backstop would fall away if talks on a future relationship break down. He said while some of the reporting was accurate, ""much more of it isn't"". He added: ""Complex and detailed negotiations cannot be conducted in public."" Meanwhile, Mr Barclayhas written to EU negotiator Michel Barnier on protecting UK and EU citizen's rights after Brexit,external, following government support in Parliament for an amendment from Tory MP Alberto Costa. In the letter, he said the government's position was that the withdrawal agreement provided ""the best way of providing confidence to citizens"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But, he said given their ""shared commitment to protecting the rights of citizens in all scenarios"", he would welcome Mr Barnier's views on the proposal to ring-fence rights. Mr Barclay added that more than 130,000 applications from EU nationals for settled status in the UK after Brexit have already been granted by the Home Office. Environment minister George Eustice, who quit his jobin order to oppose attempts to delay Brexit, has been replaced by Robert Goodwill, the MP for Scarborough and Whitby.

"Emmanuel Macron has published an open letter to Europe in newspapers across the continent French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed a series of reforms to ensure the future of the European Union. In an opinion piece published in newspapers across Europe,he calls for the creation of an agency to protect the bloc against cyber-attacks,external. Ahead of May's European elections, he advocates a ban on foreign powers financing European political parties. And he suggests the British people were not properly informed before voting to leave the EU. Mr Macron set out his proposals for a ""European renaissance"" in an open letter addressed directly to the ""citizens of Europe"", which was published in newspapers in all 28 EU member states. Macron urges EU to shun nationalism Macron pushes for 'true European army' In his letter, Mr Macron says the EU as an institution needs a major shake-up if it is to stop member states ""retreating into nationalism"" - a direct reference to Brexit. ""Who told the British people the truth about their post-Brexit future?"" he asks, using the UK's withdrawal from the union as an example of the EU being in crisis. ""Who spoke to them about losing access to the EU market? Who mentioned the risks to peace in Ireland of restoring the border?"" He describes the EU as ""not just an economic market"" but a ""project"", before going on to set out his ""roadmap for the EU"". In his open letter to Europe, Mr Macron proposes the creation of several new bodies that would oversee change within the EU. They are: European Agency for the Protection of Democracies, to protect against cyber attacks, the spread of fake news, and to ban foreign powers from funding European political parties European Council for Internal Security, which would comprise a Europe-wide border force agency and asylum office, and a European security council that would have ""the UK on board"" An EU minimum wage, which would be ""appropriate to each country"" and negotiated collectively on an annual basis, and a guarantee that EU citizens would get ""the same pay for the same work"" European Climate Bank, which would finance the EU's transition to his suggested environmental targets, ""zero carbon by 2050 and pesticides halved by 2025"" A European food safety force, to ""improve our food controls"" and protect them from the ""lobby threat"" with ""independent scientific assessment of substances hazardous to the environment and health"" A Conference for Europe, which Mr Macron wants the EU to set up by the end of this year, so that changes can be proposed and approved by representatives from EU institutions and member states By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris For months President Macron has been forced to concentrate on home affairs, thanks to the ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) movement. But that crisis is waning. So now, with EU elections approaching in May, is the moment to fire an opening salvo in that campaign, and return to his big theme of European renewal. We have been here before. Before his election he campaigned under a blue European flag, and in his Sorbonne speech of September 2017 he promised a new era of Franco-German unity at the heart of an invigorated EU. The results have been, to say the least, disappointing. Now he is back with more of the vision thing, but this time observers detect a shift. Today the focus seems to be more on protection, defence and borders - rather than economic and social convergence; and more on intergovernmental cooperation, rather than federalism.  A nod perhaps to the power of his foes, and their ""populist"" rationale. First, Mr Macron says a new European Agency for the Protection of Democracies should be set up to provide each member state with experts who can protect their election processes from cyber-attacks, and manipulation from foreign powers. ""Our first freedom is democratic freedom,"" he writes. ""The freedom to chose our leaders as foreign powers seek to influence our votes at every election."" He then adds that ""we should also ban the funding of European political parties by foreign powers"". Hackers 'intercept EU diplomatic cables' Macronâs marvellous manoeuvres This is seen as a reference both toclaims of Russian links to elements of the Brexit campaign, and to the controversy overRussian financing of the far-right French political party, National Front. As well as this, the French president says, the EU should bring in rules ""banishing incitement to hatred and violence from the internet"". He also says the EU should write up a new treaty of defence and security, and set up a European security council, which would include the UK. In 2017, France said it had beentargeted by 24,000 cyber-attacks in a year- and warned that it could be hit by a campaign like the one thought to have targeted the 2016 US election. And the European Innovation Council, which already exists, should be given a larger budget ""on a par with the United States"" in order to support research into new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI). Using Brexit as an example, Mr Macron warns against letting EU member states ""retreat into nationalism"" Mr Macron then goes on to say that those who want to belong to the visa-free Schengen area should accept both stricter controls on outer borders, and a common asylum policy for migrants. At the moment, different Schengen member states are able to have wildly different policies on asylum and immigration. Germany, for instance, accepted about 1.2 million asylum seekers during the 2015-16 crisis, while Hungarypassed a law criminalising lawyers and activists who helped asylum seekers. ""We will need a common border force and a European asylum office, strict control obligations and European solidarity to which each country will contribute under the authority of a European Council for Internal Security,"" he writes. The French president then suggests bringing in new social security measures for EU citizens, including a new ""EU minimum wage"" that would be ""appropriate to each country, negotiated collectively every year"". He also says that the EU should have a ""social shield"" that would guarantee that workers doing the same job get the same pay. ""[Europe] needs to drive forward a project of convergence rather than competition,"" he adds. Mr Macron also proposes new EU-wide environmental targets - ""zero carbon by 2050 and pesticides halved by 2025"" - which would be financed by a new European Climate Bank. A new ""European food safety force"" would enforce the EU's food controls, while funding independent scientific research to combat the influence of corporate lobbies. ""We can't let nationalists with no solutions exploit people's anger,"" he concludes. ""We can't sleepwalk to a diminished Europe... European humanism demands action.""

"A campaign has been launched to recruit another 20,000 social care workers in Wales over the next 10 years. The ageing population in Wales and relatively older workforce are two factors for the expected demand. The jobs will include care workers in people's own homes, workers in residential care and more nurses. TheWeCare.Wales campaign,externalalso aims to increase public understanding about what care work involves. The number of elderly people over the age of 80 is predicted to increase by 44% in Wales by 2030. There are currently about 113,000 people in the social care sector. There is a perception that the work is low paid and pressured with long hours and demanding schedules. The body responsible for regulating and developing the workforce said it wanted to show the jobs were ""invaluable to our every day life"" and hopes they will be thought more highly of. Sue Evans, chief executive of Social Care Wales, said: ""Terms and conditions are obviously a factor. One of the things our research has told us though is that once you're in the sector, people find it a really rewarding career and stay because of the values it gives them, helping people live a better life. ""We can't compete with other industries that may pay more but there's a real lack of understanding out there about what the roles are. A major part of our campaign is actually improving understanding."" Ms Evans said there was a breadth of work which would be needed, from frontline social and care work to befriending, housing liaison, occupational therapy and budget management. As well as supporting adults, there is also a need for more childcare and early years workers are needed as the Welsh Government rolls out its 30-hour free childcare package.

"A campaign has been launched to recruit another 20,000 social care workers in Wales over the next 10 years. The ageing population in Wales and relatively older workforce are two factors for the expected demand. The jobs will include care workers in people's own homes, workers in residential care and more nurses. TheWeCare.Wales campaign,externalalso aims to increase public understanding about what care work involves. The number of elderly people over the age of 80 is predicted to increase by 44% in Wales by 2030. There are currently about 113,000 people in the social care sector. There is a perception that the work is low paid and pressured with long hours and demanding schedules. The body responsible for regulating and developing the workforce said it wanted to show the jobs were ""invaluable to our every day life"" and hopes they will be thought more highly of. Sue Evans, chief executive of Social Care Wales, said: ""Terms and conditions are obviously a factor. One of the things our research has told us though is that once you're in the sector, people find it a really rewarding career and stay because of the values it gives them, helping people live a better life. ""We can't compete with other industries that may pay more but there's a real lack of understanding out there about what the roles are. A major part of our campaign is actually improving understanding."" Ms Evans said there was a breadth of work which would be needed, from frontline social and care work to befriending, housing liaison, occupational therapy and budget management. As well as supporting adults, there is also a need for more childcare and early years workers are needed as the Welsh Government rolls out its 30-hour free childcare package.

"Mobile data costs vary considerably around the world A study into the amount people pay for mobile data has found that the UK has some of the most expensive prices in Europe. The research,,externalfrom price comparison site Cable.co.uk, found that one gigabyte (GB) of data cost $0.26 (Â£0.20) in India but $6.66 in the UK. The US had one of the most expensive rates - with an average cost of $12.37 for the same amount of data. The results were ""disappointing"" said Cable's telecoms analyst Dan Howdle. ""Despite a healthy UK marketplace, our study has uncovered that EU nations such as Finland, Poland, Denmark, Italy, Austria and France pay a fraction of what we pay in the UK for similar data usage. It will be interesting to see how our position is affected post-Brexit,"" he said. The study compared mobile data pricing in 230 countries around the world. The UK ranked 136th in the list. The global average was $8.53 for 1GB. The cheapest mobile data in Western Europe is in Finland with an average price of $1.16 for 1GB of data. Denmark, Monaco and Italy all offer packages below $2. There were 15 countries in Western Europe which had cheaper prices than the UK. In Eastern Europe, Poland is the cheapest at $1.32 per gigabyte, followed by Romania ($1.89) and Slovenia ($2.21). Top five nations: India - $0.26 Kyrgyzstan - $0.27 Kazakstan - $0.49 Ukraine - $0.51 Rwanda - $0.56 Bottom five nations: Zimbabwe - $75.20 Equatorial Guinea - $65.83 Saint Helena - $55.47 Falkland Islands - $47.39 Djibouti - $37.92 Zimbabwe is the most expensive country in which to buy mobile data - with an average cost of 1GB coming in at an eye-watering $75.20. Africa has both the cheapest and most expensive prices, with Rwanda, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo all offering less than $1 data prices but Equatorial Guinea and Saint Helena both charging more than $50 per gigabyte. Asian nations make up half of the top 20 cheapest countries, with only Taiwan, China and South Korea charging more than the global average. The reasons for the vast differences in prices around the world were complex said Mr Howdle. ""Some countries have excellent mobile and fixed broadband infrastructure and so providers are able to offer large amounts of data, which brings down the price per gigabyte. Others with less advanced broadband networks are heavily reliant on mobile data and the economy dictates that prices must be low, as that's what people can afford,"" he added. ""At the more expensive end of the list, we have countries where often the infrastructure isn't great but also where consumption is very small. People are often buying data packages of just a tens of megabytes at a time, making a gigabyte a relatively large and therefore expensive amount of data to buy."" The research looked at SIM-only deals and included a range of packages from all the providers in each country.

"The US plans to end preferential trade status for India, under a scheme which allows certain products to enter the US duty-free. President Donald Trump said India had failed to assure the US it would provide reasonable access to its markets. India said the US move would have a ""minimal economic impact"". The US will also end Turkey's preferential trade status, saying it no longer qualifies. It is the latest US attempt to counter what it sees as unfair trade practices. Mr Trump has pledged to reduce US trade deficits, and has repeatedly criticised India for high tariffs. As a result, he directed the US Trade Representative's (USTR) office to remove India from a programme that grants it preferential trade treatment. Preferential trade treatment for India currently allows $5.6bn (Â£4.3bn) worth of exports to enter the United States duty free. In a letter to Congress, the US president said India had ""not assured the United States that it will provide equitable and reasonable access to the markets of India"". Under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) programme, ""certain products can enter the US duty-free if the beneficiary developing country meets a set of criteria established by Congress"". The criteria include providing intellectual property protection, and giving the US reasonable and fair market access. Is trade spoiling the Trump-Modi bromance? A quick guide to the US-China trade war India's Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan said the withdrawal from the GSP would have ""minimal economic impact of $190m (Â£144m) on India"". ""Our trade relations remain cordial with the US. There is no disruption on trade talks,"" Mr Wadhawan said. Analysis by Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent India is the world's biggest beneficiary of America's GSP programme, which was created in the 1970s to help developing and poor countries improve their economic growth prospects. At the time,India was clocking in growth rates of as low as 3.5%.,externalThis year it is thought that it could shoot up to the world's fifth largest economy, rivalling the UK. Analysts say that's why the US, and in particular the Trump administration, is saying things need to change. Countries that are no longer developing nations shouldn't continue to get special access from the US to help them grow - especially if they're not providing reciprocal access. Trade experts also say there's a sense within the Trump administration that if they're going after China based on its claims that it is still a developing country, then it is hypocritical not to do the same with India, too. The US also intends to remove Turkey from its GSP programme. It argues the country no longer meets the criteria because it is ""sufficiently economically developed"". The changes may not take effect until at least 60 days after the notifications to Congress and the governments of India and Turkey. The move is the latest push by the Trump administration to redress what it considers to be unfair trading relationships with other countries. That sentiment has fuelled a damaging trade war between Washington and Beijing. Negotiations are ongoing to resolve the dispute that has seen both sides impose billions of dollars worth of tariffs on one another's goods. The US has alsoimposed tariffs on steel and aluminium importsfrom countries around the world. Last year, Indiaretaliated to those tariff hikesby raising import duties on a range of goods. The move to end US preferential status for India comes at a challenging time for India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he prepares to face elections this year.

"The government will stop funding Verify next year The National Audit Office (NAO) has criticised the government's flagship identity verification scheme. A damning report says Gov.UK Verify has fallen well short of its target of 25 million users by 2020, managing only 3.6 million so far. The government has had to lower its estimates for Verify's financial benefits by 75%. It says challenges like these are to be expected when the government is working ""at the forefront of new technology"". The Verify platform was launched by the Government Digital Service (GDS) in 2016, intended to become the default way for people to prove their identity for online government services. From checking income tax to receiving benefit payments, GDS's aim was for Verify to be a shared identity portal across government departments - with 46 expected to be connected to the platform by March 2018. But only 19 government services currently use Verify and 11 of those can still be accessed using other online systems. Universal Credit: 'I've nearly lost my house twice' Concern over 'hidden' Universal Credit council costs Amber Rudd links universal credit to rise in food bank use For those that do use Verify, problems are widespread. Currently only 48% of people who try to sign up for the service are successful on their first try. This rate is even lower (38%) for universal credit claimants using the service to authenticate their identity online. This has led to increased operational costs, with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) expecting its spend on manual verification to be about Â£40m over the next decade. ""Verify is saving taxpayers money and is a world-leading project in its field,"" a GDS spokesman told BBC News. ""The NAO report reflects that it has been a challenging project - but challenges like these are to be expected when the government is working at the forefront of new technology."" But Meg Hillier MP, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, called Verify ""a textbook case of government's over-optimism and programme-management failure."" ""Despite spending at least Â£154m on Verify, only half the people that try to sign up are able to use it and take-up is much lower than expected."" The report notes that the total cost of Verify is in fact likely to exceed Â£154m, as this figure does not include the amount it has cost departments to reconfigure their systems to use Verify. Of the known costs, more than one-third has gone on payments to the commercial identity providers behind the system, including Barclays and the Post Office. In addition, six government departments have yet to pay for the services - totalling Â£2m in unpaid invoices between them. Fewer than half of people that try to sign up for the service are successful on their first try The government is due to stop funding Verify from April 2020, handing operation over to the private sector. ""It is not yet clear what it will cost for government departments to continue using Verify when government funding stops next year,"" said Ms Hillier. All these setbacks mean the estimate for Verify's financial benefits has been slashed by the government from Â£873m - as GDS predicted in a 2016 business case - down to Â£217m. And even this revised figure is in doubt, as the NAO says it has been unable to verify the estimated benefits. ""Even in the context of GDS's redefined objectives for the programme, it is difficult to conclude that successive decisions to continue with Verify have been sufficiently justified,"" the report says. A whole new way of doing major government IT programmes much more efficiently - that was the promise of GDS. Instead, its biggest project, Verify, has turned out to be the same old story of delays, technical failures and missed targets - or, as the NAO puts it, the ""optimism bias and a failure to set clear objectives"" we've seen so many times before. I got a warning of that back in 2014 when I was invited in to the Cabinet Office to be one of the first people to try out Verify. The GDS team painted a compelling vision of a system that would give citizens a simple way of accessing online services provided by an increasingly digital government. But despite their best efforts, when they tried to verify me, the computer said, ""No."" Teething troubles that will soon be sorted out, I thought. But, five years on, fewer than half of the people who try to sign up succeed even after they've had their identity confirmed by one of Verify's commercial partners. Many of the big government departments were hostile to GDS from the start, seeing it as a threat to their right to run their own IT projects. Perhaps that's one of the reasons why just 19 departments have signed up to use it, when 46 were supposed to have come on board by now. The most startling fact in the report is that six government bodies that are using Verify have failed to pay their bills for it, even after being invoiced by the Cabinet Office. The government will end central funding for Verify next year and it is clear it has only been kept afloat for so long because of the role it was supposed to play in the provision of universal credit. Another fine mess then - and as far as finding a way to run major public sector IT projects, it is back to the drawing board.

"The government has launched its first cervical screening advertising campaign in England, as the number of women having checks has hit a 20-year low. The campaign - being run by Public Health England - has avoided the term ""smear test"" amid concern it may be putting people off. Officials said the term was outdated and hope the term cervical screening will ""normalise"" the procedure. Adverts will run on TV, radio and online for the next eight weeks. The campaign stresses the screening is basically a health check for the cervix and shows a woman being reminded by family members and friends to go for testing. Figures last year showed just over 71% of women aged 25 to 64 had been screened at regular enough intervals. This video can not be played What happens during cervical screening? PHE director of screening Anne Mackie said the campaign was about ""breaking down barriers"". She said there were a variety of reasons for not attending but there had been a conscious move away from the term ""smear test"". ""The technical process used today no longer smears the sample of cells from the cervix on to a glass plate,"" she said. ""We now put cells that we collect into a tube of liquid, so technically 'smear' is incorrect."" The advert asks women not to ignore their invites for screening Ms Mackie said the overarching message of the campaign - cervical screening saves lives - was much more ""clear and direct"" and ""hopefully helps to normalise the term"". She added: ""The campaign shows how cervical screening is a vital preventative test which can identify potentially harmful cells and treat them before they have a chance to develop into cancer, giving us the opportunity to stop cancer before it starts."" Masters student Isha Webber, 29, from London, attended her first screening appointment when she was 25. It came back all clear. A few years later, when she was screened again, she was found to have abnormal cells that required treatment to remove. ""I can't reinforce enough how important it is to stay on top of your cervical screening appointments,"" she said. ""When you get your invitation letter, book right away and don't delay. ""I am so glad that I went when I did and had those abnormal cells removed. ""I hate to think what may have been the case if I delayed. ""I now talk to as many people as possible about my experience, to raise awareness of the importance of screening."" The NHS target is for 80% of women aged 25 to 49 to be tested every three years and the same proportion aged 50 to 64 to be screened every five years. But in some areas uptake has dropped below 50%. Experts have put it down to: embarrassment a lack of awareness just putting it off Research by the charity Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust suggested young women were embarrassed to attend because of: their body shape the appearance of their vulva concerns over smell A third said they would not go if they had not waxed or shaved their bikini area. And about 15% said they would miss their screening test for a gym class or a waxing appointment. Every year about 2,600 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and nearly 700 die from the disease. The advertising campaign is just one element of the government's approach to increase uptake. A review of invitation letters, leaflets and results letters is under way, while pilots to trial text messaging reminders have started. Some areas have also started to offer weekend and evening screening. Government advisers are also considering whether to recommend self-testing. Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust chief executive Robert Music said: ""We know attending screening isn't always easy for a wide range of reasons, yet cervical screening can be lifesaving as it can detect changes in the cervix before they become cancerous."" The Scottish government and NHS Scotland ran acervical screening advert,externalin 2017, telling women to ""stop fannying about"" and ""nip cancer in the bud"". While it used the term smear test, theNHS Health Scotland website,externalprimarily refers to it as cervical screening.

"A Â£1.6bn government fund has been launched to boost less well-off towns in England after Brexit. The pot is split into Â£1bn, divided in England using a needs-based formula, and Â£600m communities can bid for. More than half of the money, to be spread over seven years, will go to the north of England and the Midlands. Labour called it a bribe to influence MPs to back the PM's Brexit deal and critics say it does not cover cuts to local authority funding. The Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government said there will be additional announcements ""in due course"" for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. No Welsh cash in Â£1.6bn post-Brexit fund Council spending cuts, in seven charts 'Worst yet to come' in council cuts Brexit: All you need to know In January, MPs rejected the withdrawal deal Theresa May has reached with the EU by 230 votes - the biggest defeat for a sitting government in history. To win another vote, which Mrs May has promised will be on or before 12 March, she could find herself relying on the votes of Labour MPs from Leave-voting parts of the country. John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, a former coal mining area in Nottinghamshire, told the PM last month to ""show us the money"" with ""transformative investment"" in areas that voted to leave. The Labour MP, who backed Mrs May's Brexit deal at the first vote, denied it amounted to ""transactional politics"". This video can not be played Lisa Nandy: âObviously, I wouldnât turn down any moneyâ¦ but my vote is not for saleâ But John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the fund ""smacks of desperation from a government reduced to bribing MPs to vote for their damaging flagship Brexit legislation"". The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the money will be targeted on coastal communities, market towns, and de-industrialised towns, which meets the demands of some Labour MPs, who say regeneration funding tends to go to big cities. The funding will go to specific projects like a new university campus or railway station, our correspondent added. Dismissing the claim that the funding aimed to entice Labour MPs, Housing and Communities Secretary James Brokenshire insisted the cash would be made available even if the withdrawal agreement was rejected and denied the funding was a bribe. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This funding is there regardless of the outcome, but obviously we want to see a deal happening, we believe that is what is in the best interests of our country."" He said the money would ""supplement the work of councils"" and could be ""transformative"" and was there ""to see that towns grow"". However, Labour MP Alex Sobel, of the cross-party People's Vote campaign, which wants a new referendum on Brexit, said it was ""a drop in the ocean"" compared with the cost of leaving the EU. He said the annual loss to local economies would be more than enough to wipe out any potential return from this scheme. Theresa May, pictured with her husband Philip, has promised MPs another vote on her deal by 12 March Labour's Ruth Smeeth, the MP for Leave-supporting Stoke-on-Trent, described the amount of money as ""extraordinarily pathetic"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour programme, she said: ""If you're talking about national renewal, this is less money than is being taken out of my economy by the introduction of [new welfare system] universal credit over the next four years."" Labour and Stoke-on-Trent Central MP Gareth Snell said the announcement was a ""huge disappointment"", tweeting: ""The entire allocation for the West Midlands over four years is less than the total value of cuts faced by Stoke-on-Trent City Council alone over the same period."" Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar, has described the funding as ""a shameless little bung."" She told BBC Radio 5 Live that Â£90m had been lost from her local council over nine years of austerity and the money was ""bobbins"" and was ""shameless and embarrassing"". And Labour's Rhondda MP Chris Bryant tweeted: ""And not a penny for Wales. The trouble with bribes is they embody injustice."" Welsh councils facing real-terms cuts Austerity blamed for children in care rise A really simple guide to all things Brexit But the prime minister insisted: ""Communities across the country voted for Brexit as an expression of their desire to see change - that must be a change for the better, with more opportunity and greater control. ""These towns have a glorious heritage, huge potential and, with the right help, a bright future ahead of them."" She said prosperity had been ""unfairly spread"" for ""too long"". By BBC political correspondent Iain Watson A month ago John Mann - who voted to leave the EU - told the BBC there was a ""good dialogue"" going on with the government. And he was hopeful Mrs May would come back with ""something significant"" for his, and other, areas outside London. He and a group of Labour MPs from Leave areas were demanding the protection of employment rights after Brexit - and assurances poorer areas wouldn't lose out when EU regional funding ended. The cash on offer from the government is equivalent to less than 2% of English local authority spending. Theresa May says she is simply making good a promise she made in her first speech as prime minister to help ""ordinary working class families"". But the Labour leadership see this as a ""bribe"" to tempt some of their own MPs to break ranks and back Mrs May's deal. The former Conservative, now Independent, MP Anna Soubry claims it's an attempt to buy votes. But the government insists the true beneficiaries will be residents of coastal and industrial communities who feel left behind. The Â£1.6bn Stronger Towns Fund will be broken down into Â£600m, which communities in any part of England can bid for, and Â£1bn allocated using a needs-based formula to the following areas: North-west England:Â£281m North-east England:Â£105m Yorkshire and the Humber:Â£197m West Midlands:Â£212m East Midlands:Â£110m South-west England:Â£33m South-east England:Â£37m East England:Â£25m ""The formula allocations are based on a combination of productivity, income, skills, deprivation metrics and proportion of the population living in towns,"" a department spokesperson said. ""This targets funding at those places with economies that are performing relatively less well to the England average."" London is not included in the list, but towns within Greater London can bid for a share of the Â£600m pot, the department spokesperson added. The government said communities would be able to draw up job-boosting plans for their town, with the support and advice of their Local Enterprise Partnerships. It added that it would also seek to ensure towns in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland would benefit from the new funding.

"Lifting your baby in its car seat can cause pelvic organs to be displaced in some women, experts warn New mothers are being warned lifting and carrying baby car seats can put their postnatal recovery at risk. First-stage seats are heavy and awkward for women left vulnerable after giving birth and can cause or worsenpelvic organ prolapse,external, physiotherapists said. Nelly Brewer, 32, said she ""thought her life was over"" when she suffered a bladder prolapse after carrying her baby in his car seat. Manufacturers said they were limited on design and weight by regulations. Cornwall physiotherapist Laura Cullen warned seats should ideally not be removed from the car in at least the first six to eight weeks after birth. The Professional Network of Pelvic, Obstetric and Gynaecological Physiotherapy (POGP) said the seats were not well designed for carrying. Carrying and lifting a car seat can cause too much strain for some, experts said Amanda Savage, from POGP, said the seats were ""not well designed to be a way of moving a baby around"". ""You're carrying a heavy weight off to one side far away from your body often with your hand turned backwards or forwards and that's not a comfortable or ergonomic way to carry something."" Ms Savage added women were ""very, very vulnerable in those first few weeks"" and they should be lifting as little as possible and strengthening support muscles. POGP advised putting a car seat on a lightweight frame with wheels and to use the car'sIsofix fittings,externalif possible to minimise twisting. My transgender child: 'Don't you think she's happier?'

""I carried the car seat into the health visitors, ironically, and after that I felt a weird sensation,"" she said. The civil servant, who was 29 at the time, discovered the front wall of her vagina had collapsed. ""It was horrendous - I thought my life was over.

She improved after an exercise regime. Laura Cullen, specialist physiotherapist, said car seats should stay in the car Laura Cullen runs Fit Bumps and Mums women's health physiotherapy in Newquay, Cornwall, and says women need to know the risks associated with lifting. ""Some women breeze through birth and are absolutely fine and able to be very active quite quickly postpartum, whilst others need much longer,"" she said. ""I recommend car seats are predominantly used in the car and not used as a carrying device,"" the mother of two said. She said a sling could be used to transport babies to and from the car, adding: ""As and when you do lift the car seat try to keep it as close to your body as possible and avoid any extreme twisting."" Manufacturers said parents' wellbeing was ""high on their agenda"" Luke Burns, of the Baby Products Association, said strict safety regulations hampered car seat design but ""brands are always looking at solutions to provide greater ease of use for parents as well as to protect their wellbeing"". ""Carbon fibre construction, which is extremely strong and lighter than most plastics, may be a possibility in the future, but it is extremely expensive and likely to make the manufacturing costs prohibitive and beyond the reach of most families.""

"Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart The government should treat knife crime with the same urgency as terrorism, a former Home Office minister has said. Labour MP Vernon Coaker said Cobra, the government's emergency committee, should meet to respond to the ""national crisis"". It comes aftertwo 17-year-olds were killedin separate incidents in London and Greater Manchester at the weekend. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he would meet police chiefs to look at ways to combat violence. Mr Coaker, the MP for Gedling, in Nottingham, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he had been motivated to act after his constituent Jaden Moodie, 14, had been stabbed to death in January. ""We're seeing the murder of young people on our streets - families wrecked, communities almost under attack,"" he said. Jaden Moodie was knocked off a moped before being attacked ""If a terrorist incident occurs, of course we should deal with that really seriously - but this is also something which is a national crisis and a national emergency."" Cobra meetings, typically called following threats to national security, aim to bring together senior ministers, civil servants, emergency services, councils and others to produce a fast, effective response. ""In the face of many other national emergencies, the government quite rightly bring everybody together at Cobra. That's what they should be doing in respect to knife crime,"" said Mr Coaker. Can knife crime be stopped before it starts? Fatal stabbings at highest level since 1946 Rising knife crime in England and Wales Figures show the number of children in England aged 16 and under being stabbed rose by 93% between 2016 and 2018. Former Conservative policing minister Mike Penning said he agreed with Mr Coaker about the urgency needed to tackle the problem. He said the government's counter-terrorism strategy, known as Prevent, could act as a blueprint, ""where people go into communities and educate young people about the dangers of knives"". This video can not be played The unit tackling knives and other weapons in Nottingham Mr Penning also called for additional police powers to use stop and search. The existing powers enable officers to search people on the street if they have reasonable grounds to suspect they may be carrying weapons, illegal drugs, stolen property or items to be used to commit a crime. People can also be searched without reasonable grounds if a senior officer believes there's a risk of serious violence in a particular area. Nottinghamshire Police is the only force outside London with a dedicated team tasked with taking weapons off the streets. Between October 2017 and September 2018, six people were killed in knife attacks in the city - with 889 knife incidents recorded in 2018, a 12% rise on the previous year. Also in 2018, the East Midlands Major Trauma Centre said it had resuscitated 28 children with knife wounds, 50% more than in the previous year. Janice Morgan said on one night there were six stabbings ""The youngest patient I've treated is probably 14 but I know there has certainly been some younger than that,"" said nurse Janice Morgan. She added that on one night there had been six stabbings. A Home Office spokesman said it recognised the severity of the problem and had launched the Serious Violence Strategy and invested Â£220m in early intervention projects. He said: ""In recognition of the severity of the threat we also created the Serious Violence Taskforce, which is chaired by the home secretary and brings together ministers, MPs, the mayor of London, senior police officers - including the Met commissioner - and leaders from the public and voluntary sector.

"The government will stop funding Verify next year The National Audit Office (NAO) has criticised the government's flagship identity verification scheme. A damning report says Gov.UK Verify has fallen well short of its target of 25 million users by 2020, managing only 3.6 million so far. The government has had to lower its estimates for Verify's financial benefits by 75%. It says challenges like these are to be expected when the government is working ""at the forefront of new technology"". The Verify platform was launched by the Government Digital Service (GDS) in 2016, intended to become the default way for people to prove their identity for online government services. From checking income tax to receiving benefit payments, GDS's aim was for Verify to be a shared identity portal across government departments - with 46 expected to be connected to the platform by March 2018. But only 19 government services currently use Verify and 11 of those can still be accessed using other online systems. Universal Credit: 'I've nearly lost my house twice' Concern over 'hidden' Universal Credit council costs Amber Rudd links universal credit to rise in food bank use For those that do use Verify, problems are widespread. Currently only 48% of people who try to sign up for the service are successful on their first try. This rate is even lower (38%) for universal credit claimants using the service to authenticate their identity online. This has led to increased operational costs, with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) expecting its spend on manual verification to be about Â£40m over the next decade. ""Verify is saving taxpayers money and is a world-leading project in its field,"" a GDS spokesman told BBC News. ""The NAO report reflects that it has been a challenging project - but challenges like these are to be expected when the government is working at the forefront of new technology."" But Meg Hillier MP, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, called Verify ""a textbook case of government's over-optimism and programme-management failure."" ""Despite spending at least Â£154m on Verify, only half the people that try to sign up are able to use it and take-up is much lower than expected."" The report notes that the total cost of Verify is in fact likely to exceed Â£154m, as this figure does not include the amount it has cost departments to reconfigure their systems to use Verify. Of the known costs, more than one-third has gone on payments to the commercial identity providers behind the system, including Barclays and the Post Office. In addition, six government departments have yet to pay for the services - totalling Â£2m in unpaid invoices between them. Fewer than half of people that try to sign up for the service are successful on their first try The government is due to stop funding Verify from April 2020, handing operation over to the private sector. ""It is not yet clear what it will cost for government departments to continue using Verify when government funding stops next year,"" said Ms Hillier. All these setbacks mean the estimate for Verify's financial benefits has been slashed by the government from Â£873m - as GDS predicted in a 2016 business case - down to Â£217m. And even this revised figure is in doubt, as the NAO says it has been unable to verify the estimated benefits. ""Even in the context of GDS's redefined objectives for the programme, it is difficult to conclude that successive decisions to continue with Verify have been sufficiently justified,"" the report says. A whole new way of doing major government IT programmes much more efficiently - that was the promise of GDS. Instead, its biggest project, Verify, has turned out to be the same old story of delays, technical failures and missed targets - or, as the NAO puts it, the ""optimism bias and a failure to set clear objectives"" we've seen so many times before. I got a warning of that back in 2014 when I was invited in to the Cabinet Office to be one of the first people to try out Verify. The GDS team painted a compelling vision of a system that would give citizens a simple way of accessing online services provided by an increasingly digital government. But despite their best efforts, when they tried to verify me, the computer said, ""No."" Teething troubles that will soon be sorted out, I thought. But, five years on, fewer than half of the people who try to sign up succeed even after they've had their identity confirmed by one of Verify's commercial partners. Many of the big government departments were hostile to GDS from the start, seeing it as a threat to their right to run their own IT projects. Perhaps that's one of the reasons why just 19 departments have signed up to use it, when 46 were supposed to have come on board by now. The most startling fact in the report is that six government bodies that are using Verify have failed to pay their bills for it, even after being invoiced by the Cabinet Office. The government will end central funding for Verify next year and it is clear it has only been kept afloat for so long because of the role it was supposed to play in the provision of universal credit. Another fine mess then - and as far as finding a way to run major public sector IT projects, it is back to the drawing board.

"A deadly wildfire engulfed Paradise, north of Sacramento, California, last November Wet winters are no longer a guide to the severity of wildfires in California, a new study suggests. Increased temperatures due to global warming and more effective efforts to contain fires mean there's now more dry wood to burn. This means that large wildfires of the kind seen in 2018 can now happen in any year, regardless of how wet the previous winter was. The researchers say huge blazes may be a sign of things to come. Their study is published in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,external. Last year was California's most destructive and deadly wildfire season on record. Pictures beamed around the world revealed the havoc wrought as fires devastated whole communities. During winter, moisture in the form of precipitation is delivered to California by a fast moving band of air called the jet stream. A US-German team of scientists reconstructed fire and moisture patterns, along with the position of the North Pacific jet stream, over the past 400 years. A future of more frequent, more intense fires will pose a challenge for firefighters in the region They combined instrumental and historical records of temperature, rainfall and fires, with the natural archives of climate and fires contained in tree rings. They found that from 1600 to 1903, the position of the North Pacific jet stream over California was linked to the amount of winter rainfall and the severity of the subsequent wildfire season. Wet winters brought on by the jet stream were followed by a less intense wildfire season, while dry winters were followed by more intense fires. California's deadliest wildfire kills 42 California fire town needs 'total rebuild' Snapshots from California 'apocalypse' town But after 1904, the connection between winter moisture and wildfires was seen to weaken. This coincides with the beginning of a fire suppression policy on US federal lands. The connection then disappears completely after 1977. ""When the jet stream is positioned over California, it's like a fire hose - it brings storms and moisture straight over California,"" said Valerie Trouet from the University of Arizona's Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research. ""What we see post-1900 is that the position of the jet stream is still an important driver of moisture to California - it brings moisture to California when it's in the right position - but there's a disconnect with fire."" Dr Trouet's colleague on the paper, Eduardo Zorita, from Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht in Germany, told BBC News: ""Humans have a strong influence on fire events in several ways: directly, through fire suppression... but another indirect effect is that if human societies suppress fires, more fuel is available for later. ""Fire is a natural phenomenon that's very important for forest dynamics on longer timescales: for the way that forests renew themselves and grow and incorporate new species... human societies interrupt these forest and fire dynamics."" Now, the build-up of vegetation - the fuel - has combined with the effects of rising temperatures due to climate change to produce a situation where any year may have large fires, no matter how wet the previous winter. High spring and summer temperatures dry out the abundant vegetation and, when combined with high winds, the area burned can greatly increase. ""It may happen that for certain periods, the frequency of fires is suppressed by humans, but when a fire occurs, its intensity may be bigger than it would have been without human intervention,"" said Dr Zorita. The year 2017 was a good example of the situation described in the paper. The wet winter of 2016-17 was followed by many large fires in 2017. The 2018 fire season saw the largest area burned on record, causing more than $3.5bn in damage. Satellite image of the Camp Fire in California taken in November 2018 Climate scientist Dr Ioana Colfescu, from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) at the University of Leeds, UK, told BBC News: ""They find that whether precipitation is enhanced or reduced in the case of a high CO2 future, California faces increasing fire potential due to thermodynamic warming and this can be a mechanism for the recent California fires (despite wet extremes)."" She said the ""excellent study"" added a lot to what was currently known about the effects of long-term climate change on California fires. Dr Colfescu, who was not involved with the study, explained that several factors could introduce uncertainty into the results. ""When using observational records, the data quality varies depending on the source; when using numerical models, whether because our methods are imperfect or because we're still missing minor details, the outputs vary. Last, the climate system contains 'noise' (chaos or internal variability),"" she said. ""Each of these three aspects can introduce uncertainty in the results and the hallmarks of what is called chaos in mathematics can't be eliminated. ""While always keeping this in mind, as well as taking into account implications of a limited observational record, combined methodologies like the ones used in this study are the way to understand better what we already think we know and to prepare for the future.""

One Twitter blunder in 2014 cost a leading MP her job in the shadow cabinet. The then shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry was campaigning in Rochester in Kent for a by-election, when she sent this tweet of three England flags and a white van. The tweet was posted on polling day The then Labour leader Ed Miliband said he was ""furious"" about the tweet which gave a ""misleading impression"". The resident of the house, Dan Ware, said Ms Thornberry was a ""snob"" while her actions were also criticised by Conservative leader David Cameron and UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Ms Thornberry told reporters she ""made a mistake"" and apologised ""if she had upset or insulted anybody"", before quitting her post. MPs who slip up on social media should take comfort in the fact that these things do blow over - Ms Thornberry is now back on the Labour front bench in a more senior role, as shadow foreign secretary.

In a Commons debate, Walthamstow's Labour MP Stella Creasy read out the names of 18 young people who have been killed in London in 2019, adding: ""This is an emergency that requires an emergency response."" Lord Hogan-Howe, who led the Metropolitan Police force from 2011 to 2017, said a 93% rise in the number of under-16s stabbed over five years - revealed by Channel 4's Dispatches - was a ""terrifying statistic"" and ""something has to change"". He said a tsar, rather than individual police forces, should be put in charge of how money is spent to tackle knife crime - especially when it comes to officer recruitment. ""I'd want to know, week after week, when are you recruiting them? When do they arrive? When do they get trained? And when do they hit the streets?"" he told the BBC. ""If it's not treated as a crisis, it will take another two years before we see action."" Tsars are unelected independent advisers to the government who help to shape policy on a range of issues from drug misuse to how to reinvigorate the high street.

It can't go on."" Prime Minister Theresa May said she recognised people's concern, but insisted there was ""no direct correlation"" between the rise in knife crime anda fall in police numbers. The Met's Assistant Commissioner, Graham McNulty, said tackling violent crime ""remains the Met's priority"", adding officers from the violent crime unit worked extended shifts over the weekend. He said: ""The increased police presence has made a difference with officers conducting over 2,500 stop and searches in the last three days alone."" Can knife crime be stopped before it starts? Dealing with rising tide of knife crime How Scotland stemmed the tide Rising knife crime in England and Wales: Ten charts NHS data shows that the number of children aged 16 and under treated for stab wounds in England rose from 180 in 2012-13 to 347 in 2017-18. Two boys, both aged 17, have been arrested on suspicion of Yousef's murder and remain in police custody. Officers say Jodie's attacker was a male in his late teens who stabbed her in the back without saying a word. There are no descriptions of a second suspect. Jodie's family branded it a ""totally random and unprovoked attack"". Labour councillor Tele Lawal said the government must ""wake up"" The Labour councillor for Heaton, Tele Lawal, who attended Jodie's sixth form college, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""She was a scout, loved by the community. To have a person like her taken away - is that not a wake-up call for our government? ""It shocks us all. For me as a councillor, what more can we be doing?"" By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Three teenagers, Hazrat Umar, Abdullah Muhammad and Sidali Mohamed (l-r), were stabbed to death recently in Birmingham Before you try to solve any problem, you need to know what's causing it. The Home Office says the spike in knife crime, and serious violence more generally, is largely being driven by disputes over drugs. So, with the National Crime Agency, it's set up a co-ordination centre to focus efforts on disrupting supply and catching dealers. But it's also clear many stabbings are not linked to drugs - they're part of a tit-for-tat cycle of street violence between gangs which breeds fear among young people and prompts them to carry weapons. There's a consensus that fixing that requires a two-pronged approach. More visible and intrusive policing, such as stop-and-search, to suppress the problem, together with longer-term prevention work (known as the public health model) to identify and support those at risk of being drawn into violent gangs at an early stage. Where there's disagreement is whether cuts to policing and other public services have played a role in the surge in violence. For ministers, to acknowledge resources are a factor would mean admitting their policies contributed to the problem and providing funding to rectify it. The killings at the weekend follow the deaths ofthree other teenagers in knife attacks in Birmingham in two weeks, prompting West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David  Jamieson to brand the situation a""national emergency"". Hazrat Umar, 17, was killed in Bordesley Green on Monday; Abdullah Muhammad, 16, died in Small Heath the previous week, and seven days earlier Sidali Mohamed, 16, was stabbed outside a college in Highgate. This video can not be played Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Graham McNulty says tackling violent crime 'remains the priority' In October, the Home Office set out arange of actions to tackle violent crime,external, including a Â£200m youth endowment fund and a consultation on a new legal duty to treat serious violence as a public health issue. It also revealed plans for a consultation to adopt a new ""public health"" approach to tackling serious violence. Mr Khan later said violence would be treated as a ""disease infecting communities"".

Baby rabbits and pigeons have been among the first to benefit from the scheme at New Arc Animal Rescue Centre, near Ellon. It replaces the grooming they would receive from parents. Mascara brushes have been donated from as far afield as Australia and America. Kevin Newell, who helps care for the animals at the rescue centre, told BBC Scotland of the successful appeal: ""We have been inundated - we have got more wands here than in Hogwarts. ""The mascara brushes are cleaned, and we get them ready for the baby season. They are usually orphaned. ""If using on a small rabbit it's fantastic as they are so fine, it removes mites and dust, and once that grooming process is in place it's a bonding thing. ""It's like parental care. It keeps them clean, happy and healthy."" He added: ""We have given these brushes a second life - and we will then get them recycled and made into another product.""
