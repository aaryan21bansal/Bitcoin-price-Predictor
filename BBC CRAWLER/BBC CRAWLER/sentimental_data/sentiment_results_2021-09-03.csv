"Accolade, the wine giant that makes Hardys, has warned that truck driver shortages could hit the busy festive season and push up costs. Robert Foye, its boss, said the firm was being hit by external staff shortages, especially among suppliers, in distribution and delivery. Companies operating in the UK are having to deal with a shortage of lorry drivers. Firms including Wetherspoons and McDonald's have been affected. Lorry driver shortages have also have been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. Mr Foye said: ""These shortages, if they continue, could definitely impact Christmas. We are trying to get ahead of it, but it does depend on the situation for the entire transport and trucking industry in the UK."" Mr Foye also warned that shortages could push up costs. ""The only way we can mitigate this is if we work very closely with our trucking and transport suppliers and our customers. We have done some of that and are managing well so far, but ultimately costs will go up."" Australia's Accolade, the UK's largest wine firm and the world's fifth biggest, delivers 35 million cases to 143 countries every year. Wetherspoons runs low on some beer brands Bin collection delays linked to driver shortage How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Its brands include Hardys, Echo Falls, Kumala, Banrock Station and Stowells. ""Staff shortages are definitely there and there's a whole new group of employees that need to be trained, from truck drivers to restaurant staff,"" Mr Foye added. Consumers are seeing the impact of driver shortages and supply chain strains, from McDonalds halting milkshake sales to supermarkets running out of Diet Coke. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) estimates there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers. Marc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM ISI, said Western Europe and the US were experiencing similar shortages. ""All the anecdotal evidence suggests that the large pay rises and even signing-on bonuses have done little to alleviate the problem,"" he said. ""Christmas supply delivery problems are highly probable, above all due to the extensive lockdowns over the past two months in China and much of eastern Asia."" Accolade's large Â£100m Park facility in Bristol is the largest wine distribution centre in Europe, with capacity to fill over a million bottles per year and distribute more than 180 million litres of wine annually. The industry has felt the effect of global lockdowns that restricted large swathes of the hospitality industry. Mr Foye said that despite the lifting of UK restrictions, business was taking longer to get back to pre-Covid levels. ""In the UK you're 100% opened up, but because of the effect of Covid, because people's habits have changed and some outlets gone out of business, you're really only at 65% of the level of 2019 levels. We think it's going to take two years to get back to 90-95% level in the UK."" He added: ""Jump over to US, they're opening extremely fast and are at the 90% level."" The firm, which pioneered wine blending back in 1853, predicts rising demand for low alcohol wine - defined as 9.9% alcohol content or less by Accolade - and is about to launch a zero-alcohol wine. ""No or low alcohol will grow 20% plus per year for the next five years and eventually be 15-20% of all wine,"" he said. Australian wine makers are also weathering trade tensions with China after Beijing levied 200% tariffs on Australian wine in March. China is the world's biggest red wine market and was the top buyer of Australian wine before the tariffs hit.

"This video can not be played Footage captures dancing thief stealing Rolex watch in Birmingham A street thief was caught on CCTV using ""a bizarre dance"" to distract a victim before stealing her Â£9,000 Rolex watch. Police said Abdelhadi Bahou Jabour approached a couple in Birmingham on 10 July and struck up banter. He then broke out in a dance routine described by police as ""part Bruce Forsyth, part Artful Dodger"" as he slipped off the woman's watch. Jabour, from Findern Green, Sneinton, Nottingham, admitted two robberies and an attempted robbery. After failing to steal the man's watch, when it snagged on his cuff, West Midlands Police said the 24-year-old jogged away from Colmore Row. He soon stumbled across another woman wearing a Â£4,700 Rolex watch, which he also made off with. Jabour is due to be sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on 6 October. Latest news from the West Midlands Police said the ""nimble-footed"" thief's dance moves, which included ""grinding up against the woman"" and flicking out his leg, proved an effective way of diverting the couple's attention. Jabour is due to be sentenced on 6 October ""Normally pickpockets try to steal using stealth so you won't even feel it,"" PC Mat Evans said. ""But this technique uses the opposite approach, using excessive contact to misdirect your attention away from the sensation of having your pockets emptied or, in this case, your watch stolen."" He said it was a skill that took ""many hours of training"" to perfect. ""I've seen the 'Ronaldinho' technique used before, but this offender's particular dance moves were the most bizarre I've ever seen. Part Bruce Forsyth, part Artful Dodger,"" PC Evans added In the second theft of the night, in St Phillip's Cathedral grounds, police said Jabour sang It's Coming Home in an attempt to divert the woman's attention, although she realised something was wrong and resisted. Jabour then twisted her arm before slipping off her designer watch. He was spotted in the city centre later in the month and arrested. His mobile phone was examined and police said pictures of a house party showed Abdul Boychaala and Hussen Ehab,who were jailed for the same ruse.

"""Why are you travelling without a mahram?"" the Taliban guard asks a young Afghan woman about her missing male escort. She sits on her own in the back of a beat-up Kabul yellow taxi as it pulls up to the checkpoint marked, like all the others, by the white Taliban flag with black script. What is allowed now in Kabul, and what is not? The turbaned Talib, rifle slung over shoulder, tells her to call her husband. When she explains she doesn't have a phone, he instructs another taxi driver to take her home to get her husband and bring them back. Once completed, all is resolved. Kabul is still a city of a grinding traffic gridlock, wooden market carts groaning with Afghan green grapes and deep purple plums, and street kids in tattered tunics threading through the melee. Kabul's markets are still open On the surface, the city seems much the same. It's not. It's a capital governed by Taliban statements, and some Taliban on the streets. ""Be careful in how you deal with your people. This nation has suffered a lot. Be gentle,"" urged spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid in an impromptu press conference, flanked by fighters in full combat gear, the first day after the last US soldier flew home. Some things don't need saying. As soon as the Taliban swept, with surprising speed, into Kabul last month, Afghans knew what to do during Taliban rule 2.0. Men stopped shaving to allow beards to grow; women switched bright scarves to black ones and checked the length of their dresses and cloaks. So much else is uncertain, unnerving. ""What should I do?"" many Afghans ask in urgent cries for advice, and assistance to escape, tumbling by the hour onto my phone and computer, and those of countless others around the world. Maryam Rajaee knew what to do when Kabul collapsed. On 15 August, as Taliban fighters surged into the streets, she was conducting a long- awaited workshop for female prosecutors in the attorney general's office. ""We must continue,"" her eager students implored her when she flagged the looming threat. But her class soon resigned itself to this sudden reversal. Since then, Rajaee has been moving from one safe house to the next with her family including two young children. Maryam Rajaee was leading a workshop on female prosecutors when the Taliban took power Her three-year-old daughter, Nilofar, already says she wants to be an engineer; her multi-coloured plastic building blocks sit in the corner of a mud-brick room, a late summer sun streams through the windows. No one is quite sure yet what Taliban leaders mean when they say women and girls will be given ""all their rights within Islam"". Many women, including Rajaee, were told in no uncertain terms, ""don't come back to the office"". Many fear they'll never be allowed to return to the life they lived in a city they no longer feel is their own. ""It is my right to be educated, to have a good job, to participate in society at a high level,"" Rajaee tells us as she sits next to a pile of textbooks for her university degree, and her work heading a unit on gender and human rights awareness. ""All my dreams have been destroyed,"" she reflects, her voice breaking. Two decades of international engagement created a space for new ideas, new identities. Now some lives lived are a liability. ""I have good memories of our Christmas parties, of times we cooked delicious food and we were all so happy,"" reminisces Hameed, who'd been a head chef at the British embassy in Kabul for 13 years. We sit cross-legged on a carpet with his five young children, and a pile of faded photographs and certificates of appreciation for his work. Hameed worked at the British embassy but feels betrayed But Hameed, and some 60 other employees at the embassy were hired through a private contractor. Sources say almost all of the staff directly employed by Britain's foreign office managed to fly out of Kabul before Taliban moved in; contractors were left behind. ""We worked so hard, even during the Covid lockdown. If they don't take us out of here, it is a big betrayal,"" laments Hameed. Britain, like some other Western countries, is promising to find ways to help, in third countries, but for many it's a daunting and dangerous prospect to find new routes out. Some have already fled from this city in haste; some now happily rush in. Taliban fighters stream into Kabul from the provinces. A group from Uruzgan, in central Afghanistan, invite us for a chat as we approach the entrance to Kabul airport. ""I haven't been able to visit Kabul for years,"" says 25-year-old Rafiullah, effusive about his ""great happiness"". Asked about the many educated Afghans his own age who feel their future has disappeared, he waves an olive branch. ""We are all Afghans and the country is now moving toward a good path of peace and prosperity."" ""We are all Afghans,"" the Taliban says In some neighbourhoods, Taliban fighters go house-to-house. There's a knock on the door, a demand to hand over government phones and cars, anything of value from their old job. Sometimes even private cars are seized by Taliban who doubt it could have been afforded without some kind of corruption. In western Kabul, in neighbourhoods like Dasht-e-Barchi, populated largely by members of the minority Hazara community, residents whisper of house searches, of men being taken away. ""I'm scared,"" says one woman who travels into the centre of the city for her job. ""We are telling the Taliban we are our family's only source of income and we have to go to work."" In the heart of Kabul, the queues in front of the banks stretch all the way down the street. Most branches are shut; most have no money. ""It's been a week I have been coming every day to get some money,"" declares one man in the bulging crowd. ""This is a new start just to go backwards."" From rural areas, far from this city in so many ways, come comments of relief that American warplanes have finally left the skies, that fighting has gone. For millions of Afghans who live with deepening hunger and hardship, life hasn't changed one jot in their struggle just to survive. Crowds have been forming outside banks In this time between the collapse of the old order and the creation of the new, many take each day, as it comes. ""Is this history, is this real, I can't believe my eyes what I am seeing,"" says freelance Afghan journalist Ahmed Mangli when we meet by Kabul airport. We talk in a district strewn with rubbish and luggage abandoned during the scramble to board the last military flights during the unprecedented international airlift. Mangli first started working in Kabul when the Taliban were ousted 20 years ago. ""The Taliban spokesman is trying to co-ordinate media but everyone has a weapon, everyone feels they are king,"" he reflects. ""I don't know how long I can take this risk but I want to be part of this history."" Kabul make-up artist: 'Women like me are Taliban targets' The two countries throwing a lifeline to the Taliban Panjshir - the valley trying to hold off the Taliban A historic moment unfolds; a historic past is being undone. Billboards with beaming brides in glittering white gowns and racy red lipstick are now being blacked out. The sweeping street murals of the Art Lords team - which told stories of courageous journalists, committed doctors, a yearning for peace after so much war - are being painted over. The first to go was an image, starkly painted in black and white, to mark the signing of a deal last year in Doha between the Taliban and the United States. A people of poets now struggles to find words. An old friend, Masood Khalili, who's fought on so many fronts over so many years, sends me some verse.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"""Why are you travelling without a mahram?"" the Taliban guard asks a young Afghan woman about her missing male escort. She sits on her own in the back of a beat-up Kabul yellow taxi as it pulls up to the checkpoint marked, like all the others, by the white Taliban flag with black script. What is allowed now in Kabul, and what is not? The turbaned Talib, rifle slung over shoulder, tells her to call her husband. When she explains she doesn't have a phone, he instructs another taxi driver to take her home to get her husband and bring them back. Once completed, all is resolved. Kabul is still a city of a grinding traffic gridlock, wooden market carts groaning with Afghan green grapes and deep purple plums, and street kids in tattered tunics threading through the melee. Kabul's markets are still open On the surface, the city seems much the same. It's not. It's a capital governed by Taliban statements, and some Taliban on the streets. ""Be careful in how you deal with your people. This nation has suffered a lot. Be gentle,"" urged spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid in an impromptu press conference, flanked by fighters in full combat gear, the first day after the last US soldier flew home. Some things don't need saying. As soon as the Taliban swept, with surprising speed, into Kabul last month, Afghans knew what to do during Taliban rule 2.0. Men stopped shaving to allow beards to grow; women switched bright scarves to black ones and checked the length of their dresses and cloaks. So much else is uncertain, unnerving. ""What should I do?"" many Afghans ask in urgent cries for advice, and assistance to escape, tumbling by the hour onto my phone and computer, and those of countless others around the world. Maryam Rajaee knew what to do when Kabul collapsed. On 15 August, as Taliban fighters surged into the streets, she was conducting a long- awaited workshop for female prosecutors in the attorney general's office. ""We must continue,"" her eager students implored her when she flagged the looming threat. But her class soon resigned itself to this sudden reversal. Since then, Rajaee has been moving from one safe house to the next with her family including two young children. Maryam Rajaee was leading a workshop on female prosecutors when the Taliban took power Her three-year-old daughter, Nilofar, already says she wants to be an engineer; her multi-coloured plastic building blocks sit in the corner of a mud-brick room, a late summer sun streams through the windows. No one is quite sure yet what Taliban leaders mean when they say women and girls will be given ""all their rights within Islam"". Many women, including Rajaee, were told in no uncertain terms, ""don't come back to the office"". Many fear they'll never be allowed to return to the life they lived in a city they no longer feel is their own. ""It is my right to be educated, to have a good job, to participate in society at a high level,"" Rajaee tells us as she sits next to a pile of textbooks for her university degree, and her work heading a unit on gender and human rights awareness. ""All my dreams have been destroyed,"" she reflects, her voice breaking. Two decades of international engagement created a space for new ideas, new identities. Now some lives lived are a liability. ""I have good memories of our Christmas parties, of times we cooked delicious food and we were all so happy,"" reminisces Hameed, who'd been a head chef at the British embassy in Kabul for 13 years. We sit cross-legged on a carpet with his five young children, and a pile of faded photographs and certificates of appreciation for his work. Hameed worked at the British embassy but feels betrayed But Hameed, and some 60 other employees at the embassy were hired through a private contractor. Sources say almost all of the staff directly employed by Britain's foreign office managed to fly out of Kabul before Taliban moved in; contractors were left behind. ""We worked so hard, even during the Covid lockdown. If they don't take us out of here, it is a big betrayal,"" laments Hameed. Britain, like some other Western countries, is promising to find ways to help, in third countries, but for many it's a daunting and dangerous prospect to find new routes out. Some have already fled from this city in haste; some now happily rush in. Taliban fighters stream into Kabul from the provinces. A group from Uruzgan, in central Afghanistan, invite us for a chat as we approach the entrance to Kabul airport. ""I haven't been able to visit Kabul for years,"" says 25-year-old Rafiullah, effusive about his ""great happiness"". Asked about the many educated Afghans his own age who feel their future has disappeared, he waves an olive branch. ""We are all Afghans and the country is now moving toward a good path of peace and prosperity."" ""We are all Afghans,"" the Taliban says In some neighbourhoods, Taliban fighters go house-to-house. There's a knock on the door, a demand to hand over government phones and cars, anything of value from their old job. Sometimes even private cars are seized by Taliban who doubt it could have been afforded without some kind of corruption. In western Kabul, in neighbourhoods like Dasht-e-Barchi, populated largely by members of the minority Hazara community, residents whisper of house searches, of men being taken away. ""I'm scared,"" says one woman who travels into the centre of the city for her job. ""We are telling the Taliban we are our family's only source of income and we have to go to work."" In the heart of Kabul, the queues in front of the banks stretch all the way down the street. Most branches are shut; most have no money. ""It's been a week I have been coming every day to get some money,"" declares one man in the bulging crowd. ""This is a new start just to go backwards."" From rural areas, far from this city in so many ways, come comments of relief that American warplanes have finally left the skies, that fighting has gone. For millions of Afghans who live with deepening hunger and hardship, life hasn't changed one jot in their struggle just to survive. Crowds have been forming outside banks In this time between the collapse of the old order and the creation of the new, many take each day, as it comes. ""Is this history, is this real, I can't believe my eyes what I am seeing,"" says freelance Afghan journalist Ahmed Mangli when we meet by Kabul airport. We talk in a district strewn with rubbish and luggage abandoned during the scramble to board the last military flights during the unprecedented international airlift. Mangli first started working in Kabul when the Taliban were ousted 20 years ago. ""The Taliban spokesman is trying to co-ordinate media but everyone has a weapon, everyone feels they are king,"" he reflects. ""I don't know how long I can take this risk but I want to be part of this history."" Kabul make-up artist: 'Women like me are Taliban targets' The two countries throwing a lifeline to the Taliban Panjshir - the valley trying to hold off the Taliban A historic moment unfolds; a historic past is being undone. Billboards with beaming brides in glittering white gowns and racy red lipstick are now being blacked out. The sweeping street murals of the Art Lords team - which told stories of courageous journalists, committed doctors, a yearning for peace after so much war - are being painted over. The first to go was an image, starkly painted in black and white, to mark the signing of a deal last year in Doha between the Taliban and the United States. A people of poets now struggles to find words. An old friend, Masood Khalili, who's fought on so many fronts over so many years, sends me some verse.

"Pat Hume, pictured here with her husband in 2010, was the ""perfect partner"" for John Pat Hume has been described as the most ""extraordinarily strong woman, with the softest, most gentle manner"". The widow of the late SDLP leader and Nobel prize winner John Hume died on Thursday after a short illness, aged 83. Former Irish President Mary McAleese paid tribute to Mrs Hume saying she was ""the perfect partner"" to John Hume. Mrs Hume worked alongside her husband from the beginning of the civil rights movement in Londonderry in the 1960s. Her death comes just over a yearafter the death of her husband. ""She was a nurturer, she was a coper,"" said Dr McAleese, who recently spent a day with Mrs Hume. Listen: Pat Hume on her life with John Pat Hume, widow of John Hume, has died Nobel Peace Prize winner John Hume dies Hume Foundation 'will inspire future generations' In a statement on Thursday, the Hume family said they were ""heartbroken"", adding that she ""died as she lived - surrounded by family, peacefully and generous to the end"". The family paid tribute to the medical staff who cared for their mother in her final days. Speaking to Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster, Dr McAleese said John relied on Pat for her ""wisdom and advice"". ""Pat was an extravagantly wise woman, she had a huge wisdom,"" she added. ""I don't know anybody who I have met in my life who was more rounded and more grounded than Pat. This video can not be played Political leaders pay tribute to Pat Hume ""She was able to synthesise common sense, compassion, political nous in a way that was really, really special and absolutely essential to John."" Dr McAleese said Mrs Hume ""never looked for the limelight... but boy is she deserving of a mountain of praise."" Foyle MP and current SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Mrs Hume has left ""a tremendous legacy for everyone in Derry and across Ireland"". ""John always said: 'I'm the parcel and Pat delivers me.' ""That was true,"" he added. ""I genuinely don't believe any of the of the things John achieved would have been possible without Pat. ""She just had such strength and also belief in what they were doing, she was as driven to bring about a peaceful, and just Ireland as he was."" ""The people of Derry and the people of Ireland owe them both a great debt."" Pat Hume was, according to her husband John, his rock and key adviser throughout his long political career. As a journalist in the north west, you were always very keen to get Pat Hume's insight into current political developments. Her brain was so sharp and she was able to cut through a lot of the spin and nonsense - delivering lines you wouldn't hear from politicians. I always found her very frustrating, but very frustrating in a nice way. The more I tried to question her, and get advice and a steer from her, the more she would ask me about my family, my career and how things were going for me. You always came away from meeting her having unburdened yourself, without having gleaned the information you were hoping to get. Like her husband John, she was always interested in people and that cut to the core of what they were about as a couple. They were very much rooted in the Derry community and were more interested in the people around them, than mixing with the great and the good. Pat Hume's name never appeared on an election ballot paper, but her influence on the political path in Northern Ireland stretched far beyond many politicians. John and Pat Hume with David Trimble and Hillary Clinton in Belfast in 2012 Paying tribute to Mrs Hume on Friday, former US President Bill Clinton said that she ""played an enormous role"" in helping to achieve peace in Northern Ireland. ""All of us who were blessed by the way she lived her life and advanced her cause with such grace and good humour will be forever grateful,"" he said. Hillary Clinton, former US secretary of state and presidential candidate, described her as ""a gracious, determined force behind the achievement of peace in Ireland"". Mrs Clinton added that the Humes ""made the world a better place and set an example for us all"". Former Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin said Pat Hume was ""one of the bedrocks of the peace process who kept her nerve at the worst of times"". ""She didn't flinch, John Hume didn't flinch and they prevailed in the end,"" the former Sinn FÃ©in Foyle MLA said. When talks with the Sinn FÃ©in leadership were held at the Humes' home in Derry, Pat ""set the atmosphere for constructive and calm conversation"". He added: ""Unfailingly, no matter the circumstances, Pat Hume was always steady, steadfast, she clearly was across all the discussions. ""She was always focused on finding ways through the disagreements and I think John Hume was benefitting from her advice on an ongoing basis. I think republicans benefitted as well, I know I certainly did."" John and Pat Hume pictured beside one of Mr Hume's election poster in 1999 Ulster Unionist MLA Mike Nesbitt, a trustee of the John and Pat Hume Foundation, said the Hume's shared a view of Northern Ireland politics that was ahead of its time. ""Everybody else was talking about a divided society and the negativity of that, John and Pat were talking in a very positive way about the benefits of the fact we have a very diverse society,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle. He said she was ""more than just John's rock"" and along with Daphne Trimble, wife of former Ulster Unionist party leader Lord Trimble, had playeda key role in supporting victims,externaland survivors of the Troubles. Lady Trimble said she shared a ""warm friendship"" with Mrs Hume. ""She was one of the best, simply one of the best people I have ever met,"" she said. Her friend will be sorely missed, she added. Mrs Hume's work continued during the Troubles, through to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. She ran her husband's Foyle constituency office dealing with community issues, housing and poverty in Derry. Mrs Hume, a former teacher, wasawarded the Irish Red Cross Lifetime Achievement award in 2018. A foundation honouring John and Pat Hume's peace and reconciliation work waslaunched in November last year. A book of condolence has opened in the main hall of Derry's Guildhall. The city's Mayor Graham Warke said it would allow people to ""offer the people the chance to pay their respects and say thank you to a remarkable and courageous woman"". Mrs Hume's funeral Mass will be held at St Eugene's Cathedral in Derry at 11:00 BST on Monday. Members of the public are invited to watch the service live via webcam.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul.

Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West.

As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said.

""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul.

"Social care must be adequately funded, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said, amid reports ministers plan to raise national insurance. Downing Street did not deny reports of an increase of at least 1% to improve social care and tackle the NHS backlog. The justice secretary said he would not ""speculate"" but said there should be a ""grown-up conversation"" about how to pay for rising social care costs. The move would break a Tory manifesto commitment at the last election. ""The British public are sensible enough to know that when it comes to the issue of social care we have to find some way in which it will be adequately funded,"" Mr Buckland told BBC Breakfast. He said that the Conservative Party had also promised at the 2019 election that it would bring forward sustainable proposals to fund social care. The Daily Telegraph reports thatDowning Street favours a 1% rise,externalin the national insurance rate, affecting about 25 million workers and self-employed people, as well as employers. But it says the Treasury is pushing for a 1.25% increase. And the Times adds thatHealth and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid wants a bigger rise of 2%,external. But a source close to Mr Javid said that 2% figure was incorrect and the BBC understands the health secretary is pushing for a lower figure. Ministers urged to act now on social care funding Labour: Why would we oppose a social care tax? For someone on average earnings of Â£29,536 a year, a 1% increase in national insurance would cost them Â£199.68 annually. The Telegraph says the funds will be used to put a cap on the amount an individual has to spend on social care costs over their lifetime. In their manifesto, the Conservatives said: ""The prerequisite of any solution will be a guarantee that no-one needing care has to sell their home to pay for it."" The government said it was ""committed to bringing forward a long-term plan to reform the social care system"". In a statement, it said proposals would be set out this year. Boris Johnson appears to be ready to break one promise in order to keep another. He is considering going against a manifesto commitment not to raise national insurance in order to deliver on his vow to fix social care. If the plan is put forward it will need a hard sell - to the public, most of whom will still pay large amounts towards care, and to Conservative MPs, for whom raising taxes is repellent. How best to look after the elderly, disabled and others needing care is one of society's most pressing questions. How to persuade the public to pay for it is the government's most pressing problem and a huge political challenge. Labour said the NHS and social care needed proper investment but it was wrong to raise national insurance., which would disproportionately hit low-earners, young people and businesses. ""Boris Johnson still hasn't come forward with the plan for social care he promised over two years ago, and instead they're proposing a manifesto-breaking tax rise that would hit working people and businesses hard,"" said shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson. It comes asformer health secretary Jeremy Hunt wrote in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat there should be a new ""health and care premium"" added to tax instead, as he warned against raising national insurance or income tax. Mr Hunt, who now chairs the Commons health committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government must ""bite the bullet"" and find some way to increase taxes. ""The sums are eye-watering, far bigger than a chancellor can find down the back of a Treasury sofa,"" he said. But he said a national insurance increase was the wrong approach because it would not be paid by pensioners. ""Since older people are the biggest beneficiaries I think it's only fair that they should make a contribution,"" Mr Hunt said. National insurance is paid on the profits of self-employed people and the earnings of employees when they exceed Â£9,568 a year. They then pay 12% of their income up to about Â£50,000 a year, when it drops to 2%. That has raised concerns that any rise to national insurance would affect low earners more than high earners. An ageing population means growing demand However, council spending in England is about 3% lower than in 2010 Age UK estimates 1.5 million people in England don't get the help they need The fees local authorities pay for care - in a person's own home or a care home - vary hugely People who don't qualify for free care are often charged more, with no maximum limit on costs There are huge staff shortages - Age UK estimates there are about 45,000 vacancies Nine challenges facing the social care system Boris Johnson has been under increasing pressure to set out his plan for social care reform. Speaking on the steps of Downing Street on his first day as prime minister in 2019, he pledged to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared"". But that plan has yet to be published. On top of long-term funding challenges, the social care sector has also faced extra costs because of the pandemic. Councils, which provide social care, have seen their budgets cut over the last decade. The squeeze on council funding in England means that people who pay for themselves are often propping up the care system. In England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than Â£23,250 can get help from their council. There is no overall limit on costs, meaning thousands every year end up selling their homes to pay. Personal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs. The Scottish National Party said the UK government at Westminster should guarantee Scottish workers would not pay for an ""England-only policy"". Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland. Ministers urged to act now on social care funding Labour: Why would we oppose a social care tax?

"This video can not be played NZ PM Jacinda Ardern: ""This was a violent attack. It was senseless"" Police in New Zealand shot and killed a ""violent extremist"" after he stabbed and wounded at least six people in an Auckland supermarket. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the incident was a ""terrorist attack"" carried out by a Sri Lankan national who was under police surveillance. The man, who has not been officially named, was a supporter of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group, she said. Police killed the man within 60 seconds of the attack on Friday. ""What happened today was despicable, it was hateful it was wrong,"" Ms Ardern said in a news conference. ""It was carried out by an individual, not a faith."" Of the six wounded people, three are in a critical condition and one is in a serious condition, health officials say. ""The hospital staff are doing everything they can to preserve their lives,"" Auckland Mayor Phil Goff told the BBC. ""We're all horrified by what's happened. But... justice came pretty swiftly for the offender,"" he added. It happened at the Countdown supermarket at LynnMall in the Auckland district of New Lynn on Friday afternoon. Police commissioner Andrew Coster said a surveillance team and a specialist tactics group had followed the man from his home to the supermarket. But while there were concerns about the him, officials said they had no reason to think he was planning an attack on Friday, and the team believed he was going to do his grocery shopping. After entering the store, however, the attacker got hold of a knife and went on a stabbing spree. New Zealand's PM say incident at supermarket was a ""terrorist attack"" Shopper Michelle Miller told local news outlet Stuff that the man was ""running around like a lunatic"" and attacking people. ""All I heard was a lot of screaming,"" she said. ""[People were] running out, hysterically, just screaming, yelling, scared,"" another witness said, adding that he saw an elderly man lying on the ground with a stab wound. Witnesses also said the attacker had shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). Mr Coster said police rushed over upon hearing the commotion and shot and killed the attacker when he charged at the officers with the knife. Footage from the supermarket shared online showed people fleeing before the sound of gun shots could be heard. Analysis by Phil Mercer, BBC News This callous act in Auckland will stir painful memories of the deadly mosque attacks in Christchurch in 2019. In that attack, a lone gunman - a self-confessed white supremacist - murdered 51 worshippers.  Once again, New Zealand's geographic isolation and peaceful reputation have proved to be no defence against extremism. The assailant had, for years, been identified as a threat to national security and was under 24-hour surveillance. The police acted decisively to prevent further carnage, but they weren't close enough to stop serious injuries.  New terror laws could, however, allow volatile individuals to be detained in the future. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has sent a message of support: Kia Kaha New Zealand, he wrote, using Maori words. Stay strong. The man, whose identity cannot be revealed due to court suppression orders, arrived in New Zealand in October 2011. He became a person of national security interest in 2016. He had been under round-the-clock monitoring and heavy surveillance due to concerns about his ideology. He was known to multiple agencies, and was also on a terror watchlist. Local media reports said the attacker was 32 years old and had recently been sentenced to one year of supervision for possessing IS propaganda. Prosecutors had accused him of plotting a ""lone wolf"" terror attack using knives, but the judge ruled that planning a terror attack was not in itself an offence under existing laws, the reports said. His internet search history and bookmarks included heroes of Isis, Islamic State dress, and New Zealand prison clothes and food, according to Stuff. Ms Ardern said that until Friday, he had not committed any offence. When asked about the man's motivations, she said they were ""Isis-inspired"". Questions have been raised about why action against him was not taken before six people were injured - especially since he was under close surveillance. ""The reality is, that when you are surveilling someone on a 24/7 basis, it is not possible to be immediately next to them at all times. The staff intervened as quickly as they could and they prevented further injury in what was a terrifying situation,"" said Mr Coster. He added that the attacker was very surveillance-conscious, and that teams needed to maintain a distance to be effective. Authorities are confident the attacker was acting alone and that there is no further danger to the community, according to Mr Coster. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

"Pat Hume, pictured here with her husband in 2010, was the ""perfect partner"" for John Pat Hume has been described as the most ""extraordinarily strong woman, with the softest, most gentle manner"". The widow of the late SDLP leader and Nobel prize winner John Hume died on Thursday after a short illness, aged 83. Former Irish President Mary McAleese paid tribute to Mrs Hume saying she was ""the perfect partner"" to John Hume. Mrs Hume worked alongside her husband from the beginning of the civil rights movement in Londonderry in the 1960s. Her death comes just over a yearafter the death of her husband. ""She was a nurturer, she was a coper,"" said Dr McAleese, who recently spent a day with Mrs Hume. Listen: Pat Hume on her life with John Pat Hume, widow of John Hume, has died Nobel Peace Prize winner John Hume dies Hume Foundation 'will inspire future generations' In a statement on Thursday, the Hume family said they were ""heartbroken"", adding that she ""died as she lived - surrounded by family, peacefully and generous to the end"". The family paid tribute to the medical staff who cared for their mother in her final days. Speaking to Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster, Dr McAleese said John relied on Pat for her ""wisdom and advice"". ""Pat was an extravagantly wise woman, she had a huge wisdom,"" she added. ""I don't know anybody who I have met in my life who was more rounded and more grounded than Pat. This video can not be played Political leaders pay tribute to Pat Hume ""She was able to synthesise common sense, compassion, political nous in a way that was really, really special and absolutely essential to John."" Dr McAleese said Mrs Hume ""never looked for the limelight... but boy is she deserving of a mountain of praise."" Foyle MP and current SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Mrs Hume has left ""a tremendous legacy for everyone in Derry and across Ireland"". ""John always said: 'I'm the parcel and Pat delivers me.' ""That was true,"" he added. ""I genuinely don't believe any of the of the things John achieved would have been possible without Pat. ""She just had such strength and also belief in what they were doing, she was as driven to bring about a peaceful, and just Ireland as he was."" ""The people of Derry and the people of Ireland owe them both a great debt."" Pat Hume was, according to her husband John, his rock and key adviser throughout his long political career. As a journalist in the north west, you were always very keen to get Pat Hume's insight into current political developments. Her brain was so sharp and she was able to cut through a lot of the spin and nonsense - delivering lines you wouldn't hear from politicians. I always found her very frustrating, but very frustrating in a nice way. The more I tried to question her, and get advice and a steer from her, the more she would ask me about my family, my career and how things were going for me. You always came away from meeting her having unburdened yourself, without having gleaned the information you were hoping to get. Like her husband John, she was always interested in people and that cut to the core of what they were about as a couple. They were very much rooted in the Derry community and were more interested in the people around them, than mixing with the great and the good. Pat Hume's name never appeared on an election ballot paper, but her influence on the political path in Northern Ireland stretched far beyond many politicians. John and Pat Hume with David Trimble and Hillary Clinton in Belfast in 2012 Paying tribute to Mrs Hume on Friday, former US President Bill Clinton said that she ""played an enormous role"" in helping to achieve peace in Northern Ireland. ""All of us who were blessed by the way she lived her life and advanced her cause with such grace and good humour will be forever grateful,"" he said. Hillary Clinton, former US secretary of state and presidential candidate, described her as ""a gracious, determined force behind the achievement of peace in Ireland"". Mrs Clinton added that the Humes ""made the world a better place and set an example for us all"". Former Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin said Pat Hume was ""one of the bedrocks of the peace process who kept her nerve at the worst of times"". ""She didn't flinch, John Hume didn't flinch and they prevailed in the end,"" the former Sinn FÃ©in Foyle MLA said. When talks with the Sinn FÃ©in leadership were held at the Humes' home in Derry, Pat ""set the atmosphere for constructive and calm conversation"". He added: ""Unfailingly, no matter the circumstances, Pat Hume was always steady, steadfast, she clearly was across all the discussions. ""She was always focused on finding ways through the disagreements and I think John Hume was benefitting from her advice on an ongoing basis. I think republicans benefitted as well, I know I certainly did."" John and Pat Hume pictured beside one of Mr Hume's election poster in 1999 Ulster Unionist MLA Mike Nesbitt, a trustee of the John and Pat Hume Foundation, said the Hume's shared a view of Northern Ireland politics that was ahead of its time. ""Everybody else was talking about a divided society and the negativity of that, John and Pat were talking in a very positive way about the benefits of the fact we have a very diverse society,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle. He said she was ""more than just John's rock"" and along with Daphne Trimble, wife of former Ulster Unionist party leader Lord Trimble, had playeda key role in supporting victims,externaland survivors of the Troubles. Lady Trimble said she shared a ""warm friendship"" with Mrs Hume. ""She was one of the best, simply one of the best people I have ever met,"" she said. Her friend will be sorely missed, she added. Mrs Hume's work continued during the Troubles, through to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. She ran her husband's Foyle constituency office dealing with community issues, housing and poverty in Derry. Mrs Hume, a former teacher, wasawarded the Irish Red Cross Lifetime Achievement award in 2018. A foundation honouring John and Pat Hume's peace and reconciliation work waslaunched in November last year. A book of condolence has opened in the main hall of Derry's Guildhall. The city's Mayor Graham Warke said it would allow people to ""offer the people the chance to pay their respects and say thank you to a remarkable and courageous woman"". Mrs Hume's funeral Mass will be held at St Eugene's Cathedral in Derry at 11:00 BST on Monday. Members of the public are invited to watch the service live via webcam.

"Social care must be adequately funded, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said, amid reports ministers plan to raise national insurance. Downing Street did not deny reports of an increase of at least 1% to improve social care and tackle the NHS backlog. The justice secretary said he would not ""speculate"" but said there should be a ""grown-up conversation"" about how to pay for rising social care costs. The move would break a Tory manifesto commitment at the last election. ""The British public are sensible enough to know that when it comes to the issue of social care we have to find some way in which it will be adequately funded,"" Mr Buckland told BBC Breakfast. He said that the Conservative Party had also promised at the 2019 election that it would bring forward sustainable proposals to fund social care. The Daily Telegraph reports thatDowning Street favours a 1% rise,externalin the national insurance rate, affecting about 25 million workers and self-employed people, as well as employers. But it says the Treasury is pushing for a 1.25% increase. And the Times adds thatHealth and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid wants a bigger rise of 2%,external. But a source close to Mr Javid said that 2% figure was incorrect and the BBC understands the health secretary is pushing for a lower figure. Ministers urged to act now on social care funding Labour: Why would we oppose a social care tax? For someone on average earnings of Â£29,536 a year, a 1% increase in national insurance would cost them Â£199.68 annually. The Telegraph says the funds will be used to put a cap on the amount an individual has to spend on social care costs over their lifetime. In their manifesto, the Conservatives said: ""The prerequisite of any solution will be a guarantee that no-one needing care has to sell their home to pay for it."" The government said it was ""committed to bringing forward a long-term plan to reform the social care system"". In a statement, it said proposals would be set out this year. Boris Johnson appears to be ready to break one promise in order to keep another. He is considering going against a manifesto commitment not to raise national insurance in order to deliver on his vow to fix social care. If the plan is put forward it will need a hard sell - to the public, most of whom will still pay large amounts towards care, and to Conservative MPs, for whom raising taxes is repellent. How best to look after the elderly, disabled and others needing care is one of society's most pressing questions. How to persuade the public to pay for it is the government's most pressing problem and a huge political challenge. Labour said the NHS and social care needed proper investment but it was wrong to raise national insurance., which would disproportionately hit low-earners, young people and businesses. ""Boris Johnson still hasn't come forward with the plan for social care he promised over two years ago, and instead they're proposing a manifesto-breaking tax rise that would hit working people and businesses hard,"" said shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson. It comes asformer health secretary Jeremy Hunt wrote in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat there should be a new ""health and care premium"" added to tax instead, as he warned against raising national insurance or income tax. Mr Hunt, who now chairs the Commons health committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government must ""bite the bullet"" and find some way to increase taxes. ""The sums are eye-watering, far bigger than a chancellor can find down the back of a Treasury sofa,"" he said. But he said a national insurance increase was the wrong approach because it would not be paid by pensioners. ""Since older people are the biggest beneficiaries I think it's only fair that they should make a contribution,"" Mr Hunt said. National insurance is paid on the profits of self-employed people and the earnings of employees when they exceed Â£9,568 a year. They then pay 12% of their income up to about Â£50,000 a year, when it drops to 2%. That has raised concerns that any rise to national insurance would affect low earners more than high earners. An ageing population means growing demand However, council spending in England is about 3% lower than in 2010 Age UK estimates 1.5 million people in England don't get the help they need The fees local authorities pay for care - in a person's own home or a care home - vary hugely People who don't qualify for free care are often charged more, with no maximum limit on costs There are huge staff shortages - Age UK estimates there are about 45,000 vacancies Nine challenges facing the social care system Boris Johnson has been under increasing pressure to set out his plan for social care reform. Speaking on the steps of Downing Street on his first day as prime minister in 2019, he pledged to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared"". But that plan has yet to be published. On top of long-term funding challenges, the social care sector has also faced extra costs because of the pandemic. Councils, which provide social care, have seen their budgets cut over the last decade. The squeeze on council funding in England means that people who pay for themselves are often propping up the care system. In England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than Â£23,250 can get help from their council. There is no overall limit on costs, meaning thousands every year end up selling their homes to pay. Personal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs. The Scottish National Party said the UK government at Westminster should guarantee Scottish workers would not pay for an ""England-only policy"". Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland. Ministers urged to act now on social care funding Labour: Why would we oppose a social care tax?

"A retailers group said it was important to follow the instructions with the barbecues Shops should stop selling disposable barbecues because they are a ""truly modern menace"", the Welsh Conservative climate change spokeswoman has said. Senedd member Janet Finch-Saunders said the products pose ""far too many"" risks to both health and the environment. She has written to supermarkets and other retailers urging them to stop stocking them from next summer. North Wales firefighters attended three separate incidents with disposable barbecues in a single day this year. Responding to Ms Finch-Saunders's call, a retail group urged people to use the products responsibly. Co-op pulls instant barbecues near national parks Council plans disposable BBQs ban Writing to retailers, the Aberconwy Senedd member (MS) asked them to take a ""civic-minded, ecologically friendly leadership position"" on single-use barbecues. Commenting on her letter, she said: ""As these foil barbeques are portable, they may be used in unsuitable locations such as under trees or near long grass, bushes or fences, which may easily catch fire. ""As the bottom of the barbecue can get extremely hot, and with prolonged dry weather over the summer, there is potential to damage the ground. ""As we witnessed earlier this summer, they can also cause unnecessary bin fires if disposed of before they have cooled to a suitable temperature."" Janet Finch-Saunders is the Welsh Conservatives' spokeswoman on climate change in the Senedd/Welsh Parliament Ms Finch-Saunders also highlighted the fact the products are ""non-recyclable"" at a time when it is important to reuse materials as much as possible and said this should prompt retailers to ""pause for thought"". ""I have found them discarded and left under sand to scar feet,"" she said. ""This would not be happening if customers were pointed towards reusable portable barbecues."" She said it was important to highlight the issue now before stock decisions are taken by firms. Welsh Retail Consortium head Sara Jones said: ""Retailers often offer a range of reusable or disposable barbecues, which provide a great way for people to enjoy the Welsh outdoors. ""However, it is extremely important that users realise that these must be used responsibly. ""That means following the on-pack instructions and ensuring that if they are disposed of then it is done so correctly.""

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up.

Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said.

""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions.

"This video can not be played NZ PM Jacinda Ardern: ""This was a violent attack. It was senseless"" Police in New Zealand shot and killed a ""violent extremist"" after he stabbed and wounded at least six people in an Auckland supermarket. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the incident was a ""terrorist attack"" carried out by a Sri Lankan national who was under police surveillance. The man, who has not been officially named, was a supporter of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group, she said. Police killed the man within 60 seconds of the attack on Friday. ""What happened today was despicable, it was hateful it was wrong,"" Ms Ardern said in a news conference. ""It was carried out by an individual, not a faith."" Of the six wounded people, three are in a critical condition and one is in a serious condition, health officials say. ""The hospital staff are doing everything they can to preserve their lives,"" Auckland Mayor Phil Goff told the BBC. ""We're all horrified by what's happened. But... justice came pretty swiftly for the offender,"" he added. It happened at the Countdown supermarket at LynnMall in the Auckland district of New Lynn on Friday afternoon. Police commissioner Andrew Coster said a surveillance team and a specialist tactics group had followed the man from his home to the supermarket. But while there were concerns about the him, officials said they had no reason to think he was planning an attack on Friday, and the team believed he was going to do his grocery shopping. After entering the store, however, the attacker got hold of a knife and went on a stabbing spree. New Zealand's PM say incident at supermarket was a ""terrorist attack"" Shopper Michelle Miller told local news outlet Stuff that the man was ""running around like a lunatic"" and attacking people. ""All I heard was a lot of screaming,"" she said. ""[People were] running out, hysterically, just screaming, yelling, scared,"" another witness said, adding that he saw an elderly man lying on the ground with a stab wound. Witnesses also said the attacker had shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). Mr Coster said police rushed over upon hearing the commotion and shot and killed the attacker when he charged at the officers with the knife. Footage from the supermarket shared online showed people fleeing before the sound of gun shots could be heard. Analysis by Phil Mercer, BBC News This callous act in Auckland will stir painful memories of the deadly mosque attacks in Christchurch in 2019. In that attack, a lone gunman - a self-confessed white supremacist - murdered 51 worshippers.  Once again, New Zealand's geographic isolation and peaceful reputation have proved to be no defence against extremism. The assailant had, for years, been identified as a threat to national security and was under 24-hour surveillance. The police acted decisively to prevent further carnage, but they weren't close enough to stop serious injuries.  New terror laws could, however, allow volatile individuals to be detained in the future. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has sent a message of support: Kia Kaha New Zealand, he wrote, using Maori words. Stay strong. The man, whose identity cannot be revealed due to court suppression orders, arrived in New Zealand in October 2011. He became a person of national security interest in 2016. He had been under round-the-clock monitoring and heavy surveillance due to concerns about his ideology. He was known to multiple agencies, and was also on a terror watchlist. Local media reports said the attacker was 32 years old and had recently been sentenced to one year of supervision for possessing IS propaganda. Prosecutors had accused him of plotting a ""lone wolf"" terror attack using knives, but the judge ruled that planning a terror attack was not in itself an offence under existing laws, the reports said. His internet search history and bookmarks included heroes of Isis, Islamic State dress, and New Zealand prison clothes and food, according to Stuff. Ms Ardern said that until Friday, he had not committed any offence. When asked about the man's motivations, she said they were ""Isis-inspired"". Questions have been raised about why action against him was not taken before six people were injured - especially since he was under close surveillance. ""The reality is, that when you are surveilling someone on a 24/7 basis, it is not possible to be immediately next to them at all times. The staff intervened as quickly as they could and they prevented further injury in what was a terrifying situation,"" said Mr Coster. He added that the attacker was very surveillance-conscious, and that teams needed to maintain a distance to be effective. Authorities are confident the attacker was acting alone and that there is no further danger to the community, according to Mr Coster. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"".

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"The UK records another 42,076 coronavirus cases - the highest daily figure for six weeks - and 121 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test The JCVI, the UK government's vaccine advisers, decide not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for all children aged between 12 and 15 But about 200,000 more 12 to 15-year-olds with certain health problems will now be eligible for the vaccines Chief medical officers are now being asked by health secretaries to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating more children They will look at issues such as any effect on education and then advise the UK and devolved governments before a final decision is made One in 75 people in the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 August, the Office for National Statistics estimates The UK is sending four million doses of the Pfizer jab to Australia as part of a Covid vaccine swap deal The EU and AstraZeneca have ended a legal dispute about supply of coronavirus vaccines Edited by James Clarke That's all from us today - your updates have come from Francesca Gillett, Alex Therrien, Doug Faulkner, Vanessa Barford and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news soon. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main stories of the day: Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) member Prof Adam Finn says the decision not to recommend rolling out the vaccine to healthy children under 15 was based on a ""risk-benefit balance"". The professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol says: ""Although the vaccine works and would be beneficial in the sense of preventing infection and some severe disease from Covid, there are significant uncertainties around the safety of the vaccine that have not yet been clarified such that we can't be sure that the risk-benefit balance is sufficiently good in favour and to the benefit of those children to recommend it."" He says the large majority of severe cases in children - and the very small number of deaths in the age group - occurred in children who were ""identifiably at high risk because of other medical conditions"", which is why the vaccine is being rolled out to more of these children. While the JCVI is not recommending jabs for healthy 12 to 15 year olds, 200,000 more in that age group who are vulnerable will be offered a vaccine. This includes those who have chronic heart, lung and liver conditions. Children aged 12 and over who have severe neurodisability, Down's syndrome, a severely weakened immune system or profound and multiple learning difficulties are also recommended two doses of vaccine. Currently under-18s are being given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although the Moderna vaccine hasalso been authorised for use in children in the UK,external. You can fine out morehere. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, says if we are going to vaccinate children it has to be in their interests and ""not in society's interests"". He says it is not an easy decision but says he supports the decision of the JCVI, which he says has given the matter a ""substantial amount of thought"". Prof Hunter says the JCVI has taken different decisions to other countries in the past and points to the 12-week delay it originally recommended between first and second jabs, which he says saved ""many thousands of lives"". He says in the first wave of the pandemic schools played an important part in transmission but as the pandemic has gone on schools being open has had ""a decreasingly important roll in the rollout of the pandemic"". ""Yes, schools almost certainly will be associated with some increase in transmission but it is doubtful that will be a huge impact on the epidemic,"" he says. Additional safety measures in schools will become ""more important"" if all 12 to 15-year-olds are not vaccinated, a teaching union says. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, says: ""If the decision not to vaccinate is upheld by the chief medical officers, this makes additional safety mitigations in schools all the more important. ""Sadly, in taking away so many safety measures last term, without replacing them with others, the government has left schools open to another rise in case counts - which will mean many children and staff missing school if they test positive."" Christina Pagel said the JCVI's decision was  ""out of step"" with most other high-income countries The decision by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation not to recommend Covid vaccines for all 12 to 15-year-olds is ""out of step"" with the stance taken by most other high-income countries, a scientist says. Christina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London, says the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have all recommended vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds. Pagel, a member of the Independent Sage group set up to scrutinise decisions made by the government on coronavirus, says a recent ONS report estimated one in 1,000 children have had long Covid for more than a year. She also pointed toa study,externalthat found the risk of myocarditis - an inflammation of the heart - was greater in people who were infected with Covid versus those who had been vaccinated. ""It doesn't really make any sense to me that we're not trying to protect children from Covid."" The US has vaccinated more than 10 million 12-15-year-olds and France, Italy, Canada and Israel are among other countries vaccinating children. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says he is ""disappointed"" by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) decision not to recommend jabs for healthy 12 to 15-year-olds. He says his union is pleased more children with health vulnerabilities will receive vaccines and that he understands the decision is based on an assessment of the ""balance of risks"". But he says: ""Nevertheless, the upshot is that this would make it more difficult during the autumn term and beyond to guard against educational disruption caused by transmission of the virus."" BBC MonitoringBy Shayan Sardarizadeh A group of anti-vaccine protesters have clashed with police officers during an attempt to break into the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) office in Canary Wharf. The Metropolitan Police says four of its officers have been injured. The group, which calls itself Official Voice, has staged similar protests outside the former BBC Television Centre, ITN Productions, Google and Facebook buildings. Organising its rallies on the Telegram messaging app, the group claims to be against vaccinating children and so-called vaccine passports. The groupâs online presence is also full of debunked conspiracy theories about Covid vaccines, including false claims that mRNA vaccines are a form of âgene therapyâ or that the vaccine is a âdepopulation toolâ for a shadowy global elite. Anti-vaccine protests across the UK have become more frequent and increasingly more aggressive in recent weeks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A further 121 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been reported. Meanwhile, 43,142,747 people have received both doses of a coronavirus vaccine and 5,029251  have received just one dose, as of 2 September. The UK's four chief medical officers are to provide further advice on the vaccination of children aged 12 to 15 with Covid-19 vaccines following the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They are being asked to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating children, such as any impact on education. The JCVI advised the health benefits from vaccination are marginally greater than the potential known harms, but stopped short of recommending vaccinations for all 12 to 15-year-olds. The UK's Health Secretary Sajid Javid says he and the other UK health secretaries have written to the chief medical officers to ask that they consider the vaccination of 12 to 15-year-olds ""from a broader perspective, as suggested by the JCVI"". âWe will then consider the advice from the chief medical officers, building on the advice from the JCVI, before making a decision shortly.â Javid has asked the NHS to put preparations in place to roll out vaccinations to 12 to 15-year-olds, should it be recommended by the chief medical officers. Catherine BurnsHealth correspondent The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has decided to invite another 200,000 12 to 15-year-olds with underlying health problems for Covid vaccines - but has stopped short of extending it to all teenagers. Instead, health minister from all four UK nations will ask their chief medical officers to decide. They will also consider aspects such as the impact on education. This means that about 350,000 12 to 15-year-olds with certain health problems are now eligible for the vaccines. There are more than three million 12 to 15-year-olds in the UK. The vaccine experts did decide the benefits to children do marginally outweigh the risks â but that wasnât enough for them to recommend universal vaccination for this age group. They weighed up the very rare risk of young people developing myocarditis â an inflammation of the heart. In the US, for every million Pfizer second doses given to 12 to 17-year-old boys, around 60 had the condition. It was eight in a million for girls. The Netherlands is among the nations already rolling out Covid jabs to 12 to 15-year-olds The government's vaccine advisers have decided not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children aged between 12 and 15. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has announced it is widening the so-far limited rollout to more children in this age bracket who have underlying health conditions. But it is not recommending mass vaccination of children aged between 12 and 15. The programme is being extended from what had been considered the most at-risk children, to include children with chronic major heart, lung, kidney, liver and neurological conditions. It means about 200,000 more children will be invited for vaccines. The decision comes exactly a week after the Department of Health and Social Care confirmed preparations were under way to ensure the NHS was ready to offer coronavirus jabs to all 12 to 15-year-olds in England from early September. The department said it wanted to be ""ready to hit the ground running"". The Borders General Hospital is said to be experiencing considerable ongoing pressure A health board in Scotland has extended its suspension of all routine operations for a further three weeks in the face of rising Covid patient numbers. NHS Borders first announced it was stopping such surgery on 11 August. It has now confirmed that, due to ""significant pressure"" at the Borders General Hospital, it will not resume before 26 September. The health board says the decision has not been easy and all patients affected will be contacted directly. Read more. If you're fully vaccinated, you can currently enjoy perks like not having to self-isolate after coming into contact with someone with Covid, and being able to travel abroad without certain restrictions. But from the end of September, the plan is to make proof of your Covid status - for example that you're fully vaccinated or have tested negative - a requirement to get into nightclubs and some other crowded venues in England and Scotland. Today,Scotlandhas just made it easier to proveyour vaccine status by allowing people to download or receive a paper QR code that can be scanned. InEngland, you can download your Covid pass via the NHS app (not the NHS Covid app) if you are registered with a GP, or get it online or by calling 119. InWalesyou can also download the NHS Covid pass, and people inNorthern Irelandcan apply for the certificate online and use it for travel. More details on what to do here. Levels of crime were ""remarkably low"" in Jersey asclubs reopened for the first time, police say. Some of Jersey'slast Covid restrictions were lifted on 26 August, allowing dancing and large gatherings to return. Among those hitting the clubs was Clodagh O'Brien who turned 18 on the day restrictions were lifted in Jersey. ""I've always wanted to go, so I was pretty excited,"" she says. While Jason McDonald, who runs security company JMD Secure, says the bank holiday weekend was ""off-the-walls busy"" but adds ""we had no trouble which was really unbelievable"". We've been hearing today about Scotland now allowing people to download their vaccine certificate as a QR code - like what happens in England. But it's now emerged that a security flaw which allows people to edit their vaccination status certificates has not been fixed - three months after it was first identified. The BBCreported in May how vaccination status details could be alteredusing popular computer software programmes. A fix was rolled out which meant people could only request the document be sent to them by post. But the certificates are available to download again and still editable. BBC Scotland was able to download a certificate and edit it to include a false name, date of birth and the address of the BBC's Glasgow headquarters. Read more here. There are signs that the Delta variant in the US is harming the recovery of the economy. New government data released on Friday showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected in August - with employment rising by 235,000. The figure was well down on the 1.05 million jobs created in July, adding to fears that the recovery from the pandemic may be running out of steam. Despite the disappointing hiring levels, the unemployment rate declined to 5.2% in August from 5.4% the previous month. The dollar fell on foreign exchange markets after the announcement. We've got more here. Earlier we reported on a call from scientists to vaccinate all children over 12. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is still pondering its judgement on whether jabs should be given to healthy children in this age group but there is general agreement that this is a really tricky call to make. The JCVI is focusing squarely on the benefits of vaccination to children themselves - not on how it helps other people. Children's risk from Covid isn't zero but the chances of them becoming seriously ill from Covid are incredibly small. That means there needs to be a clear and obvious advantage to giving them a jab. However,a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccineshas made that calculation a lot more complicated. Here Philippa Roxby takes a look atthe factors the JCVI will have to consider. The England Under-21s football team were due to play Romania in a friendly today but the match has beencancelled after two positive Covid-19 tests in the English camp. The Young Lions did not travel to Bucharest, with the Football Association saying positive tests were reported ""within the party of players and support staff"". Individuals concerned were ""immediately isolated from the rest of the group"". New head coach Lee Carsley had been set to take charge for the first time, having been appointed in July. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Asda has announced plans to open nearly 230 convenience stores at petrol stations owned by the Issa brothers. Billionaires Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who bought the supermarket giant last year, will launch 28 Asda on the Move shops this year after trialling the format at five petrol stations. They will be rolled-out at petrol forecourts controlled by EG Group, the Issa brothers' business. Asda said it intended to launch a further 200 stores next year. The move will give Asda a foothold in the convenience stores market after falling behind rivals such as Tesco and Sainsbury's, which have long operated smaller format shops. One of the first actions that the Issa brothers took after buying Asda last year with private equity firm TDR Capital for Â£6.8bn, was to open a small number of Asda on the Move stores. Asda: How to buy a Â£6.8bn supermarket for Â£780m The supermarket said the shops would be up to 3,000 sq ft and stock up to 2,500 products. Asda will supply goods to EG Group on a wholesale basis. Asda also announced its latest trading figures which showed that like-for-like sales fell by 0.7% between the beginning of April and the end of June. It blamed the fall on the comparison to last year when the UK entered its first Covid lockdown and households stocked up on shopping.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"The Treasury must ""urgently"" confirm extra funding before councils can start making offers to house Afghan refugees, a document seen by the BBC suggests. It estimates the cost of helping those coming to the UK over the next 10 years could be more than Â£2.5bn. And it suggests a shortfall in the cash committed by Whitehall so far. A government spokesperson said hundreds of Afghan nationals who had worked alongside the British in Afghanistan had already been welcomed to the UK. But Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said it was ""deeply worrying"" that the government was ""failing to step up and play its role in providing national coordination, leadership and support"". The Treasury has been asked to comment on the contents of the leaked document. Council leader shocked at 1,350 empty army homes Where will resettled Afghans live in the UK? How many Afghan asylum seekers has the UK taken in? Thousands of people have fled Afghanistansince the country fell to the Taliban in August, as US and UK troops withdrew their forces after 20 years on the ground. Around 15,000 people eligible to come to the UK were evacuated in the final two weeks, including 8,000 Afghans who had worked alongside British forces. But the government has admittedit cannot be precise with how many others were left behind. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is in the regionto try to negotiate safe passage through neighbouring countries for Britons and others still trying to leave Afghanistan. Speaking at a press conference in Pakistan, he pledged Â£30m in aid to bordering countries taking in the majority of the refugees, to help provide shelter and sanitation. And he promised the UK would be ""shouldering our humanitarian responsibilities"" to help. The government is talking to councils about how many people could be resettled in their areas when they reach the UK, calling for a fair distribution across the country. This call was echoed in a joint statement by council leaders in Greater Manchester, including its mayor, Labour's Andy Burnham, who said ""every part of the country needs to take a share of the responsibility across all schemes, asylum and resettlement"" - rather than areas with lower house prices accommodating ""far higher numbers of those seeking sanctuary"". The leaked document - Afghan Resettlement: Domestic Support Offer and Funding Requirements - was discussed by ministers on Wednesday. It said just under Â£400m has been allocated so far to help resettle those who had fled the country, but an extra Â£557m could be needed over the next three years. Left behind in Afghanistan: If I canât get out, Iâll die Afghans who worked for UK can stay permanently The government intends to provide funding to local authorities to accommodate Afghans, and the document says relocation costs were a ""substantial - but necessary - offer of support"". Ministers met to discuss resettling plans on Friday before holding a meeting with local authority leaders, telling them to see ""no offer of housing and support as too small"". But the BBC understands the councils were not given confirmation of how much funding they would receive. This video can not be played Getting the plane out of Afghanistan was the ""happiest moment of my life"" Among the councils offering support, Walsall Council in the West Midlands has taken in 69 evacuees so far and says it hopes to house up to 120. Mike Bird, the council leader, said it was a difficult task, housing families with children who needed school places. ""With children going back to school, and the pressure on school places, that in itself is something the government don't seem to be taking into account,"" he said. ""We've got the whole of the UK that should be considered. If only one [some] councils are coming forward... then the government have got to step in and make sure it does happen."" One refugee, Ahmed, whose real name is not being used, arrived in the UK from Kabul with his wife and six children in July. He told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme this week about the challenges his family faced. ""We have been living in hotels for quite a while now in larger groups and it's becoming tougher and tougher, so it's time for us to move to a proper house,"" he said. ""That is the overarching concern we are having, because we can't have a bank account."" Schemes for people fleeing the country include the existing Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) for Afghans who worked with the UK government and a new Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) for vulnerable people. Funding models for the resettlement schemes are still being developed, but initial proposals suggested the figures would be based on 5,000 Afghans arriving under the ACRS scheme per year (capped at 20,000 people) at a cost of Â£715m, 5,000 arriving under the UK Resettlement Scheme each year at a cost of Â£1.65bn, and 7,000 arriving under the ARAP scheme in 2021-2 at a cost of Â£190m. The document also suggested that while some refugees would require more support than others, local authorities should be given a set amount per person housed to make their funding easier to plan. It recommended local authorities should be given Â£20,520 per person split over three years, plus more for education costs. It also recommended extra healthcare funding of Â£3,200 per person and Â£15m funding per year to ""international partners"" to support resettlement in third countries. These initial funding proposals suggest the costs would reach Â£187m in 2021/2 and Â£975m over the course of this spending review period - which lasts until 2024/5. But the document said that with just under Â£400m of this funding already committed, there would be a shortfall of approximately Â£557m, so confirmation of further funding from the Treasury will be required ""urgently"". Labour's Mr Thomas-Symonds accused ministers of being ""disastrously complacent"" throughout the crisis in Afghanistan. He said: ""Councils across the country want to do the right thing, so it's deeply worrying that the UK government is failing to step up and play its role in providing national coordination, leadership and support.""

"This video can not be played NZ PM Jacinda Ardern: ""This was a violent attack. It was senseless"" Police in New Zealand shot and killed a ""violent extremist"" after he stabbed and wounded at least six people in an Auckland supermarket. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the incident was a ""terrorist attack"" carried out by a Sri Lankan national who was under police surveillance. The man, who has not been officially named, was a supporter of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group, she said. Police killed the man within 60 seconds of the attack on Friday. ""What happened today was despicable, it was hateful it was wrong,"" Ms Ardern said in a news conference. ""It was carried out by an individual, not a faith."" Of the six wounded people, three are in a critical condition and one is in a serious condition, health officials say. ""The hospital staff are doing everything they can to preserve their lives,"" Auckland Mayor Phil Goff told the BBC. ""We're all horrified by what's happened. But... justice came pretty swiftly for the offender,"" he added. It happened at the Countdown supermarket at LynnMall in the Auckland district of New Lynn on Friday afternoon. Police commissioner Andrew Coster said a surveillance team and a specialist tactics group had followed the man from his home to the supermarket. But while there were concerns about the him, officials said they had no reason to think he was planning an attack on Friday, and the team believed he was going to do his grocery shopping. After entering the store, however, the attacker got hold of a knife and went on a stabbing spree. New Zealand's PM say incident at supermarket was a ""terrorist attack"" Shopper Michelle Miller told local news outlet Stuff that the man was ""running around like a lunatic"" and attacking people. ""All I heard was a lot of screaming,"" she said. ""[People were] running out, hysterically, just screaming, yelling, scared,"" another witness said, adding that he saw an elderly man lying on the ground with a stab wound. Witnesses also said the attacker had shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). Mr Coster said police rushed over upon hearing the commotion and shot and killed the attacker when he charged at the officers with the knife. Footage from the supermarket shared online showed people fleeing before the sound of gun shots could be heard. Analysis by Phil Mercer, BBC News This callous act in Auckland will stir painful memories of the deadly mosque attacks in Christchurch in 2019. In that attack, a lone gunman - a self-confessed white supremacist - murdered 51 worshippers.  Once again, New Zealand's geographic isolation and peaceful reputation have proved to be no defence against extremism. The assailant had, for years, been identified as a threat to national security and was under 24-hour surveillance. The police acted decisively to prevent further carnage, but they weren't close enough to stop serious injuries.  New terror laws could, however, allow volatile individuals to be detained in the future. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has sent a message of support: Kia Kaha New Zealand, he wrote, using Maori words. Stay strong. The man, whose identity cannot be revealed due to court suppression orders, arrived in New Zealand in October 2011. He became a person of national security interest in 2016. He had been under round-the-clock monitoring and heavy surveillance due to concerns about his ideology. He was known to multiple agencies, and was also on a terror watchlist. Local media reports said the attacker was 32 years old and had recently been sentenced to one year of supervision for possessing IS propaganda. Prosecutors had accused him of plotting a ""lone wolf"" terror attack using knives, but the judge ruled that planning a terror attack was not in itself an offence under existing laws, the reports said. His internet search history and bookmarks included heroes of Isis, Islamic State dress, and New Zealand prison clothes and food, according to Stuff. Ms Ardern said that until Friday, he had not committed any offence. When asked about the man's motivations, she said they were ""Isis-inspired"". Questions have been raised about why action against him was not taken before six people were injured - especially since he was under close surveillance. ""The reality is, that when you are surveilling someone on a 24/7 basis, it is not possible to be immediately next to them at all times. The staff intervened as quickly as they could and they prevented further injury in what was a terrifying situation,"" said Mr Coster. He added that the attacker was very surveillance-conscious, and that teams needed to maintain a distance to be effective. Authorities are confident the attacker was acting alone and that there is no further danger to the community, according to Mr Coster. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

"The UK records another 42,076 coronavirus cases - the highest daily figure for six weeks - and 121 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test The JCVI, the UK government's vaccine advisers, decide not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for all children aged between 12 and 15 But about 200,000 more 12 to 15-year-olds with certain health problems will now be eligible for the vaccines Chief medical officers are now being asked by health secretaries to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating more children They will look at issues such as any effect on education and then advise the UK and devolved governments before a final decision is made One in 75 people in the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 August, the Office for National Statistics estimates The UK is sending four million doses of the Pfizer jab to Australia as part of a Covid vaccine swap deal The EU and AstraZeneca have ended a legal dispute about supply of coronavirus vaccines Edited by James Clarke That's all from us today - your updates have come from Francesca Gillett, Alex Therrien, Doug Faulkner, Vanessa Barford and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news soon. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main stories of the day: Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) member Prof Adam Finn says the decision not to recommend rolling out the vaccine to healthy children under 15 was based on a ""risk-benefit balance"". The professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol says: ""Although the vaccine works and would be beneficial in the sense of preventing infection and some severe disease from Covid, there are significant uncertainties around the safety of the vaccine that have not yet been clarified such that we can't be sure that the risk-benefit balance is sufficiently good in favour and to the benefit of those children to recommend it."" He says the large majority of severe cases in children - and the very small number of deaths in the age group - occurred in children who were ""identifiably at high risk because of other medical conditions"", which is why the vaccine is being rolled out to more of these children. While the JCVI is not recommending jabs for healthy 12 to 15 year olds, 200,000 more in that age group who are vulnerable will be offered a vaccine. This includes those who have chronic heart, lung and liver conditions. Children aged 12 and over who have severe neurodisability, Down's syndrome, a severely weakened immune system or profound and multiple learning difficulties are also recommended two doses of vaccine. Currently under-18s are being given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although the Moderna vaccine hasalso been authorised for use in children in the UK,external. You can fine out morehere. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, says if we are going to vaccinate children it has to be in their interests and ""not in society's interests"". He says it is not an easy decision but says he supports the decision of the JCVI, which he says has given the matter a ""substantial amount of thought"". Prof Hunter says the JCVI has taken different decisions to other countries in the past and points to the 12-week delay it originally recommended between first and second jabs, which he says saved ""many thousands of lives"". He says in the first wave of the pandemic schools played an important part in transmission but as the pandemic has gone on schools being open has had ""a decreasingly important roll in the rollout of the pandemic"". ""Yes, schools almost certainly will be associated with some increase in transmission but it is doubtful that will be a huge impact on the epidemic,"" he says. Additional safety measures in schools will become ""more important"" if all 12 to 15-year-olds are not vaccinated, a teaching union says. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, says: ""If the decision not to vaccinate is upheld by the chief medical officers, this makes additional safety mitigations in schools all the more important. ""Sadly, in taking away so many safety measures last term, without replacing them with others, the government has left schools open to another rise in case counts - which will mean many children and staff missing school if they test positive."" Christina Pagel said the JCVI's decision was  ""out of step"" with most other high-income countries The decision by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation not to recommend Covid vaccines for all 12 to 15-year-olds is ""out of step"" with the stance taken by most other high-income countries, a scientist says. Christina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London, says the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have all recommended vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds. Pagel, a member of the Independent Sage group set up to scrutinise decisions made by the government on coronavirus, says a recent ONS report estimated one in 1,000 children have had long Covid for more than a year. She also pointed toa study,externalthat found the risk of myocarditis - an inflammation of the heart - was greater in people who were infected with Covid versus those who had been vaccinated. ""It doesn't really make any sense to me that we're not trying to protect children from Covid."" The US has vaccinated more than 10 million 12-15-year-olds and France, Italy, Canada and Israel are among other countries vaccinating children. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says he is ""disappointed"" by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) decision not to recommend jabs for healthy 12 to 15-year-olds. He says his union is pleased more children with health vulnerabilities will receive vaccines and that he understands the decision is based on an assessment of the ""balance of risks"". But he says: ""Nevertheless, the upshot is that this would make it more difficult during the autumn term and beyond to guard against educational disruption caused by transmission of the virus."" BBC MonitoringBy Shayan Sardarizadeh A group of anti-vaccine protesters have clashed with police officers during an attempt to break into the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) office in Canary Wharf. The Metropolitan Police says four of its officers have been injured. The group, which calls itself Official Voice, has staged similar protests outside the former BBC Television Centre, ITN Productions, Google and Facebook buildings. Organising its rallies on the Telegram messaging app, the group claims to be against vaccinating children and so-called vaccine passports. The groupâs online presence is also full of debunked conspiracy theories about Covid vaccines, including false claims that mRNA vaccines are a form of âgene therapyâ or that the vaccine is a âdepopulation toolâ for a shadowy global elite. Anti-vaccine protests across the UK have become more frequent and increasingly more aggressive in recent weeks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The latest UK government coronavirus figures are in and there have been a further 42,076 new cases reported. The last time more new daily cases were reported was on 22 July. A further 121 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been reported. Meanwhile, 43,142,747 people have received both doses of a coronavirus vaccine and 5,029251  have received just one dose, as of 2 September. The UK's four chief medical officers are to provide further advice on the vaccination of children aged 12 to 15 with Covid-19 vaccines following the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They are being asked to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating children, such as any impact on education. The JCVI advised the health benefits from vaccination are marginally greater than the potential known harms, but stopped short of recommending vaccinations for all 12 to 15-year-olds. The UK's Health Secretary Sajid Javid says he and the other UK health secretaries have written to the chief medical officers to ask that they consider the vaccination of 12 to 15-year-olds ""from a broader perspective, as suggested by the JCVI"". âWe will then consider the advice from the chief medical officers, building on the advice from the JCVI, before making a decision shortly.â Javid has asked the NHS to put preparations in place to roll out vaccinations to 12 to 15-year-olds, should it be recommended by the chief medical officers. Catherine BurnsHealth correspondent The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has decided to invite another 200,000 12 to 15-year-olds with underlying health problems for Covid vaccines - but has stopped short of extending it to all teenagers. Instead, health minister from all four UK nations will ask their chief medical officers to decide. They will also consider aspects such as the impact on education. This means that about 350,000 12 to 15-year-olds with certain health problems are now eligible for the vaccines. There are more than three million 12 to 15-year-olds in the UK. The vaccine experts did decide the benefits to children do marginally outweigh the risks â but that wasnât enough for them to recommend universal vaccination for this age group. They weighed up the very rare risk of young people developing myocarditis â an inflammation of the heart. In the US, for every million Pfizer second doses given to 12 to 17-year-old boys, around 60 had the condition. It was eight in a million for girls. The Netherlands is among the nations already rolling out Covid jabs to 12 to 15-year-olds The government's vaccine advisers have decided not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children aged between 12 and 15. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has announced it is widening the so-far limited rollout to more children in this age bracket who have underlying health conditions. But it is not recommending mass vaccination of children aged between 12 and 15. The programme is being extended from what had been considered the most at-risk children, to include children with chronic major heart, lung, kidney, liver and neurological conditions. It means about 200,000 more children will be invited for vaccines. The decision comes exactly a week after the Department of Health and Social Care confirmed preparations were under way to ensure the NHS was ready to offer coronavirus jabs to all 12 to 15-year-olds in England from early September. The department said it wanted to be ""ready to hit the ground running"". The Borders General Hospital is said to be experiencing considerable ongoing pressure A health board in Scotland has extended its suspension of all routine operations for a further three weeks in the face of rising Covid patient numbers. NHS Borders first announced it was stopping such surgery on 11 August. It has now confirmed that, due to ""significant pressure"" at the Borders General Hospital, it will not resume before 26 September. The health board says the decision has not been easy and all patients affected will be contacted directly. Read more. If you're fully vaccinated, you can currently enjoy perks like not having to self-isolate after coming into contact with someone with Covid, and being able to travel abroad without certain restrictions. But from the end of September, the plan is to make proof of your Covid status - for example that you're fully vaccinated or have tested negative - a requirement to get into nightclubs and some other crowded venues in England and Scotland. Today,Scotlandhas just made it easier to proveyour vaccine status by allowing people to download or receive a paper QR code that can be scanned. InEngland, you can download your Covid pass via the NHS app (not the NHS Covid app) if you are registered with a GP, or get it online or by calling 119. InWalesyou can also download the NHS Covid pass, and people inNorthern Irelandcan apply for the certificate online and use it for travel. More details on what to do here. Levels of crime were ""remarkably low"" in Jersey asclubs reopened for the first time, police say. Some of Jersey'slast Covid restrictions were lifted on 26 August, allowing dancing and large gatherings to return. Among those hitting the clubs was Clodagh O'Brien who turned 18 on the day restrictions were lifted in Jersey. ""I've always wanted to go, so I was pretty excited,"" she says. While Jason McDonald, who runs security company JMD Secure, says the bank holiday weekend was ""off-the-walls busy"" but adds ""we had no trouble which was really unbelievable"". We've been hearing today about Scotland now allowing people to download their vaccine certificate as a QR code - like what happens in England. But it's now emerged that a security flaw which allows people to edit their vaccination status certificates has not been fixed - three months after it was first identified. The BBCreported in May how vaccination status details could be alteredusing popular computer software programmes. A fix was rolled out which meant people could only request the document be sent to them by post. But the certificates are available to download again and still editable. BBC Scotland was able to download a certificate and edit it to include a false name, date of birth and the address of the BBC's Glasgow headquarters. Read more here. There are signs that the Delta variant in the US is harming the recovery of the economy. New government data released on Friday showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected in August - with employment rising by 235,000. The figure was well down on the 1.05 million jobs created in July, adding to fears that the recovery from the pandemic may be running out of steam. Despite the disappointing hiring levels, the unemployment rate declined to 5.2% in August from 5.4% the previous month. The dollar fell on foreign exchange markets after the announcement. We've got more here. Earlier we reported on a call from scientists to vaccinate all children over 12. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is still pondering its judgement on whether jabs should be given to healthy children in this age group but there is general agreement that this is a really tricky call to make. The JCVI is focusing squarely on the benefits of vaccination to children themselves - not on how it helps other people. Children's risk from Covid isn't zero but the chances of them becoming seriously ill from Covid are incredibly small. That means there needs to be a clear and obvious advantage to giving them a jab. However,a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccineshas made that calculation a lot more complicated. Here Philippa Roxby takes a look atthe factors the JCVI will have to consider. The England Under-21s football team were due to play Romania in a friendly today but the match has beencancelled after two positive Covid-19 tests in the English camp. The Young Lions did not travel to Bucharest, with the Football Association saying positive tests were reported ""within the party of players and support staff"". Individuals concerned were ""immediately isolated from the rest of the group"". New head coach Lee Carsley had been set to take charge for the first time, having been appointed in July. Â© 2025 BBC.

The department said it wanted to be ""ready to hit the ground running"". The Borders General Hospital is said to be experiencing considerable ongoing pressure A health board in Scotland has extended its suspension of all routine operations for a further three weeks in the face of rising Covid patient numbers. NHS Borders first announced it was stopping such surgery on 11 August. It has now confirmed that, due to ""significant pressure"" at the Borders General Hospital, it will not resume before 26 September. The health board says the decision has not been easy and all patients affected will be contacted directly. Read more. If you're fully vaccinated, you can currently enjoy perks like not having to self-isolate after coming into contact with someone with Covid, and being able to travel abroad without certain restrictions. But from the end of September, the plan is to make proof of your Covid status - for example that you're fully vaccinated or have tested negative - a requirement to get into nightclubs and some other crowded venues in England and Scotland. Today,Scotlandhas just made it easier to proveyour vaccine status by allowing people to download or receive a paper QR code that can be scanned. InEngland, you can download your Covid pass via the NHS app (not the NHS Covid app) if you are registered with a GP, or get it online or by calling 119. InWalesyou can also download the NHS Covid pass, and people inNorthern Irelandcan apply for the certificate online and use it for travel. More details on what to do here. Levels of crime were ""remarkably low"" in Jersey asclubs reopened for the first time, police say. Some of Jersey'slast Covid restrictions were lifted on 26 August, allowing dancing and large gatherings to return. Among those hitting the clubs was Clodagh O'Brien who turned 18 on the day restrictions were lifted in Jersey. ""I've always wanted to go, so I was pretty excited,"" she says. While Jason McDonald, who runs security company JMD Secure, says the bank holiday weekend was ""off-the-walls busy"" but adds ""we had no trouble which was really unbelievable"". We've been hearing today about Scotland now allowing people to download their vaccine certificate as a QR code - like what happens in England. But it's now emerged that a security flaw which allows people to edit their vaccination status certificates has not been fixed - three months after it was first identified. The BBCreported in May how vaccination status details could be alteredusing popular computer software programmes. A fix was rolled out which meant people could only request the document be sent to them by post. But the certificates are available to download again and still editable. BBC Scotland was able to download a certificate and edit it to include a false name, date of birth and the address of the BBC's Glasgow headquarters. Read more here. There are signs that the Delta variant in the US is harming the recovery of the economy. New government data released on Friday showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected in August - with employment rising by 235,000. The figure was well down on the 1.05 million jobs created in July, adding to fears that the recovery from the pandemic may be running out of steam. Despite the disappointing hiring levels, the unemployment rate declined to 5.2% in August from 5.4% the previous month. The dollar fell on foreign exchange markets after the announcement. We've got more here. Earlier we reported on a call from scientists to vaccinate all children over 12. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is still pondering its judgement on whether jabs should be given to healthy children in this age group but there is general agreement that this is a really tricky call to make. The JCVI is focusing squarely on the benefits of vaccination to children themselves - not on how it helps other people. Children's risk from Covid isn't zero but the chances of them becoming seriously ill from Covid are incredibly small. That means there needs to be a clear and obvious advantage to giving them a jab. However,a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccineshas made that calculation a lot more complicated. Here Philippa Roxby takes a look atthe factors the JCVI will have to consider. The England Under-21s football team were due to play Romania in a friendly today but the match has beencancelled after two positive Covid-19 tests in the English camp. The Young Lions did not travel to Bucharest, with the Football Association saying positive tests were reported ""within the party of players and support staff"". Individuals concerned were ""immediately isolated from the rest of the group"". New head coach Lee Carsley had been set to take charge for the first time, having been appointed in July. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Pat Hume, pictured here with her husband in 2010, was the ""perfect partner"" for John Pat Hume has been described as the most ""extraordinarily strong woman, with the softest, most gentle manner"". The widow of the late SDLP leader and Nobel prize winner John Hume died on Thursday after a short illness, aged 83. Former Irish President Mary McAleese paid tribute to Mrs Hume saying she was ""the perfect partner"" to John Hume. Mrs Hume worked alongside her husband from the beginning of the civil rights movement in Londonderry in the 1960s. Her death comes just over a yearafter the death of her husband. ""She was a nurturer, she was a coper,"" said Dr McAleese, who recently spent a day with Mrs Hume. Listen: Pat Hume on her life with John Pat Hume, widow of John Hume, has died Nobel Peace Prize winner John Hume dies Hume Foundation 'will inspire future generations' In a statement on Thursday, the Hume family said they were ""heartbroken"", adding that she ""died as she lived - surrounded by family, peacefully and generous to the end"". The family paid tribute to the medical staff who cared for their mother in her final days. Speaking to Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster, Dr McAleese said John relied on Pat for her ""wisdom and advice"". ""Pat was an extravagantly wise woman, she had a huge wisdom,"" she added. ""I don't know anybody who I have met in my life who was more rounded and more grounded than Pat. This video can not be played Political leaders pay tribute to Pat Hume ""She was able to synthesise common sense, compassion, political nous in a way that was really, really special and absolutely essential to John."" Dr McAleese said Mrs Hume ""never looked for the limelight... but boy is she deserving of a mountain of praise."" Foyle MP and current SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Mrs Hume has left ""a tremendous legacy for everyone in Derry and across Ireland"". ""John always said: 'I'm the parcel and Pat delivers me.' ""That was true,"" he added. ""I genuinely don't believe any of the of the things John achieved would have been possible without Pat. ""She just had such strength and also belief in what they were doing, she was as driven to bring about a peaceful, and just Ireland as he was."" ""The people of Derry and the people of Ireland owe them both a great debt."" Pat Hume was, according to her husband John, his rock and key adviser throughout his long political career. As a journalist in the north west, you were always very keen to get Pat Hume's insight into current political developments. Her brain was so sharp and she was able to cut through a lot of the spin and nonsense - delivering lines you wouldn't hear from politicians. I always found her very frustrating, but very frustrating in a nice way. The more I tried to question her, and get advice and a steer from her, the more she would ask me about my family, my career and how things were going for me. You always came away from meeting her having unburdened yourself, without having gleaned the information you were hoping to get. Like her husband John, she was always interested in people and that cut to the core of what they were about as a couple. They were very much rooted in the Derry community and were more interested in the people around them, than mixing with the great and the good. Pat Hume's name never appeared on an election ballot paper, but her influence on the political path in Northern Ireland stretched far beyond many politicians. John and Pat Hume with David Trimble and Hillary Clinton in Belfast in 2012 Paying tribute to Mrs Hume on Friday, former US President Bill Clinton said that she ""played an enormous role"" in helping to achieve peace in Northern Ireland. ""All of us who were blessed by the way she lived her life and advanced her cause with such grace and good humour will be forever grateful,"" he said. Hillary Clinton, former US secretary of state and presidential candidate, described her as ""a gracious, determined force behind the achievement of peace in Ireland"". Mrs Clinton added that the Humes ""made the world a better place and set an example for us all"". Former Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin said Pat Hume was ""one of the bedrocks of the peace process who kept her nerve at the worst of times"". ""She didn't flinch, John Hume didn't flinch and they prevailed in the end,"" the former Sinn FÃ©in Foyle MLA said. When talks with the Sinn FÃ©in leadership were held at the Humes' home in Derry, Pat ""set the atmosphere for constructive and calm conversation"". He added: ""Unfailingly, no matter the circumstances, Pat Hume was always steady, steadfast, she clearly was across all the discussions. ""She was always focused on finding ways through the disagreements and I think John Hume was benefitting from her advice on an ongoing basis. I think republicans benefitted as well, I know I certainly did."" John and Pat Hume pictured beside one of Mr Hume's election poster in 1999 Ulster Unionist MLA Mike Nesbitt, a trustee of the John and Pat Hume Foundation, said the Hume's shared a view of Northern Ireland politics that was ahead of its time. ""Everybody else was talking about a divided society and the negativity of that, John and Pat were talking in a very positive way about the benefits of the fact we have a very diverse society,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle. He said she was ""more than just John's rock"" and along with Daphne Trimble, wife of former Ulster Unionist party leader Lord Trimble, had playeda key role in supporting victims,externaland survivors of the Troubles. Lady Trimble said she shared a ""warm friendship"" with Mrs Hume. ""She was one of the best, simply one of the best people I have ever met,"" she said. Her friend will be sorely missed, she added. Mrs Hume's work continued during the Troubles, through to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. She ran her husband's Foyle constituency office dealing with community issues, housing and poverty in Derry. Mrs Hume, a former teacher, wasawarded the Irish Red Cross Lifetime Achievement award in 2018. A foundation honouring John and Pat Hume's peace and reconciliation work waslaunched in November last year. A book of condolence has opened in the main hall of Derry's Guildhall. The city's Mayor Graham Warke said it would allow people to ""offer the people the chance to pay their respects and say thank you to a remarkable and courageous woman"". Mrs Hume's funeral Mass will be held at St Eugene's Cathedral in Derry at 11:00 BST on Monday. Members of the public are invited to watch the service live via webcam.

"This video can not be played NZ PM Jacinda Ardern: ""This was a violent attack. It was senseless"" Police in New Zealand shot and killed a ""violent extremist"" after he stabbed and wounded at least six people in an Auckland supermarket. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the incident was a ""terrorist attack"" carried out by a Sri Lankan national who was under police surveillance. The man, who has not been officially named, was a supporter of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group, she said. Police killed the man within 60 seconds of the attack on Friday. ""What happened today was despicable, it was hateful it was wrong,"" Ms Ardern said in a news conference. ""It was carried out by an individual, not a faith."" Of the six wounded people, three are in a critical condition and one is in a serious condition, health officials say. ""The hospital staff are doing everything they can to preserve their lives,"" Auckland Mayor Phil Goff told the BBC. ""We're all horrified by what's happened. But... justice came pretty swiftly for the offender,"" he added. It happened at the Countdown supermarket at LynnMall in the Auckland district of New Lynn on Friday afternoon. Police commissioner Andrew Coster said a surveillance team and a specialist tactics group had followed the man from his home to the supermarket. But while there were concerns about the him, officials said they had no reason to think he was planning an attack on Friday, and the team believed he was going to do his grocery shopping. After entering the store, however, the attacker got hold of a knife and went on a stabbing spree. New Zealand's PM say incident at supermarket was a ""terrorist attack"" Shopper Michelle Miller told local news outlet Stuff that the man was ""running around like a lunatic"" and attacking people. ""All I heard was a lot of screaming,"" she said. ""[People were] running out, hysterically, just screaming, yelling, scared,"" another witness said, adding that he saw an elderly man lying on the ground with a stab wound. Witnesses also said the attacker had shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). Mr Coster said police rushed over upon hearing the commotion and shot and killed the attacker when he charged at the officers with the knife. Footage from the supermarket shared online showed people fleeing before the sound of gun shots could be heard. Analysis by Phil Mercer, BBC News This callous act in Auckland will stir painful memories of the deadly mosque attacks in Christchurch in 2019. In that attack, a lone gunman - a self-confessed white supremacist - murdered 51 worshippers.  Once again, New Zealand's geographic isolation and peaceful reputation have proved to be no defence against extremism. The assailant had, for years, been identified as a threat to national security and was under 24-hour surveillance. The police acted decisively to prevent further carnage, but they weren't close enough to stop serious injuries.  New terror laws could, however, allow volatile individuals to be detained in the future. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has sent a message of support: Kia Kaha New Zealand, he wrote, using Maori words. Stay strong. The man, whose identity cannot be revealed due to court suppression orders, arrived in New Zealand in October 2011. He became a person of national security interest in 2016. He had been under round-the-clock monitoring and heavy surveillance due to concerns about his ideology. He was known to multiple agencies, and was also on a terror watchlist. Local media reports said the attacker was 32 years old and had recently been sentenced to one year of supervision for possessing IS propaganda. Prosecutors had accused him of plotting a ""lone wolf"" terror attack using knives, but the judge ruled that planning a terror attack was not in itself an offence under existing laws, the reports said. His internet search history and bookmarks included heroes of Isis, Islamic State dress, and New Zealand prison clothes and food, according to Stuff. Ms Ardern said that until Friday, he had not committed any offence. When asked about the man's motivations, she said they were ""Isis-inspired"". Questions have been raised about why action against him was not taken before six people were injured - especially since he was under close surveillance. ""The reality is, that when you are surveilling someone on a 24/7 basis, it is not possible to be immediately next to them at all times. The staff intervened as quickly as they could and they prevented further injury in what was a terrifying situation,"" said Mr Coster. He added that the attacker was very surveillance-conscious, and that teams needed to maintain a distance to be effective. Authorities are confident the attacker was acting alone and that there is no further danger to the community, according to Mr Coster. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

""But it needs to stop and we need to get this out of football."" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged Fifa ""to take strong action against those responsible to ensure that this kind of disgraceful behaviour is eradicated from the game for good"". Football Daily podcast: Racist chants mar England win On Friday afternoon, football's world governing body Fifa said disciplinary proceedings had been opened ""following analysis of the match reports"". It added: ""Once again, Fifa would like to state that our position remains firm and resolute in rejecting any form of racism and violence as well as any other form of discrimination or abuse. ""We have a very clear zero tolerance stance against such abhorrent behaviours in football."" This video can not be played I donât think our players can do any more - Southgate Despite Uefa ordering Hungary to play three home games behind closed doors after their supporters' discriminatory behaviour, fans were allowed in on Thursday as the game came under Fifa's jurisdiction. The Uefa ban relates to racism and other discriminatory conduct which took place during Euro 2020 in June. While Uefa manage World Cup qualifiers involving European teams, Fifa is able to take action because it is their competition. ""Fifa strongly rejects any form of racism and violence and has a very clear zero tolerance stance for such behaviour in football,"" the game's global governing body said. Anti-discrimination bodies Kick It Out, Show Racism the Red Card and Fare criticised Fifa and Uefa for their handling of Hungary's existing ban. ""The question for us is why Fifa didn't act to prevent this, and why the global football system didn't work together to prevent this,"" Kick It Out chief executive Tony Burnett said. ""All I'm hearing again thus far is excuses about who should file what paperwork and who should file permission for X, Y and Z."" Fare executive director Piara Powar said allowing fans to attend in Budapest was an example of the ""system falling apart"" as Uefa and Fifa try to deal with racism. Allow Instagram content?

Powar also confirmed that the The Fare Network - an organisation trying to fight inequality in football - would provide authorities with a report of their own from the game, including video footage. Ged Grebby, chief executive of Show Racism the Red Card, told BBC Radio 5 Live that England managerGareth Southgate was right to say England should ""get its own house in order""before criticising others for their behaviour, following a numerous instances of racism in the game. Grebby also added that a ""long-term education programme"" should be put in place to help tackle racism in Hungarian football. The Professional Footballers' Association said ""loopholes"" that meant the game was not behind closed doors must be addressed. ""Global football governing bodies need to demonstrate that these behaviours will never be tolerated in our game,"" the players' union said. ""We demand they issue the strongest sanctions possible, such as lifetime stadium bans."" England players took the knee to many jeers in Budapest on Thursday England's players were booed as they took the knee before the match at the 67,000-capacity Puskas Arena to protest against racism, with BBC Radio 5 Live reporter Juliette Ferrington describing the reaction from fans as a ""wall of noise"". She also described how racist chants could be heard during the match and that Sterling and Bellingham were the targets of abuse. In the second half, Sterling was pelted with paper cups and bottles when he opened the scoring for England. A flare was later thrown on to the pitch after Harry Maguire put the visitors 3-0 ahead. The Hungarian Football Federation (MLSZ) said that those who disrupted the match ""need to be identified and severely punished"", but did not make any specific reference to discriminatory abuse. ""Fans entering the field, throwing light grenades and glasses, are being identified. The MLSZ has filed/will file a police report against them,"" the MLSZ said. ""Any fine will be passed on to the perpetrators in civil litigation, and they can expect a two-year disqualification from sporting events at the end of the trial."" England manager Gareth Southgate had ice thrown at him by fans during his post-match interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, in which he said he hoped the abuse was ""dealt with the right way"". ""I've heard reports of racism, which I hadn't heard during the game,"" he said. ""Everyone knows what we stand for as a team, and that's completely unacceptable. It has been reported. Our head of security has spoken to the players and taken their statement. We will deal with it in the right channels. ""The world is modernising and although some people are stuck in their ways of thinking and their prejudices, they're going to be the dinosaurs in the end because the world is changing."" Hungary's minister of foreign affairs, Peter Szijjarto, questioned English complaints about the boos in Budapest in a Facebook post that included a video of England supporters at Wembley jeering during the Italian national anthem before the Euro 2020 final. Nick Thorpe, BBC Central Europe Correspondent Hungarians have reacted with a mixture of anger, shame and defiance to allegations of racist abuse. 'Fantastic atmosphere, 2nd half meltdown' read the headline in the main sports paper, Nemzeti Sport. The right-wing Fidesz government has been in power for 11 years, and is proud of its open, nationalist stance. That has gone down well with fans, knows as the Ultras, in their uniform black T-shirts. Prime Minister Viktor Orban and some of his ministers end their speeches with the football slogan 'Go for it, Hungarians!' ""The Hungarian FA should complain to Fifaâ¦ that the England team is making political propaganda out of a sports event,"" read one comment on the pro-government Mandiner website. But there was also disgust at the behaviour, especially the pelting of Raheem Sterling.

"Social care must be adequately funded, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said, amid reports ministers plan to raise national insurance. Downing Street did not deny reports of an increase of at least 1% to improve social care and tackle the NHS backlog. The justice secretary said he would not ""speculate"" but said there should be a ""grown-up conversation"" about how to pay for rising social care costs. The move would break a Tory manifesto commitment at the last election. ""The British public are sensible enough to know that when it comes to the issue of social care we have to find some way in which it will be adequately funded,"" Mr Buckland told BBC Breakfast. He said that the Conservative Party had also promised at the 2019 election that it would bring forward sustainable proposals to fund social care. The Daily Telegraph reports thatDowning Street favours a 1% rise,externalin the national insurance rate, affecting about 25 million workers and self-employed people, as well as employers. But it says the Treasury is pushing for a 1.25% increase. And the Times adds thatHealth and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid wants a bigger rise of 2%,external. But a source close to Mr Javid said that 2% figure was incorrect and the BBC understands the health secretary is pushing for a lower figure. Ministers urged to act now on social care funding Labour: Why would we oppose a social care tax? For someone on average earnings of Â£29,536 a year, a 1% increase in national insurance would cost them Â£199.68 annually. The Telegraph says the funds will be used to put a cap on the amount an individual has to spend on social care costs over their lifetime. In their manifesto, the Conservatives said: ""The prerequisite of any solution will be a guarantee that no-one needing care has to sell their home to pay for it."" The government said it was ""committed to bringing forward a long-term plan to reform the social care system"". In a statement, it said proposals would be set out this year. Boris Johnson appears to be ready to break one promise in order to keep another. He is considering going against a manifesto commitment not to raise national insurance in order to deliver on his vow to fix social care. If the plan is put forward it will need a hard sell - to the public, most of whom will still pay large amounts towards care, and to Conservative MPs, for whom raising taxes is repellent. How best to look after the elderly, disabled and others needing care is one of society's most pressing questions. How to persuade the public to pay for it is the government's most pressing problem and a huge political challenge. Labour said the NHS and social care needed proper investment but it was wrong to raise national insurance., which would disproportionately hit low-earners, young people and businesses. ""Boris Johnson still hasn't come forward with the plan for social care he promised over two years ago, and instead they're proposing a manifesto-breaking tax rise that would hit working people and businesses hard,"" said shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson. It comes asformer health secretary Jeremy Hunt wrote in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat there should be a new ""health and care premium"" added to tax instead, as he warned against raising national insurance or income tax. Mr Hunt, who now chairs the Commons health committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government must ""bite the bullet"" and find some way to increase taxes. ""The sums are eye-watering, far bigger than a chancellor can find down the back of a Treasury sofa,"" he said. But he said a national insurance increase was the wrong approach because it would not be paid by pensioners. ""Since older people are the biggest beneficiaries I think it's only fair that they should make a contribution,"" Mr Hunt said. National insurance is paid on the profits of self-employed people and the earnings of employees when they exceed Â£9,568 a year. They then pay 12% of their income up to about Â£50,000 a year, when it drops to 2%. That has raised concerns that any rise to national insurance would affect low earners more than high earners. An ageing population means growing demand However, council spending in England is about 3% lower than in 2010 Age UK estimates 1.5 million people in England don't get the help they need The fees local authorities pay for care - in a person's own home or a care home - vary hugely People who don't qualify for free care are often charged more, with no maximum limit on costs There are huge staff shortages - Age UK estimates there are about 45,000 vacancies Nine challenges facing the social care system Boris Johnson has been under increasing pressure to set out his plan for social care reform. Speaking on the steps of Downing Street on his first day as prime minister in 2019, he pledged to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared"". But that plan has yet to be published. On top of long-term funding challenges, the social care sector has also faced extra costs because of the pandemic. Councils, which provide social care, have seen their budgets cut over the last decade. The squeeze on council funding in England means that people who pay for themselves are often propping up the care system. In England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than Â£23,250 can get help from their council. There is no overall limit on costs, meaning thousands every year end up selling their homes to pay. Personal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"The UK records another 42,076 coronavirus cases - the highest daily figure for six weeks - and 121 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test The JCVI, the UK government's vaccine advisers, decide not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for all children aged between 12 and 15 But about 200,000 more 12 to 15-year-olds with certain health problems will now be eligible for the vaccines Chief medical officers are now being asked by health secretaries to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating more children They will look at issues such as any effect on education and then advise the UK and devolved governments before a final decision is made One in 75 people in the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 August, the Office for National Statistics estimates The UK is sending four million doses of the Pfizer jab to Australia as part of a Covid vaccine swap deal The EU and AstraZeneca have ended a legal dispute about supply of coronavirus vaccines Edited by James Clarke That's all from us today - your updates have come from Francesca Gillett, Alex Therrien, Doug Faulkner, Vanessa Barford and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news soon. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main stories of the day: Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) member Prof Adam Finn says the decision not to recommend rolling out the vaccine to healthy children under 15 was based on a ""risk-benefit balance"". The professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol says: ""Although the vaccine works and would be beneficial in the sense of preventing infection and some severe disease from Covid, there are significant uncertainties around the safety of the vaccine that have not yet been clarified such that we can't be sure that the risk-benefit balance is sufficiently good in favour and to the benefit of those children to recommend it."" He says the large majority of severe cases in children - and the very small number of deaths in the age group - occurred in children who were ""identifiably at high risk because of other medical conditions"", which is why the vaccine is being rolled out to more of these children. While the JCVI is not recommending jabs for healthy 12 to 15 year olds, 200,000 more in that age group who are vulnerable will be offered a vaccine. This includes those who have chronic heart, lung and liver conditions. Children aged 12 and over who have severe neurodisability, Down's syndrome, a severely weakened immune system or profound and multiple learning difficulties are also recommended two doses of vaccine. Currently under-18s are being given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although the Moderna vaccine hasalso been authorised for use in children in the UK,external. You can fine out morehere. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, says if we are going to vaccinate children it has to be in their interests and ""not in society's interests"". He says it is not an easy decision but says he supports the decision of the JCVI, which he says has given the matter a ""substantial amount of thought"". Prof Hunter says the JCVI has taken different decisions to other countries in the past and points to the 12-week delay it originally recommended between first and second jabs, which he says saved ""many thousands of lives"". He says in the first wave of the pandemic schools played an important part in transmission but as the pandemic has gone on schools being open has had ""a decreasingly important roll in the rollout of the pandemic"". ""Yes, schools almost certainly will be associated with some increase in transmission but it is doubtful that will be a huge impact on the epidemic,"" he says. Additional safety measures in schools will become ""more important"" if all 12 to 15-year-olds are not vaccinated, a teaching union says. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, says: ""If the decision not to vaccinate is upheld by the chief medical officers, this makes additional safety mitigations in schools all the more important. ""Sadly, in taking away so many safety measures last term, without replacing them with others, the government has left schools open to another rise in case counts - which will mean many children and staff missing school if they test positive."" Christina Pagel said the JCVI's decision was  ""out of step"" with most other high-income countries The decision by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation not to recommend Covid vaccines for all 12 to 15-year-olds is ""out of step"" with the stance taken by most other high-income countries, a scientist says. Christina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London, says the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have all recommended vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds. Pagel, a member of the Independent Sage group set up to scrutinise decisions made by the government on coronavirus, says a recent ONS report estimated one in 1,000 children have had long Covid for more than a year. She also pointed toa study,externalthat found the risk of myocarditis - an inflammation of the heart - was greater in people who were infected with Covid versus those who had been vaccinated. ""It doesn't really make any sense to me that we're not trying to protect children from Covid."" The US has vaccinated more than 10 million 12-15-year-olds and France, Italy, Canada and Israel are among other countries vaccinating children. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says he is ""disappointed"" by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) decision not to recommend jabs for healthy 12 to 15-year-olds. He says his union is pleased more children with health vulnerabilities will receive vaccines and that he understands the decision is based on an assessment of the ""balance of risks"". But he says: ""Nevertheless, the upshot is that this would make it more difficult during the autumn term and beyond to guard against educational disruption caused by transmission of the virus."" BBC MonitoringBy Shayan Sardarizadeh A group of anti-vaccine protesters have clashed with police officers during an attempt to break into the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) office in Canary Wharf. The Metropolitan Police says four of its officers have been injured. The group, which calls itself Official Voice, has staged similar protests outside the former BBC Television Centre, ITN Productions, Google and Facebook buildings. Organising its rallies on the Telegram messaging app, the group claims to be against vaccinating children and so-called vaccine passports. The groupâs online presence is also full of debunked conspiracy theories about Covid vaccines, including false claims that mRNA vaccines are a form of âgene therapyâ or that the vaccine is a âdepopulation toolâ for a shadowy global elite. Anti-vaccine protests across the UK have become more frequent and increasingly more aggressive in recent weeks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The latest UK government coronavirus figures are in and there have been a further 42,076 new cases reported. The last time more new daily cases were reported was on 22 July. A further 121 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been reported. Meanwhile, 43,142,747 people have received both doses of a coronavirus vaccine and 5,029251  have received just one dose, as of 2 September. The UK's four chief medical officers are to provide further advice on the vaccination of children aged 12 to 15 with Covid-19 vaccines following the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They are being asked to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating children, such as any impact on education. The JCVI advised the health benefits from vaccination are marginally greater than the potential known harms, but stopped short of recommending vaccinations for all 12 to 15-year-olds. The UK's Health Secretary Sajid Javid says he and the other UK health secretaries have written to the chief medical officers to ask that they consider the vaccination of 12 to 15-year-olds ""from a broader perspective, as suggested by the JCVI"". âWe will then consider the advice from the chief medical officers, building on the advice from the JCVI, before making a decision shortly.â Javid has asked the NHS to put preparations in place to roll out vaccinations to 12 to 15-year-olds, should it be recommended by the chief medical officers. Catherine BurnsHealth correspondent The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has decided to invite another 200,000 12 to 15-year-olds with underlying health problems for Covid vaccines - but has stopped short of extending it to all teenagers. Instead, health minister from all four UK nations will ask their chief medical officers to decide. They will also consider aspects such as the impact on education. This means that about 350,000 12 to 15-year-olds with certain health problems are now eligible for the vaccines. There are more than three million 12 to 15-year-olds in the UK. The vaccine experts did decide the benefits to children do marginally outweigh the risks â but that wasnât enough for them to recommend universal vaccination for this age group. They weighed up the very rare risk of young people developing myocarditis â an inflammation of the heart. In the US, for every million Pfizer second doses given to 12 to 17-year-old boys, around 60 had the condition. It was eight in a million for girls. The Netherlands is among the nations already rolling out Covid jabs to 12 to 15-year-olds The government's vaccine advisers have decided not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children aged between 12 and 15. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has announced it is widening the so-far limited rollout to more children in this age bracket who have underlying health conditions. But it is not recommending mass vaccination of children aged between 12 and 15. The programme is being extended from what had been considered the most at-risk children, to include children with chronic major heart, lung, kidney, liver and neurological conditions. It means about 200,000 more children will be invited for vaccines. The decision comes exactly a week after the Department of Health and Social Care confirmed preparations were under way to ensure the NHS was ready to offer coronavirus jabs to all 12 to 15-year-olds in England from early September. The department said it wanted to be ""ready to hit the ground running"". The Borders General Hospital is said to be experiencing considerable ongoing pressure A health board in Scotland has extended its suspension of all routine operations for a further three weeks in the face of rising Covid patient numbers. NHS Borders first announced it was stopping such surgery on 11 August. It has now confirmed that, due to ""significant pressure"" at the Borders General Hospital, it will not resume before 26 September. The health board says the decision has not been easy and all patients affected will be contacted directly. Read more. If you're fully vaccinated, you can currently enjoy perks like not having to self-isolate after coming into contact with someone with Covid, and being able to travel abroad without certain restrictions. But from the end of September, the plan is to make proof of your Covid status - for example that you're fully vaccinated or have tested negative - a requirement to get into nightclubs and some other crowded venues in England and Scotland. Today,Scotlandhas just made it easier to proveyour vaccine status by allowing people to download or receive a paper QR code that can be scanned. InEngland, you can download your Covid pass via the NHS app (not the NHS Covid app) if you are registered with a GP, or get it online or by calling 119. InWalesyou can also download the NHS Covid pass, and people inNorthern Irelandcan apply for the certificate online and use it for travel. More details on what to do here. Levels of crime were ""remarkably low"" in Jersey asclubs reopened for the first time, police say. Some of Jersey'slast Covid restrictions were lifted on 26 August, allowing dancing and large gatherings to return. Among those hitting the clubs was Clodagh O'Brien who turned 18 on the day restrictions were lifted in Jersey. ""I've always wanted to go, so I was pretty excited,"" she says. While Jason McDonald, who runs security company JMD Secure, says the bank holiday weekend was ""off-the-walls busy"" but adds ""we had no trouble which was really unbelievable"". We've been hearing today about Scotland now allowing people to download their vaccine certificate as a QR code - like what happens in England. But it's now emerged that a security flaw which allows people to edit their vaccination status certificates has not been fixed - three months after it was first identified. The BBCreported in May how vaccination status details could be alteredusing popular computer software programmes. A fix was rolled out which meant people could only request the document be sent to them by post. But the certificates are available to download again and still editable. BBC Scotland was able to download a certificate and edit it to include a false name, date of birth and the address of the BBC's Glasgow headquarters. Read more here. There are signs that the Delta variant in the US is harming the recovery of the economy. New government data released on Friday showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected in August - with employment rising by 235,000. The figure was well down on the 1.05 million jobs created in July, adding to fears that the recovery from the pandemic may be running out of steam. Despite the disappointing hiring levels, the unemployment rate declined to 5.2% in August from 5.4% the previous month. The dollar fell on foreign exchange markets after the announcement. We've got more here. Earlier we reported on a call from scientists to vaccinate all children over 12. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is still pondering its judgement on whether jabs should be given to healthy children in this age group but there is general agreement that this is a really tricky call to make. The JCVI is focusing squarely on the benefits of vaccination to children themselves - not on how it helps other people. Children's risk from Covid isn't zero but the chances of them becoming seriously ill from Covid are incredibly small. That means there needs to be a clear and obvious advantage to giving them a jab. However,a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccineshas made that calculation a lot more complicated. Here Philippa Roxby takes a look atthe factors the JCVI will have to consider. The England Under-21s football team were due to play Romania in a friendly today but the match has beencancelled after two positive Covid-19 tests in the English camp. The Young Lions did not travel to Bucharest, with the Football Association saying positive tests were reported ""within the party of players and support staff"".

"The UK records another 42,076 coronavirus cases - the highest daily figure for six weeks - and 121 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test The JCVI, the UK government's vaccine advisers, decide not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for all children aged between 12 and 15 But about 200,000 more 12 to 15-year-olds with certain health problems will now be eligible for the vaccines Chief medical officers are now being asked by health secretaries to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating more children They will look at issues such as any effect on education and then advise the UK and devolved governments before a final decision is made One in 75 people in the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 August, the Office for National Statistics estimates The UK is sending four million doses of the Pfizer jab to Australia as part of a Covid vaccine swap deal The EU and AstraZeneca have ended a legal dispute about supply of coronavirus vaccines Edited by James Clarke That's all from us today - your updates have come from Francesca Gillett, Alex Therrien, Doug Faulkner, Vanessa Barford and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news soon. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main stories of the day: Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) member Prof Adam Finn says the decision not to recommend rolling out the vaccine to healthy children under 15 was based on a ""risk-benefit balance"". The professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol says: ""Although the vaccine works and would be beneficial in the sense of preventing infection and some severe disease from Covid, there are significant uncertainties around the safety of the vaccine that have not yet been clarified such that we can't be sure that the risk-benefit balance is sufficiently good in favour and to the benefit of those children to recommend it."" He says the large majority of severe cases in children - and the very small number of deaths in the age group - occurred in children who were ""identifiably at high risk because of other medical conditions"", which is why the vaccine is being rolled out to more of these children. While the JCVI is not recommending jabs for healthy 12 to 15 year olds, 200,000 more in that age group who are vulnerable will be offered a vaccine. This includes those who have chronic heart, lung and liver conditions. Children aged 12 and over who have severe neurodisability, Down's syndrome, a severely weakened immune system or profound and multiple learning difficulties are also recommended two doses of vaccine. Currently under-18s are being given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although the Moderna vaccine hasalso been authorised for use in children in the UK,external. You can fine out morehere. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, says if we are going to vaccinate children it has to be in their interests and ""not in society's interests"". He says it is not an easy decision but says he supports the decision of the JCVI, which he says has given the matter a ""substantial amount of thought"". Prof Hunter says the JCVI has taken different decisions to other countries in the past and points to the 12-week delay it originally recommended between first and second jabs, which he says saved ""many thousands of lives"". He says in the first wave of the pandemic schools played an important part in transmission but as the pandemic has gone on schools being open has had ""a decreasingly important roll in the rollout of the pandemic"". ""Yes, schools almost certainly will be associated with some increase in transmission but it is doubtful that will be a huge impact on the epidemic,"" he says. Additional safety measures in schools will become ""more important"" if all 12 to 15-year-olds are not vaccinated, a teaching union says. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, says: ""If the decision not to vaccinate is upheld by the chief medical officers, this makes additional safety mitigations in schools all the more important. ""Sadly, in taking away so many safety measures last term, without replacing them with others, the government has left schools open to another rise in case counts - which will mean many children and staff missing school if they test positive."" Christina Pagel said the JCVI's decision was  ""out of step"" with most other high-income countries The decision by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation not to recommend Covid vaccines for all 12 to 15-year-olds is ""out of step"" with the stance taken by most other high-income countries, a scientist says. Christina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London, says the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have all recommended vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds. Pagel, a member of the Independent Sage group set up to scrutinise decisions made by the government on coronavirus, says a recent ONS report estimated one in 1,000 children have had long Covid for more than a year. She also pointed toa study,externalthat found the risk of myocarditis - an inflammation of the heart - was greater in people who were infected with Covid versus those who had been vaccinated. ""It doesn't really make any sense to me that we're not trying to protect children from Covid."" The US has vaccinated more than 10 million 12-15-year-olds and France, Italy, Canada and Israel are among other countries vaccinating children. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says he is ""disappointed"" by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) decision not to recommend jabs for healthy 12 to 15-year-olds. He says his union is pleased more children with health vulnerabilities will receive vaccines and that he understands the decision is based on an assessment of the ""balance of risks"". But he says: ""Nevertheless, the upshot is that this would make it more difficult during the autumn term and beyond to guard against educational disruption caused by transmission of the virus."" BBC MonitoringBy Shayan Sardarizadeh A group of anti-vaccine protesters have clashed with police officers during an attempt to break into the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) office in Canary Wharf. The Metropolitan Police says four of its officers have been injured. The group, which calls itself Official Voice, has staged similar protests outside the former BBC Television Centre, ITN Productions, Google and Facebook buildings. Organising its rallies on the Telegram messaging app, the group claims to be against vaccinating children and so-called vaccine passports. The groupâs online presence is also full of debunked conspiracy theories about Covid vaccines, including false claims that mRNA vaccines are a form of âgene therapyâ or that the vaccine is a âdepopulation toolâ for a shadowy global elite. Anti-vaccine protests across the UK have become more frequent and increasingly more aggressive in recent weeks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The latest UK government coronavirus figures are in and there have been a further 42,076 new cases reported. The last time more new daily cases were reported was on 22 July. A further 121 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been reported. Meanwhile, 43,142,747 people have received both doses of a coronavirus vaccine and 5,029251  have received just one dose, as of 2 September. The UK's four chief medical officers are to provide further advice on the vaccination of children aged 12 to 15 with Covid-19 vaccines following the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They are being asked to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating children, such as any impact on education. The JCVI advised the health benefits from vaccination are marginally greater than the potential known harms, but stopped short of recommending vaccinations for all 12 to 15-year-olds. The UK's Health Secretary Sajid Javid says he and the other UK health secretaries have written to the chief medical officers to ask that they consider the vaccination of 12 to 15-year-olds ""from a broader perspective, as suggested by the JCVI"". âWe will then consider the advice from the chief medical officers, building on the advice from the JCVI, before making a decision shortly.â Javid has asked the NHS to put preparations in place to roll out vaccinations to 12 to 15-year-olds, should it be recommended by the chief medical officers. Catherine BurnsHealth correspondent The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has decided to invite another 200,000 12 to 15-year-olds with underlying health problems for Covid vaccines - but has stopped short of extending it to all teenagers. Instead, health minister from all four UK nations will ask their chief medical officers to decide. They will also consider aspects such as the impact on education. This means that about 350,000 12 to 15-year-olds with certain health problems are now eligible for the vaccines. There are more than three million 12 to 15-year-olds in the UK. The vaccine experts did decide the benefits to children do marginally outweigh the risks â but that wasnât enough for them to recommend universal vaccination for this age group. They weighed up the very rare risk of young people developing myocarditis â an inflammation of the heart. In the US, for every million Pfizer second doses given to 12 to 17-year-old boys, around 60 had the condition. It was eight in a million for girls. The Netherlands is among the nations already rolling out Covid jabs to 12 to 15-year-olds The government's vaccine advisers have decided not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children aged between 12 and 15. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has announced it is widening the so-far limited rollout to more children in this age bracket who have underlying health conditions. But it is not recommending mass vaccination of children aged between 12 and 15. The programme is being extended from what had been considered the most at-risk children, to include children with chronic major heart, lung, kidney, liver and neurological conditions. It means about 200,000 more children will be invited for vaccines. The decision comes exactly a week after the Department of Health and Social Care confirmed preparations were under way to ensure the NHS was ready to offer coronavirus jabs to all 12 to 15-year-olds in England from early September. The department said it wanted to be ""ready to hit the ground running"". The Borders General Hospital is said to be experiencing considerable ongoing pressure A health board in Scotland has extended its suspension of all routine operations for a further three weeks in the face of rising Covid patient numbers. NHS Borders first announced it was stopping such surgery on 11 August. It has now confirmed that, due to ""significant pressure"" at the Borders General Hospital, it will not resume before 26 September. The health board says the decision has not been easy and all patients affected will be contacted directly. Read more. If you're fully vaccinated, you can currently enjoy perks like not having to self-isolate after coming into contact with someone with Covid, and being able to travel abroad without certain restrictions. But from the end of September, the plan is to make proof of your Covid status - for example that you're fully vaccinated or have tested negative - a requirement to get into nightclubs and some other crowded venues in England and Scotland. Today,Scotlandhas just made it easier to proveyour vaccine status by allowing people to download or receive a paper QR code that can be scanned. InEngland, you can download your Covid pass via the NHS app (not the NHS Covid app) if you are registered with a GP, or get it online or by calling 119. InWalesyou can also download the NHS Covid pass, and people inNorthern Irelandcan apply for the certificate online and use it for travel. More details on what to do here. Levels of crime were ""remarkably low"" in Jersey asclubs reopened for the first time, police say. Some of Jersey'slast Covid restrictions were lifted on 26 August, allowing dancing and large gatherings to return. Among those hitting the clubs was Clodagh O'Brien who turned 18 on the day restrictions were lifted in Jersey. ""I've always wanted to go, so I was pretty excited,"" she says. While Jason McDonald, who runs security company JMD Secure, says the bank holiday weekend was ""off-the-walls busy"" but adds ""we had no trouble which was really unbelievable"". We've been hearing today about Scotland now allowing people to download their vaccine certificate as a QR code - like what happens in England. But it's now emerged that a security flaw which allows people to edit their vaccination status certificates has not been fixed - three months after it was first identified. The BBCreported in May how vaccination status details could be alteredusing popular computer software programmes. A fix was rolled out which meant people could only request the document be sent to them by post. But the certificates are available to download again and still editable. BBC Scotland was able to download a certificate and edit it to include a false name, date of birth and the address of the BBC's Glasgow headquarters. Read more here. There are signs that the Delta variant in the US is harming the recovery of the economy. New government data released on Friday showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected in August - with employment rising by 235,000. The figure was well down on the 1.05 million jobs created in July, adding to fears that the recovery from the pandemic may be running out of steam. Despite the disappointing hiring levels, the unemployment rate declined to 5.2% in August from 5.4% the previous month. The dollar fell on foreign exchange markets after the announcement. We've got more here. Earlier we reported on a call from scientists to vaccinate all children over 12. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is still pondering its judgement on whether jabs should be given to healthy children in this age group but there is general agreement that this is a really tricky call to make. The JCVI is focusing squarely on the benefits of vaccination to children themselves - not on how it helps other people. Children's risk from Covid isn't zero but the chances of them becoming seriously ill from Covid are incredibly small. That means there needs to be a clear and obvious advantage to giving them a jab. However,a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccineshas made that calculation a lot more complicated. Here Philippa Roxby takes a look atthe factors the JCVI will have to consider.

"The national shortage of lorry drivers could lead to a rise in food prices, wholesalers have warned. Darren Labbett, managing director of Woods Foodservice, told the BBC that his industry was facing a ""perfect storm"" of adverse effects. ""We've got the Brexit situation and the after-effects of the pandemic coming together at the same time,"" he added. Mr Labbett said the cost of vegetable oil was at a 30-year high because of higher shipping costs and demand. ""As we came out of lockdown, the demand for everything went through the roof overnight,"" he said. Mr Labbett added that wholesalers were ""trying our utmost"" to absorb the extra costs instead of passing them on, ""but we can't absorb those price increases forever"". James Bielby, chief executive of the Federation of Wholesale Distributors, which represents about 600 firms in the wholesale sector, said there were ""chronic"" staff shortages throughout the food and drink supply chain, with up to half a million vacancies. ""That means all businesses - growers, processers, wholesalers and manufacturers - having to offer incentives to retain and recruit staff, and costs are rising as a result,"" he told the BBC. ""Under these circumstances, it is inevitable that some of these cost increases will be passed through the supply chain, which will lead to food price inflation."" Food production in the UK at risk, warns industry Driver shortage: 'I got a big pay rise overnight' How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Many businesses have been complaining about the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, which continues to cause serious supply chain problems. The coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes have all contributed to a lack of qualified drivers. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortfall of about 100,000 workers. On Thursday, Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability from the British Retail Consortium told the UK Trade and Business Commission food manufacturing was under severe strain because of shortages of HGV drivers and other supply chain staff, meaning that some production might have to move out of the UK. The British Frozen Food Federation's chief executive, Richard Harrow, told the commission he was concerned that smaller food businesses like wholesalers and catering firms were missing out because haulage companies were having to prioritise bigger customers like supermarkets. ""Many wholesalers have seen their businesses close down during the pandemic with the restaurant industry closed, and so they had a very difficult period,"" he said. ""Now they're coming out of that and seeing strong demand, but they're struggling to get drivers and struggling to get deliveries. ""If you're a haulage company and you're restricted because of drivers, you're going to go where the work is easiest. If you're then being asked to drop a number of different pallets in different locations to smaller wholesalers, it ticks the 'too difficult to do' box', so I think they will be disproportionately impacted,"" Mr Harrow added. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortfall of about 100,000 truck drivers However, wholesalers point to a number of other factors that are also threatening to push up prices. David Josephs, owner of All Greens Wholesale, a fruit and vegetable importer and wholesaler in London, said Brexit had been the biggest cause of additional costs for his business. ""We have an operation out of Milan, we ship twice a week, and just those two shipments a week coming out of Milan, the paperwork, purely the paperwork, is costing us an additional â¬52,000 (Â£44,650) a year,"" he told the BBC. ""But with Covid now as well, growers around Europe have been affected with labour shortages and therefore, goods haven't been picked out of the ground and therefore there is a shortage.""

"This video can not be played The record rainfall caused flash flooding in New York City US President Joe Biden says ""historic investment"" is needed to deal with the climate crisis, as the north-east reels from flash flooding and tornadoes that have killed at least 45 people. The US is facing climate-related destruction across the country and tackling it is ""a matter of life and death"", the president said. New York City and New Jersey saw unprecedented levels of rainfall. Some residents became trapped in flooded basements and cars. Six states suffered loss of life: New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said at least 23 people had died in his state - most of them stuck in their vehicles as the waters rose At least 14 people lost their lives in New York City, including a two-year-old boy. Eleven of them drowned while trapped in their flooded basements, officials said Five people died in Pennsylvania, while a state trooper in Connecticut was swept away as he responded to a call Deaths were also reported in Maryland and Virginia President Biden has declared an emergency in both New Jersey and New York, enabling both states to receive federal funding to support local disaster relief efforts. The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but we know that increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall. Residents of Elizabeth, New Jersey, are recovering from the storm The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Four ways climate change links to extreme weather A really simple guide to climate change New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio criticised weather experts, saying their forecasts were being ""made a mockery of in a matter of minutes"". He said he had been warned to expect between three and six inches (7.5 and 15cm) of rain over the course of the day. However a record 3.15 inches fell in Central Park in just one hour. ""The suddenness, the brutality of storms now, it is different,"" he said, adding that the latest extreme weather was ""the biggest wake-up call"". New York Governor Kathy Hochul said: ""We did not know that between 8:50 and 9:50 p.m. last night, that the heavens would literally open up and bring Niagara Falls level of water to the streets of New York."" New Jersey's largest dairy farm suffered extensive damage Residents have been assessing the damage to property. One man in Flushing, New York, said his house was prone to flooding ""but what I saw last night is unimaginable"". ""I have never seen water coming in all directions,"" Tedla Asfaw, 60, told the BBC. ""There's huge damage here. It's a big hit for us."" In New Jersey, a tornado flattened the state's largest dairy farm, ripping roofs off buildings and toppling several large silos. Many cows were trapped under fallen sheds and some died, the owners of Wellacrest Farm wrote on their Facebook page. ""Along with the devastating loss of homes in our neighbourhoods - we, as a community, suffered a great loss with the destruction of our farm."" In New York, some 835 people had to be rescued from stranded subway trains, police said on Thursday, after social media pictures showed water gushing into underground stations and tunnels. Other footage showed cars floating down flooded roads, with cries of ""help"" being heard from inside. Nearly 500 vehicles were abandoned in New York, the Associated Press says. Passengers on trains, planes and buses have been describing finding themselves stuck for hours without moving as the flooding made travelling impossible. Allow Twitter content?

President Biden said the unprecedented flooding in the region, along with the destruction brought by Hurricane Ida to Louisiana and Mississippi and wildfires in the West, were ""yet another reminder that these extreme storms in the climate crisis are here"". He said he would be pushing Congress for action on his Build Back Better plan, which would see ""historic investment"" in infrastructure, including modernising roads and bridges and improving energy grids, water and sewage systems. ""This destruction is everywhere,"" he said. ""It's a matter of life and death and we are all in this together. This is one of the great challenges of our time but I'm confident we will meet it. The president will visit Louisiana on Friday to assess what is being done to help the state, which became the first to face Hurricane Ida when it made landfall on Sunday. More than 900,000 homes remain without power in the state. Have you been affected by Storm Ida? If it is safe to do so, please get in touch with your experiences.

"The Treasury must ""urgently"" confirm extra funding before councils can start making offers to house Afghan refugees, a document seen by the BBC suggests. It estimates the cost of helping those coming to the UK over the next 10 years could be more than Â£2.5bn. And it suggests a shortfall in the cash committed by Whitehall so far. A government spokesperson said hundreds of Afghan nationals who had worked alongside the British in Afghanistan had already been welcomed to the UK. But Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said it was ""deeply worrying"" that the government was ""failing to step up and play its role in providing national coordination, leadership and support"". The Treasury has been asked to comment on the contents of the leaked document. Council leader shocked at 1,350 empty army homes Where will resettled Afghans live in the UK? How many Afghan asylum seekers has the UK taken in? Thousands of people have fled Afghanistansince the country fell to the Taliban in August, as US and UK troops withdrew their forces after 20 years on the ground. Around 15,000 people eligible to come to the UK were evacuated in the final two weeks, including 8,000 Afghans who had worked alongside British forces. But the government has admittedit cannot be precise with how many others were left behind. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is in the regionto try to negotiate safe passage through neighbouring countries for Britons and others still trying to leave Afghanistan. Speaking at a press conference in Pakistan, he pledged Â£30m in aid to bordering countries taking in the majority of the refugees, to help provide shelter and sanitation. And he promised the UK would be ""shouldering our humanitarian responsibilities"" to help. The government is talking to councils about how many people could be resettled in their areas when they reach the UK, calling for a fair distribution across the country. This call was echoed in a joint statement by council leaders in Greater Manchester, including its mayor, Labour's Andy Burnham, who said ""every part of the country needs to take a share of the responsibility across all schemes, asylum and resettlement"" - rather than areas with lower house prices accommodating ""far higher numbers of those seeking sanctuary"". The leaked document - Afghan Resettlement: Domestic Support Offer and Funding Requirements - was discussed by ministers on Wednesday. It said just under Â£400m has been allocated so far to help resettle those who had fled the country, but an extra Â£557m could be needed over the next three years. Left behind in Afghanistan: If I canât get out, Iâll die Afghans who worked for UK can stay permanently The government intends to provide funding to local authorities to accommodate Afghans, and the document says relocation costs were a ""substantial - but necessary - offer of support"". Ministers met to discuss resettling plans on Friday before holding a meeting with local authority leaders, telling them to see ""no offer of housing and support as too small"". But the BBC understands the councils were not given confirmation of how much funding they would receive. This video can not be played Getting the plane out of Afghanistan was the ""happiest moment of my life"" Among the councils offering support, Walsall Council in the West Midlands has taken in 69 evacuees so far and says it hopes to house up to 120. Mike Bird, the council leader, said it was a difficult task, housing families with children who needed school places. ""With children going back to school, and the pressure on school places, that in itself is something the government don't seem to be taking into account,"" he said. ""We've got the whole of the UK that should be considered. If only one [some] councils are coming forward... then the government have got to step in and make sure it does happen."" One refugee, Ahmed, whose real name is not being used, arrived in the UK from Kabul with his wife and six children in July. He told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme this week about the challenges his family faced. ""We have been living in hotels for quite a while now in larger groups and it's becoming tougher and tougher, so it's time for us to move to a proper house,"" he said. ""That is the overarching concern we are having, because we can't have a bank account."" Schemes for people fleeing the country include the existing Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) for Afghans who worked with the UK government and a new Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) for vulnerable people. Funding models for the resettlement schemes are still being developed, but initial proposals suggested the figures would be based on 5,000 Afghans arriving under the ACRS scheme per year (capped at 20,000 people) at a cost of Â£715m, 5,000 arriving under the UK Resettlement Scheme each year at a cost of Â£1.65bn, and 7,000 arriving under the ARAP scheme in 2021-2 at a cost of Â£190m. The document also suggested that while some refugees would require more support than others, local authorities should be given a set amount per person housed to make their funding easier to plan. It recommended local authorities should be given Â£20,520 per person split over three years, plus more for education costs. It also recommended extra healthcare funding of Â£3,200 per person and Â£15m funding per year to ""international partners"" to support resettlement in third countries. These initial funding proposals suggest the costs would reach Â£187m in 2021/2 and Â£975m over the course of this spending review period - which lasts until 2024/5. But the document said that with just under Â£400m of this funding already committed, there would be a shortfall of approximately Â£557m, so confirmation of further funding from the Treasury will be required ""urgently"". Labour's Mr Thomas-Symonds accused ministers of being ""disastrously complacent"" throughout the crisis in Afghanistan. He said: ""Councils across the country want to do the right thing, so it's deeply worrying that the UK government is failing to step up and play its role in providing national coordination, leadership and support."" The shadow home secretary called on the prime minister to urgently set out details on how promised funding would be spent to ""allow Afghan people who have been through hellish experiences rebuild their lives here"". Border Force staff were assisting Afghan refugees on their arrival from Afghanistan A spokesperson from the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said that the government was calling on all councils who had not yet offered, to come forward with offers of support. ""Thanks to the efforts of nearly a third of Britain's councils and vital delivery partners, hundreds of Afghan nationals who have worked alongside our Armed Forces and diplomats in Afghanistan, risking their lives supporting us, have already been warmly welcomed to the country,"" they said. ""Councils in England, Scotland and Wales will have access to a share of an additional Â£5m to help them provide the necessary housing and support to Afghans who have worked for this country in Afghanistan, but who now face threats of persecution or worse.""

"The UK records another 42,076 coronavirus cases - the highest daily figure for six weeks - and 121 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test The JCVI, the UK government's vaccine advisers, decide not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for all children aged between 12 and 15 But about 200,000 more 12 to 15-year-olds with certain health problems will now be eligible for the vaccines Chief medical officers are now being asked by health secretaries to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating more children They will look at issues such as any effect on education and then advise the UK and devolved governments before a final decision is made One in 75 people in the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 August, the Office for National Statistics estimates The UK is sending four million doses of the Pfizer jab to Australia as part of a Covid vaccine swap deal The EU and AstraZeneca have ended a legal dispute about supply of coronavirus vaccines Edited by James Clarke That's all from us today - your updates have come from Francesca Gillett, Alex Therrien, Doug Faulkner, Vanessa Barford and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news soon. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main stories of the day: Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) member Prof Adam Finn says the decision not to recommend rolling out the vaccine to healthy children under 15 was based on a ""risk-benefit balance"". The professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol says: ""Although the vaccine works and would be beneficial in the sense of preventing infection and some severe disease from Covid, there are significant uncertainties around the safety of the vaccine that have not yet been clarified such that we can't be sure that the risk-benefit balance is sufficiently good in favour and to the benefit of those children to recommend it."" He says the large majority of severe cases in children - and the very small number of deaths in the age group - occurred in children who were ""identifiably at high risk because of other medical conditions"", which is why the vaccine is being rolled out to more of these children. While the JCVI is not recommending jabs for healthy 12 to 15 year olds, 200,000 more in that age group who are vulnerable will be offered a vaccine. This includes those who have chronic heart, lung and liver conditions. Children aged 12 and over who have severe neurodisability, Down's syndrome, a severely weakened immune system or profound and multiple learning difficulties are also recommended two doses of vaccine. Currently under-18s are being given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although the Moderna vaccine hasalso been authorised for use in children in the UK,external. You can fine out morehere. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, says if we are going to vaccinate children it has to be in their interests and ""not in society's interests"". He says it is not an easy decision but says he supports the decision of the JCVI, which he says has given the matter a ""substantial amount of thought"". Prof Hunter says the JCVI has taken different decisions to other countries in the past and points to the 12-week delay it originally recommended between first and second jabs, which he says saved ""many thousands of lives"". He says in the first wave of the pandemic schools played an important part in transmission but as the pandemic has gone on schools being open has had ""a decreasingly important roll in the rollout of the pandemic"". ""Yes, schools almost certainly will be associated with some increase in transmission but it is doubtful that will be a huge impact on the epidemic,"" he says. Additional safety measures in schools will become ""more important"" if all 12 to 15-year-olds are not vaccinated, a teaching union says. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, says: ""If the decision not to vaccinate is upheld by the chief medical officers, this makes additional safety mitigations in schools all the more important. ""Sadly, in taking away so many safety measures last term, without replacing them with others, the government has left schools open to another rise in case counts - which will mean many children and staff missing school if they test positive."" Christina Pagel said the JCVI's decision was  ""out of step"" with most other high-income countries The decision by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation not to recommend Covid vaccines for all 12 to 15-year-olds is ""out of step"" with the stance taken by most other high-income countries, a scientist says. Christina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London, says the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have all recommended vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds. Pagel, a member of the Independent Sage group set up to scrutinise decisions made by the government on coronavirus, says a recent ONS report estimated one in 1,000 children have had long Covid for more than a year. She also pointed toa study,externalthat found the risk of myocarditis - an inflammation of the heart - was greater in people who were infected with Covid versus those who had been vaccinated. ""It doesn't really make any sense to me that we're not trying to protect children from Covid."" The US has vaccinated more than 10 million 12-15-year-olds and France, Italy, Canada and Israel are among other countries vaccinating children. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says he is ""disappointed"" by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) decision not to recommend jabs for healthy 12 to 15-year-olds. He says his union is pleased more children with health vulnerabilities will receive vaccines and that he understands the decision is based on an assessment of the ""balance of risks"". But he says: ""Nevertheless, the upshot is that this would make it more difficult during the autumn term and beyond to guard against educational disruption caused by transmission of the virus."" BBC MonitoringBy Shayan Sardarizadeh A group of anti-vaccine protesters have clashed with police officers during an attempt to break into the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) office in Canary Wharf. The Metropolitan Police says four of its officers have been injured. The group, which calls itself Official Voice, has staged similar protests outside the former BBC Television Centre, ITN Productions, Google and Facebook buildings. Organising its rallies on the Telegram messaging app, the group claims to be against vaccinating children and so-called vaccine passports. The groupâs online presence is also full of debunked conspiracy theories about Covid vaccines, including false claims that mRNA vaccines are a form of âgene therapyâ or that the vaccine is a âdepopulation toolâ for a shadowy global elite. Anti-vaccine protests across the UK have become more frequent and increasingly more aggressive in recent weeks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The latest UK government coronavirus figures are in and there have been a further 42,076 new cases reported. The last time more new daily cases were reported was on 22 July. A further 121 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been reported. Meanwhile, 43,142,747 people have received both doses of a coronavirus vaccine and 5,029251  have received just one dose, as of 2 September. The UK's four chief medical officers are to provide further advice on the vaccination of children aged 12 to 15 with Covid-19 vaccines following the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They are being asked to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating children, such as any impact on education. The JCVI advised the health benefits from vaccination are marginally greater than the potential known harms, but stopped short of recommending vaccinations for all 12 to 15-year-olds. The UK's Health Secretary Sajid Javid says he and the other UK health secretaries have written to the chief medical officers to ask that they consider the vaccination of 12 to 15-year-olds ""from a broader perspective, as suggested by the JCVI"". âWe will then consider the advice from the chief medical officers, building on the advice from the JCVI, before making a decision shortly.â Javid has asked the NHS to put preparations in place to roll out vaccinations to 12 to 15-year-olds, should it be recommended by the chief medical officers. Catherine BurnsHealth correspondent The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has decided to invite another 200,000 12 to 15-year-olds with underlying health problems for Covid vaccines - but has stopped short of extending it to all teenagers. Instead, health minister from all four UK nations will ask their chief medical officers to decide. They will also consider aspects such as the impact on education. This means that about 350,000 12 to 15-year-olds with certain health problems are now eligible for the vaccines. There are more than three million 12 to 15-year-olds in the UK. The vaccine experts did decide the benefits to children do marginally outweigh the risks â but that wasnât enough for them to recommend universal vaccination for this age group. They weighed up the very rare risk of young people developing myocarditis â an inflammation of the heart. In the US, for every million Pfizer second doses given to 12 to 17-year-old boys, around 60 had the condition. It was eight in a million for girls. The Netherlands is among the nations already rolling out Covid jabs to 12 to 15-year-olds The government's vaccine advisers have decided not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children aged between 12 and 15. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has announced it is widening the so-far limited rollout to more children in this age bracket who have underlying health conditions. But it is not recommending mass vaccination of children aged between 12 and 15. The programme is being extended from what had been considered the most at-risk children, to include children with chronic major heart, lung, kidney, liver and neurological conditions. It means about 200,000 more children will be invited for vaccines. The decision comes exactly a week after the Department of Health and Social Care confirmed preparations were under way to ensure the NHS was ready to offer coronavirus jabs to all 12 to 15-year-olds in England from early September. The department said it wanted to be ""ready to hit the ground running"". The Borders General Hospital is said to be experiencing considerable ongoing pressure A health board in Scotland has extended its suspension of all routine operations for a further three weeks in the face of rising Covid patient numbers. NHS Borders first announced it was stopping such surgery on 11 August. It has now confirmed that, due to ""significant pressure"" at the Borders General Hospital, it will not resume before 26 September. The health board says the decision has not been easy and all patients affected will be contacted directly. Read more. If you're fully vaccinated, you can currently enjoy perks like not having to self-isolate after coming into contact with someone with Covid, and being able to travel abroad without certain restrictions. But from the end of September, the plan is to make proof of your Covid status - for example that you're fully vaccinated or have tested negative - a requirement to get into nightclubs and some other crowded venues in England and Scotland. Today,Scotlandhas just made it easier to proveyour vaccine status by allowing people to download or receive a paper QR code that can be scanned. InEngland, you can download your Covid pass via the NHS app (not the NHS Covid app) if you are registered with a GP, or get it online or by calling 119. InWalesyou can also download the NHS Covid pass, and people inNorthern Irelandcan apply for the certificate online and use it for travel. More details on what to do here. Levels of crime were ""remarkably low"" in Jersey asclubs reopened for the first time, police say. Some of Jersey'slast Covid restrictions were lifted on 26 August, allowing dancing and large gatherings to return. Among those hitting the clubs was Clodagh O'Brien who turned 18 on the day restrictions were lifted in Jersey. ""I've always wanted to go, so I was pretty excited,"" she says. While Jason McDonald, who runs security company JMD Secure, says the bank holiday weekend was ""off-the-walls busy"" but adds ""we had no trouble which was really unbelievable"". We've been hearing today about Scotland now allowing people to download their vaccine certificate as a QR code - like what happens in England. But it's now emerged that a security flaw which allows people to edit their vaccination status certificates has not been fixed - three months after it was first identified. The BBCreported in May how vaccination status details could be alteredusing popular computer software programmes. A fix was rolled out which meant people could only request the document be sent to them by post. But the certificates are available to download again and still editable. BBC Scotland was able to download a certificate and edit it to include a false name, date of birth and the address of the BBC's Glasgow headquarters. Read more here. There are signs that the Delta variant in the US is harming the recovery of the economy. New government data released on Friday showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected in August - with employment rising by 235,000. The figure was well down on the 1.05 million jobs created in July, adding to fears that the recovery from the pandemic may be running out of steam. Despite the disappointing hiring levels, the unemployment rate declined to 5.2% in August from 5.4% the previous month. The dollar fell on foreign exchange markets after the announcement. We've got more here. Earlier we reported on a call from scientists to vaccinate all children over 12. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is still pondering its judgement on whether jabs should be given to healthy children in this age group but there is general agreement that this is a really tricky call to make. The JCVI is focusing squarely on the benefits of vaccination to children themselves - not on how it helps other people. Children's risk from Covid isn't zero but the chances of them becoming seriously ill from Covid are incredibly small. That means there needs to be a clear and obvious advantage to giving them a jab. However,a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccineshas made that calculation a lot more complicated. Here Philippa Roxby takes a look atthe factors the JCVI will have to consider. The England Under-21s football team were due to play Romania in a friendly today but the match has beencancelled after two positive Covid-19 tests in the English camp. The Young Lions did not travel to Bucharest, with the Football Association saying positive tests were reported ""within the party of players and support staff"". Individuals concerned were ""immediately isolated from the rest of the group"". New head coach Lee Carsley had been set to take charge for the first time, having been appointed in July. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Treasury must ""urgently"" confirm extra funding before councils can start making offers to house Afghan refugees, a document seen by the BBC suggests. It estimates the cost of helping those coming to the UK over the next 10 years could be more than Â£2.5bn. And it suggests a shortfall in the cash committed by Whitehall so far. A government spokesperson said hundreds of Afghan nationals who had worked alongside the British in Afghanistan had already been welcomed to the UK. But Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said it was ""deeply worrying"" that the government was ""failing to step up and play its role in providing national coordination, leadership and support"". The Treasury has been asked to comment on the contents of the leaked document. Council leader shocked at 1,350 empty army homes Where will resettled Afghans live in the UK? How many Afghan asylum seekers has the UK taken in? Thousands of people have fled Afghanistansince the country fell to the Taliban in August, as US and UK troops withdrew their forces after 20 years on the ground. Around 15,000 people eligible to come to the UK were evacuated in the final two weeks, including 8,000 Afghans who had worked alongside British forces. But the government has admittedit cannot be precise with how many others were left behind. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is in the regionto try to negotiate safe passage through neighbouring countries for Britons and others still trying to leave Afghanistan. Speaking at a press conference in Pakistan, he pledged Â£30m in aid to bordering countries taking in the majority of the refugees, to help provide shelter and sanitation. And he promised the UK would be ""shouldering our humanitarian responsibilities"" to help. The government is talking to councils about how many people could be resettled in their areas when they reach the UK, calling for a fair distribution across the country. This call was echoed in a joint statement by council leaders in Greater Manchester, including its mayor, Labour's Andy Burnham, who said ""every part of the country needs to take a share of the responsibility across all schemes, asylum and resettlement"" - rather than areas with lower house prices accommodating ""far higher numbers of those seeking sanctuary"". The leaked document - Afghan Resettlement: Domestic Support Offer and Funding Requirements - was discussed by ministers on Wednesday. It said just under Â£400m has been allocated so far to help resettle those who had fled the country, but an extra Â£557m could be needed over the next three years. Left behind in Afghanistan: If I canât get out, Iâll die Afghans who worked for UK can stay permanently The government intends to provide funding to local authorities to accommodate Afghans, and the document says relocation costs were a ""substantial - but necessary - offer of support"". Ministers met to discuss resettling plans on Friday before holding a meeting with local authority leaders, telling them to see ""no offer of housing and support as too small"". But the BBC understands the councils were not given confirmation of how much funding they would receive. This video can not be played Getting the plane out of Afghanistan was the ""happiest moment of my life"" Among the councils offering support, Walsall Council in the West Midlands has taken in 69 evacuees so far and says it hopes to house up to 120. Mike Bird, the council leader, said it was a difficult task, housing families with children who needed school places. ""With children going back to school, and the pressure on school places, that in itself is something the government don't seem to be taking into account,"" he said. ""We've got the whole of the UK that should be considered. If only one [some] councils are coming forward... then the government have got to step in and make sure it does happen."" One refugee, Ahmed, whose real name is not being used, arrived in the UK from Kabul with his wife and six children in July. He told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme this week about the challenges his family faced. ""We have been living in hotels for quite a while now in larger groups and it's becoming tougher and tougher, so it's time for us to move to a proper house,"" he said. ""That is the overarching concern we are having, because we can't have a bank account."" Schemes for people fleeing the country include the existing Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) for Afghans who worked with the UK government and a new Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) for vulnerable people. Funding models for the resettlement schemes are still being developed, but initial proposals suggested the figures would be based on 5,000 Afghans arriving under the ACRS scheme per year (capped at 20,000 people) at a cost of Â£715m, 5,000 arriving under the UK Resettlement Scheme each year at a cost of Â£1.65bn, and 7,000 arriving under the ARAP scheme in 2021-2 at a cost of Â£190m. The document also suggested that while some refugees would require more support than others, local authorities should be given a set amount per person housed to make their funding easier to plan. It recommended local authorities should be given Â£20,520 per person split over three years, plus more for education costs. It also recommended extra healthcare funding of Â£3,200 per person and Â£15m funding per year to ""international partners"" to support resettlement in third countries. These initial funding proposals suggest the costs would reach Â£187m in 2021/2 and Â£975m over the course of this spending review period - which lasts until 2024/5. But the document said that with just under Â£400m of this funding already committed, there would be a shortfall of approximately Â£557m, so confirmation of further funding from the Treasury will be required ""urgently"". Labour's Mr Thomas-Symonds accused ministers of being ""disastrously complacent"" throughout the crisis in Afghanistan. He said: ""Councils across the country want to do the right thing, so it's deeply worrying that the UK government is failing to step up and play its role in providing national coordination, leadership and support."" The shadow home secretary called on the prime minister to urgently set out details on how promised funding would be spent to ""allow Afghan people who have been through hellish experiences rebuild their lives here"". Border Force staff were assisting Afghan refugees on their arrival from Afghanistan A spokesperson from the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said that the government was calling on all councils who had not yet offered, to come forward with offers of support. ""Thanks to the efforts of nearly a third of Britain's councils and vital delivery partners, hundreds of Afghan nationals who have worked alongside our Armed Forces and diplomats in Afghanistan, risking their lives supporting us, have already been warmly welcomed to the country,"" they said. ""Councils in England, Scotland and Wales will have access to a share of an additional Â£5m to help them provide the necessary housing and support to Afghans who have worked for this country in Afghanistan, but who now face threats of persecution or worse.""

"Alexanda Kotey (file image) An Islamic State (IS) group suspect from the UK has pleaded guilty in a US court to multiple charges relating to the murder of four American hostages. Alexanda Kotey is accused of belonging to an IS cell dubbed ""The Beatles"" which was involved in kidnappings in Iraq and Syria. The IS cell was allegedly responsible for the beheadings of a number of Western and Japanese hostages. Kotey, 37, pleaded guilty to all eight charges and now faces life in prison. He attended a change of plea hearing at a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on Thursday, where he pleaded guilty to charges including hostage taking resulting in death and conspiracy to murder US citizens. ""Kotey has been afforded due process and in the face of overwhelming evidence, he made the independent decision to plead guilty to his crimes,"" lawyer Raj Parekh, a member of the prosecuting team, told reporters outside the court. ""He has agreed to spend the rest of his life in prison,"" he added. Who were the Islamic State 'Beatles'? Profile: Journalist James Foley Profile: Steven Sotloff Kotey and fellow ""Beatle"" El Shafee Elsheikh, 32, are on trial for their involvement in the murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and relief workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller. Both men are also suspected of involvement in the deaths of other hostages, including Alan Henning - a British taxi driver who was delivering aid - and Scottish aid worker David Haines, as well as two Japanese nationals. The pair initially pleaded not guilty at a hearing in October. The change of plea suggests Kotey may now co-operate with prosecutors. It is not yet clear whether Elsheikh has reached a plea deal with authorities. Clockwise from top left: Aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig, and journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley The two men were flown from US custody in Iraq last year to face the charges, which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison. Originally from west London, their alleged IS gang was given its Beatles nickname by hostages due to their British accents. They were stripped of their UK nationality in 2018. Some of the victims were beheaded, with their deaths filmed and broadcast on social media. The high-profile killings triggered outrage around the world. The group's alleged ringleader, Mohammed Emwazi, known as ""Jihadi John"", was killed in a drone strike in 2015. Another gang member, Aine Davis, was arrested and imprisoned in Turkey. Kotey and Elsheikh remained at large until they were captured in 2018 by Syrian Kurds fighting IS. UK sends US evidence on IS 'Beatles' Relatives of British IS hostage braced for trial The US government had wanted to put them on trial but was lacking evidence. The men were in a legal limbo for several months, held by the US military in Iraq where the US attorney general threatened to hand them over to local courts, known for their summary justice and executions. But the US said it would not carry out the death penalty if the men were convicted in a US court. British counter-terrorism officials have since shared crucial evidence with US officials. Elsheikh is scheduled to go on trial in January. Kotey's plea deal, meanwhile, carries a minimum sentence of life without parole. But after 15 years he would be eligible to be transferred to the UK to face any possible charges there. His sentencing is due to take place in March next year.

"This video can not be played The record rainfall caused flash flooding in New York City US President Joe Biden says ""historic investment"" is needed to deal with the climate crisis, as the north-east reels from flash flooding and tornadoes that have killed at least 45 people. The US is facing climate-related destruction across the country and tackling it is ""a matter of life and death"", the president said. New York City and New Jersey saw unprecedented levels of rainfall. Some residents became trapped in flooded basements and cars. Six states suffered loss of life: New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said at least 23 people had died in his state - most of them stuck in their vehicles as the waters rose At least 14 people lost their lives in New York City, including a two-year-old boy. Eleven of them drowned while trapped in their flooded basements, officials said Five people died in Pennsylvania, while a state trooper in Connecticut was swept away as he responded to a call Deaths were also reported in Maryland and Virginia President Biden has declared an emergency in both New Jersey and New York, enabling both states to receive federal funding to support local disaster relief efforts. The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but we know that increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall. Residents of Elizabeth, New Jersey, are recovering from the storm The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Four ways climate change links to extreme weather A really simple guide to climate change New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio criticised weather experts, saying their forecasts were being ""made a mockery of in a matter of minutes"". He said he had been warned to expect between three and six inches (7.5 and 15cm) of rain over the course of the day. However a record 3.15 inches fell in Central Park in just one hour. ""The suddenness, the brutality of storms now, it is different,"" he said, adding that the latest extreme weather was ""the biggest wake-up call"". New York Governor Kathy Hochul said: ""We did not know that between 8:50 and 9:50 p.m. last night, that the heavens would literally open up and bring Niagara Falls level of water to the streets of New York."" New Jersey's largest dairy farm suffered extensive damage Residents have been assessing the damage to property. One man in Flushing, New York, said his house was prone to flooding ""but what I saw last night is unimaginable"". ""I have never seen water coming in all directions,"" Tedla Asfaw, 60, told the BBC. ""There's huge damage here. It's a big hit for us."" In New Jersey, a tornado flattened the state's largest dairy farm, ripping roofs off buildings and toppling several large silos. Many cows were trapped under fallen sheds and some died, the owners of Wellacrest Farm wrote on their Facebook page. ""Along with the devastating loss of homes in our neighbourhoods - we, as a community, suffered a great loss with the destruction of our farm."" In New York, some 835 people had to be rescued from stranded subway trains, police said on Thursday, after social media pictures showed water gushing into underground stations and tunnels. Other footage showed cars floating down flooded roads, with cries of ""help"" being heard from inside. Nearly 500 vehicles were abandoned in New York, the Associated Press says. Passengers on trains, planes and buses have been describing finding themselves stuck for hours without moving as the flooding made travelling impossible. Allow Twitter content?

"Jordan has been chased by debt collection agencies after falling behind on payments for clothes. The 23-year-old bought a winter coat using Buy Now Pay Later when employed, but then lost his job. According to Citizens Advice, one in 10 shoppers who use this type of credit end up being pursued by debt collectors. The Treasury said it was ""stepping in and regulating"" the market so people ""are treated fairly"". Jordan started using Buy Now Pay Later after seeing it advertised on social media apps and on the iPhone app store. He decided to use it to buy a coat for Â£200. ""It was quite cold, it was the winter, and at that point I didn't have a lot of clothes,"" he said. ""I was in a job, and I was able to pay it, but I ended up being quite unfortunate and losing that job."" He bought some other items including a hat, but fell behind with the payments to firms including Laybuy and Klarna. ""It was quite difficult for me to keep on top of it. I went through a lot of anxiety and depression,"" he said, and began to be chased by debt collection agencies. ""They don't give any leeway or ease with it at all,"" he says. ""They call up quite a bit [and email]. It does make me stressed when I'm being constantly called and badgered about it."" ""I think [Buy Now Pay Later] is quite dangerous, to be honest,"" Jordan says. ""Especially on the advertising. They make it out to be such a good thing... but that's only condoning debt."" Jordan has recently moved to Bristol to start a new job, and will be in a position to pay off the debt. Charities sound alarm over buy-now-pay-later debt Buy now, pay later firms such as Klarna face stricter controls Laybuy said: ""Laybuy only refers a customer to a debt collector as a last resort, and only after other attempts to collect the outstanding payment have been exhausted. ""When a debt is referred to a debt collector, we only ever refer outstanding purchase price of the product. ""Late fees, which are limited to a maximum of Â£24 for a single order, are never passed to a debt collector. Laybuy also pays all the cost for debt collection."" Alex Marsh, head of Klarna UK, said: ""At Klarna we only ever use debt collection agencies to help us contact customers we are unable to reach and we do this on fewer than 1% of orders. ""The debt collection agencies we work with are all Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)-authorised and will only contact customers by telephone or email and do not use bailiffs. ""We encourage any of our customers whose circumstances have changed, to please get in touch so we can help you with a plan to get back on track."" Buy Now Pay Later options often appear at checkouts on retailers' websites, and can help spread the cost of purchases, interest-free, potentially avoiding expensive credit. But Citizens Advice said that for many people Buy Now Pay Later can be ""a slippery slope into debt"". It added that it ""fears shoppers have been left unprotected and ill-informed during the rapid expansion of the sector"". ""Not one of the BNPL checkouts on leading retailers' websites warned people they could be referred to debt collectors for missed payments,"" the advice service said. Shoppers were charged Â£39m in late fees in the past year, it estimated. Of those who were referred to a debt collector for missed payments, 96% said there had been negative consequences. Millions of online shoppers have being clicking the buttons to spread the payments, but as the number of users has grown, so have the criticisms. Buy Now Pay Later arrangements aren't viewed as a normal loan by credit reference agencies and other lenders. It becomes a kind of invisible debt to the safety net system, so people with lots of little Buy Now Pay Later debts can get in a mess trying to juggle those payments alongside other loans and interest at the same time. Fears are growing that younger people are being saddled with unnecessary debt, and that those who are already vulnerable are slipping further down the debt spiral. Although the government said in February that they will regulate the sector, they haven't done so yet. These included sleepless nights, ignoring texts, emails and letters in case they were about debts, avoiding answering the door, borrowing money to repay the debt, or deteriorating mental health. Citizens Advice said that a woman aged in her 60s was trying to buy plants online, but struggled to find the postage cost at the checkout and decided to abandon her purchase. The keen gardener was surprised to receive an email saying she had signed up to a buy now pay later agreement, and tried to cancel her order. She told Citizens Advice: ""I really don't understand how I ended up paying for my plants through buy now, pay later. ""I didn't understand what it was. Then I get these threatening emails saying they're going to contact debt collectors, and then I got a letter from a debt collector. ""I couldn't sleep, I lay awake worrying that someone was going to turn up to my house and start taking things. I have a number of health issues and I was worried this was going to make me ill again. It was eventually resolved, but at great stress to me."" Millie Harris, a debt adviser at Citizens Advice East Devon, said: ""My concern is that people aren't processing the fact that buy now pay later is credit. They don't realise there are going to be consequences if they don't pay - it gives them a false sense of security. ""I've seen people using it for their kids' clothes and shoes that they would otherwise never be able to afford. They are taking out what is effectively a loan, but they don't see it as one. ""For example, I helped someone who has tens of thousands of pounds of debt, but they don't see buy now pay later as part of that total. ""It's almost under-the-radar debt."" Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, agrees: ""A seamless buy now pay later checkout process should not mean shoppers have to dig around in the small print to find out they're taking out a credit agreement, and could be referred to debt collectors if they can't pay. The warnings should be unmissable."" Citizens Advice is urging anyone who has been contacted by debt collectors to get free, independent debt advice. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""Buy Now Pay Later can be a helpful way to manage your finances but it's important that consumers are protected as these agreements become more popular. ""By stepping in and regulating, we're making sure people are treated fairly and only offered agreements they can afford."" On 2 February, the government announced it would to bring unregulated interest-free Buy Now Pay Later products into regulation.

We'll be back with more coronavirus news soon. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main stories of the day: Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) member Prof Adam Finn says the decision not to recommend rolling out the vaccine to healthy children under 15 was based on a ""risk-benefit balance"". The professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol says: ""Although the vaccine works and would be beneficial in the sense of preventing infection and some severe disease from Covid, there are significant uncertainties around the safety of the vaccine that have not yet been clarified such that we can't be sure that the risk-benefit balance is sufficiently good in favour and to the benefit of those children to recommend it."" He says the large majority of severe cases in children - and the very small number of deaths in the age group - occurred in children who were ""identifiably at high risk because of other medical conditions"", which is why the vaccine is being rolled out to more of these children. While the JCVI is not recommending jabs for healthy 12 to 15 year olds, 200,000 more in that age group who are vulnerable will be offered a vaccine. This includes those who have chronic heart, lung and liver conditions. Children aged 12 and over who have severe neurodisability, Down's syndrome, a severely weakened immune system or profound and multiple learning difficulties are also recommended two doses of vaccine. Currently under-18s are being given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although the Moderna vaccine hasalso been authorised for use in children in the UK,external. You can fine out morehere. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, says if we are going to vaccinate children it has to be in their interests and ""not in society's interests"". He says it is not an easy decision but says he supports the decision of the JCVI, which he says has given the matter a ""substantial amount of thought"". Prof Hunter says the JCVI has taken different decisions to other countries in the past and points to the 12-week delay it originally recommended between first and second jabs, which he says saved ""many thousands of lives"". He says in the first wave of the pandemic schools played an important part in transmission but as the pandemic has gone on schools being open has had ""a decreasingly important roll in the rollout of the pandemic"". ""Yes, schools almost certainly will be associated with some increase in transmission but it is doubtful that will be a huge impact on the epidemic,"" he says. Additional safety measures in schools will become ""more important"" if all 12 to 15-year-olds are not vaccinated, a teaching union says. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, says: ""If the decision not to vaccinate is upheld by the chief medical officers, this makes additional safety mitigations in schools all the more important. ""Sadly, in taking away so many safety measures last term, without replacing them with others, the government has left schools open to another rise in case counts - which will mean many children and staff missing school if they test positive."" Christina Pagel said the JCVI's decision was  ""out of step"" with most other high-income countries The decision by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation not to recommend Covid vaccines for all 12 to 15-year-olds is ""out of step"" with the stance taken by most other high-income countries, a scientist says. Christina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London, says the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have all recommended vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds. Pagel, a member of the Independent Sage group set up to scrutinise decisions made by the government on coronavirus, says a recent ONS report estimated one in 1,000 children have had long Covid for more than a year. She also pointed toa study,externalthat found the risk of myocarditis - an inflammation of the heart - was greater in people who were infected with Covid versus those who had been vaccinated. ""It doesn't really make any sense to me that we're not trying to protect children from Covid."" The US has vaccinated more than 10 million 12-15-year-olds and France, Italy, Canada and Israel are among other countries vaccinating children. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says he is ""disappointed"" by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) decision not to recommend jabs for healthy 12 to 15-year-olds. He says his union is pleased more children with health vulnerabilities will receive vaccines and that he understands the decision is based on an assessment of the ""balance of risks"". But he says: ""Nevertheless, the upshot is that this would make it more difficult during the autumn term and beyond to guard against educational disruption caused by transmission of the virus."" BBC MonitoringBy Shayan Sardarizadeh A group of anti-vaccine protesters have clashed with police officers during an attempt to break into the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) office in Canary Wharf. The Metropolitan Police says four of its officers have been injured. The group, which calls itself Official Voice, has staged similar protests outside the former BBC Television Centre, ITN Productions, Google and Facebook buildings. Organising its rallies on the Telegram messaging app, the group claims to be against vaccinating children and so-called vaccine passports. The groupâs online presence is also full of debunked conspiracy theories about Covid vaccines, including false claims that mRNA vaccines are a form of âgene therapyâ or that the vaccine is a âdepopulation toolâ for a shadowy global elite. Anti-vaccine protests across the UK have become more frequent and increasingly more aggressive in recent weeks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The latest UK government coronavirus figures are in and there have been a further 42,076 new cases reported. The last time more new daily cases were reported was on 22 July. A further 121 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been reported. Meanwhile, 43,142,747 people have received both doses of a coronavirus vaccine and 5,029251  have received just one dose, as of 2 September. The UK's four chief medical officers are to provide further advice on the vaccination of children aged 12 to 15 with Covid-19 vaccines following the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They are being asked to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating children, such as any impact on education. The JCVI advised the health benefits from vaccination are marginally greater than the potential known harms, but stopped short of recommending vaccinations for all 12 to 15-year-olds. The UK's Health Secretary Sajid Javid says he and the other UK health secretaries have written to the chief medical officers to ask that they consider the vaccination of 12 to 15-year-olds ""from a broader perspective, as suggested by the JCVI"". âWe will then consider the advice from the chief medical officers, building on the advice from the JCVI, before making a decision shortly.â Javid has asked the NHS to put preparations in place to roll out vaccinations to 12 to 15-year-olds, should it be recommended by the chief medical officers. Catherine BurnsHealth correspondent The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has decided to invite another 200,000 12 to 15-year-olds with underlying health problems for Covid vaccines - but has stopped short of extending it to all teenagers. Instead, health minister from all four UK nations will ask their chief medical officers to decide. They will also consider aspects such as the impact on education. This means that about 350,000 12 to 15-year-olds with certain health problems are now eligible for the vaccines. There are more than three million 12 to 15-year-olds in the UK. The vaccine experts did decide the benefits to children do marginally outweigh the risks â but that wasnât enough for them to recommend universal vaccination for this age group. They weighed up the very rare risk of young people developing myocarditis â an inflammation of the heart. In the US, for every million Pfizer second doses given to 12 to 17-year-old boys, around 60 had the condition. It was eight in a million for girls. The Netherlands is among the nations already rolling out Covid jabs to 12 to 15-year-olds The government's vaccine advisers have decided not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children aged between 12 and 15. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has announced it is widening the so-far limited rollout to more children in this age bracket who have underlying health conditions. But it is not recommending mass vaccination of children aged between 12 and 15. The programme is being extended from what had been considered the most at-risk children, to include children with chronic major heart, lung, kidney, liver and neurological conditions. It means about 200,000 more children will be invited for vaccines. The decision comes exactly a week after the Department of Health and Social Care confirmed preparations were under way to ensure the NHS was ready to offer coronavirus jabs to all 12 to 15-year-olds in England from early September. The department said it wanted to be ""ready to hit the ground running"". The Borders General Hospital is said to be experiencing considerable ongoing pressure A health board in Scotland has extended its suspension of all routine operations for a further three weeks in the face of rising Covid patient numbers. NHS Borders first announced it was stopping such surgery on 11 August. It has now confirmed that, due to ""significant pressure"" at the Borders General Hospital, it will not resume before 26 September. The health board says the decision has not been easy and all patients affected will be contacted directly. Read more. If you're fully vaccinated, you can currently enjoy perks like not having to self-isolate after coming into contact with someone with Covid, and being able to travel abroad without certain restrictions. But from the end of September, the plan is to make proof of your Covid status - for example that you're fully vaccinated or have tested negative - a requirement to get into nightclubs and some other crowded venues in England and Scotland. Today,Scotlandhas just made it easier to proveyour vaccine status by allowing people to download or receive a paper QR code that can be scanned. InEngland, you can download your Covid pass via the NHS app (not the NHS Covid app) if you are registered with a GP, or get it online or by calling 119. InWalesyou can also download the NHS Covid pass, and people inNorthern Irelandcan apply for the certificate online and use it for travel. More details on what to do here. Levels of crime were ""remarkably low"" in Jersey asclubs reopened for the first time, police say. Some of Jersey'slast Covid restrictions were lifted on 26 August, allowing dancing and large gatherings to return. Among those hitting the clubs was Clodagh O'Brien who turned 18 on the day restrictions were lifted in Jersey. ""I've always wanted to go, so I was pretty excited,"" she says. While Jason McDonald, who runs security company JMD Secure, says the bank holiday weekend was ""off-the-walls busy"" but adds ""we had no trouble which was really unbelievable"". We've been hearing today about Scotland now allowing people to download their vaccine certificate as a QR code - like what happens in England. But it's now emerged that a security flaw which allows people to edit their vaccination status certificates has not been fixed - three months after it was first identified. The BBCreported in May how vaccination status details could be alteredusing popular computer software programmes. A fix was rolled out which meant people could only request the document be sent to them by post. But the certificates are available to download again and still editable. BBC Scotland was able to download a certificate and edit it to include a false name, date of birth and the address of the BBC's Glasgow headquarters. Read more here. There are signs that the Delta variant in the US is harming the recovery of the economy. New government data released on Friday showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected in August - with employment rising by 235,000. The figure was well down on the 1.05 million jobs created in July, adding to fears that the recovery from the pandemic may be running out of steam. Despite the disappointing hiring levels, the unemployment rate declined to 5.2% in August from 5.4% the previous month. The dollar fell on foreign exchange markets after the announcement. We've got more here. Earlier we reported on a call from scientists to vaccinate all children over 12. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is still pondering its judgement on whether jabs should be given to healthy children in this age group but there is general agreement that this is a really tricky call to make. The JCVI is focusing squarely on the benefits of vaccination to children themselves - not on how it helps other people. Children's risk from Covid isn't zero but the chances of them becoming seriously ill from Covid are incredibly small. That means there needs to be a clear and obvious advantage to giving them a jab. However,a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccineshas made that calculation a lot more complicated. Here Philippa Roxby takes a look atthe factors the JCVI will have to consider. The England Under-21s football team were due to play Romania in a friendly today but the match has beencancelled after two positive Covid-19 tests in the English camp. The Young Lions did not travel to Bucharest, with the Football Association saying positive tests were reported ""within the party of players and support staff"". Individuals concerned were ""immediately isolated from the rest of the group"". New head coach Lee Carsley had been set to take charge for the first time, having been appointed in July. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Objects, including a flare, were thrown on to the pitch in Budapest on Thursday Fifa has opened disciplinary proceedings after racist abuse was aimed at England players duringThursday's 4-0 win over Hungaryin a World Cup qualifier in Budapest. Raheem Sterling and Jude Bellingham were both targeted. England players were also pelted with objects in the second half and a flare was thrown on the pitch by the home fans at Puskas Arena. England condemned the abuseas ""completely unacceptable"". Borussia Dortmund midfielder Bellingham, 18, tweeted on Friday: ""Part of the game and always will be until proper punishments are put in place by those with the power.

""It is a disgrace how it keeps on happening,"" said Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount. ""When these things happen, consequences need to take place and the FA will be speaking to Fifa about it and hopefully it keeps getting put to them and they hand out bans. ""But it needs to stop and we need to get this out of football."" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged Fifa ""to take strong action against those responsible to ensure that this kind of disgraceful behaviour is eradicated from the game for good"". Football Daily podcast: Racist chants mar England win On Friday afternoon, football's world governing body Fifa said disciplinary proceedings had been opened ""following analysis of the match reports"". It added: ""Once again, Fifa would like to state that our position remains firm and resolute in rejecting any form of racism and violence as well as any other form of discrimination or abuse. ""We have a very clear zero tolerance stance against such abhorrent behaviours in football."" This video can not be played I donât think our players can do any more - Southgate Despite Uefa ordering Hungary to play three home games behind closed doors after their supporters' discriminatory behaviour, fans were allowed in on Thursday as the game came under Fifa's jurisdiction. The Uefa ban relates to racism and other discriminatory conduct which took place during Euro 2020 in June. While Uefa manage World Cup qualifiers involving European teams, Fifa is able to take action because it is their competition. ""Fifa strongly rejects any form of racism and violence and has a very clear zero tolerance stance for such behaviour in football,"" the game's global governing body said. Anti-discrimination bodies Kick It Out, Show Racism the Red Card and Fare criticised Fifa and Uefa for their handling of Hungary's existing ban. ""The question for us is why Fifa didn't act to prevent this, and why the global football system didn't work together to prevent this,"" Kick It Out chief executive Tony Burnett said. ""All I'm hearing again thus far is excuses about who should file what paperwork and who should file permission for X, Y and Z."" Fare executive director Piara Powar said allowing fans to attend in Budapest was an example of the ""system falling apart"" as Uefa and Fifa try to deal with racism. Allow Instagram content?

Powar also confirmed that the The Fare Network - an organisation trying to fight inequality in football - would provide authorities with a report of their own from the game, including video footage. Ged Grebby, chief executive of Show Racism the Red Card, told BBC Radio 5 Live that England managerGareth Southgate was right to say England should ""get its own house in order""before criticising others for their behaviour, following a numerous instances of racism in the game. Grebby also added that a ""long-term education programme"" should be put in place to help tackle racism in Hungarian football. The Professional Footballers' Association said ""loopholes"" that meant the game was not behind closed doors must be addressed. ""Global football governing bodies need to demonstrate that these behaviours will never be tolerated in our game,"" the players' union said. ""We demand they issue the strongest sanctions possible, such as lifetime stadium bans."" England players took the knee to many jeers in Budapest on Thursday England's players were booed as they took the knee before the match at the 67,000-capacity Puskas Arena to protest against racism, with BBC Radio 5 Live reporter Juliette Ferrington describing the reaction from fans as a ""wall of noise"". She also described how racist chants could be heard during the match and that Sterling and Bellingham were the targets of abuse. In the second half, Sterling was pelted with paper cups and bottles when he opened the scoring for England. A flare was later thrown on to the pitch after Harry Maguire put the visitors 3-0 ahead. The Hungarian Football Federation (MLSZ) said that those who disrupted the match ""need to be identified and severely punished"", but did not make any specific reference to discriminatory abuse. ""Fans entering the field, throwing light grenades and glasses, are being identified. The MLSZ has filed/will file a police report against them,"" the MLSZ said. ""Any fine will be passed on to the perpetrators in civil litigation, and they can expect a two-year disqualification from sporting events at the end of the trial."" England manager Gareth Southgate had ice thrown at him by fans during his post-match interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, in which he said he hoped the abuse was ""dealt with the right way"". ""I've heard reports of racism, which I hadn't heard during the game,"" he said. ""Everyone knows what we stand for as a team, and that's completely unacceptable. It has been reported. Our head of security has spoken to the players and taken their statement. We will deal with it in the right channels. ""The world is modernising and although some people are stuck in their ways of thinking and their prejudices, they're going to be the dinosaurs in the end because the world is changing."" Hungary's minister of foreign affairs, Peter Szijjarto, questioned English complaints about the boos in Budapest in a Facebook post that included a video of England supporters at Wembley jeering during the Italian national anthem before the Euro 2020 final. Nick Thorpe, BBC Central Europe Correspondent Hungarians have reacted with a mixture of anger, shame and defiance to allegations of racist abuse. 'Fantastic atmosphere, 2nd half meltdown' read the headline in the main sports paper, Nemzeti Sport. The right-wing Fidesz government has been in power for 11 years, and is proud of its open, nationalist stance. That has gone down well with fans, knows as the Ultras, in their uniform black T-shirts. Prime Minister Viktor Orban and some of his ministers end their speeches with the football slogan 'Go for it, Hungarians!' ""The Hungarian FA should complain to Fifaâ¦ that the England team is making political propaganda out of a sports event,"" read one comment on the pro-government Mandiner website. But there was also disgust at the behaviour, especially the pelting of Raheem Sterling. ""Don't pretend that the darling Hungarian fans would never do such a thing, we have our share of brain-dead, hateful jerks. Ban them for life - if there is video or audio evidence,"" read another comment on the same site.

The vaccine experts did decide the benefits to children do marginally outweigh the risks â but that wasnât enough for them to recommend universal vaccination for this age group. They weighed up the very rare risk of young people developing myocarditis â an inflammation of the heart. In the US, for every million Pfizer second doses given to 12 to 17-year-old boys, around 60 had the condition. It was eight in a million for girls. The Netherlands is among the nations already rolling out Covid jabs to 12 to 15-year-olds The government's vaccine advisers have decided not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children aged between 12 and 15. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has announced it is widening the so-far limited rollout to more children in this age bracket who have underlying health conditions. But it is not recommending mass vaccination of children aged between 12 and 15. The programme is being extended from what had been considered the most at-risk children, to include children with chronic major heart, lung, kidney, liver and neurological conditions. It means about 200,000 more children will be invited for vaccines. The decision comes exactly a week after the Department of Health and Social Care confirmed preparations were under way to ensure the NHS was ready to offer coronavirus jabs to all 12 to 15-year-olds in England from early September. The department said it wanted to be ""ready to hit the ground running"". The Borders General Hospital is said to be experiencing considerable ongoing pressure A health board in Scotland has extended its suspension of all routine operations for a further three weeks in the face of rising Covid patient numbers. NHS Borders first announced it was stopping such surgery on 11 August. It has now confirmed that, due to ""significant pressure"" at the Borders General Hospital, it will not resume before 26 September. The health board says the decision has not been easy and all patients affected will be contacted directly. Read more. If you're fully vaccinated, you can currently enjoy perks like not having to self-isolate after coming into contact with someone with Covid, and being able to travel abroad without certain restrictions. But from the end of September, the plan is to make proof of your Covid status - for example that you're fully vaccinated or have tested negative - a requirement to get into nightclubs and some other crowded venues in England and Scotland. Today,Scotlandhas just made it easier to proveyour vaccine status by allowing people to download or receive a paper QR code that can be scanned. InEngland, you can download your Covid pass via the NHS app (not the NHS Covid app) if you are registered with a GP, or get it online or by calling 119.

We've been hearing today about Scotland now allowing people to download their vaccine certificate as a QR code - like what happens in England. But it's now emerged that a security flaw which allows people to edit their vaccination status certificates has not been fixed - three months after it was first identified.

A fix was rolled out which meant people could only request the document be sent to them by post. But the certificates are available to download again and still editable.

There are signs that the Delta variant in the US is harming the recovery of the economy. New government data released on Friday showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected in August - with employment rising by 235,000. The figure was well down on the 1.05 million jobs created in July, adding to fears that the recovery from the pandemic may be running out of steam. Despite the disappointing hiring levels, the unemployment rate declined to 5.2% in August from 5.4% the previous month. The dollar fell on foreign exchange markets after the announcement. We've got more here. Earlier we reported on a call from scientists to vaccinate all children over 12. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is still pondering its judgement on whether jabs should be given to healthy children in this age group but there is general agreement that this is a really tricky call to make. The JCVI is focusing squarely on the benefits of vaccination to children themselves - not on how it helps other people. Children's risk from Covid isn't zero but the chances of them becoming seriously ill from Covid are incredibly small. That means there needs to be a clear and obvious advantage to giving them a jab. However,a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccineshas made that calculation a lot more complicated. Here Philippa Roxby takes a look atthe factors the JCVI will have to consider. The England Under-21s football team were due to play Romania in a friendly today but the match has beencancelled after two positive Covid-19 tests in the English camp.

"The UK records another 42,076 coronavirus cases - the highest daily figure for six weeks - and 121 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test The JCVI, the UK government's vaccine advisers, decide not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for all children aged between 12 and 15 But about 200,000 more 12 to 15-year-olds with certain health problems will now be eligible for the vaccines Chief medical officers are now being asked by health secretaries to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating more children They will look at issues such as any effect on education and then advise the UK and devolved governments before a final decision is made One in 75 people in the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 August, the Office for National Statistics estimates The UK is sending four million doses of the Pfizer jab to Australia as part of a Covid vaccine swap deal The EU and AstraZeneca have ended a legal dispute about supply of coronavirus vaccines Edited by James Clarke That's all from us today - your updates have come from Francesca Gillett, Alex Therrien, Doug Faulkner, Vanessa Barford and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news soon. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main stories of the day: Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) member Prof Adam Finn says the decision not to recommend rolling out the vaccine to healthy children under 15 was based on a ""risk-benefit balance"". The professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol says: ""Although the vaccine works and would be beneficial in the sense of preventing infection and some severe disease from Covid, there are significant uncertainties around the safety of the vaccine that have not yet been clarified such that we can't be sure that the risk-benefit balance is sufficiently good in favour and to the benefit of those children to recommend it."" He says the large majority of severe cases in children - and the very small number of deaths in the age group - occurred in children who were ""identifiably at high risk because of other medical conditions"", which is why the vaccine is being rolled out to more of these children. While the JCVI is not recommending jabs for healthy 12 to 15 year olds, 200,000 more in that age group who are vulnerable will be offered a vaccine. This includes those who have chronic heart, lung and liver conditions. Children aged 12 and over who have severe neurodisability, Down's syndrome, a severely weakened immune system or profound and multiple learning difficulties are also recommended two doses of vaccine. Currently under-18s are being given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although the Moderna vaccine hasalso been authorised for use in children in the UK,external. You can fine out morehere. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, says if we are going to vaccinate children it has to be in their interests and ""not in society's interests"". He says it is not an easy decision but says he supports the decision of the JCVI, which he says has given the matter a ""substantial amount of thought"". Prof Hunter says the JCVI has taken different decisions to other countries in the past and points to the 12-week delay it originally recommended between first and second jabs, which he says saved ""many thousands of lives"". He says in the first wave of the pandemic schools played an important part in transmission but as the pandemic has gone on schools being open has had ""a decreasingly important roll in the rollout of the pandemic"". ""Yes, schools almost certainly will be associated with some increase in transmission but it is doubtful that will be a huge impact on the epidemic,"" he says. Additional safety measures in schools will become ""more important"" if all 12 to 15-year-olds are not vaccinated, a teaching union says. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, says: ""If the decision not to vaccinate is upheld by the chief medical officers, this makes additional safety mitigations in schools all the more important. ""Sadly, in taking away so many safety measures last term, without replacing them with others, the government has left schools open to another rise in case counts - which will mean many children and staff missing school if they test positive."" Christina Pagel said the JCVI's decision was  ""out of step"" with most other high-income countries The decision by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation not to recommend Covid vaccines for all 12 to 15-year-olds is ""out of step"" with the stance taken by most other high-income countries, a scientist says. Christina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London, says the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have all recommended vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds. Pagel, a member of the Independent Sage group set up to scrutinise decisions made by the government on coronavirus, says a recent ONS report estimated one in 1,000 children have had long Covid for more than a year. She also pointed toa study,externalthat found the risk of myocarditis - an inflammation of the heart - was greater in people who were infected with Covid versus those who had been vaccinated. ""It doesn't really make any sense to me that we're not trying to protect children from Covid."" The US has vaccinated more than 10 million 12-15-year-olds and France, Italy, Canada and Israel are among other countries vaccinating children. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says he is ""disappointed"" by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) decision not to recommend jabs for healthy 12 to 15-year-olds. He says his union is pleased more children with health vulnerabilities will receive vaccines and that he understands the decision is based on an assessment of the ""balance of risks"". But he says: ""Nevertheless, the upshot is that this would make it more difficult during the autumn term and beyond to guard against educational disruption caused by transmission of the virus."" BBC MonitoringBy Shayan Sardarizadeh A group of anti-vaccine protesters have clashed with police officers during an attempt to break into the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) office in Canary Wharf. The Metropolitan Police says four of its officers have been injured. The group, which calls itself Official Voice, has staged similar protests outside the former BBC Television Centre, ITN Productions, Google and Facebook buildings. Organising its rallies on the Telegram messaging app, the group claims to be against vaccinating children and so-called vaccine passports. The groupâs online presence is also full of debunked conspiracy theories about Covid vaccines, including false claims that mRNA vaccines are a form of âgene therapyâ or that the vaccine is a âdepopulation toolâ for a shadowy global elite. Anti-vaccine protests across the UK have become more frequent and increasingly more aggressive in recent weeks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The latest UK government coronavirus figures are in and there have been a further 42,076 new cases reported. The last time more new daily cases were reported was on 22 July. A further 121 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been reported. Meanwhile, 43,142,747 people have received both doses of a coronavirus vaccine and 5,029251  have received just one dose, as of 2 September. The UK's four chief medical officers are to provide further advice on the vaccination of children aged 12 to 15 with Covid-19 vaccines following the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They are being asked to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating children, such as any impact on education. The JCVI advised the health benefits from vaccination are marginally greater than the potential known harms, but stopped short of recommending vaccinations for all 12 to 15-year-olds. The UK's Health Secretary Sajid Javid says he and the other UK health secretaries have written to the chief medical officers to ask that they consider the vaccination of 12 to 15-year-olds ""from a broader perspective, as suggested by the JCVI"". âWe will then consider the advice from the chief medical officers, building on the advice from the JCVI, before making a decision shortly.â Javid has asked the NHS to put preparations in place to roll out vaccinations to 12 to 15-year-olds, should it be recommended by the chief medical officers. Catherine BurnsHealth correspondent The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has decided to invite another 200,000 12 to 15-year-olds with underlying health problems for Covid vaccines - but has stopped short of extending it to all teenagers.

"Lisa Brinkworth worked undercover as a model in a documentary for the BBC's Donal McIntyre Investigates series in 1998 A former BBC reporter who claims she was sexually assaulted while working undercover to expose abuse in the fashion industry has given a statement to French police. Lisa Brinkworth posed as a model in a documentary for the BBC's Donal McIntyre Investigates series in 1998. She alleges she was sexually assaulted by one of the world's biggest model agents, Gerald Marie, during filming. Along with 13 other former models, she is giving details of her alleged assault to French authorities who have begun a preliminary investigation. ""I would very much like to see justice for them. And particularly because they were just so young and powerless at the time. ""When it happened to me... I was much older, I was working as a journalist, but when I think about them, at 16 or 17 [years old] in some cases, and completely powerless on their own with him, that's what gives me the drive to carry on."" Gerald Marie, who was the former European head of Elite Models, through his lawyer, issued a statement saying he ""refutes with dismay these false and defamatory allegations"". ""He shall be withholding his eventual statements until speaking to the competent authorities."" Gerald Marie has denied the allegations, made by at least 14 women According to a report in the Guardian newspaper, the investigation is being led by aspecialist child protection unit,externalin France. Lisa says that after a dinner with other models and Marie's business friends, she accompanied a small group, including Marie, to a club, where he pinned her down to a chair and sexually assaulted her. She said the incident was witnessed by a number of people, including her colleague Donal MacIntyre. Afterwards, she recorded her account of the assault on camera, but did not go to the police. ""I was directed not to at the time, because it would have cut short the investigation. At that time, we were working very intensively undercover. I was working 20 hour days, I think we were exhausted. We were so focused on the story. I didn't question that wisdom. And I know now I should have done. ""And then of course, in retrospect, I wish I had. It's only recently when I decided to look at this again, and I started to investigate and I started to revisit this, and women were prepared to speak out."" Lisa Brinkworth recorded her account of the assault on camera at the time After the documentary aired in November 1999, Elite Models sued the BBC alleging misrepresentation. They reached aconfidential settlement,externalwhich included the BBC not airing the documentary ever again. The BBC also told Lisa that the settlement agreement prevented it providing footage to her. ""It just seems so, so wrong to me that these women have gone through some decades really carrying this trauma,"" Lisa says. ""I feel responsibility myself because I started doing that work. And I feel that the settlement with Elite sort of halted progress."" Under French law, all of the women have exhausted their statute of limitation -  the time in which they could have pursued a criminal case against Gerald Marie. But Anne-Claire Lejeune, Lisa's lawyer, says she argued with the Paris prosecutor that Lisa was prevented at the time from being able to seek criminal justice and therefore her statute of limitations should be paused in order for an investigation to begin. She says that argument, combined with the number of women making similar accusations against Marie, ultimately convinced the prosecutor to give the go-ahead for a preliminary investigation. ""I had four victims who contacted me last September, who told me their stories, that they were raped - when they were a minor, for some of them, and for others when they were 20 or 22, and they wanted to press charges against Gerald Marie. ""So we submitted their testimonies to the French Prosecutor and he decided to open a preliminary investigation against Gerald Marie for rapes and sexual assault."" Anne-Claire says she has so far spoken with 31 women who have detailed similar accusations against Gerald Marie. She confirms that 14 will be interviewed by French authorities, but the rest are ""not ready to talk officially right now"". ""For women who don't feel ready to talk, they can give their testimony without giving their names. They can stay anonymous during the investigation. They can write to me and I'll submit it to the prosecutor or they can write to the prosecutor directly."" Lisa believes the undercover recordings she gathered for the BBC documentary are evidence of her assault and has requested the footage from her former employer. So far, she says, they have refused to pass it on to her. According to theNew York Times,external, ex model Carrie Otis has launched a separate legal action against Gerald Marie, accusing him of repeatedly raping her in Paris when she was 17. Catherine Donaldson is also going to Paris to give an account of her sexual assault accusation against Gerald Marie. She says in 1985, when she was an aspiring model, he invited her to his apartment after convincing her he was having a party. No-one else turned up, she claims, and Marie offered her drugs, which she declined, before he ""pounced on her"", sexually assaulting her. ""My agent in England knew that this could potentially happen to me in Paris, but as she said, she thought I could handle it,"" says Catherine. ""It was recognised, enough people knew he was doing that. He was allowed."" She later went on to makea film called Couch,external, which was a fictionalised version, she says of her experience with Gerald Marie. Laurie Marsden, who lives in Australia, claims in that 1982, Gerald Marie pushed her onto a bed and attempted to rape her after a party at his flat in Paris. ""One of the questions that people ask is, well, why didn't you report it at the time? And I say that is the wrong question. The question is, why did it take so long for women to be heard, for women to feel comfortable to come forward and tell their stories, for women to be believed and not to be victim blamed?"" In a statement, the BBC said it was ""doing everything"" it could to assist Lisa with her complaint. ""We take these matters very seriously and we know this is distressing for Lisa Brinkworth. We are doing everything we can to help Lisa pursue her complaint with the French authorities. ""Our lawyers have provided documents to the French investigators and to Lisa and we are in continuing discussions with Lisa and her lawyers on how we can help further as the legal process progresses."" Anne-Claire says she believes there are potentially more women, within the statute of limitations, who can contribute to the investigation, but who are unaware that one is being conducted.

Catherine Donaldson is also going to Paris to give an account of her sexual assault accusation against Gerald Marie. She says in 1985, when she was an aspiring model, he invited her to his apartment after convincing her he was having a party. No-one else turned up, she claims, and Marie offered her drugs, which she declined, before he ""pounced on her"", sexually assaulting her. ""My agent in England knew that this could potentially happen to me in Paris, but as she said, she thought I could handle it,"" says Catherine. ""It was recognised, enough people knew he was doing that. He was allowed."" She later went on to makea film called Couch,external, which was a fictionalised version, she says of her experience with Gerald Marie. Laurie Marsden, who lives in Australia, claims in that 1982, Gerald Marie pushed her onto a bed and attempted to rape her after a party at his flat in Paris. ""One of the questions that people ask is, well, why didn't you report it at the time? And I say that is the wrong question. The question is, why did it take so long for women to be heard, for women to feel comfortable to come forward and tell their stories, for women to be believed and not to be victim blamed?"" In a statement, the BBC said it was ""doing everything"" it could to assist Lisa with her complaint. ""We take these matters very seriously and we know this is distressing for Lisa Brinkworth. We are doing everything we can to help Lisa pursue her complaint with the French authorities. ""Our lawyers have provided documents to the French investigators and to Lisa and we are in continuing discussions with Lisa and her lawyers on how we can help further as the legal process progresses."" Anne-Claire says she believes there are potentially more women, within the statute of limitations, who can contribute to the investigation, but who are unaware that one is being conducted. ""That's why my clients want to send a message saying if you have been a victim then please come forward."" Have you been personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

"The UK records another 42,076 coronavirus cases - the highest daily figure for six weeks - and 121 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test The JCVI, the UK government's vaccine advisers, decide not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for all children aged between 12 and 15 But about 200,000 more 12 to 15-year-olds with certain health problems will now be eligible for the vaccines Chief medical officers are now being asked by health secretaries to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating more children They will look at issues such as any effect on education and then advise the UK and devolved governments before a final decision is made One in 75 people in the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 August, the Office for National Statistics estimates The UK is sending four million doses of the Pfizer jab to Australia as part of a Covid vaccine swap deal The EU and AstraZeneca have ended a legal dispute about supply of coronavirus vaccines Edited by James Clarke That's all from us today - your updates have come from Francesca Gillett, Alex Therrien, Doug Faulkner, Vanessa Barford and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news soon. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main stories of the day: Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) member Prof Adam Finn says the decision not to recommend rolling out the vaccine to healthy children under 15 was based on a ""risk-benefit balance"". The professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol says: ""Although the vaccine works and would be beneficial in the sense of preventing infection and some severe disease from Covid, there are significant uncertainties around the safety of the vaccine that have not yet been clarified such that we can't be sure that the risk-benefit balance is sufficiently good in favour and to the benefit of those children to recommend it."" He says the large majority of severe cases in children - and the very small number of deaths in the age group - occurred in children who were ""identifiably at high risk because of other medical conditions"", which is why the vaccine is being rolled out to more of these children. While the JCVI is not recommending jabs for healthy 12 to 15 year olds, 200,000 more in that age group who are vulnerable will be offered a vaccine. This includes those who have chronic heart, lung and liver conditions. Children aged 12 and over who have severe neurodisability, Down's syndrome, a severely weakened immune system or profound and multiple learning difficulties are also recommended two doses of vaccine. Currently under-18s are being given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although the Moderna vaccine hasalso been authorised for use in children in the UK,external. You can fine out morehere. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, says if we are going to vaccinate children it has to be in their interests and ""not in society's interests"". He says it is not an easy decision but says he supports the decision of the JCVI, which he says has given the matter a ""substantial amount of thought"". Prof Hunter says the JCVI has taken different decisions to other countries in the past and points to the 12-week delay it originally recommended between first and second jabs, which he says saved ""many thousands of lives"". He says in the first wave of the pandemic schools played an important part in transmission but as the pandemic has gone on schools being open has had ""a decreasingly important roll in the rollout of the pandemic"". ""Yes, schools almost certainly will be associated with some increase in transmission but it is doubtful that will be a huge impact on the epidemic,"" he says. Additional safety measures in schools will become ""more important"" if all 12 to 15-year-olds are not vaccinated, a teaching union says. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, says: ""If the decision not to vaccinate is upheld by the chief medical officers, this makes additional safety mitigations in schools all the more important. ""Sadly, in taking away so many safety measures last term, without replacing them with others, the government has left schools open to another rise in case counts - which will mean many children and staff missing school if they test positive."" Christina Pagel said the JCVI's decision was  ""out of step"" with most other high-income countries The decision by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation not to recommend Covid vaccines for all 12 to 15-year-olds is ""out of step"" with the stance taken by most other high-income countries, a scientist says. Christina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London, says the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have all recommended vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds. Pagel, a member of the Independent Sage group set up to scrutinise decisions made by the government on coronavirus, says a recent ONS report estimated one in 1,000 children have had long Covid for more than a year. She also pointed toa study,externalthat found the risk of myocarditis - an inflammation of the heart - was greater in people who were infected with Covid versus those who had been vaccinated. ""It doesn't really make any sense to me that we're not trying to protect children from Covid."" The US has vaccinated more than 10 million 12-15-year-olds and France, Italy, Canada and Israel are among other countries vaccinating children. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says he is ""disappointed"" by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) decision not to recommend jabs for healthy 12 to 15-year-olds. He says his union is pleased more children with health vulnerabilities will receive vaccines and that he understands the decision is based on an assessment of the ""balance of risks"". But he says: ""Nevertheless, the upshot is that this would make it more difficult during the autumn term and beyond to guard against educational disruption caused by transmission of the virus."" BBC MonitoringBy Shayan Sardarizadeh A group of anti-vaccine protesters have clashed with police officers during an attempt to break into the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) office in Canary Wharf. The Metropolitan Police says four of its officers have been injured. The group, which calls itself Official Voice, has staged similar protests outside the former BBC Television Centre, ITN Productions, Google and Facebook buildings. Organising its rallies on the Telegram messaging app, the group claims to be against vaccinating children and so-called vaccine passports. The groupâs online presence is also full of debunked conspiracy theories about Covid vaccines, including false claims that mRNA vaccines are a form of âgene therapyâ or that the vaccine is a âdepopulation toolâ for a shadowy global elite. Anti-vaccine protests across the UK have become more frequent and increasingly more aggressive in recent weeks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The latest UK government coronavirus figures are in and there have been a further 42,076 new cases reported. The last time more new daily cases were reported was on 22 July. A further 121 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been reported. Meanwhile, 43,142,747 people have received both doses of a coronavirus vaccine and 5,029251  have received just one dose, as of 2 September. The UK's four chief medical officers are to provide further advice on the vaccination of children aged 12 to 15 with Covid-19 vaccines following the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They are being asked to consider the wider impacts of vaccinating children, such as any impact on education. The JCVI advised the health benefits from vaccination are marginally greater than the potential known harms, but stopped short of recommending vaccinations for all 12 to 15-year-olds. The UK's Health Secretary Sajid Javid says he and the other UK health secretaries have written to the chief medical officers to ask that they consider the vaccination of 12 to 15-year-olds ""from a broader perspective, as suggested by the JCVI"". âWe will then consider the advice from the chief medical officers, building on the advice from the JCVI, before making a decision shortly.â Javid has asked the NHS to put preparations in place to roll out vaccinations to 12 to 15-year-olds, should it be recommended by the chief medical officers. Catherine BurnsHealth correspondent The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has decided to invite another 200,000 12 to 15-year-olds with underlying health problems for Covid vaccines - but has stopped short of extending it to all teenagers. Instead, health minister from all four UK nations will ask their chief medical officers to decide. They will also consider aspects such as the impact on education. This means that about 350,000 12 to 15-year-olds with certain health problems are now eligible for the vaccines. There are more than three million 12 to 15-year-olds in the UK. The vaccine experts did decide the benefits to children do marginally outweigh the risks â but that wasnât enough for them to recommend universal vaccination for this age group. They weighed up the very rare risk of young people developing myocarditis â an inflammation of the heart. In the US, for every million Pfizer second doses given to 12 to 17-year-old boys, around 60 had the condition. It was eight in a million for girls. The Netherlands is among the nations already rolling out Covid jabs to 12 to 15-year-olds The government's vaccine advisers have decided not to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children aged between 12 and 15. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has announced it is widening the so-far limited rollout to more children in this age bracket who have underlying health conditions. But it is not recommending mass vaccination of children aged between 12 and 15. The programme is being extended from what had been considered the most at-risk children, to include children with chronic major heart, lung, kidney, liver and neurological conditions. It means about 200,000 more children will be invited for vaccines. The decision comes exactly a week after the Department of Health and Social Care confirmed preparations were under way to ensure the NHS was ready to offer coronavirus jabs to all 12 to 15-year-olds in England from early September. The department said it wanted to be ""ready to hit the ground running"". The Borders General Hospital is said to be experiencing considerable ongoing pressure A health board in Scotland has extended its suspension of all routine operations for a further three weeks in the face of rising Covid patient numbers. NHS Borders first announced it was stopping such surgery on 11 August. It has now confirmed that, due to ""significant pressure"" at the Borders General Hospital, it will not resume before 26 September. The health board says the decision has not been easy and all patients affected will be contacted directly. Read more. If you're fully vaccinated, you can currently enjoy perks like not having to self-isolate after coming into contact with someone with Covid, and being able to travel abroad without certain restrictions. But from the end of September, the plan is to make proof of your Covid status - for example that you're fully vaccinated or have tested negative - a requirement to get into nightclubs and some other crowded venues in England and Scotland. Today,Scotlandhas just made it easier to proveyour vaccine status by allowing people to download or receive a paper QR code that can be scanned. InEngland, you can download your Covid pass via the NHS app (not the NHS Covid app) if you are registered with a GP, or get it online or by calling 119. InWalesyou can also download the NHS Covid pass, and people inNorthern Irelandcan apply for the certificate online and use it for travel. More details on what to do here. Levels of crime were ""remarkably low"" in Jersey asclubs reopened for the first time, police say. Some of Jersey'slast Covid restrictions were lifted on 26 August, allowing dancing and large gatherings to return. Among those hitting the clubs was Clodagh O'Brien who turned 18 on the day restrictions were lifted in Jersey. ""I've always wanted to go, so I was pretty excited,"" she says. While Jason McDonald, who runs security company JMD Secure, says the bank holiday weekend was ""off-the-walls busy"" but adds ""we had no trouble which was really unbelievable"". We've been hearing today about Scotland now allowing people to download their vaccine certificate as a QR code - like what happens in England. But it's now emerged that a security flaw which allows people to edit their vaccination status certificates has not been fixed - three months after it was first identified. The BBCreported in May how vaccination status details could be alteredusing popular computer software programmes. A fix was rolled out which meant people could only request the document be sent to them by post. But the certificates are available to download again and still editable. BBC Scotland was able to download a certificate and edit it to include a false name, date of birth and the address of the BBC's Glasgow headquarters. Read more here. There are signs that the Delta variant in the US is harming the recovery of the economy. New government data released on Friday showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected in August - with employment rising by 235,000. The figure was well down on the 1.05 million jobs created in July, adding to fears that the recovery from the pandemic may be running out of steam. Despite the disappointing hiring levels, the unemployment rate declined to 5.2% in August from 5.4% the previous month. The dollar fell on foreign exchange markets after the announcement. We've got more here. Earlier we reported on a call from scientists to vaccinate all children over 12. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is still pondering its judgement on whether jabs should be given to healthy children in this age group but there is general agreement that this is a really tricky call to make. The JCVI is focusing squarely on the benefits of vaccination to children themselves - not on how it helps other people. Children's risk from Covid isn't zero but the chances of them becoming seriously ill from Covid are incredibly small. That means there needs to be a clear and obvious advantage to giving them a jab. However,a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccineshas made that calculation a lot more complicated. Here Philippa Roxby takes a look atthe factors the JCVI will have to consider. The England Under-21s football team were due to play Romania in a friendly today but the match has beencancelled after two positive Covid-19 tests in the English camp. The Young Lions did not travel to Bucharest, with the Football Association saying positive tests were reported ""within the party of players and support staff"". Individuals concerned were ""immediately isolated from the rest of the group"". New head coach Lee Carsley had been set to take charge for the first time, having been appointed in July. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi (L) has been holding talks with UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says the UK and Pakistan have a ""shared interest"" in securing a ""stable and peaceful future for Afghanistan"". Mr Raab has met his Pakistani counterpart and the country's prime minister as part of his regional tour. The foreign secretary's visit is part of efforts to secure safe passage for Britons and others trying to leave Afghanistan. It comes as the UK announced Â£30m in aid to bordering countries. The funding will help provide shelter and sanitation for the tens of thousands of refugees expected to flee the Taliban regime. Mr Raab promised the UK would be ""shouldering our humanitarian responsibilities"" to help Afghans, as well as neighbouring countries who are taking in the majority of refugees. Meanwhile, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee -which questioned Mr Raab earlier this week- has announced it will hold an inquiry on UK policy towards Afghanistan. Its chair, Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, said ""big questions remain"" over the UK's withdrawal from the country and its future approach to the region. He added: ""The true extent of the damage done will only become clear in the coming months and years. However, it is already clear that the world has become more dangerous and unstable."" How many Afghan refugees are fleeing? Qatar and Turkey become Taliban's lifeline to the outside world How can the West stop Afghan terror bases? Taliban are back - what next for Afghanistan? In his first visit to Pakistan as foreign secretary, Mr Raab met the country's foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, before holding talks with Prime Minister Imran Khan. In a joint press conference with Mr Qureshi, the foreign secretary said the UK would be ""supporting those countries who face greatest demands from those who may be displaced in the weeks ahead"". Pakistan, which shares a border with Afghanistan, is a key player in the crisis and already hosts about three million Afghan refugees. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Raab said ""no-one wants to see the economic and social fabric of Afghanistan collapse"", but the UK wanted to work with humanitarian agencies to help, rather than the Taliban itself. The two-days of discussions were also expected to focus on how to encourage the Taliban to allow safe passage for refugees and prevent Afghanistan becoming a hub for terrorist groups. The Foreign Office has already sent officials to help process those crossing the border. But Mr Raab has been criticised by MPs for not focusing more on the country. This week, he has been visiting the region to build a coalition with neighbouring countries to ""exert the maximum moderating influence"" on the Taliban. After talks with leaders in Qatar on Thursday,the foreign secretary said evacuations may be able to resume from Kabul airport ""in the near future"". The Afghan capital's airport is out of action following the withdrawal of US troops last week. And on Thursday evening he said he had spoken to Tajikistan foreign minister Sirojiddin Muhriddin about ""how our countries can help maintain stability in the region, and tackle the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan"". Dominic Raab visited Doha in Qatar on Thursday Of the Â£30m in aid offered to neighbouring countries, Mr Raab said Â£10m would be made available immediately to humanitarian organisations in order to get supplies to Afghanistan's borders. Countries predicted to experience a significant increase in refugees will also receive Â£20m to help with processing new arrivals and to provide essential services and supplies. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has estimated a worst-case scenario of more than 500,000 refugees fleeing Afghanistan to Pakistan, Tajikistan, Iran, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan in the coming months. Mr Raab said: ""It is vital that we help those fleeing Afghanistan and do not allow the crisis there to undermine regional stability."" He added that the aid showed the UK's ""commitment to shoulder our humanitarian responsibility"". Afghan refugees are expected to travel to countries including Pakistan More than 15,000 people have been evacuated by the UK from Afghanistan so far, including more than 5,000 British nationals,. The last British plane flying people out of Kabul took off on Saturday, as the remaining foreign troops withdrew from the country. It is feared thousands of people eligible for relocation, including Afghans who worked for the British and their families, have been left behind. Mr Raab has estimated the number of UK nationals still in the country is in the ""low hundreds"" but he was unable to give a precise figure of the number of eligible Afghans who were unable to get on evacuation flights. Last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced an increase in aid to Afghanistan to Â£286m,amid a policy to cut spending on overseas assistance. The UK sent Â£290m of aid to Afghanistan in 2019, according to a briefing from the House of Commons Library, and the government pledged Â£155m in aid for 2021 at the Afghanistan Conference in November 2020.

The Treasury said it was ""stepping in and regulating"" the market so people ""are treated fairly"". Jordan started using Buy Now Pay Later after seeing it advertised on social media apps and on the iPhone app store. He decided to use it to buy a coat for Â£200. ""It was quite cold, it was the winter, and at that point I didn't have a lot of clothes,"" he said. ""I was in a job, and I was able to pay it, but I ended up being quite unfortunate and losing that job."" He bought some other items including a hat, but fell behind with the payments to firms including Laybuy and Klarna. ""It was quite difficult for me to keep on top of it. I went through a lot of anxiety and depression,"" he said, and began to be chased by debt collection agencies. ""They don't give any leeway or ease with it at all,"" he says. ""They call up quite a bit [and email]. It does make me stressed when I'm being constantly called and badgered about it."" ""I think [Buy Now Pay Later] is quite dangerous, to be honest,"" Jordan says. ""Especially on the advertising. They make it out to be such a good thing... but that's only condoning debt."" Jordan has recently moved to Bristol to start a new job, and will be in a position to pay off the debt. Charities sound alarm over buy-now-pay-later debt Buy now, pay later firms such as Klarna face stricter controls Laybuy said: ""Laybuy only refers a customer to a debt collector as a last resort, and only after other attempts to collect the outstanding payment have been exhausted. ""When a debt is referred to a debt collector, we only ever refer outstanding purchase price of the product. ""Late fees, which are limited to a maximum of Â£24 for a single order, are never passed to a debt collector. Laybuy also pays all the cost for debt collection."" Alex Marsh, head of Klarna UK, said: ""At Klarna we only ever use debt collection agencies to help us contact customers we are unable to reach and we do this on fewer than 1% of orders. ""The debt collection agencies we work with are all Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)-authorised and will only contact customers by telephone or email and do not use bailiffs. ""We encourage any of our customers whose circumstances have changed, to please get in touch so we can help you with a plan to get back on track."" Buy Now Pay Later options often appear at checkouts on retailers' websites, and can help spread the cost of purchases, interest-free, potentially avoiding expensive credit. But Citizens Advice said that for many people Buy Now Pay Later can be ""a slippery slope into debt"". It added that it ""fears shoppers have been left unprotected and ill-informed during the rapid expansion of the sector"". ""Not one of the BNPL checkouts on leading retailers' websites warned people they could be referred to debt collectors for missed payments,"" the advice service said. Shoppers were charged Â£39m in late fees in the past year, it estimated. Of those who were referred to a debt collector for missed payments, 96% said there had been negative consequences. Millions of online shoppers have being clicking the buttons to spread the payments, but as the number of users has grown, so have the criticisms. Buy Now Pay Later arrangements aren't viewed as a normal loan by credit reference agencies and other lenders. It becomes a kind of invisible debt to the safety net system, so people with lots of little Buy Now Pay Later debts can get in a mess trying to juggle those payments alongside other loans and interest at the same time. Fears are growing that younger people are being saddled with unnecessary debt, and that those who are already vulnerable are slipping further down the debt spiral. Although the government said in February that they will regulate the sector, they haven't done so yet. These included sleepless nights, ignoring texts, emails and letters in case they were about debts, avoiding answering the door, borrowing money to repay the debt, or deteriorating mental health. Citizens Advice said that a woman aged in her 60s was trying to buy plants online, but struggled to find the postage cost at the checkout and decided to abandon her purchase. The keen gardener was surprised to receive an email saying she had signed up to a buy now pay later agreement, and tried to cancel her order. She told Citizens Advice: ""I really don't understand how I ended up paying for my plants through buy now, pay later. ""I didn't understand what it was. Then I get these threatening emails saying they're going to contact debt collectors, and then I got a letter from a debt collector. ""I couldn't sleep, I lay awake worrying that someone was going to turn up to my house and start taking things. I have a number of health issues and I was worried this was going to make me ill again. It was eventually resolved, but at great stress to me."" Millie Harris, a debt adviser at Citizens Advice East Devon, said: ""My concern is that people aren't processing the fact that buy now pay later is credit. They don't realise there are going to be consequences if they don't pay - it gives them a false sense of security. ""I've seen people using it for their kids' clothes and shoes that they would otherwise never be able to afford. They are taking out what is effectively a loan, but they don't see it as one. ""For example, I helped someone who has tens of thousands of pounds of debt, but they don't see buy now pay later as part of that total. ""It's almost under-the-radar debt."" Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, agrees: ""A seamless buy now pay later checkout process should not mean shoppers have to dig around in the small print to find out they're taking out a credit agreement, and could be referred to debt collectors if they can't pay. The warnings should be unmissable."" Citizens Advice is urging anyone who has been contacted by debt collectors to get free, independent debt advice. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""Buy Now Pay Later can be a helpful way to manage your finances but it's important that consumers are protected as these agreements become more popular. ""By stepping in and regulating, we're making sure people are treated fairly and only offered agreements they can afford."" On 2 February, the government announced it would to bring unregulated interest-free Buy Now Pay Later products into regulation.

"This video can not be played Here we go again! Abba announce a new album and concerts - with a difference Pop legends Abba have surprised and delighted fans by announcing their first studio album for 40 years. Abba Voyage will be released in November, before a ""revolutionary"" set of concerts where virtual avatars will play hits like Mamma Mia and Waterloo. The quartet, who split up in 1982, said they ended up back in the recording studio while working on the stage show. ""At first it was just two songs, and then we said, 'Well, maybe we should do a few others,'"" said Benny Andersson. In the end, they recorded 10 tracks - two of which were premiered during a globally-streamed press conference on Thursday. The band first reconvened in the recording studio in 2018 The first, I Still Have Faith In You, is an affectionate piano ballad portraying the bond the four band members share. ""When Benny played the melody, I just knew it had to be about us,"" said Bjorn Ulvaeus, explaining the song's origins. Do Abba's new songs live up to their hits? Why the UK gave Abba 'nul points' at Eurovision Abba Gold spends record 1,000 weeks in UK chart ""It's about realising that it's inconceivable to be where we are. No imagination could dream up that, to release an album after 40 years and still be the best of friends, and still be enjoying each other's company, and have a total loyalty. ""Who has experienced that? Nobody."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

The second track, Don't Shut Me Down, is a mini-melodrama in the vein of the Abba classic The Day Before You Came, where a woman returns to her partner years after walking out. ""You asked me not to leave, well here I am again - and I love you still,"" sing Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad in their trademark stacked harmonies. Both songs will feature on Abba Voyage when it is released on 5 November, with an eye on the lucrative Christmas market. The record will even include ""a little Christmas tune"", said Benny, as well as ""a number of pop songs"". He added: ""I think it's pretty good. We've done as good as we could, at our age."" Abba's records continue to sell and stream in the millions, almost 40 years after they split up The reunion had, for many years, seemed unlikely. The band reportedly turned down $1bn to tour in 2000. In an interview with the BBC in 2013,Agnetha saidshe preferred to leave Abba in the past. ""It was such a long time ago, and we are getting older, and we have our different lives,"" she explained. In a statement accompanying Thursday's announcement, the singer said she ""had no idea what to expect"" when they finally reconvened in 2018. ""But Benny's recording studio is such a friendly and safe environment, and before I knew it I was really enjoying myself!"" ""It was so joyful to be together in the studio again, the four of us, and hearing Frida and Agnetha going for it again,"" added Benny. But the pianist confessed to having nerves ahead of the initial recording session. ""Five minutes before they came into the studio, I was thinking, 'I should have asked if they can still sing,'"" he said. ""But they could and they can and you will hear it when you listen to the records."" However, neither singer attended the press launch in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. ""They should have been here,"" said Bjorn, half-joking, ""but they don't enjoy this [publicity] as much as Benny does."" The band's new songs will also be played during the band's virtual concert, also titled Abba Voyage, which will open next year in a specially-built arena in east London. Playing six nights a week, it will feature digital versions of Abba's band members, accompanied by a 10-piece live band performing 22 of their greatest hits. Tickets go on sale on 7 September, starting at Â£21, with the opening night on 27 May. Abba's Agnetha comes out of retirement BBC Radio 2's Abba Party The digital Abba show will initially be staged in London, but could tour the world The so-called ""Abba-tars"" were designed by Industrial Light and Magic - the visual effects company founded by Star Wars creator George Lucas. More than 850 people worked on recreating Abba ""in their prime"" using motion capture technology to scan ""every mannerism and every motion"" of the musicians, who are now in their 70s, as they performed. ""Agnetha, Frida, Benny and Bjorn got on stage in front of 160 cameras and almost as many VFX geniuses, and they performed every song in this show, to perfection, over five weeks,"" explained producer Ludvig Andersson. ""So when you see this show, it is not four people pretending to Abba, it is actually them."" Bjorn said the band had chosen London to premiere the show because ""London is the best city to be in when it comes to entertainment, theatre, musicalsâ¦ We have always felt that the Brits see us as their own."" Asked what he enjoyed most about being in Abba, Benny replied with refreshing honesty: ""Not having to worry about the money"". ""It's been a good thing for all of us,"" he continued. ""You are free to do anything. I just keep on writing music."" Here we are in 2021 with the first new Abba material since ET came out and, I'm happy to report, they haven't messed it up. We join Abba not as the pant-suited disco voyeurs of Voulez-Vous and Dancing Queen, but as they are now - in their 70s, reminiscing about their lives, and looking back at the music they made in their prime. The lead track, I Still Have Faith In You, is an ode to their friendship and to the bonds that have matured and survived despite divorce and heartbreak. Starting gently, it builds to an astronomical climax, full of power chords and dazzling harmonies, as the quartet declare: ""Through joy and the sorrow, we have a story and it survived.""

"Social care must be adequately funded, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said, amid reports ministers plan to raise national insurance. Downing Street did not deny reports of an increase of at least 1% to improve social care and tackle the NHS backlog. The justice secretary said he would not ""speculate"" but said there should be a ""grown-up conversation"" about how to pay for rising social care costs. The move would break a Tory manifesto commitment at the last election. ""The British public are sensible enough to know that when it comes to the issue of social care we have to find some way in which it will be adequately funded,"" Mr Buckland told BBC Breakfast. He said that the Conservative Party had also promised at the 2019 election that it would bring forward sustainable proposals to fund social care. The Daily Telegraph reports thatDowning Street favours a 1% rise,externalin the national insurance rate, affecting about 25 million workers and self-employed people, as well as employers. But it says the Treasury is pushing for a 1.25% increase. And the Times adds thatHealth and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid wants a bigger rise of 2%,external. But a source close to Mr Javid said that 2% figure was incorrect and the BBC understands the health secretary is pushing for a lower figure. Ministers urged to act now on social care funding Labour: Why would we oppose a social care tax? For someone on average earnings of Â£29,536 a year, a 1% increase in national insurance would cost them Â£199.68 annually. The Telegraph says the funds will be used to put a cap on the amount an individual has to spend on social care costs over their lifetime. In their manifesto, the Conservatives said: ""The prerequisite of any solution will be a guarantee that no-one needing care has to sell their home to pay for it."" The government said it was ""committed to bringing forward a long-term plan to reform the social care system"". In a statement, it said proposals would be set out this year. Boris Johnson appears to be ready to break one promise in order to keep another. He is considering going against a manifesto commitment not to raise national insurance in order to deliver on his vow to fix social care. If the plan is put forward it will need a hard sell - to the public, most of whom will still pay large amounts towards care, and to Conservative MPs, for whom raising taxes is repellent. How best to look after the elderly, disabled and others needing care is one of society's most pressing questions. How to persuade the public to pay for it is the government's most pressing problem and a huge political challenge. Labour said the NHS and social care needed proper investment but it was wrong to raise national insurance., which would disproportionately hit low-earners, young people and businesses. ""Boris Johnson still hasn't come forward with the plan for social care he promised over two years ago, and instead they're proposing a manifesto-breaking tax rise that would hit working people and businesses hard,"" said shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson. It comes asformer health secretary Jeremy Hunt wrote in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat there should be a new ""health and care premium"" added to tax instead, as he warned against raising national insurance or income tax. Mr Hunt, who now chairs the Commons health committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government must ""bite the bullet"" and find some way to increase taxes. ""The sums are eye-watering, far bigger than a chancellor can find down the back of a Treasury sofa,"" he said. But he said a national insurance increase was the wrong approach because it would not be paid by pensioners. ""Since older people are the biggest beneficiaries I think it's only fair that they should make a contribution,"" Mr Hunt said. National insurance is paid on the profits of self-employed people and the earnings of employees when they exceed Â£9,568 a year. They then pay 12% of their income up to about Â£50,000 a year, when it drops to 2%. That has raised concerns that any rise to national insurance would affect low earners more than high earners. An ageing population means growing demand However, council spending in England is about 3% lower than in 2010 Age UK estimates 1.5 million people in England don't get the help they need The fees local authorities pay for care - in a person's own home or a care home - vary hugely People who don't qualify for free care are often charged more, with no maximum limit on costs There are huge staff shortages - Age UK estimates there are about 45,000 vacancies Nine challenges facing the social care system Boris Johnson has been under increasing pressure to set out his plan for social care reform. Speaking on the steps of Downing Street on his first day as prime minister in 2019, he pledged to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared"". But that plan has yet to be published. On top of long-term funding challenges, the social care sector has also faced extra costs because of the pandemic. Councils, which provide social care, have seen their budgets cut over the last decade. The squeeze on council funding in England means that people who pay for themselves are often propping up the care system. In England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than Â£23,250 can get help from their council. There is no overall limit on costs, meaning thousands every year end up selling their homes to pay. Personal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs. The Scottish National Party said the UK government at Westminster should guarantee Scottish workers would not pay for an ""England-only policy"". Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland. Ministers urged to act now on social care funding Labour: Why would we oppose a social care tax?

"The care system helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing, eating and medication. It is under pressure across the UK after past governments failed to reform or fund the council-run system properly. The pressure on social care during the coronavirus pandemic has led to renewed calls for government action. Onhis first day,externalas prime minister in 2019, Boris Johnson committed to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared"". But that plan has yet to be published - ministers say they will bring forward proposals in 2021. The system is devolved across the four nations, meaning governments need to develop solutions unique to their own region. Unlike the NHS, social care is means-tested. To receive help from your local authority, you must have a very high level of need and, in England and Northern Ireland, savings and assets of less than Â£23,250. In Wales, the threshold is Â£24,000 for non-residential care but Â£50,000 for residential care. Scotland operates a different system. Since 2010, the number of older people asking for council help has increased, but fewer now qualify for support in their own home or in care homes. The charity Age UK estimates there are 1.5 million people in England who need some help with day-to-day life, but do not receive it. Care home residents accounted for almost a third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales up to January 2021, according to analysis by the PA news agency. Meanwhile, staff sickness and problems with personal protective equipment (PPE) supply increased pressure on the care system. The King's Fund says the pandemic has had a""devastating"" impact on the quality of care,external. Despite increasing demand, spending is still 3% lower than a decade ago. The money councils spend on social care comes from: A lump sum from central government that is used to pay for local public services (including social care) Funds raised by councils themselves, mainly from council tax Cuts to funding from central government led to a 17% fall in councils' spending on local public services between 2010 and 2019,according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies,external. Local authorities have generally tried to protect their spending on adult social care, and the government has put in extra short-term money in recent years. The Local Government Association has said councils are under intense financial pressure, particularly since the start of the pandemic. The fees that local authorities pay for care, both in a person's own home or care homes, vary hugely depending on where you live. But across the country, the companies and charities who provide those services complain that councils are not covering the real cost of care. The squeeze on council funding in England means that people who pay for themselves are often propping up the care system. In 2016, the competition regulatorestimated that in care homes,external, self-funders paid significantly more in fees than a local authority resident. Increasingly, care companies warn they would go out of business without private clients subsidising the system. Many of those self-funders will have ended up selling their family home to pay for their care. It is one of the reasons why many view the current system as unfair. The care systems across the UK are increasingly different in the way they operate, with England the least generous. For instance, in Wales, no-one who is eligible for care at home is expected to pay more than Â£100 a week towards it. The systems in Northern Ireland and Scotland are different for support at home and residential care. In Northern Ireland, no-one over the age of 75 pays for home care. Scotland provides free personal care for people who are assessed as needing support at home, whatever their age. In Scottish care homes, people get free care if they have savings or assets of less than Â£18,000. Those with savings and assets of between Â£18,000 and Â£28,750 have to fund part of their care on a sliding scale, while people with more than that have to fund their own care, apart from a Â£193.50 a week contribution towards personal care and Â£87.10 a week towards nursing care. These differences are reflected in the amount of money each nation spends per person on social care. There is no comparable data for Northern Ireland. The UK has an ageing population and the pressures on the care system will only increase. While living longer is considered a positive, many older people will develop health conditions which mean they need help with day-to-day life. For instance, the number of people with dementia in the UK is expected tomore than double to 1.6 million by 2040,external. The Alzheimer's Society has estimated that without local authority help, someone with dementia will typically have to spend Â£100,000 on the care they need. For a long timethey have called this a ""dementia tax"",external, as someone who develops the disease will have to cover their own costs until their assets are reduced to Â£23,250 - the threshold for qualifying for local authority help in England. But the growth in people needing care is fastest among working-age adults, rather than over-65s.  According to the Kings Fund,care for working-age adults is nearly twice as expensive as for older people,external. There is a knock-on effect for the health service if the care system is supporting fewer people, and only those with the highest needs. Someone struggling to cope on their own is more likely to have a fall or neglect themselves, meaning they end up in hospital emergency departments. Then, when they are ready to leave hospital, a lack of social care in the community can lead to them being stuck in a hospital bed for longer than required. This is why experts say the future of the NHS is tied to creating an effective social care system. Finding sufficient people willing to take on the challenging, yet rewarding, work of looking after people in their own home, or in care homes, is a continuing problem. Thelatest official data for England,externalshows there are 112,000 vacancies - over 7% of the social care workforce in England. Nearly a quarter of the 1.5 million people working in the sector are on zero-hours contracts (when employees are not guaranteed a full working week) and pay is often the minimum wage. Many argue that improving the pay and skills of the workforce is vital to encourage people to consider care work as a career. Increasingly, social care workers are carrying out tasks that would once have been done by trained nurses.

""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control.

Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"Alexanda Kotey (file image) An Islamic State (IS) group suspect from the UK has pleaded guilty in a US court to multiple charges relating to the murder of four American hostages. Alexanda Kotey is accused of belonging to an IS cell dubbed ""The Beatles"" which was involved in kidnappings in Iraq and Syria. The IS cell was allegedly responsible for the beheadings of a number of Western and Japanese hostages. Kotey, 37, pleaded guilty to all eight charges and now faces life in prison. He attended a change of plea hearing at a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on Thursday, where he pleaded guilty to charges including hostage taking resulting in death and conspiracy to murder US citizens. ""Kotey has been afforded due process and in the face of overwhelming evidence, he made the independent decision to plead guilty to his crimes,"" lawyer Raj Parekh, a member of the prosecuting team, told reporters outside the court. ""He has agreed to spend the rest of his life in prison,"" he added. Who were the Islamic State 'Beatles'? Profile: Journalist James Foley Profile: Steven Sotloff Kotey and fellow ""Beatle"" El Shafee Elsheikh, 32, are on trial for their involvement in the murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and relief workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller. Both men are also suspected of involvement in the deaths of other hostages, including Alan Henning - a British taxi driver who was delivering aid - and Scottish aid worker David Haines, as well as two Japanese nationals. The pair initially pleaded not guilty at a hearing in October. The change of plea suggests Kotey may now co-operate with prosecutors. It is not yet clear whether Elsheikh has reached a plea deal with authorities. Clockwise from top left: Aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig, and journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley The two men were flown from US custody in Iraq last year to face the charges, which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison. Originally from west London, their alleged IS gang was given its Beatles nickname by hostages due to their British accents. They were stripped of their UK nationality in 2018. Some of the victims were beheaded, with their deaths filmed and broadcast on social media. The high-profile killings triggered outrage around the world. The group's alleged ringleader, Mohammed Emwazi, known as ""Jihadi John"", was killed in a drone strike in 2015. Another gang member, Aine Davis, was arrested and imprisoned in Turkey. Kotey and Elsheikh remained at large until they were captured in 2018 by Syrian Kurds fighting IS. UK sends US evidence on IS 'Beatles' Relatives of British IS hostage braced for trial The US government had wanted to put them on trial but was lacking evidence. The men were in a legal limbo for several months, held by the US military in Iraq where the US attorney general threatened to hand them over to local courts, known for their summary justice and executions. But the US said it would not carry out the death penalty if the men were convicted in a US court. British counter-terrorism officials have since shared crucial evidence with US officials. Elsheikh is scheduled to go on trial in January. Kotey's plea deal, meanwhile, carries a minimum sentence of life without parole. But after 15 years he would be eligible to be transferred to the UK to face any possible charges there. His sentencing is due to take place in March next year.

"The Treasury must ""urgently"" confirm extra funding before councils can start making offers to house Afghan refugees, a document seen by the BBC suggests. It estimates the cost of helping those coming to the UK over the next 10 years could be more than Â£2.5bn. And it suggests a shortfall in the cash committed by Whitehall so far. A government spokesperson said hundreds of Afghan nationals who had worked alongside the British in Afghanistan had already been welcomed to the UK. But Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said it was ""deeply worrying"" that the government was ""failing to step up and play its role in providing national coordination, leadership and support"". The Treasury has been asked to comment on the contents of the leaked document. Council leader shocked at 1,350 empty army homes Where will resettled Afghans live in the UK? How many Afghan asylum seekers has the UK taken in? Thousands of people have fled Afghanistansince the country fell to the Taliban in August, as US and UK troops withdrew their forces after 20 years on the ground. Around 15,000 people eligible to come to the UK were evacuated in the final two weeks, including 8,000 Afghans who had worked alongside British forces. But the government has admittedit cannot be precise with how many others were left behind. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is in the regionto try to negotiate safe passage through neighbouring countries for Britons and others still trying to leave Afghanistan. Speaking at a press conference in Pakistan, he pledged Â£30m in aid to bordering countries taking in the majority of the refugees, to help provide shelter and sanitation. And he promised the UK would be ""shouldering our humanitarian responsibilities"" to help. The government is talking to councils about how many people could be resettled in their areas when they reach the UK, calling for a fair distribution across the country. This call was echoed in a joint statement by council leaders in Greater Manchester, including its mayor, Labour's Andy Burnham, who said ""every part of the country needs to take a share of the responsibility across all schemes, asylum and resettlement"" - rather than areas with lower house prices accommodating ""far higher numbers of those seeking sanctuary"". The leaked document - Afghan Resettlement: Domestic Support Offer and Funding Requirements - was discussed by ministers on Wednesday. It said just under Â£400m has been allocated so far to help resettle those who had fled the country, but an extra Â£557m could be needed over the next three years. Left behind in Afghanistan: If I canât get out, Iâll die Afghans who worked for UK can stay permanently The government intends to provide funding to local authorities to accommodate Afghans, and the document says relocation costs were a ""substantial - but necessary - offer of support"". Ministers met to discuss resettling plans on Friday before holding a meeting with local authority leaders, telling them to see ""no offer of housing and support as too small"". But the BBC understands the councils were not given confirmation of how much funding they would receive. This video can not be played Getting the plane out of Afghanistan was the ""happiest moment of my life"" Among the councils offering support, Walsall Council in the West Midlands has taken in 69 evacuees so far and says it hopes to house up to 120. Mike Bird, the council leader, said it was a difficult task, housing families with children who needed school places. ""With children going back to school, and the pressure on school places, that in itself is something the government don't seem to be taking into account,"" he said. ""We've got the whole of the UK that should be considered. If only one [some] councils are coming forward... then the government have got to step in and make sure it does happen."" One refugee, Ahmed, whose real name is not being used, arrived in the UK from Kabul with his wife and six children in July. He told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme this week about the challenges his family faced. ""We have been living in hotels for quite a while now in larger groups and it's becoming tougher and tougher, so it's time for us to move to a proper house,"" he said. ""That is the overarching concern we are having, because we can't have a bank account."" Schemes for people fleeing the country include the existing Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) for Afghans who worked with the UK government and a new Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) for vulnerable people. Funding models for the resettlement schemes are still being developed, but initial proposals suggested the figures would be based on 5,000 Afghans arriving under the ACRS scheme per year (capped at 20,000 people) at a cost of Â£715m, 5,000 arriving under the UK Resettlement Scheme each year at a cost of Â£1.65bn, and 7,000 arriving under the ARAP scheme in 2021-2 at a cost of Â£190m. The document also suggested that while some refugees would require more support than others, local authorities should be given a set amount per person housed to make their funding easier to plan. It recommended local authorities should be given Â£20,520 per person split over three years, plus more for education costs. It also recommended extra healthcare funding of Â£3,200 per person and Â£15m funding per year to ""international partners"" to support resettlement in third countries. These initial funding proposals suggest the costs would reach Â£187m in 2021/2 and Â£975m over the course of this spending review period - which lasts until 2024/5. But the document said that with just under Â£400m of this funding already committed, there would be a shortfall of approximately Â£557m, so confirmation of further funding from the Treasury will be required ""urgently"". Labour's Mr Thomas-Symonds accused ministers of being ""disastrously complacent"" throughout the crisis in Afghanistan. He said: ""Councils across the country want to do the right thing, so it's deeply worrying that the UK government is failing to step up and play its role in providing national coordination, leadership and support."" The shadow home secretary called on the prime minister to urgently set out details on how promised funding would be spent to ""allow Afghan people who have been through hellish experiences rebuild their lives here"". Border Force staff were assisting Afghan refugees on their arrival from Afghanistan A spokesperson from the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said that the government was calling on all councils who had not yet offered, to come forward with offers of support. ""Thanks to the efforts of nearly a third of Britain's councils and vital delivery partners, hundreds of Afghan nationals who have worked alongside our Armed Forces and diplomats in Afghanistan, risking their lives supporting us, have already been warmly welcomed to the country,"" they said. ""Councils in England, Scotland and Wales will have access to a share of an additional Â£5m to help them provide the necessary housing and support to Afghans who have worked for this country in Afghanistan, but who now face threats of persecution or worse.""

"An anti-Taliban machine-gunner in Panjshir on Thursday Heavy fighting is reported between Taliban forces and resistance fighters in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley. The Taliban said they had taken some territory and inflicted ""heavy"" losses on the National Resistance Front (NRF). But the NRF said it had control of all entrances to the valley, and the Taliban had lost hundreds of fighters. Panjshir is the only province that has not fallen to the Islamist group and thousands of opposition fighters are believed to have massed there. The resistance - which includes former Vice-President Amrullah Saleh, former Afghan security force members and local militias - is led by local tribal leader Ahmad Massoud. Massoud's father held off the Soviets in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s. Panjshir - the valley trying to hold off the Taliban Meanwhile US President Joe Biden visited troops who were injured in a devastating bomb attack at Kabul airport as they helped to evacuate Americans and Afghans from the country. Thirteen US soldiers were among some 170 people killed. This video can not be played Watch: Bodies of US troops returned to America He made the visit four days after the last American soldiers left Afghanistan, where the Western-backed government had crumbled in the face of a Taliban offensive this summer. Biden is inside a military hospital here in Maryland, visiting the wounded. I travelled with him in the motorcade, along with about a dozen other journalists who are part of a press pool. No-one was allowed to say where the president was going, and his visit remained a secret until until we arrived at the hospital. Now that he is here, the news of his visit can be disclosed. Biden has been criticised for his decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and for the way that he has overseen the events of the past few weeks. His visit to the hospital is a way for him to pay tribute to the sacrifices that people have made. It is also a reminder of the cost of war, and why he said the US should leave Afghanistan. White House officials carried big bouquets of flowers inside the hospital, to help brighten the rooms of the injured men and women. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that fighters had moved into the Panjshir Valley after negotiations failed, Reuters news agency reports. Talks failed because the two sides held very different positions, BBC Persian quoted NRF spokesman Fahim Dashti as saying. He said they were fighting the Taliban on two fronts and that 350 Taliban fighters had been killed and a number captured. Claims from either side are difficult to verify. Reprisals cast doubts over the Taliban's amnesty Taliban are back - what next for Afghanistan? Reports of Taliban fighters searching for, and killing, people such as senior police officials and government officials  contradict the more moderate image the group sought to portray when it took control of the country.

"Discarded nitrous oxide cartridges litter the beach promenade in Bournemouth The unlawful possession of laughing gas could be made a crime in England and Wales. Ministers have asked independent advisers to review the harm caused by nitrous oxide. Usually sold in small silver canisters and inhaled, it is the second most-used drug among young adults. Home Secretary Priti Patel wants the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) to review the harm caused by nitrous oxide. She said was prepared to take ""tough action"" and introduce further restrictions. But drugs experts said the move was ""completely pointless"" and a ""waste of time"". Sold legally, nitrous oxide is used for medical and commercial uses, such as making whipped cream - but is illegal when sold as a psychoactive drug. When inhaled, the gas can cause elation and hallucinations. According to the Office for National Statistics, there were 36 deaths in Great Britain associated with nitrous oxide between 2001 and 2016. Ms Patel said: ""Misusing drugs can have a devastating impact on lives and communities. We are determined to do all we can to address this issue and protect the futures of our children and young people."" She added that if the ACMD recommended further restrictions, she would be ""ready to take tough action"". ""Should the expert ACMD recommend further restrictions on this drug, we stand ready to take tough action."" Arrests after 1,800 laughing gas canisters found Young chess players 'killed by laughing gas' MP proposes laughing gas sale restrictions How dangerous is laughing gas? But former ACMD chairman Professor David Nutt, who was sacked in 2009 after claiming that ecstasy and LSD were less dangerous than alcohol, called the move a ""gimmick"". Prof Nutt, founder of the charity Drug Science, said it was ""completely symptomatic of the utterly blinkered perspective that this Government has on drugs"". He added: ""This is completely pointless, an utter distraction. This is pretence of doing something about drug problems, but focusing on a drug that has very, very little harm - way less harm than alcohol - and they should be investing their money on people who are dying of drugs like fentanyl and heroin."" Another leading drugs expert called the move a ""waste of time"" and said criminalising possession ""would likely lead to illicit sales"". Adam Winstock, a consultant psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialist, said: ""Asking for evidence is great but the ACMD advice comes framed by the current home secretary's preconceived notion that a problem related to drug use can be successfully addressed by making something illegal. ""This is palpably and evidentially false. But making a drug with minimal risk to most users illegal will add the risk of criminality to all."" But ministers have faced cross-party pressure to tighten the regulations on the sale of nitrous oxide. Labour MP Rosie Duffield told a Commons debate in 2020 that recreational use had become ""much more prevalent"" during the pandemic. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds welcomed the review, saying it was right to ""assess the harm"". But he added: However, this will not be an answer to the terrible impact Conservative cuts to policing have caused.""

"UK residents are hoarding an estimated Â£50m in loose change, with little sign of it all being spent as Covid restrictions ease. Nearly six in 10 people are holding coins at home, according to a survey by banking trade body UK Finance. People tend to hold on to 1p, 2p, 5p and 10p coins. The findings have prompted pleas for this money to be given to charity, as cash donations dropped during the Covid crisis. UK Finance data suggests that people have been holding on to cash three times longer than they used to owing, in part, to the coronavirus lockdowns. Contactless card limit to rise to Â£100 in October No new 2p or Â£2 coins to be made for 10 years Many retailers and entertainment venues were shut, and some shops have encouraged the use of contactless payments over cash. The research said that cash use had risen - notably among 35 to 54-year-olds - as restrictions were eased. ""It is clear that with the reopening of the economy there has been some degree of revival in cash transactions,"" it said. Adrian Buckle, head of research at UK Finance, told the BBC that when people received a high-value coin in change, such as a Â£1 or Â£2 coin, they tended to carry it with them and spend it. However, when it came to a low-value coin, ""seven out of 10 of us will drop it in a pot at home and we forget about them"". With those coins disappearing from circulation, more had to be manufactured to replace them, with the cost reaching Â£50m last year, he said. Pocket money is a popular reason to keep cash at home The stash of low-value coins in people's homes still showed little chance of being spent in the next two or three months, the report suggested. Among the 1,000 people surveyed, most tended to hoard cash primarily for security, but also to pay friends and neighbours for shopping, for gifts and for pocket money. Although the amounts held tended to be below Â£100, this could have an impact on the way cash flowed around the economy, the report said. UK Finance said this raised questions about the mix of coins in circulation in the UK. Two years ago, the Treasury said that 1p and 2p coinswould continue to be used ""for years to come"". ""Industry and policymakers may need to actively encourage greater recycling of hoarded cash to avoid significant wastage to the UK economy,"" the report said. One way to do that was by urging people to give loose change to charity, it said. The Charities AidÂ Foundation found that more than half the charities theyÂ spoke toÂ last yearÂ had seen a drop in donations.Â That coincided with four in 10 charities reporting increased demand for help from those in need.Â ""Cash donations to charities, normally the country's most popular way of giving, saw a substantial decline during 2020 and remain at very low levels compared to previous years,"" said Neil Heslop, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation. ""As charities struggle to resume fundraising, while continuing to work on the frontlines of the response to the pandemic, donating spare loose change would be a huge show of much-needed support at a critical time.""

"Japan's prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, has said he will not run for re-election as party leader this month, signalling the end of his tenure. Mr Suga had been appointed to the role just a year ago following the resignation of Shinzo Abe. The shock announcement comes as Mr Suga's approval ratings dropped to an all-time low. Japan - which is still under a state of emergency - is now grappling with its worst ever Covid wave. The country, which has now seen more than 1.5 million virus cases, has also seen a slow vaccination roll out. The decision to host the Olympics Games this year despite the worsening pandemic also proved to be hugely unpopular. ""Today at the executive meeting, [Mr] Suga said he wants to focus his efforts on anti-coronavirus measures and will not run in the leadership election,"" said the secretary general of Mr Suga's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), according to an AFP report. ""Honestly, I'm surprised. It's truly regrettable. He did his best but after careful consideration, he made this decision,"" he said. Japanese shares rose sharply on the news, with the broad Topix stock index closing up by 1.6% after hitting its highest level in three decades. Tokyo's financial markets had made gains already this week on hopes for a stronger government ahead of the ruling party's leadership race and a general election later in the year. The ruling LDP is due to hold an election on Sept 29 to pick its president. The winner of the leadership election is widely expected to be Japan's leader as the LDP holds a parliamentary majority. Yoshihide Suga: The 'right-hand man' who became PM The 72-year-old, who was born to a family of strawberry farmers, was first elected to the Yokohama City Council in 1987, and in 1996 he was elected to Japan's Diet for the first time. In 2005, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi appointed him senior vice minister of internal affairs and communication. The following year, Mr Koizumi's successor Shinzo Abe promoted him to minister with three cabinet posts, which he held until 2007.

"Northern Ireland gets most of its medicines from GB distributors The health minister has warned of a risk to patients if pharmaceutical firms go ahead with plans to withdraw medicines due to the Northern Ireland Protocol. NI gets most of its medicines from distributors in Great Britain, but is still covered by EU medicines rules. That will make exporting medicines from GB to NI more difficult in January when a Protocol ""grace period"" ends. The health department has been notified 910 medicines are due to be withdrawn. Afurther 2,400 are at risk. There is no immediate risk to supplies and the health department has previously said people don't need to change their prescribing behaviour. Medicines suppliers must give six months notice when they intend to withdraw a product. In a briefing paper, which has been circulated among ministers and senior officials in recent days, Stormont's Health Minister Robin Swann said he now had ""deep concerns about the risk to patient health and maintaining vital medical supplies"". He is calling for a ""standstill"" which would mean an extension of the grace period. What next for the Northern Ireland Protocol? More than 2,000 medicines face withdrawal over Protocol Some medicines could be withdrawn due to protocol The paper said the planned withdrawals ""cover all classifications of medicines, including prescription-only medicines, pharmacy and general sales list medicines"". Almost 90% of the confirmed withdrawals are classified as high risk, meaning there is the potential for disruption and the need for some form of mitigation. That mitigation could mean using alternative products or seeking alternative sources of supply. Mr Swann supports a UK government proposal to remove medicines from the Protocol The major issues are the need for additional batch testing for medicines moving from GB to NI and continued compliance with the EU's falsified medicines directive. Earlier this year the British Generic Manufacturers Association (BGMA) said these issues would make it commercially unviable to sell some products in Northern Ireland. The EU has proposed measures to ease the problembut the UK government is sceptical about whether they are enough. Instead the UK has proposed that medicines should be completely removed from the scope of the Protocol with an extension of the grace period until that can be agreed. But the two sides have not yet agreed on a way forward. Mr Swann supports the UK government proposal to remove medicines from the Protocol but it is not clear if other Northern Ireland Executive parties share that view. Stormont health committee chairman Colm Gildernew said there were issues of ""huge concern"" that required a ""focused piece of work"". When asked on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme if he supported Mr Swann's position that the best solution was to remove medicines from the scope of the protocol, Mr Gildernew said he was not clear on the potential impact of a joint position by the Executive but would meet with the minister to discuss the issue. He said he believed the issue was ""too important for unilateral action"" and said he wanted ""dedicated and urgent bilateral negotiations building on the good will that exists"". The Sinn FÃ©in MLA said no one wanted to see medicines interrupted and that he understood the concerns and the uncertainty around it. ""I think this needs to be negotiated in good faith with the European Union. I believe all solutions need to be kept on the table but it is absolutely crucial that good will is maintained,"" he said. Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said the warning from Robin Swann should be a ""wake-up call"" for the EU and the UK government. ""This isn't scaremongering - it is the practical out-workings of the NI Protocol and there is a practical solution,"" he said. ""There is no immediate shortage of medicines, but if action isn't taken now that is exactly what we could be facing come the new year."" The DUP MLA Jonathan Buckley called the situation a ""fiasco"" and said it was ""immoral, unjustifiable and cannot be tolerated."" He added: ""The imposition of the protocol impacts and harms every single person in Northern Ireland.  It should be opposed by everyone."" Community pharmacist Peter Rice, deputy chair of Community Pharmacy Northern Ireland, said he wanted to reassure patients that they did not see an immediate concern with medicine supply. He said the situation was evolving and they were working to ensure Northern Ireland has parity and equal access to medication with the rest of the UK. Speaking on Good Morning Ulster, he said they intended to continue to ""work tirelessly"" so patients do not need to be concerned. It is the deal agreed by the UK and EU to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. It does this by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. This means goods don't have to checked as they cross the Irish border, instead some checks and controls are required on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. This has caused difficulties for some businesses and is opposed by unionist parties in Northern Ireland, which say it undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position as part of the UK. In July the UK published a ""command paper"" proposing radical changes to the protocol but the EU says it will not renegotiate.

"This video can not be played NZ PM Jacinda Ardern: ""This was a violent attack. It was senseless"" Police in New Zealand shot and killed a ""violent extremist"" after he stabbed and wounded at least six people in an Auckland supermarket. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the incident was a ""terrorist attack"" carried out by a Sri Lankan national who was under police surveillance. The man, who has not been officially named, was a supporter of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group, she said. Police killed the man within 60 seconds of the attack on Friday. ""What happened today was despicable, it was hateful it was wrong,"" Ms Ardern said in a news conference. ""It was carried out by an individual, not a faith."" Of the six wounded people, three are in a critical condition and one is in a serious condition, health officials say. ""The hospital staff are doing everything they can to preserve their lives,"" Auckland Mayor Phil Goff told the BBC. ""We're all horrified by what's happened. But... justice came pretty swiftly for the offender,"" he added. It happened at the Countdown supermarket at LynnMall in the Auckland district of New Lynn on Friday afternoon. Police commissioner Andrew Coster said a surveillance team and a specialist tactics group had followed the man from his home to the supermarket. But while there were concerns about the him, officials said they had no reason to think he was planning an attack on Friday, and the team believed he was going to do his grocery shopping. After entering the store, however, the attacker got hold of a knife and went on a stabbing spree. New Zealand's PM say incident at supermarket was a ""terrorist attack"" Shopper Michelle Miller told local news outlet Stuff that the man was ""running around like a lunatic"" and attacking people. ""All I heard was a lot of screaming,"" she said. ""[People were] running out, hysterically, just screaming, yelling, scared,"" another witness said, adding that he saw an elderly man lying on the ground with a stab wound. Witnesses also said the attacker had shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). Mr Coster said police rushed over upon hearing the commotion and shot and killed the attacker when he charged at the officers with the knife. Footage from the supermarket shared online showed people fleeing before the sound of gun shots could be heard. Analysis by Phil Mercer, BBC News This callous act in Auckland will stir painful memories of the deadly mosque attacks in Christchurch in 2019. In that attack, a lone gunman - a self-confessed white supremacist - murdered 51 worshippers.  Once again, New Zealand's geographic isolation and peaceful reputation have proved to be no defence against extremism. The assailant had, for years, been identified as a threat to national security and was under 24-hour surveillance. The police acted decisively to prevent further carnage, but they weren't close enough to stop serious injuries.  New terror laws could, however, allow volatile individuals to be detained in the future. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has sent a message of support: Kia Kaha New Zealand, he wrote, using Maori words. Stay strong. The man, whose identity cannot be revealed due to court suppression orders, arrived in New Zealand in October 2011. He became a person of national security interest in 2016. He had been under round-the-clock monitoring and heavy surveillance due to concerns about his ideology. He was known to multiple agencies, and was also on a terror watchlist. Local media reports said the attacker was 32 years old and had recently been sentenced to one year of supervision for possessing IS propaganda. Prosecutors had accused him of plotting a ""lone wolf"" terror attack using knives, but the judge ruled that planning a terror attack was not in itself an offence under existing laws, the reports said. His internet search history and bookmarks included heroes of Isis, Islamic State dress, and New Zealand prison clothes and food, according to Stuff. Ms Ardern said that until Friday, he had not committed any offence. When asked about the man's motivations, she said they were ""Isis-inspired"". Questions have been raised about why action against him was not taken before six people were injured - especially since he was under close surveillance. ""The reality is, that when you are surveilling someone on a 24/7 basis, it is not possible to be immediately next to them at all times. The staff intervened as quickly as they could and they prevented further injury in what was a terrifying situation,"" said Mr Coster. He added that the attacker was very surveillance-conscious, and that teams needed to maintain a distance to be effective. Authorities are confident the attacker was acting alone and that there is no further danger to the community, according to Mr Coster. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

New terror laws could, however, allow volatile individuals to be detained in the future. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has sent a message of support: Kia Kaha New Zealand, he wrote, using Maori words. Stay strong. The man, whose identity cannot be revealed due to court suppression orders, arrived in New Zealand in October 2011. He became a person of national security interest in 2016. He had been under round-the-clock monitoring and heavy surveillance due to concerns about his ideology. He was known to multiple agencies, and was also on a terror watchlist. Local media reports said the attacker was 32 years old and had recently been sentenced to one year of supervision for possessing IS propaganda. Prosecutors had accused him of plotting a ""lone wolf"" terror attack using knives, but the judge ruled that planning a terror attack was not in itself an offence under existing laws, the reports said. His internet search history and bookmarks included heroes of Isis, Islamic State dress, and New Zealand prison clothes and food, according to Stuff. Ms Ardern said that until Friday, he had not committed any offence. When asked about the man's motivations, she said they were ""Isis-inspired"". Questions have been raised about why action against him was not taken before six people were injured - especially since he was under close surveillance. ""The reality is, that when you are surveilling someone on a 24/7 basis, it is not possible to be immediately next to them at all times. The staff intervened as quickly as they could and they prevented further injury in what was a terrifying situation,"" said Mr Coster. He added that the attacker was very surveillance-conscious, and that teams needed to maintain a distance to be effective. Authorities are confident the attacker was acting alone and that there is no further danger to the community, according to Mr Coster. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

"Social care must be adequately funded, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said, amid reports ministers plan to raise national insurance. Downing Street did not deny reports of an increase of at least 1% to improve social care and tackle the NHS backlog. The justice secretary said he would not ""speculate"" but said there should be a ""grown-up conversation"" about how to pay for rising social care costs. The move would break a Tory manifesto commitment at the last election. ""The British public are sensible enough to know that when it comes to the issue of social care we have to find some way in which it will be adequately funded,"" Mr Buckland told BBC Breakfast. He said that the Conservative Party had also promised at the 2019 election that it would bring forward sustainable proposals to fund social care. The Daily Telegraph reports thatDowning Street favours a 1% rise,externalin the national insurance rate, affecting about 25 million workers and self-employed people, as well as employers. But it says the Treasury is pushing for a 1.25% increase. And the Times adds thatHealth and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid wants a bigger rise of 2%,external. But a source close to Mr Javid said that 2% figure was incorrect and the BBC understands the health secretary is pushing for a lower figure. Ministers urged to act now on social care funding Labour: Why would we oppose a social care tax? For someone on average earnings of Â£29,536 a year, a 1% increase in national insurance would cost them Â£199.68 annually. The Telegraph says the funds will be used to put a cap on the amount an individual has to spend on social care costs over their lifetime. In their manifesto, the Conservatives said: ""The prerequisite of any solution will be a guarantee that no-one needing care has to sell their home to pay for it."" The government said it was ""committed to bringing forward a long-term plan to reform the social care system"". In a statement, it said proposals would be set out this year. Boris Johnson appears to be ready to break one promise in order to keep another. He is considering going against a manifesto commitment not to raise national insurance in order to deliver on his vow to fix social care. If the plan is put forward it will need a hard sell - to the public, most of whom will still pay large amounts towards care, and to Conservative MPs, for whom raising taxes is repellent. How best to look after the elderly, disabled and others needing care is one of society's most pressing questions. How to persuade the public to pay for it is the government's most pressing problem and a huge political challenge. Labour said the NHS and social care needed proper investment but it was wrong to raise national insurance., which would disproportionately hit low-earners, young people and businesses. ""Boris Johnson still hasn't come forward with the plan for social care he promised over two years ago, and instead they're proposing a manifesto-breaking tax rise that would hit working people and businesses hard,"" said shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson. It comes asformer health secretary Jeremy Hunt wrote in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat there should be a new ""health and care premium"" added to tax instead, as he warned against raising national insurance or income tax. Mr Hunt, who now chairs the Commons health committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government must ""bite the bullet"" and find some way to increase taxes. ""The sums are eye-watering, far bigger than a chancellor can find down the back of a Treasury sofa,"" he said. But he said a national insurance increase was the wrong approach because it would not be paid by pensioners. ""Since older people are the biggest beneficiaries I think it's only fair that they should make a contribution,"" Mr Hunt said. National insurance is paid on the profits of self-employed people and the earnings of employees when they exceed Â£9,568 a year. They then pay 12% of their income up to about Â£50,000 a year, when it drops to 2%. That has raised concerns that any rise to national insurance would affect low earners more than high earners. An ageing population means growing demand However, council spending in England is about 3% lower than in 2010 Age UK estimates 1.5 million people in England don't get the help they need The fees local authorities pay for care - in a person's own home or a care home - vary hugely People who don't qualify for free care are often charged more, with no maximum limit on costs There are huge staff shortages - Age UK estimates there are about 45,000 vacancies Nine challenges facing the social care system Boris Johnson has been under increasing pressure to set out his plan for social care reform. Speaking on the steps of Downing Street on his first day as prime minister in 2019, he pledged to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared"". But that plan has yet to be published. On top of long-term funding challenges, the social care sector has also faced extra costs because of the pandemic. Councils, which provide social care, have seen their budgets cut over the last decade. The squeeze on council funding in England means that people who pay for themselves are often propping up the care system. In England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than Â£23,250 can get help from their council. There is no overall limit on costs, meaning thousands every year end up selling their homes to pay. Personal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs. The Scottish National Party said the UK government at Westminster should guarantee Scottish workers would not pay for an ""England-only policy"". Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland. Ministers urged to act now on social care funding Labour: Why would we oppose a social care tax?

"An anti-Taliban machine-gunner in Panjshir on Thursday Heavy fighting is reported between Taliban forces and resistance fighters in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley. The Taliban said they had taken some territory and inflicted ""heavy"" losses on the National Resistance Front (NRF). But the NRF said it had control of all entrances to the valley, and the Taliban had lost hundreds of fighters. Panjshir is the only province that has not fallen to the Islamist group and thousands of opposition fighters are believed to have massed there. The resistance - which includes former Vice-President Amrullah Saleh, former Afghan security force members and local militias - is led by local tribal leader Ahmad Massoud. Massoud's father held off the Soviets in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s. Panjshir - the valley trying to hold off the Taliban Meanwhile US President Joe Biden visited troops who were injured in a devastating bomb attack at Kabul airport as they helped to evacuate Americans and Afghans from the country. Thirteen US soldiers were among some 170 people killed. This video can not be played Watch: Bodies of US troops returned to America He made the visit four days after the last American soldiers left Afghanistan, where the Western-backed government had crumbled in the face of a Taliban offensive this summer. Biden is inside a military hospital here in Maryland, visiting the wounded. I travelled with him in the motorcade, along with about a dozen other journalists who are part of a press pool. No-one was allowed to say where the president was going, and his visit remained a secret until until we arrived at the hospital. Now that he is here, the news of his visit can be disclosed. Biden has been criticised for his decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and for the way that he has overseen the events of the past few weeks. His visit to the hospital is a way for him to pay tribute to the sacrifices that people have made. It is also a reminder of the cost of war, and why he said the US should leave Afghanistan. White House officials carried big bouquets of flowers inside the hospital, to help brighten the rooms of the injured men and women. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that fighters had moved into the Panjshir Valley after negotiations failed, Reuters news agency reports. Talks failed because the two sides held very different positions, BBC Persian quoted NRF spokesman Fahim Dashti as saying. He said they were fighting the Taliban on two fronts and that 350 Taliban fighters had been killed and a number captured. Claims from either side are difficult to verify. Reprisals cast doubts over the Taliban's amnesty Taliban are back - what next for Afghanistan? Reports of Taliban fighters searching for, and killing, people such as senior police officials and government officials  contradict the more moderate image the group sought to portray when it took control of the country.
