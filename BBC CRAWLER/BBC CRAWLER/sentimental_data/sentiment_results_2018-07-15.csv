"This video can not be played Theresa May reveals the advice President Trump gave her over Brexit Donald Trump told Theresa May she should sue the EU rather than negotiate over Brexit, she has told the BBC. The US president said on Friday at a joint news conference he had given Mrs May a suggestion - but she had found it too ""brutal"". Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr what he had said, she replied: ""He told me I should sue the EU - not go into negotiations."" It came as another government member resigned over her Brexit plans. Robert Courts said he quit as a parliamentary private secretary - an unpaid ministerial aide - at the Foreign Office to ""express discontent"" with Mrs May's policy before key Brexit votes on Monday. ""I had to think who I wanted to see in the mirror for the rest of my life,"" he said in tweet. He could not tell his constituents he supported Mrs May's proposals ""in their current form,"" he added. Mr Courts replaced David Cameron as the Conservative MP for Witney, Oxfordshire in 2016. PM warns party not to put Brexit at risk Trump: US-UK trade deal 'absolutely possible' Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan Defending her Brexit blueprint on the Andrew Marr show, the prime minister said it would allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations, end free movement of people, and end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. AWhite Paper,externalpublished on Thursday fleshed out details of her plan, which advocates close links with the EU on trade in goods, but not services. Before the paper was published, Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson resigned, along with several junior government figures, saying it would not deliver the Brexit people voted for in the 2016 referendum. This video can not be played Prime Minister Theresa May and US President Donald Trump hold a joint press conference at Chequers Mrs May laughed off the president's legal action suggestion, but added: ""Interestingly, what the president also said at that press conference was 'don't walk away'. ""Don't walk away from those negotiations because then you'll be stuck. So I want us to be able to sit down to negotiate the best deal for Britain."" Donald Trump declined to spell out what his advice to Mrs May had been, in an interview with US TV network CBS, but added: ""Maybe she'll take it, it's something she could do if she wanted to. ""But it was strong advice. And I think it probably would have worked."" Ahead of his meeting with Mrs May, Mr Trumptold the Sun newspaper,externalher Brexit proposals would ""probably kill"" a trade deal with his country. But hours later he said a US-UK trade deal would ""absolutely be possible"". This video can not be played Jacob Rees-Mogg tells the BBC the prime minister's Brexit plan goes against promises she made Leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has called the White Paper a ""bad deal for Britain"". He told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""The government unfortunately believes that Brexit is not a good thing in itself, it seems to think it has to be tempered by non-Brexit."" He said Mrs May, who campaigned to keep Britain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, had failed to grasp the ""enormously positive"" opportunities offered. He described her as a ""Remainer who has remained a Remainer"". He also said she would have to change her policy in order to get it through Parliament, without having to rely on Labour votes. Mrs May urged Brexiteers in her own party to ""keep their eye on the prize"" of Brexit - and said her plan was the only workable way to deliver it. Analysis by BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman Frankly, it is difficult to see any grounds for the UK suing the EU. Like any other member state, the UK can sue the EU in relation to any specific measure it has taken which breaches EU law. Such action would be heard at the European Court of Justice, the ultimate arbiter of EU law. An example would be if the UK was denied agricultural subsidies, or structural funds to which it was entitled under EU law. The Conservative government of David Cameron successfully sued when the European Central Bank said it would only license financial institutions within the Eurozone as clearing houses for transactions in euros. The UK and the EU have not reached a Brexit agreement yet, so there can be no action for breach of that agreement. Parties to a negotiation are under what are known as ""procedural duties"" - for instance, to act in good faith. But it is very difficult to bring an action, within a negotiation, on that basis. Some would say that even attempting to do so would seriously harm the negotiation. Mrs May's message comes ahead of crucial Commons votes on trade and customs policy in the coming week, with Tory Brexiteers tabling a series of amendments to the legislation. Mr Rees-Mogg said he was not expecting either the Customs Bill or the Trade Bill to be voted down at this stage. There are also likely to be amendments tabled by Remain supporting MPs. Reality Check: What does the Brexit White Paper reveal? Commons Brexit battles previewed Mrs May told Andrew Marr: ""Some people are saying they want to vote in the Trade Bill to keep us in the customs union. I say that's not acceptable, that's not what the British people voted for. ""Others are saying that perhaps we cannot have the bill at all. That would be damaging to our 'no deal' preparations. ""So let's just keep our eyes on the prize here. The prize is delivering leaving the European Union in a way that's in our national interest."" This video can not be played Theresa May faced questions on Brexit, leadership and President Trump Mrs May insists her plans would allow the UK to strike its own trade deals, despite agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU on cross-border trade. She said such rules were needed to protect jobs in firms with supply chains that crossed borders and deal with the Irish border issue. Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said Mrs May's ""so-called plan"" did not ""stand up to scrutiny"". ""No-one - not the public, Parliament or the Conservative party - is happy with Theresa May's offer. This has descended into a shambles,"" he said. Labour MP Ian Murray, a member of the People's Vote campaign, said the British people needed a vote on the final deal. Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson said it was not the party's policy to back another referendum - but said it should not be ruled out.

"This video can not be played Justine Greening: ""This deal keeps no-one happy"" Downing Street has rejected Justine Greening's call for a fresh referendum on the UK's exit from the EU, saying it will not happen ""in any circumstances"". The former education secretary argued the final Brexit decision should be given back to the people and out of the hands of ""deadlocked politicians"". She called for three options to be on the ballot paper: the prime minister's Chequers deal, staying in the EU or a clean break from Europe with no deal. The UK is due to leave in March 2019. Amid continuing Tory divisions over Mrs May's strategy, the government has accepted changes to legislation for customs arrangements after the UK leaves to avoid a Commons rebellion by Brexit-backing MPs. No 10 said the amendments to the Customs Bill, including one that would preclude the UK from collecting tariffs on goods bound for EU countries, were ""consistent"" with the blueprint agreed by the cabinet. Asked during a Commons statement on last week's Nato summit whether she was ""rolling over"", Mrs May said she would continue to ""listen to the concerns"" of colleagues regarding Brexit-related legislation. Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second referendum? Live: MPs debate Brexit and customs Ms Greening, who resigned after the cabinet reshuffle in January, said the referendum should offer a first and second preference vote so that a consensus can be reached. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Greening said the government's proposals were a ""genuine clever attempt at a compromise that could work"" but ""suits no-one"". The MP for Putney said: ""The reality is Parliament is now stalemated. Whatever the proposal on the table, there will be MPs who vote it down. But Britain needs to find a route forward."" Plan 'delivers the Brexit UK voted for' - May Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan Seven thoughts on a second EU referendum Ms Greening, who supported Remain in the EU referendum, is the highest profile ex-Cabinet minister to call for a second referendum. She said there were other senior Conservatives who agreed with her stance, adding that people who supported Leave in the referendum would also feel the government's approach is ""not what they voted for"". In her article in the Times, she lambasted the PM's Brexit blueprint, saying: ""We'll be dragging Remain voters out of the EU for a deal that means still complying with many EU rules, but now with no say on shaping them. ""It's not what they want, and on top of that when they hear that Leave voters are unhappy, they ask, 'What's the point?' ""For Leavers, this deal simply does not deliver the proper break from the European Union that they wanted."" By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent Combine a hung parliament with Brexit, and when you scan your eye around the House of Commons, you sometimes wonder if they can collectively agree on anything. The one thing there is certainly not much public support for right now among MPs is another referendum. Whatever the view of an individual MP on Brexit, most see making the case for another schlep to the polling station a hard argument to flog. And so while those doing so are a pretty small tribe, and it is a million miles from a majority view, there is pride among them that they can add another name to their gang. But it is worth remembering that Justine Greening is a pro-European in a marginal seat - Putney in London - that voted heavily to Remain. Ms Greening, who grew up in Rotherham, where 68% people voted to leave the EU, said the parliamentary stalemate ""risks a no-confidence vote and, worse, a Corbyn government, which would be disastrous for the economy"". She hadpreviously suggested a future generation of MPs will seek to ""improve or undo"" Brexitif it does not work for young people. Fellow Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, who backed Leave in the referendum, said he agreed with Ms Greening that the PM's plan was ""dead"" but described her call for a second vote as ""a little ill-thought-out"". ""If we wanted to extend the uncertainty for another long period this is one way of doing it,"" he told Today. Mrs May has ruled out a second vote, as has Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, although a number of senior Labour figures are backing the cross-party People's Vote campaign for a final vote on any exit deal. Pro-EU Conservative MP Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme the possibility of holding a second referendum should not be excluded but Mrs May was ""entitled to try to develop"" her Chequers plan. This video can not be played Theresa May reveals the advice President Trump gave her over Brexit ""My primary political duty at the moment is to try and help get this country through a Brexit process that is endangering its stability and its wellbeing,"" he said. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said another referendum was ""heading much closer"" but could be avoided if the Tories changed leader, adding there was ""uproar out there"" about the prime minister's proposals. Suella Braverman, who used to lead a Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs and is now a minister in the Brexit department, said there were ""obviously strong views"" within her party and described the Chequers plan as a ""starting point"" for negotiations with the EU. But the disagreements in the party have also led to another resignation from the government. Scott Mann has quit his job as a parliamentary private secretary at the Treasury, saying Mrs May's plan was ""in direct conflict"" with the views of his Leave-voting constituents in north Cornwall and he did not want to deliver a ""watered-down Brexit"" to them.

"Theresa May held talks with the US president during his UK visit The prime minister has warned Conservative MPs that they could be putting Brexit at risk. Some long-standing Leave campaigners are unhappy with herBrexit White Paper,externalwhich proposes a common rulebook with the EU for traded goods. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Theresa May urged the country to ""keep their eye on the prize"". Her message comes ahead of crucial Commons votes on trade and customs policy next week. Some members of her party's European Research Group (ERG) want to amend that legislation to scupper Mrs May's plans. The White Paper, which sparked the resignations of ministers Boris Johnson and David Davis, is aimed at ensuring trade co-operation, with no hard border for Northern Ireland, and global trade deals for the UK. Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg called it a ""bad deal for Britain"". US President Donald Trumptold the Sun newspaper,externalthe proposals would ""probably kill"" a trade deal with his country.

Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan Mrs May said she has not seen any workable alternative to the White Paper - so voting against her legislation could lead to a ""disorderly and damaging Brexit"". The prime minister said the legacy of Brexit ""cannot be a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland"". She added that Brexit must not destroy the ""integrated supply chains and just-in-time processes on which jobs and livelihoods depend"". But Mrs May did offer some reassurance to those who worry she will make further concessions to Brussels. ""Our Brexit deal is not some long wish-list from which negotiators get to pick and choose,"" she wrote. ""It is a complete plan with a set of outcomes that are non-negotiable."" She added her Brexit plan would ""end"" both the free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. This video can not be played Why Tory MPs are fighting over the government's Brexit white paper Long-standing Leave campaigners are not the only group likely to revolt, however. There are also fears that some former Remainers in her party will vote with Labour to compel her to negotiate a fully-fledged customs union with the EU. ""This would be the ultimate betrayal of the Brexit vote,"" she says. On Thursday, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he would analyse the details with the European Parliament and member states and was ""looking forward"" to negotiations with the UK next week.

"Theresa May visited the Farnborough International Airshow on Monday Theresa May has promised extra investment for the aerospace industry, just weeks after Airbus threatened to reduce its UK presence because of Brexit disruption. The prime minister also said that her Brexit plan would secure millions of aviation jobs in Britain. It comes amid growing criticism of her plan from MPs,with another government member resigningin protest on Sunday. The proposal urges close links with the EU on trade in goods, but not services. In a speech at the Farnborough Airshow on Monday, she offered more than Â£300m of government and industry money for several projects, including research on more environmentally-friendly aircraft. Airbus: Chequers deal 'right direction' Brexit circles over air show extravaganza There will be additional money for two new spaceports - one in Cornwall, one in Scotland - and a long-awaited commitment to build a new high-tech fighter aircraft that will eventually replace the Eurofighter Typhoon. The Rolls-Royce factory in Derby The UK aviation sectorgenerates turnover of about Â£60bn,externaland supports almost a million jobs. Britishaerospace exports alone,externalwere worth Â£30bn in 2017. However, industry trade association ADS has warned the sector could be paralysed if Britain leaves the EU customs union and single market, given its dependence on cross-border trade in components. Check out all our coverage of Farnborough 2018 In June, Airbus UK boss Tom Enders said it could pull production out of the UK if it quit the bloc without a transition deal. The French firm employs about 14,000 people in Britain. However, last week, Mr Enderstentatively welcomed Mrs May's plan, saying the government is now moving in the right direction. Airbus chief executive Tom Enders says the UK govenment is ""going in the right direction"" But in an interview with the BBC, the boss of Airbus's arch-rival, Boeing, pledged to keep investing in Britain. Dennis Muilenberg said while the company did not welcome disruption to the movement of goods - or to the Europe-wide systems of aviation regulation - his company's plans would not be changed by the UK's plans to leave the EU. ""We are going to continue to grow in the UK,"" he said, adding that Boeing would maintain a long-term view of its UK investments, ""regardless of how Brexit plays out"". However, he added there were worries over whether ""we continue to see free flow of goods and services"". In her speech, Mrs May argued that her proposals - including frictionless free trade in goods and the avoidance of a hard border in Northern Ireland - would protect the supply chains that big aerospace firms depend on. She also said the UK could remain part of EU agencies critical for the aerospace industry, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency. ""By working closely together, government and industry have ensured we remain at the forefront of civil aviation and that our air power is second to none,"" she said. ""Today I want us to build on that, and ensure not only that we retain our prominence, but that in an increasingly competitive industry we make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead."" ADS has welcomed the government's plan, but insists there are important and complex issues still to be resolved. However, chief executive Paul Everitt said the prime minister's remarks were a ""strong statement of intent"" that would help build confidence and encourage investment. ""The international political, military and business leaders visiting Farnborough will be reassured by last week's Brexit White Paper and are keen to hear more about the UK's post-Brexit ambitions.""

"This video can not be played President Trump describes EU as a foe in an interview with CBS. US President Donald Trump has described the European Union as a foe on trade. He told CBS News that European countries were taking advantage of the US and not paying their Nato bills. EU Council President Donald Tusk said anyone calling the EU foes was spreading ""fake news"". Mr Trump said he had ""low expectations"" for his meeting on Monday with Russia's Vladimir Putin, which comes after12 Russians were indicted for alleged hackingduring 2016 US elections. Mr Trump said he would raise this issue with Mr Putin at the summit in the Finnish capital, Helsinki, and ""maybe some good"" would come of it. Russia denies the allegations. There have been calls in the US for Mr Trump to cancel his meeting with Mr Putin over the indictments, announced on Friday by US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Sunday also saw a protest march against the summit in Helsinki. Demonstrators chanted ""media must be free"", and carried a banner calling for human rights.

Asked to name his biggest competitor and foe globally, the US president said there were ""a lot of foes"" and named Russia and China among them, but the first on his list was the EU. Mr Trump described the EU as ""very difficult"" ""I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now you wouldn't think of the European Union but they're a foe,"" he said.

""He'll listen to President Putin's response, and we'll go from there."" Mr Trump also repeated his earlier criticism of the Obama administration, which was in power when the alleged hacking of Democratic party officials took place. ""This was during the Obama administration. They were doing whatever it was during the Obama administration,"" he said. ""The DNC should be ashamed of themselves for allowing themselves to be hacked.

The US president has taken in a Nato summit and a visit to the UK ahead of his meeting with Mr Putin. The visit has been controversial because of a newspaper interview in which he said the US would probably not give the UK a trade deal under the terms of Prime Minister May's Brexit plans, and also said Europe was ""losing its character"" because of immigration from Africa and the Middle East.

"The speed limit through roadworks on motorways is normally 50mph (80km/h) Drivers could be allowed to travel faster through motorway roadworks on quiet days such as Sundays. Speed limits could be increased from 50mph (80km/h) to 60mph (97km/h) when there is less activity by road workers, Highways England announced. Highways England will test the plan which is aimed at reducing drivers' frustration at roadworks. The RAC welcomed a trial but said continued use of average speed cameras was also ""essential"". The safety of road workers is ""paramount"" said RAC spokesman Simon Williams. But ""the use of average speed cameras have been very successful in controlling speed"". ""Increasing the limit will do away with some of the frustration for drivers."" Highways England said various speed limits could also be used within one set of roadworks, meaning higher speeds are allowed when vehicles are further away from road workers. The agency said there were nearly 300 incidents a week of drivers entering coned-off areas or subjecting road workers to physical or verbal abuse on motorways or major A roads. Steph Savill, a motoring campaigner on behalf of women drivers, welcomed the announcement, saying she found roadwork restrictions ""frustrating and stressful"" and were difficult to justify ""when there are no workers on duty or other safety concerns"". She said: ""From personal experience, it's nearly impossible to keep to 50mph on a motorway in these circumstances so a small increase to 60mph will likely reduce driver stress and gets our vote."" Should the proposals be brought in, they would come into effect in late 2018 or early 2019, Highways England chief executive Jim O'Sullivan said. He added: ""People understand roadworks are necessary but are also frustrated by them. ""At the same time we have to ensure as they drive through them that they, and our road workers, are safe. ""So we are always thinking of new ways to improve journeys at the same time as keeping everyone as safe as we can. ""That is why over the next 12 months we will test changes to the design and operation of roadworks."" A studyby Highways England released in October 2017found 60% of drivers who drove at 60mph through a roadworks zone had a decreased average heart rate indicating a reduction in frustration. Motorways in Scotland and Wales are controlled by the countries' respective governments through devolved powers. Transport Scotland and the Welsh Government both said they currently had no plans to copy the Highways England plan.

"This video can not be played The footage shows a car passing the property An explosive device thrown at the home of former Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams was hurled from a moving car, CCTV footage appears to show. The recording, from a camera outside the property, was released by Sinn FÃ©in on Sunday. It shows a car passing his driveway in west Belfast on Friday night. As it passes, sparks can be seen around a parked car in a driveway and then black smoke. Police responded to reports of loud bangs at 22:50 BST on Friday 13 July On Saturday, Mr Adams said he was thankful that no one was hurt in the attack. Sinn FÃ©in activistBobby Storey's house was also attackedand the PSNI said the devices thrown at both homes were believed to be ""large industrial or commercial fireworks"". Damage to a car on Mr Adams' driveway was visible in the aftermath of the attack. Mr Adams said he was unsure whether there was a connection between the attacksand the recent violence in Londonderry, which is being linked to dissident republicans. Sinn FÃ©in said there were children in the driveway minutes before the attack In a direct appeal to the attackers, he said: ""I'd like them to sit down and explain to me what this is about. ""I'd like those who are involved in exploiting children in Derry to do the same thing, or those who are poisoning the atmosphere in east Belfast and causing havoc to do the same thing."" He said those responsible were ""resistant to change"" and the groups that had stepped away from the peace process saw Sinn FÃ©in as the enemy. This video can not be played 'I'd like them to sit down and explain' Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald will be the main speaker at the rally, which will also be attended by Mr Adams and Mr Storey. By Chris Page, Ireland correspondent Gerry Adams has spoken several times in the past about death threats made against him - by loyalists and by dissident republicans who are opposed to the peace process. Sinn FÃ©in's statement about the attacks on the homes of Mr Adams and Bobby Storey doesn't explicitly pin the blame on republican splinter groups. However, the party's reference to ""increasingly desperate and irrelevant groups"" firmly points in that direction - and republicans who have expressed support for Mr Adams on social media have condemned dissidents as ""criminals"" and ""thugs"". A number of hours earlier, Mr Adams's successor as Sinn Fein President - Mary Lou McDonald - strongly denounced the dissidents who are believed to be behind recent rioting in Londonderry as ""warped, negative, regressive, dangerous people"". Mr Adams, 69, spent nearly 34 years at the helm of Irish republican party Sinn FÃ©in. During The Troubles Mr Adams survived several attempts on his life, including a 1984 gun attack by loyalist paramilitaries. He is one of the most recognisable and controversial figures in Irish politics. Two months after the death of Martin McGuinness in 2017, Mr Adams announced he would step down as leader. He was succeeded by Mary Lou McDonald. You can read a full profile here.

"The 12 boys and their coach pictured with a drawing of Saman Gunan (also spelled Kunan), who died working to rescue them The 12 young footballers who were saved from a Thai cave after an international rescue effort are mourning a former Navy Seal who died in the operation. Volunteer diver Saman Gunan lost his life on 6 July while installing oxygen tanks in the flooded cave complex. He has since been hailed as a hero around the world. The boys and their 25-year-old coach were told of his sacrifice only on Saturday, when doctors decided they were strong enough to process the news. The full story of Thailandâs extraordinary cave rescue The heroes who saved the Wild Boars The doctor who chose to stay in the cave ""All cried and expressed their condolences by writing messages on a drawing of Lieutenant Commander Saman and observed one minute of silence for him,"" said Jedsada Chokdamrongsuk, permanent secretary at the health ministry. Photos showed the ""Wild Boars"" football team, who are being monitored in hospital, gathered solemnly around a picture of the diver. ""They also thanked him and promised to be good boys,"" the health ministry said. The young footballers bow their heads after writing messages of commemoration This video can not be played Wife and father remember 'hero' Thai diver: ""He loved helping others"" The boys, aged 11-16, were pulled from the cavern by Thai Navy Seals and foreign cave diving experts, in a three-day rescue push that ended on 10 July. They are expected to leave Chiang Rai Prachanukroh Hospital on Thursday, though many are still on antibiotics. They will be watched for signs of psychological distress, which may only become evident in the months to come. The boys have been advised against giving media interviews, which experts say could trigger a post-traumatic reaction. The youngsters and their coach had been invited to the final of the 2018 World Cup by its organiser, Fifa, but had to decline on medical grounds. As the live game will be broadcast quite late on Sunday 15 July (at 22:00 Thai time), doctors said they will enjoy a recording later. The boys' nail-biting tragedy-turned-survival-story has been followed by millions worldwide since 23 June, when they walked into the Tham Luang cave after football practice - only to be trapped by monsoon floods. They had spent nine days in the cave with little food or light when British divers first reached them on Monday 2 July. Scores of volunteers and almost 100 divers joined the effort to free them, which saw the boys sedated and carried out on military stretchers. This video can not be played First video messages from rescued Thai boys Some of the specialists have expressed shock that Saman, 38, was the only person killed in the perilous venture. His widow told the BBC: ""He's been praised as a hero because of who he was. He loved helping others, doing charity work and getting things done."" How the Thai boys were saved In pictures: How the rescue unfolded Around 4,000 volunteers are working to clean up the area around the now-infamous cave, which was battered by relays of rescuers, volunteers and news crews.

"Artwork: This is what a Scottish spaceport could look like in the early 2020s A remote, boggy stretch of land on the north coast of Scotland is set to become the UK's first spaceport. The A'Mhoine Peninsula in Sutherland has been chosen as the most suitable place from which to launch rockets vertically to put satellites in orbit. The UK Space Agency is giving Highlands and Islands Enterprise Â£2.5m towards the development of the facility. HIE will work closely with a consortium that includes the American aerospace giant Lockheed Martin. The goal would be to have launches as early as possible in the 2020s. Small rockets herald new wave UK satellite makes HD movies of Earth The Scotland money is part of a package of grants to foster UK launch capability that was announced by Business Secretary Greg Clark at theFarnborough International Air Show,external. He told the event: ""We are one of the best countries in the world for the research, development, manufacturing and application of satellites - big and small. And when we see the expansion that is taking place, and the requirement that these satellites need to be launched into orbit - there is an obvious opportunity here for the UK and it must be grasped."" Mr Clark detailed a total of Â£33.5m in grants from a reserved pot of Â£50m to help drive forward proposals. Lockheed will get the lion's share at Â£23.5m. The company wants to bring the Electron rocket to Scotland. Currently, this vehicle flies out of New Zealand. A British version of the rocket would have a propulsion unit and satellite dispenser developed and built at Ampthill in Bedfordshire, Harwell in Oxfordshire, and in Reading. Patrick Wood is Lockheed Martin's senior executive in the UK. ""As a country we've not invested in launch vehicles since 1971 and Black Arrow, which put up the Prospero satellite. I'm really proud to be working with the Lockheed Martin team and our partners in delivering the the first launch from British soil,"" he told BBC News. The Electron launch vehicle currently flies from New Zealand HIE will develop the launch complex at A'Mhoine, with Lockheed using one pad, and a second pad likely to go to Orbex. This is a new company that has been developing a 17m-tall rocket out of the public eye. On Monday, however, the firm was very forward in discussing its plans, which have now been backed through a UK Space Agency grant to the tune of Â£5.5m. ""We will be putting a new factory into Scotland where we will be doing the main production and integration of the vehicles. The vehicles will then be transported to Sutherland,"" explained Orbex CEO, Chris Larmour. ""Internally, I don't think we realised just how big today is because we've been focussed on technical tasks. But this morning at the show, I think we're beginning to realise just how big a moment this is."" The UK government has been mulling the idea of home spaceports for a decade now, and has updated the legislation that would make them possible. While the headline news focussed on Scotland and the launch of rockets from the ground, Â£2m has also been released to further investigations into the siting of a ""horizontal launch"" spaceport as well. This would see a modified aeroplane leave a British runway, climb to altitude somewhere out over the ocean and then release a rocket that can put the satellite in orbit. A number of such systems are presently in development. A partnership agreement will be signed between Cornwall Council and Virgin Orbit One making waves at the moment is owned by entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson. HisVirgin Orbit,externalcompany, based in Long Beach, California, has converted an old Virgin Atlantic 747 to dispense its LauncherOne rocket - a maiden flight for which is imminent. Cornwall, in particular, is very keen to have Virgin Orbit operate out of Newquay airport. The council and the California company signed a partnership agreement at the air show. A first mission is being targeted for 2021. ""Cornwall is showing ambition,"" said Adam Painter, the leader of the council. ""Years ago we sent miners around the world; we led the world in mining. That industrial time has gone but for Cornwall - we see that we have a number of new areas that we could excel in and space is one of them."" The UK is in a unique moment. Having pioneered the development of small satellites, through companies such asSurrey Satellite Technology Limited,externalandAAC Clyde Space,external, it has put itself right at the crest of a new wave. The use of off-the-shelf, low-cost, miniaturised consumer electronics is revolutionising satellites. It is now possible to put enormous capability inside a very small box. Having spaceports would allow UK industry to offer the full ""turn key"" product to their customers - from design, to build, to launch. The whole package. AAC Clyde Space in Glasgow produces about 80 small satellites a year Everything you can imagine. Satellites to monitor the weather, to relay communications, and to take pictures of activity on Earth. Small satellites can do all this and they tend to operate in polar-type orbits. That is, they circle the Earth a few hundred kilometres up, passing over the Arctic and the Antarctic. The north of Scotland is therefore ideally situated in this respect. Rockets would fly north, through the gap between Iceland and the Faroe Islands, and Svalbard. If there were launch failures, nothing would fall on populated land. I've mentioned three vehicles already that could fly from the UK - the Electron, Orbex and LauncherOne. But there are 60-plus small launch vehicles in development around the world. A few of these others are also based in the UK, and they will regard a home spaceport as a great fillip to their endeavours. Keep an eye on the clock. Time is short for the UK if it wants to capture a significant share of the nascent small launch market. UK regional authorities and rocket operators are going to have to move fast if they want to avoid the opportunities drifting away to other countries. There is a big responsibility on government, too. It has updated legislation but many details still need to be tied down, such as liability rules and safety requirements. If these are made too onerous, it will put up the price of launching satellites. The cost per kilogram-to-orbit has to be competitive. Chris Larmour told BBC News: ""If we weren't in the position we are today with the components being fired, tested and running already - that window would not be possible for us; and I think that window is closing for people who are not in that degree of readiness.""

"This video can not be played Justine Greening: ""This deal keeps no-one happy"" Downing Street has rejected Justine Greening's call for a fresh referendum on the UK's exit from the EU, saying it will not happen ""in any circumstances"". The former education secretary argued the final Brexit decision should be given back to the people and out of the hands of ""deadlocked politicians"". She called for three options to be on the ballot paper: the prime minister's Chequers deal, staying in the EU or a clean break from Europe with no deal. The UK is due to leave in March 2019. Amid continuing Tory divisions over Mrs May's strategy, the government has accepted changes to legislation for customs arrangements after the UK leaves to avoid a Commons rebellion by Brexit-backing MPs. No 10 said the amendments to the Customs Bill, including one that would preclude the UK from collecting tariffs on goods bound for EU countries, were ""consistent"" with the blueprint agreed by the cabinet. Asked during a Commons statement on last week's Nato summit whether she was ""rolling over"", Mrs May said she would continue to ""listen to the concerns"" of colleagues regarding Brexit-related legislation. Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second referendum? Live: MPs debate Brexit and customs Ms Greening, who resigned after the cabinet reshuffle in January, said the referendum should offer a first and second preference vote so that a consensus can be reached. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Greening said the government's proposals were a ""genuine clever attempt at a compromise that could work"" but ""suits no-one"". The MP for Putney said: ""The reality is Parliament is now stalemated. Whatever the proposal on the table, there will be MPs who vote it down. But Britain needs to find a route forward."" Plan 'delivers the Brexit UK voted for' - May Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan Seven thoughts on a second EU referendum Ms Greening, who supported Remain in the EU referendum, is the highest profile ex-Cabinet minister to call for a second referendum. She said there were other senior Conservatives who agreed with her stance, adding that people who supported Leave in the referendum would also feel the government's approach is ""not what they voted for"". In her article in the Times, she lambasted the PM's Brexit blueprint, saying: ""We'll be dragging Remain voters out of the EU for a deal that means still complying with many EU rules, but now with no say on shaping them. ""It's not what they want, and on top of that when they hear that Leave voters are unhappy, they ask, 'What's the point?' ""For Leavers, this deal simply does not deliver the proper break from the European Union that they wanted."" By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent Combine a hung parliament with Brexit, and when you scan your eye around the House of Commons, you sometimes wonder if they can collectively agree on anything. The one thing there is certainly not much public support for right now among MPs is another referendum. Whatever the view of an individual MP on Brexit, most see making the case for another schlep to the polling station a hard argument to flog. And so while those doing so are a pretty small tribe, and it is a million miles from a majority view, there is pride among them that they can add another name to their gang. But it is worth remembering that Justine Greening is a pro-European in a marginal seat - Putney in London - that voted heavily to Remain. Ms Greening, who grew up in Rotherham, where 68% people voted to leave the EU, said the parliamentary stalemate ""risks a no-confidence vote and, worse, a Corbyn government, which would be disastrous for the economy"". She hadpreviously suggested a future generation of MPs will seek to ""improve or undo"" Brexitif it does not work for young people. Fellow Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, who backed Leave in the referendum, said he agreed with Ms Greening that the PM's plan was ""dead"" but described her call for a second vote as ""a little ill-thought-out"". ""If we wanted to extend the uncertainty for another long period this is one way of doing it,"" he told Today. Mrs May has ruled out a second vote, as has Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, although a number of senior Labour figures are backing the cross-party People's Vote campaign for a final vote on any exit deal. Pro-EU Conservative MP Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme the possibility of holding a second referendum should not be excluded but Mrs May was ""entitled to try to develop"" her Chequers plan. This video can not be played Theresa May reveals the advice President Trump gave her over Brexit ""My primary political duty at the moment is to try and help get this country through a Brexit process that is endangering its stability and its wellbeing,"" he said. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said another referendum was ""heading much closer"" but could be avoided if the Tories changed leader, adding there was ""uproar out there"" about the prime minister's proposals. Suella Braverman, who used to lead a Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs and is now a minister in the Brexit department, said there were ""obviously strong views"" within her party and described the Chequers plan as a ""starting point"" for negotiations with the EU. But the disagreements in the party have also led to another resignation from the government. Scott Mann has quit his job as a parliamentary private secretary at the Treasury, saying Mrs May's plan was ""in direct conflict"" with the views of his Leave-voting constituents in north Cornwall and he did not want to deliver a ""watered-down Brexit"" to them.

"Theresa May visited the Farnborough International Airshow on Monday Theresa May has promised extra investment for the aerospace industry, just weeks after Airbus threatened to reduce its UK presence because of Brexit disruption. The prime minister also said that her Brexit plan would secure millions of aviation jobs in Britain. It comes amid growing criticism of her plan from MPs,with another government member resigningin protest on Sunday. The proposal urges close links with the EU on trade in goods, but not services. In a speech at the Farnborough Airshow on Monday, she offered more than Â£300m of government and industry money for several projects, including research on more environmentally-friendly aircraft. Airbus: Chequers deal 'right direction' Brexit circles over air show extravaganza There will be additional money for two new spaceports - one in Cornwall, one in Scotland - and a long-awaited commitment to build a new high-tech fighter aircraft that will eventually replace the Eurofighter Typhoon. The Rolls-Royce factory in Derby The UK aviation sectorgenerates turnover of about Â£60bn,externaland supports almost a million jobs. Britishaerospace exports alone,externalwere worth Â£30bn in 2017. However, industry trade association ADS has warned the sector could be paralysed if Britain leaves the EU customs union and single market, given its dependence on cross-border trade in components. Check out all our coverage of Farnborough 2018 In June, Airbus UK boss Tom Enders said it could pull production out of the UK if it quit the bloc without a transition deal. The French firm employs about 14,000 people in Britain. However, last week, Mr Enderstentatively welcomed Mrs May's plan, saying the government is now moving in the right direction. Airbus chief executive Tom Enders says the UK govenment is ""going in the right direction"" But in an interview with the BBC, the boss of Airbus's arch-rival, Boeing, pledged to keep investing in Britain. Dennis Muilenberg said while the company did not welcome disruption to the movement of goods - or to the Europe-wide systems of aviation regulation - his company's plans would not be changed by the UK's plans to leave the EU. ""We are going to continue to grow in the UK,"" he said, adding that Boeing would maintain a long-term view of its UK investments, ""regardless of how Brexit plays out"". However, he added there were worries over whether ""we continue to see free flow of goods and services"". In her speech, Mrs May argued that her proposals - including frictionless free trade in goods and the avoidance of a hard border in Northern Ireland - would protect the supply chains that big aerospace firms depend on. She also said the UK could remain part of EU agencies critical for the aerospace industry, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency. ""By working closely together, government and industry have ensured we remain at the forefront of civil aviation and that our air power is second to none,"" she said. ""Today I want us to build on that, and ensure not only that we retain our prominence, but that in an increasingly competitive industry we make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead."" ADS has welcomed the government's plan, but insists there are important and complex issues still to be resolved. However, chief executive Paul Everitt said the prime minister's remarks were a ""strong statement of intent"" that would help build confidence and encourage investment. ""The international political, military and business leaders visiting Farnborough will be reassured by last week's Brexit White Paper and are keen to hear more about the UK's post-Brexit ambitions.""

"Theresa May visited the Farnborough International Airshow on Monday Theresa May has promised extra investment for the aerospace industry, just weeks after Airbus threatened to reduce its UK presence because of Brexit disruption. The prime minister also said that her Brexit plan would secure millions of aviation jobs in Britain. It comes amid growing criticism of her plan from MPs,with another government member resigningin protest on Sunday. The proposal urges close links with the EU on trade in goods, but not services. In a speech at the Farnborough Airshow on Monday, she offered more than Â£300m of government and industry money for several projects, including research on more environmentally-friendly aircraft. Airbus: Chequers deal 'right direction' Brexit circles over air show extravaganza There will be additional money for two new spaceports - one in Cornwall, one in Scotland - and a long-awaited commitment to build a new high-tech fighter aircraft that will eventually replace the Eurofighter Typhoon. The Rolls-Royce factory in Derby The UK aviation sectorgenerates turnover of about Â£60bn,externaland supports almost a million jobs. Britishaerospace exports alone,externalwere worth Â£30bn in 2017. However, industry trade association ADS has warned the sector could be paralysed if Britain leaves the EU customs union and single market, given its dependence on cross-border trade in components. Check out all our coverage of Farnborough 2018 In June, Airbus UK boss Tom Enders said it could pull production out of the UK if it quit the bloc without a transition deal. The French firm employs about 14,000 people in Britain. However, last week, Mr Enderstentatively welcomed Mrs May's plan, saying the government is now moving in the right direction. Airbus chief executive Tom Enders says the UK govenment is ""going in the right direction"" But in an interview with the BBC, the boss of Airbus's arch-rival, Boeing, pledged to keep investing in Britain. Dennis Muilenberg said while the company did not welcome disruption to the movement of goods - or to the Europe-wide systems of aviation regulation - his company's plans would not be changed by the UK's plans to leave the EU. ""We are going to continue to grow in the UK,"" he said, adding that Boeing would maintain a long-term view of its UK investments, ""regardless of how Brexit plays out"". However, he added there were worries over whether ""we continue to see free flow of goods and services"". In her speech, Mrs May argued that her proposals - including frictionless free trade in goods and the avoidance of a hard border in Northern Ireland - would protect the supply chains that big aerospace firms depend on. She also said the UK could remain part of EU agencies critical for the aerospace industry, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency. ""By working closely together, government and industry have ensured we remain at the forefront of civil aviation and that our air power is second to none,"" she said. ""Today I want us to build on that, and ensure not only that we retain our prominence, but that in an increasingly competitive industry we make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead."" ADS has welcomed the government's plan, but insists there are important and complex issues still to be resolved. However, chief executive Paul Everitt said the prime minister's remarks were a ""strong statement of intent"" that would help build confidence and encourage investment. ""The international political, military and business leaders visiting Farnborough will be reassured by last week's Brexit White Paper and are keen to hear more about the UK's post-Brexit ambitions.""

"Matthew Rowley, whose brother Charlie was poisoned, says he found the Novichok in a perfume bottle The nerve agent that poisoned two people in Amesbury was contained in a perfume bottle, the brother of one of the victims has said. Matthew Rowley said his brother Charlie, who is seriously ill in hospital, told him he had picked up the perfume bottle. The Metropolitan Police, which is leading the investigation, refused to confirm the claim. Previously the force has said only that it was found in a ""small bottle"". Charlie Rowley is ""absolutely not the brother I know"" after the poisoning, Matthew said Charlie Rowley and his partner, Dawn Sturgess, were exposed to the nerve agent on 30 June. A murder investigation was launched after Ms Sturgess died on 8 July. Investigators believe the incident is linked to theNovichok poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliain Salisbury on 4 March. On Friday, police reiterated advice from Public Health England for people in the area not to pick up strange items - including cosmetics. Searches see 400 items seized Death increases pressure on investigators What we know so far Matthew Rowley told BBC News he was still upset about his brother's condition after speaking to him on the telephone. He said Charlie Rowley was ""absolutely not the brother I know"" though he said he was now eating solid food. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the information about the bottle could be a significant clue for investigators trying to isolate the source of the nerve agent and identify who administered it. ""Where did it come from, where was it bought, is it something that is very rare, is it something that's unusual, is it something that was bought in a particular shop at a particular time?"" he said. ""That could be absolutely vital for the investigation to find out who was responsible for the attack on the Skripals and also for the latest attack.""

"A suicide bombing earlier this month killed more than a dozen people in the Afghan city of Jalalabad The number of civilians killed in the long-running war in Afghanistan reached a record high in the first six months of this year, the UN says. Some 1,692 fatalities were recorded, with militant attacks and suicide bombs said to be the leading causes of death. The report comes as at at least seven people were killed in an attack on the rural development ministry in Kabul. Recent attacks claimed by Taliban and Islamic State group militants have killed scores across the country. The figures for the conflict, which began in 2001, are the highest since the UN started keeping records in 2009. The report, by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama), says the number of recorded deaths rose by 1% compared with the same period last year. However, the report adds, injuries fell by 5% to 3,430, and the total number of civilian casualties - accounting for deaths and injuries - dropped by 3% to 5,122. The record high death toll came despite an unprecedented ceasefire by Afghan security forces and the Taliban last month, which was largely respected by both sides, Unama said. Taliban 'threaten 70% of Afghanistan' Cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan UK to send more non-combat troops Earlier this month, Nato leaders gathered at a summit in Brussels to discuss the conflict in Afghanistan. The US has said it is planning a strategic review a year after President Donald Trump agreed to remain involved in the 17-year conflict. The US-led invasion drove the hardline Taliban from power in 2001, as part of a crackdown on Islamist militants after the 9/11 attacks in the US. Thousands of Nato troops were deployed and a long, bloody conflict followed as the ousted militants fought back. In 2014, Nato formally ended the combat mission, handing over to Afghan forces, whom it had trained. Since then, the Taliban have made substantial territorial gains across the country.

"The fire service urged people to contact the emergency services if they found an animal in distress A deer which became trapped in the sea off the Hampshire coast has drowned after a passing boat tried to lasso it. Coastguards were called to Clarence Esplanade, Southsea, at 09:00 BST amid reports of a large deer in the water. The fire service, tasked with rescuing the animal, said it was stuck between Southsea Aquarium and Southsea Castle. The service's animal rescue adviser and the RNLI managed to get the deer on board a rescue boat and gave it CPR but they were unsuccessful. Hampshire Fire and Rescue said the joint partnership team, involving the RSPCA, RNLI and Coastguard, was in a ""race against time"" to save the young roe deer, which was thought to have swum from the Isle of Wight. The animal rescue adviser was picked up by an RNLI rescue boat and taken to the deer which was 200m off shore.

Pundits on World Cup penalty World Cup win is 'supreme coronation' - Deschamps Kane wins Golden Boot as Modric named best player Pogba returns to Manchester United a world champion after becoming the first Premier League player to score in a World Cup final since Arsenal's Emmanuel Petit in 1998. The 25-year-old joined United for a then world record Â£89m in August 2016 but fell out of favour at times during the 2017-18 campaign. He was left out of the starting line-up by boss Jose Mourinho for both legs of United's Champions League last-16 defeat by Sevilla. ""Pogba was immense - especially in the second half,"" said Ferdinand. ""The pressure was on and he has to come to the fore. There's a huge price tag to his name. ""He has had a tough season in terms of the media and people from within the game calling him out in a Manchester United shirt. ""It's down to Jose now to unlock this Pogba we saw at the World Cup because he was responsible, he stood up to a lot of hard tests in midfield and was a talisman for this team. ""For some reason the jigsaw puzzle hasn't been put together properly in a Manchester United shirt. ""The way the team plays, I think 'are they getting the ball into him in the right areas?'

No-one really knew what to expect heading into this tournament. There was heightened political tension and the threat of hooliganism after clashes between England and Russia fans during Euro 2016 in Marseille. The doubts diminished quicker than Germany's chances of lifting the trophy though. From help through the Harry Potter-like metro stations, to the rather loud reception at Volgograd Airport, we were made to feel extremely welcome. I was in Marseille two years ago when trouble broke out, yet this summer I have sat in stadiums with thousands of Russians cheering England on. Their jubilation at Harry Kane's late winner against Tunisia almost rivalled that of the England fans around me. Ah, let's talk about the England fans. It's understandable their numbers have been down on previous tournaments, given the media and government attention on potential trouble. But what they've lacked in numbers, they've certainly made up for in volume. Led by the England band, I've not been to one of their games here where I haven't heard their dulcet tones for the entirety of the match. Even when they were completely outnumbered by Colombians, the chant about Gareth Southgate to Whole Again could clearly be heard. Allow Twitter content?

In a World Cup of huge shocks, maybe England fans singing an Atomic Kitten song is the biggest. And whileFifa has warned the Football Associationfollowing ""political chants"" by English fans during their semi-final match, the majority of supporters I have met here have behaved impeccably. Let's face it, England fans have been rewarded with a journey they never thought possible. England's first World Cup semi-final in nearly three decades, along with their first ever penalty shootout win in the competition. The deathly still inside the Spartak Stadium before Eric Dier slotted in the winning penalty will be remembered for its eeriness as much as its history-making. Seemingly you cannot reminisce about the World Cup without mentioning Gareth Southgate. I mean, I even wore a waistcoat on Wednesday! In the space of five weeks the former Middlesbrough man has transformed English football and the hopes of a nation. Football is not coming home, but maybe the England manager's biggest victory here in Russia has been to reunite a country. Talking of which, I must mention Russia. They were the lowest-ranked side going into this tournament and struggling for wins. Yet, the hosts inspired a nation by reaching the quarter-finals. Russian fans celebrate their team scoring against Croatia in the quarter-finals My overriding memory from this World Cup actually belongs to a small bar on a road called Ulitsa Pyatnitskaya, where I watched Russia beat former world champions Spain in a penalty shootout. The streets soon filled with Russians and became a wave of white, blue and red as they partied to the soundtrack of car horns and trumpets long into the night. Yes, France lifted the World Cup trophy on Sunday, but there have been many other victories along the way. Thank you Russia, for hosting a truly memorable World Cup.

"Ms Hernandez survived by drinking water at a nearby creek A US woman whose vehicle plunged off a California cliff has been found alive a week after she was reported missing. Angela Hernandez, 23, survived by using the hose from her jeep's radiator to siphon water from a creek, Monterey County Sheriff's office told the BBC. She was found by hikers on Friday after they saw her vehicle partially submerged at the bottom of a 60m (200ft) cliff in the Big Sur area. Ms Hernandez was conscious but had a shoulder injury, police said. She also appeared to have suffered concussion. She told investigators she had swerved to avoid hitting an animal on Highway 1, California's famed coastal road. She had been driving from her home in Portland to Los Angeles to visit her sister. Ms Hernandez's vehicle plunged down a 60m cliff at Big Sur Monterey County Sheriff's Office spokesman John Thornburg said she was lucky to be alive. ""It's usually the fall that gets them, or the ocean that gets them, and she was lucky to survive both,"" he said. Ms Hernandez would need time to get over her ordeal, her sister Isabel wrote on Facebook. ""This is very traumatic and will be a slow recovery process,"" she said.

"Debenhams has said its cash position is ""healthy"" after reports some insurers have reduced cover for its suppliers. The Sunday Times said,externalthe retailer was facing ""a cash crunch"" because some credit insurers had tightened their terms for Debenhams suppliers. The department store said its relationship with credit insurers was ""constructive"" and all were continuing to provide cover to its suppliers. Suppliers use credit insurance to cover them from the risk of not being paid. When insurance firms reduce their cover or withdraw it altogether, it means they are concerned about the ability of their customers to pay their debts. One major credit insurer, Euler Hermes, is understood to have reduced the amount of credit insurance it will provide to Debenhams' suppliers for orders for the new season. Meanwhile, some new suppliers are believed to have found it difficult to get credit insurance for Debenhams' orders. Debenhams acknowledged market conditions were ""challenging"" but said it had ""a clear strategy in place"" and was taking ""decisive actions to strengthen the business""â. The chain's statement comes a month after it issued itsthird profit warning this year, saying full-year profits would be lower-than-expected. The retailer is in the midst of a turnaround plan designed to cut costs and boost sales. Chief executive Sergio Bucher, who joined Debenhams in 2016, aims to put more emphasis on food and beauty and improve the firm's online platform. Debenhams is not the only retailer struggling. Earlier this week, rival Marks and Spencer, which has already said it will close 100 shops, warned it could be forced toclose more storesas it battles to improve its fortunes. Meanwhile administrators in charge of finding a buyer for the stricken Poundworld chain said on Fridaya further 80 stores would close, resulting in 1,024 job losses.

"This video can not be played President Trump describes EU as a foe in an interview with CBS. US President Donald Trump has described the European Union as a foe on trade. He told CBS News that European countries were taking advantage of the US and not paying their Nato bills. EU Council President Donald Tusk said anyone calling the EU foes was spreading ""fake news"". Mr Trump said he had ""low expectations"" for his meeting on Monday with Russia's Vladimir Putin, which comes after12 Russians were indicted for alleged hackingduring 2016 US elections. Mr Trump said he would raise this issue with Mr Putin at the summit in the Finnish capital, Helsinki, and ""maybe some good"" would come of it. Russia denies the allegations. There have been calls in the US for Mr Trump to cancel his meeting with Mr Putin over the indictments, announced on Friday by US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Sunday also saw a protest march against the summit in Helsinki. Demonstrators chanted ""media must be free"", and carried a banner calling for human rights.

He then returned to the theme of Germany's reliance on Nord Stream 2, a pipeline which will increase the flow of gas to EU states and which he controversially criticised ahead of last week's Nato summit. He said: ""There's a lot of anger at the fact that Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars."" He also accused Germany of ""waving a white flag"".

"The new constitution is expected to be approved by the national assembly next week Cuba will officially recognise private property for the first time in decades under a new constitution featuring far-reaching changes, state media say. Property sales were banned after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, but permitted after a law change in 2011. The communist-run state's new constitution will reaffirm that central planning and state enterprise are key to the economy. It is expected to be approved by a vote at the national assembly next week. The draft constitution would then be put to a popular referendum for final approval later this year. Castro's people - a photographic tour through Cuba Miguel DÃ­az-Canel: The man succeeding the Castros Cuba: What you need to know If it is passed it will replace the existing constitution which was approved by the Communist Party in 1976. Recognising private property could potentially mean more protections under law for private entrepreneurs - and foreign investors. But under the proposed reforms the party will remain as Cuba's dominant political force, the Granma newspaper reports. Presidents, however, will be limited to serving two consecutive five-year terms and political power will be divided between the president and a prime minister. It will ban discrimination based on gender, ethnic origin or disability. LGBT groups are hopeful it will also legalise same-sex marriage. Since 2010, Cuba has undergone a series of market reforms aimed at boosting the island's economy. The national assembly proposed a number of constitutional reforms last month- including presidential term limits and the legalisation of same-sex marriage - as the country moves to decide its political future. Former President RaÃºl Castro will see through the planned reforms The last constitutional reform in 2002 decreed that the socialist character of the political system in Cuba was ""irrevocable"". The intention of the proposed reforms is to constitutionally formalise the island's economic and social opening-up while maintaining this ""irrevocable"" socialist system. President Miguel DÃ­az-Canel announced last month that former President RaÃºl Castro will lead the potential reforms. Mr DÃ­az-Canel took over from Mr Castro as the country's leader in April. The Castro brothers, first Fidel and them Raul, ruled the country between 1959 and 2018.

"A suicide bombing earlier this month killed more than a dozen people in the Afghan city of Jalalabad The number of civilians killed in the long-running war in Afghanistan reached a record high in the first six months of this year, the UN says. Some 1,692 fatalities were recorded, with militant attacks and suicide bombs said to be the leading causes of death. The report comes as at at least seven people were killed in an attack on the rural development ministry in Kabul. Recent attacks claimed by Taliban and Islamic State group militants have killed scores across the country. The figures for the conflict, which began in 2001, are the highest since the UN started keeping records in 2009. The report, by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama), says the number of recorded deaths rose by 1% compared with the same period last year. However, the report adds, injuries fell by 5% to 3,430, and the total number of civilian casualties - accounting for deaths and injuries - dropped by 3% to 5,122. The record high death toll came despite an unprecedented ceasefire by Afghan security forces and the Taliban last month, which was largely respected by both sides, Unama said. Taliban 'threaten 70% of Afghanistan' Cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan UK to send more non-combat troops Earlier this month, Nato leaders gathered at a summit in Brussels to discuss the conflict in Afghanistan. The US has said it is planning a strategic review a year after President Donald Trump agreed to remain involved in the 17-year conflict. The US-led invasion drove the hardline Taliban from power in 2001, as part of a crackdown on Islamist militants after the 9/11 attacks in the US. Thousands of Nato troops were deployed and a long, bloody conflict followed as the ousted militants fought back. In 2014, Nato formally ended the combat mission, handing over to Afghan forces, whom it had trained. Since then, the Taliban have made substantial territorial gains across the country.

"This video can not be played The horsefly slices a small cut in your skin and soaks up the blood Although many of us are enjoying the balmy temperatures of this year's heatwave, unfortunately for some, biting insects are flourishing too. Calls to the NHS helpline 111 about insect bites are almost double the rate they normally are at this time of year. And senior doctors are reporting incidents of patients being treated in hospital for infected horsefly bites. Despite the heat, experts say standing water, such as garden paddling pools, where insects thrive should be removed. Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: ""We wouldn't normally see anyone coming to hospital for a bite, but we have seen a few recently needing treatment with antibiotics which is very unusual. ""A couple of these were infected bites from horseflies. They actually give one of the nastier bites, because they take a chunk out of you. ""They can be very painful, and can take a while to heal, and as result can get infected and need antibiotics. In the worst-case scenario, they can cause cellulitis, an infection of the skin."" According to Public Health England data on calls to NHS 111, about 9,000 people called the helpline on 8 July, around double the baseline figure which is constructed from historical data. This chimes with the Met Office records of the heatwave. Although most of June and July was warm, temperatures peaked between 24 June and 9 July when 28 degrees was recorded somewhere in the UK every day. This happens on average only twice a decade. Prof Adam Hart, an entomologist at Gloucestershire University, said that anecdotally horseflies were on the rise, although there is no hard data to confirm this. ""We had a wet spring, then we've got this beautiful hot weather which are great conditions for a lot of different insects to thrive in."" Horsefly bites are increasing due to the hot weather Dr Daniel Whitmore of the Natural History Museum's insect division agrees: ""Horseflies like hot weather in general, so they may become more active around breeding sites and farms in hot weather. ""Obviously, by wearing fewer clothes in hot weather we expose ourselves to bites more and become more attractive to the flies. ""From personal experience I've noticed that the likelihood of being bitten increases after a dip in the pool (or stream or river): the wet skin probably helps the flies detect us."" But whereas most bites are relatively painless and clear up quickly on their own, the horsefly bite is noticeably more painful and more likely to get infected. 'Rise' in cleg bites amid warm weather Horsefly season: how to avoid being bitten Creating a 'pain index' for insect bites Natalie Bungay, from the British Pest Control Association (BPCA) is advising the public to be pest aware. ""Horsefly bites are particularly painful because their main food source is livestock, which have a limited ability to move the fly away. ""This means they can take their food without having to worry about delivering a painful bite, as the animals are generally powerless to stop them. ""This is as opposed to mosquitoes, which extract blood through a painless bite."" As horseflies and mosquitoes rely on wet and marshy areas to breed, the BPCA is advising the public to remove standing water from near their homes, where possible. If bitten, Dr Scriven advises paracetamol and calamine lotion to reduce itching. After a horsefly bite, the advice is to seek medical attention if the skin starts to get red and you develop a fever.

"Passengers have described the service as ""diabolical"" A troubled rail operator has said it is ""too early to say"" if its third new timetable in two months is causing disruption. Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern passengers have faced disruption since a new timetable began on 20 May. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) said the latest timetable would provide a ""more robust and reliable service"". On Monday it said: ""Our focus is on the evening peak and rest of the week as we introduce the new interim timetable."" Monday is the first working day of the new timetable, which GTR said ""provides passengers with a more robust and reliable service, gives priority to peak hour trains and seeks to reduce gaps in the service"". There has been a mixed reaction from commuters. One St Albans Commuter said: ""I just got on the 8:12. It's running on time and the train is full, but no worse than before the timetable change really."" Another said: ""So far it's looking ok this morning. My fear is the return when trains aren't in the right place for the new timetable."" In Harpenden, Hertfordshire, Charlotte Halkett tweeted that ""there still appear to be huge crowds & delays to trains"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

GTR, which oversees Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern routes, changed the time of every train on its timetable on 20 May, which saw some services withdrawn and further cancellations without any warning. In ahalf-page newspaper advert, initially placed in the Metro newspaper and since then replicated in local papers, it apologised and acknowledged it ""failed to launch new services as planned"" which has resulted in ""significant delays, cancellations and disruption"". A letter published in newspapers said the company apologised ""sincerely and unreservedly"" An interim timetable introduced on 4 June to improve performance saw about 6% of daily services removed, but reliability has continued to struggle. The operator said the changes would mean a 13% increase in services across the GTR network - 400 extra trains a day and new direct services from 80 stations into central London, creating space for 50,000 extra passengers at peak times. Its website said the timetable would continue to evolve over time. ""Once this interim timetable is bedded in, we will look to introduce more services to complete the intended May 2018 timetable,"" it said. A series of failures have been blamedfor causing the chaos, including Network Rail's late approval of the new timetables and delayed electrification projects Poor planning by train operatorshas also been blamed, and the decision by transport ministers to phase in the introduction of new GTR services The damaging impact of the new train timetable was demonstrated inpunctuality figures published by Network Rail on Monday GTR chief executiveCharles Horton resignedlast month Last week in the House of Commons, the government warned improvements to GTR services were ""simply not happening quickly enough"" and the train operator risks losing its franchise.

"This video can not be played Why Tory MPs are fighting over the government's Brexit white paper The government has published its blueprint for UK relations with the EU, with Theresa May saying it ""delivers on the Brexit people voted for"". Thelong-awaited White Paper,externalis aimed at ensuring trade co-operation, with no hard border for Northern Ireland, and global trade deals for the UK. But Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was a ""bad deal for Britain"". And US President Donald Trump said the proposals would ""probably kill"" a trade deal with his country. Trump: Brexit plan could kill US trade deal Reality Check: What does Brexit White Paper reveal? Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan The White Paper fleshes out the Chequers agreement that sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis. The UK is hoping the EU will back the proposals so an exit deal can be struck by the autumn, ahead of the UK's official departure from the EU in March. Dominic Raab is fronting the plans after David Davis quit earlier this week New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, formerly a leading figure in the Leave campaign, said the White Paper was a blueprint for a ""principled, pragmatic and ambitious future partnership between the UK and the EU"". ""Now, it is time for the EU to respond in kind, we approach these negotiations with a spirit of pragmatism, compromise and, indeed, friendship, I hope. I trust that the EU will engage with our proposals in the same spirit,"" he told MPs. Asked in Brussels about US President Donald Trump's claim that the British people were not getting the Brexit they voted for, Mrs May said: ""We have come to an agreement on the proposal we are putting to the European Union which absolutely delivers on the Brexit we voted for. ""They voted for us to take back control of our money, our law and our borders. That is exactly what we will do."" Jacob Rees-Mogg: 'Not what the British people voted for' Leading Tory rebel Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ""There are very few signs of the prime minister's famous red lines. ""It is a pale imitation of the paper prepared by David Davis, a bad deal for Britain. It is not something I would vote for, nor is it what the British people voted for."" Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith told ministers he had ""deep misgivings"" about the White Paper. ""I voted to leave not to half leave,"" he said. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he would analyse the details with the European Parliament and member states and was ""looking forward"" to negotiations with the UK next week.

Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator, said he welcomed the UK's proposal for a future ""association agreement"" with the EU - an idea he has been promoting for some time. He added: ""We will analyse the White Paper in light of our priorities: citizens' rights, an operational backstop for Ireland and a deep economic relationship based on the integrity of the union and internal market."" A free trade zone for goods is at the heart of the proposals CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said ""many of the intentions are reassuring"" but ""there are gaps in these proposals and more detail is needed on EU VAT, some services sectors and the new customs system"". ""It's vitally important UK negotiators get their heads down and work with businesses to grapple with the detail and get it right,"" she added. Federation of Small Businesses national chairman Mike Cherry said: ""With just 37 weeks before we leave the European Union, we need to see tangible and comprehensive details on these proposals and how they will impact small businesses."" Former chief executive of UK Trade and Investment Sir Andrew Cahn told the BBC the City would be hurt by the lack of a deal on financial services, stating: ""It means the City is going to have to change. It's going to have to change quite radically. ""We will clearly lose business, some business, to Europe. But I think the City will adjust and find a way forward."" Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said the White Paper was ""a fudge, which pleases no one and is politically undeliverable"". Lloyd's boss warns on Brexit services plan The proposals were approved by cabinet last Friday but soon led to a big political fallout Some MPs are already calling it a ""hard Brexit"" for services, even though, overall, the deal suggests much closer ties to the rest of the EU than many Brexiteers had desired. For the prime minister and the government it's an important step in spelling out the reality of leaving - more political freedom does, this paper suggests, come at a cost. And it is a compromise, which by its very nature, can't please everyone. Read Laura' full blog This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow and MPs were unhappy at the White Paper's late arrival Dominic Raab's first speech as Brexit Secretary was halted shortly after it had begun, as MPs shouted that they had not seen the White Paper. Mr Raab said the paper would be made available ""as soon as is practicably possible"". Former Labour minister Ben Bradshaw could be seen throwing copies of the document to MPs on his own bench. At which point, Speaker Bercow decided to suspend sitting for five minutes to give MPs time to read it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Raab had ""not got off to a very good start"", adding: ""The utter shambles of the last 20 minutes that led to the suspension of the House during a statement is clear evidence of why the government is in such a mess."" Sir Keir told MPs: ""Across business communities, among trade unions and I genuinely believe across this House there is growing unity that the UK should remain economically close to the EU - and that means negotiating a comprehensive customs union with the EU27, and a single market deal with the right balance of rights and obligations tailored to the UK."" Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who, is campaigning for a referendum on the final EU deal - in contrast to his party's leadership - said the White Paper was ""totally unworkable and a bad deal for Britain"". It sets out four areas of future co-operation: The economic partnership between the EU and the UK Security co-operation Future co-operation in areas like aviation and nuclear power The ""institutional frameworks"" that will enforce the agreement The document repeatedly acknowledges that the UK will have more barriers to trade in some areas than there are today. It sets out plans for what is described as an ""association agreement"",  with ""joint institutional arrangements"" between the EU and the UK. The paper says that the UK will end the free of movement of people, but suggests EU citizens would be allowed to come to the UK without visas to do ""paid work in limited and clearly defined circumstances"". No more detail of this was given by officials on Thursday morning, says BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, but they rejected suggestions that it could open the door to freedom of movement for workers. The paper also suggests that there could be ""reciprocal"" arrangements with the EU for the payment of certain limited benefits or social security. Again, officials denied that this would mean widespread access to the UK benefits systems for EU nationals after Brexit, says our correspondent. Both of these elements will be subject to the upcoming negotiation. As the Chequers agreement set out on Friday, the UK would accept a ""common rule book"" for trade in goods, but not services. The government's aim is to preserve free trade in that part of the economy and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. The White Paper also proposes the setting up of a ""governing body"", made up of UK and EU ministers, and then a ""joint committee"" of officials, which would enforce the agreement. Officially, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK would come to an end. British citizens or businesses would no longer be able to take issues to the European Court of Justice - and the court would no longer be able to make judgements on UK cases. But the White Paper accepts that the European Court of Justice will be ""the interpreter of EU rules"" that the UK has agreed to follow in the ""common rule book"". The White Paper also sets out in more detail the government's proposed customs system, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement for goods and agri-foods, where it plans for the UK to collect some EU tariffs. The paper confirms that the UK will not seek ""mutual recognition"" in the services sector, which makes up the vast majority of the economy. A leaked version of an earlier draft of the White Paper, put together by the Brexit department under David Davis, envisaged that there would be such an arrangement. Some MPs have already expressed concern that by pursuing a looser arrangement with the rest of the EU on services it means a ""hard Brexit"" for the majority of the economy while the goods sector stays closely tied to the single market, although technically not inside it.

This video can not be played Thousands at London demonstration By Jennifer Scott, BBC News Thousands of protesters, mainly women, have flooded the streets of central London in the first of the day's demonstrations against against Donald Trump. The crowd is full of whistles, drums and the all important pots and pans that seem to have become a symbol of this movement. Whilst the mood is jovial, their motivation is serious. Most of those I've talked to are here because of Mr Trump's immigration policies, especially after recent pictures from the Mexican border. There are also countless signs on his attitude to women.

"PM Theresa May has set out her plans for Brexit - but EU bigwigs are in no hurry to comment for now Even the president of the United States now sees fit to weigh in on the Brexit path Theresa May is taking. Donald Trump has said, amongst other things, that if the prime minister is successful in her plan -formalised on Thursday in a White Paper,external- then that would make a future trade deal with the US far less likely. So how come key player Brussels remains so uncannily quiet about the paper? Brussels badgered the UK for months and months and months about coming up with a detailed proposal on how it envisions the future EU-UK relationship after Brexit. Now they have it, surely they have an opinion about it? As far as official responses go, the most we got from Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, was that he and his colleagues now need time to analyse the White Paper in detail. On the one hand: fair enough. It is a very dense document. But I feel the EU is hiding behind the paper's 98 pages of Brexit tech-talk. In private, EU diplomats make no secret at all of their rejection of large chunks of the White Paper. Plan 'delivers the Brexit UK voted for' - May Trump: Brexit plan could kill US trade deal Brussels has said since the beginning of Brexit negotiations that the UK can't pick and choose the ""best parts"" of EU membership and walk away from the rest when it leaves. Yet that's exactly how the White Paper is interpreted in EU circles. There is no way Michel Barnier will accept it as is. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, must calculate the best time to criticise the White Paper For Theresa May to get that ""deep and special"" access to the EU in trade terms, Brussels will certainly expect more concessions. But EU leaders are biding their time. Trying to calculate not if, but when, and how to get their criticisms across. They're very aware of the febrile political atmosphere in the UK and think if they make a quick comment or criticism of the White Paper, they'd be adding fuel to the fire. So if the EU is so keen for a soft Brexit - (of course we know, deep down, it would prefer no Brexit at all) - what concessions is Brussels prepared to make now to help shore up the prime minister's position in the political maelstrom at home? Worryingly few, is the answer if you're a fan of Theresa May or her White Paper. Brussels fears UK turmoil may lead to no-deal Brexit EU wonders if Theresa May has run out of 'Brexit fudge' Brexit: Why Brussels seems relaxed about the end game The EU still believes it holds pretty much all the cards in Brexit negotiations. I don't expect real whiffs of EU concessions before the last minute of the 11th hour this autumn. Can Theresa May hang on till then? And if she can, is she politically strong enough to strike a deal with Brussels and then sell it back home? Frankly, no one knows - and in the meantime, Brussels is stepping up contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. Not because the EU or Downing Street wants that - they really do not - but because the time allotted under EU law for a withdrawal agreement to be agreed and signed off by both parties is fast running out. In the meantime, EU diplomats try to sound upbeat: the White Paper is a great springboard from which to re-start face-to-face Brexit negotiations, they say. Those talks begin again behind closed doors on Monday. Trump and May meet amid Brexit storm May pitches trade deal at Trump dinner What happens now that a deal's been done?

"Dawn Sturgess died last weekend and Charlie Rowley remains in hospital About 400 items have been recovered by police investigating the Novichok poisoning of a couple in Wiltshire. Earlier officers investigating the murder of Dawn Sturgess and poisoning of Charlie Rowley took four vehicles from two locations - a police garage in Swindon and Salisbury ambulance depot. On Friday detectives saidthe fatal Novichok dose came from a bottle found at Mr Rowley's Amesbury house. Police warned searches of the area could last months. Mr Rowley remains critically ill in hospital. Assistant Metropolitan Police commissioner Neil Basu described the poisoning investigations as ""one of the most complex and difficult that UK policing has ever faced"". Mr Basu who is the National Lead for Counter Terrorism (CT) Policing in the UK added: ""The work being carried out is extremely important. ""Not only are we trying to solve an extremely serious crime that has been committed, but we're also working to identify any potential outstanding risks to the public, all whilst ensuring that all those involved in the search process are not themselves exposed to any risk of contamination. ""It is painstaking and vital work, which unfortunately takes a very long time to complete, but I am sure that the public understands why it is absolutely necessary."" The bottle was found at Mr Rowley's home in Amesbury He added searches were being hampered by the hot weather as investigators had to wear protective clothing and were limited to the amount of time they could spend in special suits because of the heat. Work involves taking swabs from surfaces and ensuring the process does not contaminate a wider area, police said. All the items are being transported to the labs at Porton Down for analysis. Tests are ongoing to establish whether the couple were poisoned with the same batch of Novichok poison used in the attack against Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March.

"Passengers have described the service as ""diabolical"" A troubled rail operator has said it is ""too early to say"" if its third new timetable in two months is causing disruption. Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern passengers have faced disruption since a new timetable began on 20 May. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) said the latest timetable would provide a ""more robust and reliable service"". On Monday it said: ""Our focus is on the evening peak and rest of the week as we introduce the new interim timetable."" Monday is the first working day of the new timetable, which GTR said ""provides passengers with a more robust and reliable service, gives priority to peak hour trains and seeks to reduce gaps in the service"". There has been a mixed reaction from commuters. One St Albans Commuter said: ""I just got on the 8:12. It's running on time and the train is full, but no worse than before the timetable change really."" Another said: ""So far it's looking ok this morning. My fear is the return when trains aren't in the right place for the new timetable."" In Harpenden, Hertfordshire, Charlotte Halkett tweeted that ""there still appear to be huge crowds & delays to trains"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Meanwhile, on the Royston to London Kings Cross line, Kieran Walker called the new timetable a ""failure"". ""Cancelations and delays everywhere today,"" he tweeted.

GTR, which oversees Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern routes, changed the time of every train on its timetable on 20 May, which saw some services withdrawn and further cancellations without any warning. In ahalf-page newspaper advert, initially placed in the Metro newspaper and since then replicated in local papers, it apologised and acknowledged it ""failed to launch new services as planned"" which has resulted in ""significant delays, cancellations and disruption"". A letter published in newspapers said the company apologised ""sincerely and unreservedly"" An interim timetable introduced on 4 June to improve performance saw about 6% of daily services removed, but reliability has continued to struggle. The operator said the changes would mean a 13% increase in services across the GTR network - 400 extra trains a day and new direct services from 80 stations into central London, creating space for 50,000 extra passengers at peak times. Its website said the timetable would continue to evolve over time. ""Once this interim timetable is bedded in, we will look to introduce more services to complete the intended May 2018 timetable,"" it said. A series of failures have been blamedfor causing the chaos, including Network Rail's late approval of the new timetables and delayed electrification projects Poor planning by train operatorshas also been blamed, and the decision by transport ministers to phase in the introduction of new GTR services The damaging impact of the new train timetable was demonstrated inpunctuality figures published by Network Rail on Monday GTR chief executiveCharles Horton resignedlast month Last week in the House of Commons, the government warned improvements to GTR services were ""simply not happening quickly enough"" and the train operator risks losing its franchise. Standing in for Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Cabinet Office minister and Aylesbury MP David Lidington said: ""We have launched a review of Govia Thameslink which will report in the next few weeks, and if those findings show that Govia is at fault we won't hesitate to take action whether that's fines, restricting access to future franchises or stripping them of the franchise. ""Passengers deserve far better than they're getting at the moment in terms of service and we will hold those operators to account.""

"The new constitution is expected to be approved by the national assembly next week Cuba will officially recognise private property for the first time in decades under a new constitution featuring far-reaching changes, state media say. Property sales were banned after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, but permitted after a law change in 2011. The communist-run state's new constitution will reaffirm that central planning and state enterprise are key to the economy. It is expected to be approved by a vote at the national assembly next week. The draft constitution would then be put to a popular referendum for final approval later this year. Castro's people - a photographic tour through Cuba Miguel DÃ­az-Canel: The man succeeding the Castros Cuba: What you need to know If it is passed it will replace the existing constitution which was approved by the Communist Party in 1976. Recognising private property could potentially mean more protections under law for private entrepreneurs - and foreign investors. But under the proposed reforms the party will remain as Cuba's dominant political force, the Granma newspaper reports. Presidents, however, will be limited to serving two consecutive five-year terms and political power will be divided between the president and a prime minister. It will ban discrimination based on gender, ethnic origin or disability. LGBT groups are hopeful it will also legalise same-sex marriage. Since 2010, Cuba has undergone a series of market reforms aimed at boosting the island's economy. The national assembly proposed a number of constitutional reforms last month- including presidential term limits and the legalisation of same-sex marriage - as the country moves to decide its political future. Former President RaÃºl Castro will see through the planned reforms The last constitutional reform in 2002 decreed that the socialist character of the political system in Cuba was ""irrevocable"". The intention of the proposed reforms is to constitutionally formalise the island's economic and social opening-up while maintaining this ""irrevocable"" socialist system. President Miguel DÃ­az-Canel announced last month that former President RaÃºl Castro will lead the potential reforms. Mr DÃ­az-Canel took over from Mr Castro as the country's leader in April.

"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2018: Kerber beats Williams to win first Wimbledon title Wimbledon 2018 on the BBC Venue:All England Club, WimbledonDates:2-15 July Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button, Connected TVs and the BBC Sport website and app; Live Radio 5 live and 5 live sports extra commentary; Text commentary online. Angelique Kerber beat seven-time champion Serena Williams to win her first Wimbledon title and spoil the American's dream comeback as a mum. The German 11th seed, 30, beat the 23-time Grand Slam champion 6-3 6-3 to add this title to her 2016 Australian Open and US Open crowns. Williams had been the favourite despite it being only her fourth tournament since giving birth in September. Kerber dropped to the grass when a netted service return gave her victory. ""It is a dream come true,"" said Kerber, who is the first German woman to win the title since Steffi Graf in 1996. ""I know I had to play my best tennis against a champion like Serena. Serena is a great person and a great champion and she is a great inspiration for all of us."" Williams said she had been happy to simply get to the final so soon into her comeback, adding: ""It is obviously a disappointment but I can't be disappointed. I'm literally getting started. ""To the other mums out there I was playing for you today and I tried. But Angelique played really well. I look forward to continuing to be out there and do what I do best."" I'm still contender at Slams - Williams Relive Kerber's victory over Williams Djokovic beats Nadal to reach final Live scores, schedule and results The start to the women's final was delayed by the conclusion of the men's semi-final between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal Kerber, known for her defensive style, came to the match with a more attacking plan in mind - keep the point going and exploit Williams' lack of mobility around the court. And it paid off handsomely with the 36-year-old's dashes to the net ending in errors half of the 24 times she came forward. The German former world number one showed her intent in the first game, breaking the Williams serve that forms the backbone of her game. Williams broke back to level at 2-2 before Kerber re-established the advantage in the seventh game when the American hit long, and she took the set when Williams sent a backhand into the net. Kerber stuck with her tactics in the second set, breaking in the sixth, and the sight of Williams falling to the ground in frustration when she missed a straightforward lob for 30-0 when Kerber was serving for the match summed up her day. The German struck a forehand winner to bring up championship point and sealed the victory on the next point when Williams could only return a serve into the net. Overcome by the magnitude of what she had achieved against a player who beat her in the 2016 Wimbledon final, Kerber collapsed on to the ground and covered her eyes, while Williams came over to her side of the net to share a warm embrace. Williams had been seeking to become just the fourth mother to win a Grand Slam title in the Open era Williams, like Kerber, had dropped just one set on her way to the final but she had also faced only one player ranked in the top 50 here before Saturday's showpiece. Despite her world ranking of 181 and special seeding of 25, she has been favourite for the title, with pundits and players pointing to the potent combination ofher intimidating aura- created by titles, fitness and mental strength - and the fact that her power game is perfectly suited to the fast surface of grass. However, Kerber did not let her play that game with Williams managing just four aces and hitting 24 unforced errors as the German bided her time and capitalised on the fact her opponent was not quite back to her best 10 months after giving birth to her daughter. Williams, in fact, hit more than twice as many winners as the German (23-11) but was let down by some rash forehands and below-par net play in front of a packed Centre Court, where her friend the Duchess of Sussex was watching from the Royal Box. It means her bid for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title must wait until next month's US Open at least. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2018: Watch an emotional Serena Williams react to final defeat Billie Jean King,six-time Wimbledon champion on BBC TV: ""After that very first game, you could see Kerber thinking 'woah, this is great, good start'. You could see it in her body language, she really settled in. ""Kerber was so consistent. Keeps getting one, two, three, four balls back, and when Serena's not had that match play... ""Serena could never get any rhythm, if you can keep her out there long enough, keep the rallies long, and see how fit she is... she looked a bit like she was sucking it up, out of breath a few times. Kerber always gets that one more ball back."" Martina Navratilova,nine-time Wimbledon singles champion on BBC TV: ""More balls came back, Kerber returned Serena's serve well. Serena didn't get the payoff from her ground strokes, tried to hit harder and made more errors. ""She came to the net more often which she doesn't do a lot. ""Kerber has a shot at being world number one. She will get so much confidence from this win, so you have to look at her as one of the favourites. The year is so young.""

"Mr Lafontant was accused of mishandling the fuel reforms The Prime Minister of Haiti, Jack Guy Lafontant, has resigned after days of violent protests against fuel price rises. In a speech in the lower house of Congress in the capital, Port-au-Prince, he said President Jovenel MoÃ¯se, had accepted his resignation. There had been calls for a vote of no-confidence in Mr Lafontant in Congress during the riots. At least four people were killed with shops and buildings burnt and looted. The unrest started after the government unveiled a proposal to remove fuel subsidies. Haiti protests in pictures This would have increased the price of petrol by 38%  diesel by 47% and kerosene by 51%. The capital, Port-au-Prince, was immobilized and dozens of shops and businesses attacked. Demonstrators marched through the streets of Port-au-Prince to protest against the government Thousands of Haitians took to the streets to protest for three days The government responded by suspending the reforms. In February, the country signed an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to carry out structural reforms to promote growth. The IMF argued getting rid of the fuel subsidies would free up cash for other things like education, health and job creation. But many of the protestors accused the government of being out of touch with their economic difficulties in one of the world's poorest countries. A government spokesman said the suspension of the fuel price rises was temporary while the political crisis was tackled. But opposition MPs in Congress warned that if the price increases were reinstated there would be more violence and protests on the streets. The IMF suggested on Thursday ""a more gradual approach"" to ending fuel subsidies which were expected to generate around $300m (Â£226m). There were also fuel protests in 2015 where demonstrators demanded a reduction in prices.

"This video can not be played The horsefly slices a small cut in your skin and soaks up the blood Although many of us are enjoying the balmy temperatures of this year's heatwave, unfortunately for some, biting insects are flourishing too. Calls to the NHS helpline 111 about insect bites are almost double the rate they normally are at this time of year. And senior doctors are reporting incidents of patients being treated in hospital for infected horsefly bites. Despite the heat, experts say standing water, such as garden paddling pools, where insects thrive should be removed. Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: ""We wouldn't normally see anyone coming to hospital for a bite, but we have seen a few recently needing treatment with antibiotics which is very unusual. ""A couple of these were infected bites from horseflies. They actually give one of the nastier bites, because they take a chunk out of you. ""They can be very painful, and can take a while to heal, and as result can get infected and need antibiotics. In the worst-case scenario, they can cause cellulitis, an infection of the skin."" According to Public Health England data on calls to NHS 111, about 9,000 people called the helpline on 8 July, around double the baseline figure which is constructed from historical data. This chimes with the Met Office records of the heatwave. Although most of June and July was warm, temperatures peaked between 24 June and 9 July when 28 degrees was recorded somewhere in the UK every day. This happens on average only twice a decade. Prof Adam Hart, an entomologist at Gloucestershire University, said that anecdotally horseflies were on the rise, although there is no hard data to confirm this. ""We had a wet spring, then we've got this beautiful hot weather which are great conditions for a lot of different insects to thrive in."" Horsefly bites are increasing due to the hot weather Dr Daniel Whitmore of the Natural History Museum's insect division agrees: ""Horseflies like hot weather in general, so they may become more active around breeding sites and farms in hot weather. ""Obviously, by wearing fewer clothes in hot weather we expose ourselves to bites more and become more attractive to the flies. ""From personal experience I've noticed that the likelihood of being bitten increases after a dip in the pool (or stream or river): the wet skin probably helps the flies detect us."" But whereas most bites are relatively painless and clear up quickly on their own, the horsefly bite is noticeably more painful and more likely to get infected. 'Rise' in cleg bites amid warm weather Horsefly season: how to avoid being bitten Creating a 'pain index' for insect bites Natalie Bungay, from the British Pest Control Association (BPCA) is advising the public to be pest aware. ""Horsefly bites are particularly painful because their main food source is livestock, which have a limited ability to move the fly away. ""This means they can take their food without having to worry about delivering a painful bite, as the animals are generally powerless to stop them. ""This is as opposed to mosquitoes, which extract blood through a painless bite."" As horseflies and mosquitoes rely on wet and marshy areas to breed, the BPCA is advising the public to remove standing water from near their homes, where possible. If bitten, Dr Scriven advises paracetamol and calamine lotion to reduce itching. After a horsefly bite, the advice is to seek medical attention if the skin starts to get red and you develop a fever.
