"The attack happened as services were ending, reports said A masked gunman was stopped mid-attack by an ""extraordinarily brave"" church usher after killing one person near Nashville, Tennessee. The suspect shot and injured himself during a struggle with 22-year-old Robert Caleb Engle, who was struck in the face by the suspect's gun. But Mr Engle managed to get back to his car and get his own gun to guard the injured attacker until police arrived. Police said 42 people were in the church at the time of the attack. A woman, named as 39-year-old Melanie Smith of Smyrna, was found dead in the car park near the suspect's car. Nashville Police said the suspected attacker at the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ was Emanuel Kidega Samson, 25, who was originally from Sudan. Two pistols were recovered in the church and two more guns were found in Samson's car nearby. They added that the gunman shot himself in the chest ""probably not intentionally"" during the struggle with Mr Engle. He was later released from hospital and charged with murder. At least six people were also wounded, all of whom were aged over 60. The usher was also treated for head injuries after the altercation. The motive for the shooting is not yet clear. Police say the shooter was Emanuel Kidega Samson ""It would appear he was not expecting a brave individual like the church usher to initiate the struggle and confrontation,"" Nashville Police spokesman Don Aaron said. Police said Mr Engle acted in an ""extraordinarily brave"" way. In a statement Mr Engle said: ""I do not want to be labelled a hero. The real heroes are the police, first responders and medical staff and doctors who have helped me and everyone affected."" The church's pastor, Joey Spann, and his wife Peggy were among those injured in the shooting, the Nashville Christian School said. Mr Spann teaches at the school. One eyewitness,speaking to the Tennessean newspaper,,externalsaid the pastor had shouted ""run"" as the suspect entered, but some were shot from behind. ""Our church is senior people. They didn't make it out,"" Minerva Rosa told the paper.

"This video can not be played Leaders and protesters react to the election result German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been re-elected for a fourth term while nationalists have made a historic surge in federal elections. Her conservative CDU/CSU bloc has seen its worst result in almost 70 years but will remain the largest in parliament. Its current coalition partner, the social democratic SPD, says it will go into opposition after historic losses. The nationalist AfD has won its first seats and is set to be the third party, a result that sparked some protests. Dozens of demonstrators gathered outside the right-wing, anti-Islam party's headquarters in Berlin on Sunday night, some with placards saying ""Refugees are welcome"". Protests were also held in several other cities, including Frankfurt and Cologne. While her alliance has remained the largest party, it is the worst result for the alliance between the Christian Democrat (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) since 1949, when national elections were held in Germany for the first time after World War Two. Addressing supporters, Mrs Merkel, who has been in the job for 12 years, said she had hoped for a ""better result"". She added that she would listen to the ""concerns, worries and anxieties"" of voters of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in order to win them back. Why this vote is a turning point What does Alternative for Germany (AfD) want? Mrs Merkel also said her government would have to deal with economic and security issues as well as addressing the root causes of migration - one of the main reasons behind the AfD's result. ""Today we can say that we now have a mandate to assume responsibility and we're going to assume this responsibility calmly, talking with our partners of course."" A chaotic day for German politics: Jenny Hill, BBC News, Berlin It has been a long and bruising election campaign. Angela Merkel may have won the election but it does not feel like much of a victory. This election will go down in the history books for two reasons. Mrs Merkel may have won a fourth term but it is her worst-ever general election result. And right-wing nationalists are now part of the German establishment. The result is a verdict, perhaps, on Mrs Merkel's decision to open Germany's doors to one million refugees. What is the political norm in many other European countries was considered unthinkable in post-war Germany. Not any more. Read more from Jenny The Social Democrats (SPD) also had their worst election result since 1949. The party's loss of support while junior partner in government saw leader Martin Schulz declare the end of the ""grand coalition"" with Mrs Merkel's alliance, to cheers and applause. ""It's a difficult and bitter day for social democrats in Germany,"" Mr Schulz told supporters. ""We haven't reached our objective."" He also vowed to prevent the AfD from being the main opposition party. Mrs Merkel will have to find new coalition partners after Martin Schulz (left) said his SPD would go into opposition With the possibility of an alliance with the SPD rejected, Mrs Merkel's options are narrow, and the process of forming a new coalition could take months. Six parties will be in the German parliament for the first time since the 1950s. Election marks unprecedented shift Long read: Angela Merkel's quiet power The most likely scenario is of a ""Jamaica"" coalition, so-called because of the colours of Jamaica's flag. It includes the black CDU/CSU, the yellow, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) - who are returning to parliament after a four-year hiatus - and the Greens. It is not a marriage made in heaven, as the Greens want to phase out 20 coal-fired power plants and the FDP disagree, but it is the only formation that would guarantee enough seats in the new Bundestag, German broadcaster ZDF says. All parties have rejected working with the AfD. The party is expected to take 94 seats in the 709-seat federal parliament after capitalising on a backlash against Mrs Merkel's policy towards migrants and refugees, many of them from war-torn, mainly Muslim countries like Syria. Alternative for Germany was founded in 2013 as an anti-euro party but later turned its focus to immigration and Islam. It called for a ban on minarets and declared Islam incompatible with German culture. Several of its candidates have been linked to far-right remarks. Those hardline positions helped it to win seats in 13 of Germany's 16 state parliaments in the last few years. Protesters took to the streets to voice their opposition to AfD Prominent AfD figure Frauke Petrysaid on Twitter (in German),externalthat Germany had experienced an incomparable ""political earthquake"". The party's performance was better than forecast in opinion polls. It performed particularly well in what was formerly East Germany, taking 21.5% of the vote as the second most popular party. This video can not be played German post-war politics in two minutes Beatrix von Storch, one of the party's leaders, told the BBC that the result would change the political system in Germany, giving ""a voice"" to the people she said were not represented in the last parliament. ""We'll start debates on migration, we'll start debates on Islam, we'll start debates on ever closer union."" AfD calls for stricter asylum rules to curb abuse of the system, including vetting of claims in countries of origin that are deemed ""safe"".

"This video can not be played A Muslim surgeon tells how he was attacked on the way to a mosque A doctor who was stabbed in the neck on his way to a mosque in a suspected hate crime said he ""feared the worst"". Consultant surgeon Dr Nasser Kurdy was attacked outside the Altrincham and Hale Muslim Association at about 17:50 BST on Sunday. Dr Kurdy, who has been discharged from hospital, said he has ""forgiven"" his attacker and feels ""no negative emotions"". Two men, aged 32 and 54, are being held for questioning over the attack. The 58-year-old was on his way to the mosque, where he is the vice-chairman and has led prayers, when the incident happened. The orthopaedic surgeon, who works at Wythenshawe Hospital, said it was a ""total shock"" but added it ""could've been much worse"". ""From my profession I know that you get a blow like that, invariably it's a stabbing even though you don't feel a cut,"" he said. ""There's a lot of vital structures in that area and some of them can be fatal, there's no two ways about it, and some of them can be very disabling."" When asked about reportedly Islamophobic comments shouted at the time of the attack, Dr Kurdy said he can't divulge anything as his statement is with the police. Greater Manchester Police have asked for any witnesses to come forward. Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said it was a ""nasty and unprovoked attack"" to a ""much-loved"" man. Dr Khalid Anis, a spokesman for the mosque, said: ""It could have been very, very serious...We understand it was a knife, he is very lucky. ""It's a very unified town so for this to happen like this in the street, it is frightening."" Dr Kurdy is an orthopaedic surgeon Akram Malik, chairman of the Altrincham and Hale Muslim Association, added: ""It is devastating that someone has chosen to attack a community member, on his way to prayer. ""We pray that Dr Kurdy makes a full recovery and the perpetrator faces the full force of justice."" Iftikhar Awan, who attends the mosque with his wife and children, said the community was ""in a state of shock"". ACC Jackson added: ""People will want to know why the attacker did this and we are treating this as a crime motivated by hate."" He said there would be an increased police presence in the areas to ""reassure local people"". The Muslim Council of Britain said it was shocked by the attack and urged the government to implement its ""hate crime action plan"". Mosque stabbing surgeon relives attack.

"""A hair's breadth from catastrophe"", local police say A quick-thinking French tourist has been praised for preventing a bus from plunging over a cliff in the Austrian Alps after the driver passed out. The vehicle was travelling through the mountains in the Tyrolean Alps with 21 passengers on board when the driver, 76, collapsed, police say. As the bus continued towards a steep cliff, the Frenchman was able to brake. The bus crashed into a barrier at the side of the road and came to a stop. Four people were taken to hospital. The passenger, a 65-year-old Frenchman, was sitting close to the driver when he became ill near the city of Schwaz in western Austria on Saturday, local media report. He then leapt from his seat as the vehicle crashed through the wooden roadside guardrail and applied the brake, leaving the bus full of passengers hanging over the cliff edge a short distance from a 100m (328ft) drop. ""We were a hair's breadth from catastrophe,"" a local police spokesman said, adding it was ""incredible luck"" that the passenger's reflexes had managed to stop the bus, AFP news agency reports.

Players have been protesting at racial injustice and perceived police violence. Warning: This article contains language some readers may find offensive.

"Four fire crews tackled the blaze on the M62 A large fire involving a mobile crane closed both carriageways of the M62 in Greater Manchester on Sunday evening. Four fire crews arrived at the blaze on the westbound carriageway between junction 21 for Milnrow and junction 20 for Rochdale at about 20:30 BST. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said the heat had caused the vehicle's tyres to explode. The fire had been put out by 01:00, Highways England said. Earlier, the fire service said a hazardous materials officer had been sent to the motorway because diesel had leaked onto the carriageway. ""Four fire engines from Heywood, Rochdale and Chadderton were mobilised to a fire involving a mobile crane on the M62 westbound carriageway,"" it added in a statement. ""The vehicle was well alight on arrival of crew and the heat had caused the vehicle's tyres to explode, which could be heard across parts of Rochdale and Oldham."" Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus tackled the fire with two hose reels, the fire service said. Greater Manchester Police and the Highways Agency initially closed both carriageways.

"The Labour leadership has insisted its approach to Brexit is ""grown-up and pragmatic"" as it faced opposition from some activists at its conference. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said customs union and single market options should not be ""swept off the table"" at this stage. He accused the Tories of ""joyriding"" the economy ""off a cliff-edge"". But he faced claims that by not opposing Brexit Labour were letting the Tories ""do what they want"". Members in Brighton discussed Brexit for an hour on Monday morning amid a row over why more time was not being given to the issue after it was not chosen by delegates among eight policy motions for full debate. The focus of the session was about building agreement around Labour's existing policy and there will be no vote on contentious issues such as the future of single market membership. Conference Live: Video and text updates Kuenssberg: Brexit differences won't ruin the party Corbyn pushes back on single market Labour promises women's retirement reform But a number of Labour members criticised the party's pro-Brexit stance, suggesting they were giving the government a free ride. Cameron Clack, from Stamford and Grantham, said Labour had ""voted away"" its chance to keep the UK in the single market and customs union, telling activists we ""will be remembered as the opposition that let the Tories to do what they want with Brexit"". ""We're supposed to be a party of outward-looking, internationalist, democratic socialists,"" he said. But Sir Keir Starmer said that rather than laying down ""rash ideological red lines"" during the negotiations, Labour had settled on an agreed position which respected the result of last year's referendum but prioritised the economy and trade in exit talks. Failing to reach any kind of deal with the EU was not a ""viable option"", warning that continued collaboration and co-operation was vital. By Laura Kuenssberg What the shenanigans over a debate at Labour conference on the contentious issues around Brexit really shows us is who has the whip-hand now in the party. The Corbyn-backing campaign group Momentum organised its members to choose subjects other than Brexit to be debated fully at the conference this week. It wasn't directly snuffed out by the leadership, it was a vote of delegates, but they act to protect their political hero. Brexit is essentially the only big issue where Jeremy Corbyn is in conflict with the Labour membership. Motions that advocated membership of the single market or continuing freedom of movement clashed with the party's carefully constructed position on the EU and therefore would have given Corbyn's team a rough ride on the conference floor. Read more ""Labour are now the grown-ups in the room,"" Mr Starmer said, insisting that ""remaining in a form of customs union after a transition post-Brexit phase remained a ""possible end destination"" for the party. ""We are also flexible as to whether the benefits of the single market are best retained by negotiating a new single market relationship or working up from a bespoke trade deal,"" he added. ""The outcome is what matters."" This video can not be played Confused about Labour's position on Brexit? Labour has faced accusations it is downplaying the issue during its conference but shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Labour's front bench were ""all pulling in the same direction"" over Brexit. Earlier, shadow chancellor John McDonnell insisted Labour was not trying to ignore the issue but the leadership had ""no control"" over issues chosen by members to be voted on, which include housing, rail, the NHS and pay but not Europe. ""The delegates choose their priorities and that is what they have done,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""The leadership does not control that at all... the whole point of our party now is to hand our party back to the membership."" This video can not be played Emily Thornberry: ""I know that Boris doesn't like paternity tests, but maybe we need one for Brexit"" The Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Momentum group had urged its members not to support a resolution on Brexit, emailing them with an alternative list of subjects to choose - including the Grenfell Tower tragedy, rail, growth and investment, workers' rights and social care. Several Labour MPs tweeted their displeasure at suggestions Brexit was being downplayed. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that while minimising the opportunities for conflict might be seen as ""politically clever"", given the divisions in the party over Brexit, she said many MPs would find the situation ""frustratingly vague"". Burnham: Labour is too London-centric Labour pledges law to cut credit card debt But Hove activist Darryl Telles said a Stop Brexit protest on the first day of conference was intended to ""undermine"" Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. ""I remember the Monty Python sketch, the parrot is dead, it doesn't exist, it has ceased to exist. You have as much chance of stopping Brexit as Jeremy Corbyn has of wearing my Tottenham shirt."" Although Labour's ruling NEC will finalise an agreed statement on Brexit that delegates will be allowed to vote on this afternoon in an attempt to defuse tensions, it will not commit the party to single market membership beyond the transition period.

"The rape happened in a lane near Trongate in Glasgow A 22-year-old man was raped in a lane after leaving a Glasgow nightclub in the early hours of Sunday. The serious sexual assault took place between Parnie Street and Trongate at about 03:40. The male suspect was described as black. No further description has been given. Police said the victim met the man after leaving the venue. Police have been examining CCTV footage and conducting door-to-door inquiries. They have appealed for witnesses.

"Changes to women's retirement age sparked widespread protests Labour would allow hundreds of thousands of women born in the 1950s to retire at 64 on a reduced state pension, rather than wait until 66. Government changes to the retirement age have been ""chaotic"", shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams will tell Labour's conference later. Many women who expected to retire at 60 must now work several years longer before receiving a state pension. Ms Abrahams will say her plan would mean pension security for thousands. Her change would benefit women born between 1954 and 1960. ""This will ensure that those who have suffered the consequences of this government's chaotic mismanagement of the state pension age have the security they need,"" she will tell the party's conference in Brighton. ""We will continue to work with these women to get justice."" Many women were caught by surprise when the timetable for moving to a later retirement age was accelerated in 2011. The Waspi - Women Against State Pension Inequality - campaign is pushing for a transitional ""bridging pension"" to help women whose retirement plans have been thrown into disarray. Labour has already promised to extend pension credit to the women affected. In its manifesto for the June general election, the party said it was ""exploring options for further transitional protections to ensure that all these women have security and dignity in older age"". Precise financial details were not immediately available, but Ms Abrahams will say the scheme would be ""cost-neutral in the long term"". Ms Abrahams will also call for a pause in the roll-out of universal credit, to allay fears that claimants will be plunged into poverty as it is extended across the country over the next 12 months. She argues that there is evidence of ""deepening poverty"" as more welfare claimants are transferred to universal credit, which replaces a range of older benefits. She will cite reports that one in four claims are not paid within six weeks, leading to increased debt and mounting rent arrears.

"The complex rescue operation took about six hours Rescuers had to squeeze through an ""hourglass"" gap to get to a man who was stuck in an old mineshaft. Andrew Williams from Wales fell 50ft (15m) down a disused mineshaft in Cornwall and suffered serious injuries say police. The 51-year-old walker was airlifted to hospital after the fall in the Cot Valley near St Just in Cornwall. About 50 rescuers took six hours to bring the man to safety through the narrow constriction in the mine. More on the mine rescue, and other Devon and Cornwall news Mr Williams had been walking on the coastal path with a group of other people who raised the alarm on Sunday. Mark Grantham of Cornwall Search and Rescue said: ""He was stuck on quite a precarious ledge. ""To get him out we had to come through this kind of hourglass constriction which made it a lot more difficult."" Coastguard recue teams from Penzance and Lands End were involved The man fell from a coast path in far west Cornwall It is believed he fell after going to explore the mine and stepping on a wooden cover which gave way.

"This video can not be played A Muslim surgeon tells how he was attacked on the way to a mosque A doctor who was stabbed in the neck on his way to a mosque in a suspected hate crime said he ""feared the worst"". Consultant surgeon Dr Nasser Kurdy was attacked outside the Altrincham and Hale Muslim Association at about 17:50 BST on Sunday. Dr Kurdy, who has been discharged from hospital, said he has ""forgiven"" his attacker and feels ""no negative emotions"". Two men, aged 32 and 54, are being held for questioning over the attack. The 58-year-old was on his way to the mosque, where he is the vice-chairman and has led prayers, when the incident happened. The orthopaedic surgeon, who works at Wythenshawe Hospital, said it was a ""total shock"" but added it ""could've been much worse"". ""From my profession I know that you get a blow like that, invariably it's a stabbing even though you don't feel a cut,"" he said. ""There's a lot of vital structures in that area and some of them can be fatal, there's no two ways about it, and some of them can be very disabling."" When asked about reportedly Islamophobic comments shouted at the time of the attack, Dr Kurdy said he can't divulge anything as his statement is with the police. Greater Manchester Police have asked for any witnesses to come forward. Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said it was a ""nasty and unprovoked attack"" to a ""much-loved"" man. Dr Khalid Anis, a spokesman for the mosque, said: ""It could have been very, very serious...We understand it was a knife, he is very lucky. ""It's a very unified town so for this to happen like this in the street, it is frightening."" Dr Kurdy is an orthopaedic surgeon Akram Malik, chairman of the Altrincham and Hale Muslim Association, added: ""It is devastating that someone has chosen to attack a community member, on his way to prayer.

Jenny HillBBC Berlin correspondent Angela Merkel looked exhausted,
strained, as she arrived at her party headquarters this evening. Emerging from
her car,  she arranged her face into a smile - first for the cameras and then for
the party faithful at the CDU headquarters. The chancellor knew sheâd most likely win this election. But itâs not
the victory she or her party had hoped for. Itâs the conservatives' worst
election result under her leadership. A verdict, perhaps, on her decision to open
Germanyâs doors to a million refugees. Read more from Jenny here Early official results from the eastern state of Saxony show - albeit with five of 16 districts in - that the AfD has so far got the most party votes. Germans have two votes at the election - the first to choose the local candidate of their choice, the second to choose their preferred party. Chancellor Merkel's CDU/CSU alliance looks set to have won the election with its second smallest share of the vote of the post-war era. Despite being the largest party, the CDU/CSU won around 33% of the vote. Only in 1949, when the party won 31% under Konrad Adenauer (but still led the next government of then-West Germany) have the conservatives captured such a small share of the vote at a federal election.

"Bomb disposal experts were called to the scene An unknown flammable material, thrown from a motorway bridge, caused the closure of the M3 which led to major travel disruption, police have said. Thousands of motorists were caught up in long queues on the motorway and surrounding roads in Winchester. A bomb disposal team was sent to the scene of the closure between junctions nine and 11 at Winchester on Saturday. However, the material was found not to be explosive. It is not being treated as a terror incident, officers added. The motorway was closed in both directions from about 04:00 BST, but had fully reopened by about 15:30. Motorists took to social media to share pictures of the scene Hampshire Constabulary said officers had been working with the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team to establish exactly what the material was that was thrown from the bridge leading to St Catherine's Hill. It said assessments were ongoing. Police said they were also investigating a similar case on the same bridge at about 04:00 on 16 September, when an object was dropped onto the carriageway and there were also reports of a fire. On that occasion officers found ""a quantity of broken glass"" but no fire. No-one was hurt on either occasion. The closure led to queues of up to three miles in each direction on the M3 Police said there was ""no wider risk to public safety"" following Saturday's disruption, which led to queues of up to three miles (nearly 5km) in both directions on the M3. Manchester United and Southampton FC fans were among those held up. United fan Paul Hibbert resorted to leaving the coach he was travelling to St Mary's Stadium on and made the one-and-a-half-mile (2.4km) final leg of the journey by foot.

Dame Kelly, who lives in Kent, won gold in the 800m and 1,500m competitions in Athens in 2004. She said just a year earlier she was ""cutting"" herself regularly ""to release the anguish"" she experienced. Dame Kelly said: ""At my lowest, I was cutting myself with scissors every day that I was injured."" She opened up about her experience with depression at the new Health and Wellbeing Live show near Tonbridge on Saturday. At the event, Dame Kelly shared an image taken immediately after an injury during the world championships in 1997. It was one of seven injuries that led her to self-harm. Dame Kelly, who joined the army at 17 before becoming an athlete, has previously spoken of how she hid her depression for fear of negativity but said it needed to be ""shouted about more"".

""But my biggest message to people is that you can get out of that and you can still achieve. ""There is always a light at the end of the tunnel."" Middle distance runner Dame Kelly celebrated two golds at the Athens Olympics in 2004 Becky Randall, co-founder of Health & Wellbeing Live, said: ""[Kelly] struggled but she kept going.

"This video can not be played The Labour leader told Andrew Marr he supported workers asking for a decent public sector pay rise Jeremy Corbyn has promised to listen to Labour members' calls to keep the UK in the EU single market - but warned it could hamper the government's ability to protect jobs and invest in industry. The Labour leader said EU restrictions on state aid and pressure to privatise sectors like rail could cause problems. He also predicted ""a lot"" of people would continue to come from the EU to work in the UK after Brexit. Mr Corbyn was speaking on day one of the Labour conference in Brighton. Boosted by Labour's better-than-forecast general election result in June, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he wanted 10 years in office to implement Labour's agenda, saying at least two electoral terms would be needed to address challenges on housebuilding and inequality. Setting the scene for Labour conference Burnham: Labour is too London-centric More than 40 senior party figuressigned an open letter,externalto the Observer urging Mr Corbyn to commit to remaining in the European single market and customs union after Brexit. But delegates in Brighton have rejected demands from a number of constituencies for a vote on single market membership during the conference. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said that, in practice, it means there will be no vote on one of the most contentious issues in the party. Labour has already said it would keep the UK in both agreements during a transitional period. Theresa May has suggested a two-year timeframe for a transition period, but Mr Corbyn said Labour's version would last ""as long as necessary"". It is ""impossible"" to say at this stage how long it would be, he argued. Pro-EU protesters marched in Brighton as the Labour conference got under way Asked about his plans beyond this period, Mr Corbyn said the ""important priority"" was seeking tariff-free trade access to the EU's markets, and that it was necessary to ""look very carefully"" at the terms of any trade deal to avoid restrictions on state aid, citing the UK's steel industry as an example. ""We need to be quite careful about the powers that we need as national governments,"" he said. Mr Corbyn wants to return a number of key industries, including the railways, to public ownership, but says EU competition laws present significant obstacles to that. One of the signatories to the letter, former minister Ben Bradshaw, told BBC News remaining in the market was ""the only place we can sensibly be if we want to save the economy, end austerity and pursue the sort of vision of Britain that Jeremy Corbyn says he wants"". The customs union is the EU's tariff-free trading area, which imposes the same taxes on imports from certain countries outside the union. The single market also includes the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. Speaking at the Labour conference, Stephen Kinsella, a lawyer specialising in EU law, said he was ""puzzled and slightly troubled"" by Mr Corbyn's comments about state aid. ""I think what we see in the UK is too often government refers to EU law as an excuse, as a reason for not investing. But it could do so, and it could do so within the law,"" said Mr Kinsella, who is a Labour Party member. The letter urging long-term commitment to the single market and customs union, co-ordinated by the Open Britain campaign, was signed by both Blairite and left-wing MPs, along with some prominent trade union leaders. It said: ""The supposed benefits of a clean break with the EU are a fantasy. ""The economic impact of leaving the single market would hit the most vulnerable in our society hardest."" Mr Corbyn is also facing calls to maintain the free movement of EU workers after Brexit from some Labour members, despite this being ruled out in Labour's general election manifesto. ""Manifestos evolve and change,"" MP Clive Lewis, one of those pushing for the matter to be debated at conference, told the Sunday Politics. But fellow Labour MP Caroline Flint said she did not think maintaining the current arrangements ""would be acceptable to British people"". Asked about free movement, Mr Corbyn said he understood ""the importance of workers moving from one place to the other"", but some employers had ""grotesquely exploited"" the system to pay EU workers very low wages. ""That has to stop. But we have to recognise that in the future we're going to need people to work in Europe, and people from Europe are going to need to work here. There's going to be a lot of movement."" In his Marr interview, Mr Corbyn also promised an end to the public sector pay cap. He would not commit to the 5% increase called for by some, but promised workers a rise in line with inflation - currently 2.9% - in addition to recognition of the ""sacrifice"" they had made in recent years. The Labour leader side-stepped questions about whether he would support illegal strike action by public sector workers against the cap, as backed by his ally, Unite leader Len McCluskey. A new law requires a 50% turnout for successful strike ballots, but Unite is calling for co-ordinated action across sectors regardless of the threshold reached. Repeatedly pressed on whether he would back unions defying the law, Mr Corbyn said: ""I will be with those workers demanding a decent pay rise."" But speaking on Sky News, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the party would not back unions in such circumstances. ""I have actually received a letter from Len McCluskey this week where he says he accepts Labour MPs aren't going to support calls for illegal strike action,"" he said. Mr McCluskey confirmed that was the case, saying he did not expect support from the party's leadership or any of its MPs. ""I know that they are opposed to the current law and they will do all that they can inside Parliament to change this law,"" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday.

"This video can not be played Leaders and protesters react to the election result German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been re-elected for a fourth term while nationalists have made a historic surge in federal elections. Her conservative CDU/CSU bloc has seen its worst result in almost 70 years but will remain the largest in parliament. Its current coalition partner, the social democratic SPD, says it will go into opposition after historic losses. The nationalist AfD has won its first seats and is set to be the third party, a result that sparked some protests. Dozens of demonstrators gathered outside the right-wing, anti-Islam party's headquarters in Berlin on Sunday night, some with placards saying ""Refugees are welcome"". Protests were also held in several other cities, including Frankfurt and Cologne. While her alliance has remained the largest party, it is the worst result for the alliance between the Christian Democrat (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) since 1949, when national elections were held in Germany for the first time after World War Two. Addressing supporters, Mrs Merkel, who has been in the job for 12 years, said she had hoped for a ""better result"". She added that she would listen to the ""concerns, worries and anxieties"" of voters of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in order to win them back. Why this vote is a turning point What does Alternative for Germany (AfD) want? Mrs Merkel also said her government would have to deal with economic and security issues as well as addressing the root causes of migration - one of the main reasons behind the AfD's result. ""Today we can say that we now have a mandate to assume responsibility and we're going to assume this responsibility calmly, talking with our partners of course."" A chaotic day for German politics: Jenny Hill, BBC News, Berlin It has been a long and bruising election campaign. Angela Merkel may have won the election but it does not feel like much of a victory. This election will go down in the history books for two reasons. Mrs Merkel may have won a fourth term but it is her worst-ever general election result. And right-wing nationalists are now part of the German establishment. The result is a verdict, perhaps, on Mrs Merkel's decision to open Germany's doors to one million refugees. What is the political norm in many other European countries was considered unthinkable in post-war Germany. Not any more. Read more from Jenny The Social Democrats (SPD) also had their worst election result since 1949. The party's loss of support while junior partner in government saw leader Martin Schulz declare the end of the ""grand coalition"" with Mrs Merkel's alliance, to cheers and applause. ""It's a difficult and bitter day for social democrats in Germany,"" Mr Schulz told supporters. ""We haven't reached our objective."" He also vowed to prevent the AfD from being the main opposition party. Mrs Merkel will have to find new coalition partners after Martin Schulz (left) said his SPD would go into opposition With the possibility of an alliance with the SPD rejected, Mrs Merkel's options are narrow, and the process of forming a new coalition could take months. Six parties will be in the German parliament for the first time since the 1950s.

It includes the black CDU/CSU, the yellow, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) - who are returning to parliament after a four-year hiatus - and the Greens. It is not a marriage made in heaven, as the Greens want to phase out 20 coal-fired power plants and the FDP disagree, but it is the only formation that would guarantee enough seats in the new Bundestag, German broadcaster ZDF says. All parties have rejected working with the AfD. The party is expected to take 94 seats in the 709-seat federal parliament after capitalising on a backlash against Mrs Merkel's policy towards migrants and refugees, many of them from war-torn, mainly Muslim countries like Syria. Alternative for Germany was founded in 2013 as an anti-euro party but later turned its focus to immigration and Islam. It called for a ban on minarets and declared Islam incompatible with German culture. Several of its candidates have been linked to far-right remarks.

"Tachographs are installed in lorries to ensure safety for drivers and other road users More than 440 lorries crossing into the UK last year were found with manipulated tachographs, Britain's road regulator has said. Tachographs are on-board digital recorders which keep track of the number of hours a driver has been on the road. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency believes a further 400 drivers were cheating, some using sophisticated ""interrupters"" to switch off the lorries' tachographs, but couldn't prove it. The DVSA suspects that haulage bosses could be behind the use of the devices because they are complicated to install and are often found in more than one lorry from the same company. ""The results of falling asleep at the wheel of 44-tonne lorry can be devastating to families and communities,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Anything that means a driver can drive tired and we might not know about it or stop it is a worry. That's what we are here for, to keep the roads safe."" The DVSA carried out 223,000 roadside checks between April 2016 and March 2017. 5 live Investigates discovered there was a 21% increase in the number of drivers found with manipulated tachographs during that period compared with the previous year. The tachograph interrupters are being used mainly by European drivers who cross into the UK. One Bulgarian driver discovered with a manipulated tachograph in north Wales in March had driven 23 hours non-stop. There is added danger because the interrupters disable a lorry's advanced braking systems and speedometers when they are being used. The Department for Transport said there were 400,000 HGVs licensed in the UK at the end of 2016 and estimates there are 20,000 foreign registered HGVs in the UK at any given time. Dean Allan's mother, Diana, was killed by a driver who ploughed into the back of her car when he fell asleep at the wheel of his lorry. Claudiu-Ioan Almasan was jailed for causing death by dangerous driving. He had not been driving over his permitted hours nor had he cheated his tachograph when he hit Mrs Allan's car, but he had stayed up late on the night before the crash. ""He was waiting for a phone call from his wife in another country and he'd stayed up late that evening to take the call, but he started his shift early the next morning,"" said Mr Allan. ""He didn't deliberately set out to do what he did on the day - he was too tired. "" Local investigations suggest the use of the interrupters is higher than that found by the DVSA. Sgt Steve Warren has been involved in a recent operation which arrested and charged 22 drivers who had been using the devices in Nottinghamshire. ""Unfortunately, some of these drivers are not earning a lot of money,"" he said. ""And they are telling us they are getting pressure from the company to use the device. I think they are readily available now and there are a lot more fitted to the vehicles."" This video can not be played The device enables drivers to stay on the road for longer and switches off speed limiters Road transport unions and trade bodies say hauliers from other European countries will risk getting caught with the technology because the penalties here are small, often a Â£300 fixed penalty. But British companies whose drivers get caught manipulating their tachographs can be taken off the road by the Traffic Commissioner, which licenses hauliers in England, Scotland and Wales. A European Commission initiative, called the European Register of Road Transport Undertakings, means an offence committed by a driver in one European country can lead to the closure of that driver's company in his or her home country. But 5 Live Investigates found no evidence that the powers have ever been used in the five years the system has been working. Neither Portugal nor Poland - whose drivers were caught 55 and 467 times last year respectively while driving with falsified tachographs on UK roads - have connected to the computer network yet. The European Commission is taking legal action against those countries, and Luxembourg, for not setting it up. The commission told 5 Live Investigates the system was being actively used to swap intelligence, but admitted take-up had been lower than expected. It said it was up to member states to use the system to enforce road offences committed in other countries. 5 live Investigates: Tachographsis broadcast on BBC Radio 5 live on Sunday 24 September at 11:00 BST.

"Hungry yet? They have been around for hundreds of years but now Yorkshire puddings have found themselves thrust into the culinary spotlight. This week aBBC video about a Yorkshire pudding wrap,externalwas viewed more than 13 million times online, making the dish and how to eat it a real talking point. It's polarised opinion, with some saying it's food heaven and others claiming it is sacrilege and food hell. But what's behind the revival of this humble recipe? And who is qualified to say how it's best eaten? The Yorkshire pudding is made from asimple batter of eggs, flour and milkand needs to be light yet crispy and well-risen. The general rule is that the fat - often dripping or goose fat - needs to be red hot in the tin before the batter is added, avoiding the much-feared soggy bottom. According to Yorkshire food historian Peter Brears, the recipe first appeared in a book called The Art Of Cookery by Hannah Glasse in 1747. She *whisper* came from Northumberland. As for how it got its name, Mr Brears said it is likely to have come from Yorkshire miners, who worked incredibly hard but were well paid enough to be able to afford meat and be given free coal to keep a fire going. ""A fire and roasted meat were essentials for making Yorkshire pudding,"" he said. It started to be taken up as a Yorkshire symbol in the 1890s when it started appearing on postcards - yes, postcards. From then on, well, it is just folklore. The Yorkshire pudding is usually made in a rectangular tin and cut into squares to be served with a roast dinner. It can also be made with whole sausages cooked within it, a dish known as toad-in-the-hole. The baked batter treat is believed to have been originally served as a starter with gravy. That way diners were filled up before the main course so whoever was feeding them could get away with serving less meat. Some people also like to eat it cold the next day with jam. So far, so good. For the uninitiated, that's the basics covered. But if the idea of eating something called a ""pudding"" with a savoury course isn't mind-bending enough, how about trying it in even more exotic forms from wraps to burritos? The wraps have been on sale for a while, with a stall dedicated to selling them in Leeds Kirkgate Market and a cafe in York has reportedly had customers queuing out of the door for one since being featured in the online video.

The Yorkshire pudding burrito is also a thing, which is possibly similar to a wrap but with more stuffing. Both feature the elements of a roast dinner encased in a fluffy light batter wrap, and are proving extremely popular. Earlier this month it was reported a diner in Beverley, Hull, was serving aYorkshire pudding pizza.,externalThe huge pudding is used as a base before a layer of sausage and tomato is added with a cheese topping. Not quite as traditional maybe, but does it work? Maybe the proof of the pudding really is in the eating. Mr Brears who has published several books on the history of food and worked with The National Trust and English Heritage, said the thought of a Yorkshire wrap reminds him of how it was eaten as factory food in the mid to late-19th Century. Yorkshire pudding wraps have been on sale in Leeds Kirkgate Market since last year He said: ""When you'd have your Sunday roast you would always cook more potatoes and more veg, and when you went to the mill you took a basin with meat and potatoes and gravy in the bottom and a piece of Yorkshire pudding on top. ""You would wrap it up and then during the day you would stand it on the steam pipes to warm it up."" Commenting on the BBC News video, Alice Elizabeth Ruggiero said: ""My grandmother was a true Yorkshirewomen, she served individual puddings before a dinner of stew - she filled the pudding with the gravy and we ate it like a starter with the meat and vegetables after. It was delicious."" Shona Court said: ""I want our town to have a least three of these places. I would be in heaven as, according to my son, I don't have blood, I have gravy!!!!"" The Yorkshire pudding wrap is basically a roast dinner, wrapped in a Yorkshire Not everyone is a fan. Jan Starkey Dean said: ""Isn't anything sacred anymore, why does everything have to be on the go? Are people so busy they can't sit down to eat? I think a lot of it is laziness."" And Patricia Pope said: ""Think I will stick with the traditional Sunday roast beef dinner and Yorkshire pudding sitting down at the dinner table so that I can enjoy it thoroughly."" US resident Jim Cotton said: ""As an American I must admit we don't understand Yorkshire pudding (although I had some once in the UK and enjoyed it). Love them or hate them, you can't go on social media this week without seeing one ""But this does look great. Maybe a new franchise operation in central Texas?"" Camden Gilbreath added: ""I'm American, I had no idea what a Yorkshire pudding was and not super clear on the broad definition of the word ""pudding"" in the English language, because I think creamy slightly gross dessert. ""All that said call it whatever you will that looks just delicious, idk [I don't know] what a regular Yorkshire pudding looks like but man that looks good all wrapped up."" These tasty treats make pretty good sporting props, it turns out. Across the Pennines in Ramsbottom they are used as targets in the annualWorld Black Pudding Throwing Championships, which celebrates the historic rivalry between Lancashire and Yorkshire. In Ramsbottom, contestants throw black puddings at a stack of Yorkshire puddings on a high platform Contestants throw black puddings with the aim of knocking off as many Yorkshire puddings as possible from a 20ft (6m) platform. Last year on Yorkshire Day, aYorkshire pudding throwing contestwas held in York to celebrate the region. They made the sport headlines in April, when Sheffield'sDanny Willett,who won last year's opening major of the year, promised to include Yorkshire pudding on the menu of the Masters Champions Dinner. Staying in sport, the parents of triathletesJonny and Alistair Brownleejoke that the secret of their sons' success is ""roast beef and Yorkshire puddings"".

her car,  she arranged her face into a smile - first for the cameras and then for
the party faithful at the CDU headquarters. The chancellor knew sheâd most likely win this election. But itâs not
the victory she or her party had hoped for. Itâs the conservatives' worst
election result under her leadership. A verdict, perhaps, on her decision to open
Germanyâs doors to a million refugees. Read more from Jenny here Early official results from the eastern state of Saxony show - albeit with five of 16 districts in - that the AfD has so far got the most party votes. Germans have two votes at the election - the first to choose the local candidate of their choice, the second to choose their preferred party. Chancellor Merkel's CDU/CSU alliance looks set to have won the election with its second smallest share of the vote of the post-war era. Despite being the largest party, the CDU/CSU won around 33% of the vote. Only in 1949, when the party won 31% under Konrad Adenauer (but still led the next government of then-West Germany) have the conservatives captured such a small share of the vote at a federal election.

"This video can not be played North Koreans rally against ""dotard psycho Trump"" US President Donald Trump has made new threats against North Korea in response to the country's foreign minister's fiery speech at the UN on Saturday. Ri Yong-ho described Mr Trump as a ""mentally deranged person full of megalomania"" on a ""suicide mission"". The US president responded by saying Mr Ri and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ""won't be around much longer"" if they continue their rhetoric. The fresh insults came as US bombers flew close to North Korea's east coast. The Pentagon said the aim was to demonstrate the military options available to the US to defeat any threat.

It said the flight was the farthest north of the demilitarised zone between the Koreas that any US fighter jet or bomber had flown in the 21st Century. Tensions have risen recently over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. Despite weeks of angry words, experts have played down the risk of direct conflict between the two. However, there are concerns that the escalating rhetoric could lead to one side misinterpreting the other, with dangerous consequences. Should you worry? What weapons does North Korea have? How a Pacific nuclear test might happen Kim's 'dotard' insult explained Ri Yong-ho'scomments,externalto the General Assembly on Saturday mimicked Mr Trump's remarks at the UN on Tuesday, when he called North Korean leader Kim Jong-un a ""rocket man on a suicide mission"". Mr Ri said that ""insults"" by Mr Trump were an ""irreversible mistake making it inevitable"" that North Korean rockets would hit the US mainland. The US president, the foreign minister said, would ""pay dearly"" for his speech, in which he also said he would ""totally destroy"" North Korea if the US was forced to defend itself or its allies. The bombers staged a show of force close to North Korea's east coast Shortly before his address, the Pentagon announced that the show of force underscored ""the seriousness"" with which the US took North Korea's ""reckless"" behaviour, calling the country's weapons programme a ""grave threat"". ""This mission is a demonstration of US resolve and a clear message that the president has many military options to defeat any threat,""it said in a statement.,external ""We are prepared to use the full range of military capabilities to defend the US homeland and our allies."" US Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers from Guam, escorted by Air Force F-15C Eagle fighters from Okinawa, Japan, flew in international airspace, the Pentagon added.

This video can not be played Trump is making the US an 'inevitable target' Mr Ri did not comment on the Pentagon's announcement. North Korea has refused to stop its missile and nuclear tests, despite successive rounds of UN sanctions. Its leaders say nuclear capabilities are its only deterrent against an outside world seeking to destroy it. After the North's latest and most powerful nuclear test earlier this month, the UN Security Council approved new sanctions on the country.

"This video can not be played ""My car's only got two seats"" - David Davis responds to Boris backseat driving accusations Theresa May's key EU speech was not influenced by Boris Johnson's article on the UK's future, the Brexit secretary has said. The foreign secretary has been accused of undermining the PM with a 4,000-word piece setting outhis own vision. Some reports have claimed Mr Johnson threatened to resign if his blueprint for Brexit was not followed. But David Davis said the policy in Mrs May's Florence speech ""had been coming for a long time"". Theresa May declared on Friday she would seek a transitional period after Brexit in 2019, suggesting it could last for about two years. The Sunday Express is reporting the periodwould have been longer,externalhad it not been for Mr Johnson's intervention six days ahead of her speech. The Observer, meanwhile, claims he forced herto take the so-called ""Norway model"",externaloff the table - a model which could have seen the UK pay for continued access to the single market. What did we learn from Theresa May's Florence speech? UK must clarify Brexit issues - Macron But Mr Davis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I don't think there's been any change of policy in the last few weeks."" He said the government had begun designing some aspects of Mrs May's speech on transition ""right back at the beginning of the year"". Several Sunday newspapers contain fresh allegations of splits in the cabinet. The Sunday Telegraphreports that Mr Johnson,externalis now demanding that EU rules are not applied to the UK during the transitional period, while the Sunday Times has publishedclaims of a leadership plot,externalinvolving Mr Davis, Mr Johnson, Chancellor Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Amber Rudd following June's general election. Last week, Ms Rudd accused Mr Johnson of ""back-seat driving"" over Brexit with his article. Asked about those remarks, Mr Davis would not be drawn, but joked: ""My car's only got two seats."" Speaking on Marr, Mr Davis went on to say the government would not ""under any circumstances"" accept the ""overarching supremacy"" of the European Court of Justice after the UK leaves the EU, but judges would be allowed to interpret the European treaty and look at European decisions. ""The aim with the withdrawal treaty would be to have British citizens in Europe and European citizens in Britain treated broadly similar,"" he said. ""They won't be exactly the same because they're in different countries under different legal systems but as similarly as we can."" Mr Davis denied reports that the UK faced a Â£40bn ""divorce bill"" for leaving the EU. He said it would be ""roughly"" Â£10bn a year over two years, and claims in Brussels that the final settlement once pensions and other liabilities were taken into account could be double that amount were ""made up"". ""Things like pensions and other things, these are debatable to say the least,"" he said. ""The last time we went through line by line and challenged quite a lot of the legal basis of these things and we'll continue to do that."" In her speech in Florence on Friday, the prime minister sought to reassure member states that they would not lose out financially during the current EU budget period - which runs to 2020 - as a result of the UK's departure. Mrs May also confirmed there would be no restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK during the transition period, but that after Brexit they would be registered as they arrive. But the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, accused the UK of ""cherry-picking"", saying that a ""new registration mechanism for EU citizens going to live and/or work in the UK is out of the question"". Mr Davis disputed that, arguing Britain would be ""outside of European law by then"" so the matter would be up for negotiation, and registration would be the UK's ""intention"".

Players have been protesting at racial injustice and perceived police violence. Warning: This article contains language some readers may find offensive.

"The portrait of the Duke of Buckingham dates from around 1625 A ""lost"" portrait by Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens has been rediscovered after almost 400 years. The 17th Century Flemish artist's ""head study"" of the Duke of Buckingham was identified by Dr Bendor Grosvenor from BBC Four's Britain's Lost Masterpieces. It was in Glasgow Museums' collection and on public display at the city's Pollok House stately home. But overpainting and centuries of dirt meant it was thought to be a later copy by another artist. The restored portrait of George Villiers, the 1st Duke of Buckingham, was authenticated as a Rubens by Ben van Beneden, director of the Rubenshuis in Antwerp. He said it was a ""rare addition to Rubens's portrait oeuvre, showing how he approached the genre"". Dr Grosvenor said:  ""The chance to discover a portrait of such a pivotal figure in British history by one of the greatest artists who ever lived has been thrillingly exciting."" This video can not be played Over-painting and centuries of dust were removed to reveal Rubens' original artwork Councillor David McDonald, chairman of Glasgow Life, said: ""Unsurprisingly we are beyond delighted to discover the painting is by Rubens, an artist renowned globally as one of the most important painters in history."" The portrait of the duke in a doublet with an elaborate lace collar and a sash dates from around 1625. He was a controversial figure in the Jacobean era who rose from minor nobility to become one of the favourites of James I, who was James VI in Scotland. The nature of their relationship has been the source of much debate. Some experts claim they were lovers, while others believe it was a close platonic friendship. The nature of the relationship between King James I (above) and the Duke of Buckingham has been the subject of much debate Renovation work carried out by English Heritage atApethorpe Palace,externalin Northamptonshire, one of the king's favourite residences,revealed a secret passage linking the two men's bedchambers,external. The Duke was assassinated in 1628 at the age of just 35, three years after James died. Overpainting of the background and other areas by a later artist, along with hundreds of years of dust and dirt, had obscured Rubens' work. But scientific analysis of the wood it was painted on dated it to the 1620s, and found it had been prepared in a way done by Rubens' studio. Additional cleaning and x-rays of the hair showed it was not a copy but was by the artist himself. The painting underwent conservation work by restorer Simon Gillespie to return it to its original appearance. It will go on display at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow on Thursday. The painting will feature in the first programme of the new series of Britain's Lost Masterpieces at 21:00 BST on BBC Four on 27 September.

On Saturday morning the president took to Twitter to fire off line after line attacking the NFL - and athletes in any sport who may have taken issue with his earlier comments. This is a fight Mr Trump relishes. He knows his base will flock to him when he questions the patriotism of wealthy athletes. Lines about tax cuts and healthcare reform on Friday night were duds. No-one cared much when he spoke of striking deals with Democrats. The president knows his audience. And he knows how to change the subject.

"Elwin Hawthorne, Phyllis Bray, John Cooper, Brynhild Parker: Four members of the East London group of artists started by Cooper, an inspirational teacher Two exhibitions open this month devoted to a group of working class artists from the East End of London who became art world celebrities in the late 1920s and 1930s - only to be forgotten after World War Two. They were known as the East London Group, and among their ranks were humble office clerks, a navvy, a window cleaner, a shop assistant, a printer, a basket-weaver and an errand boy. Now they're being rediscovered, with one exhibition devoted to their work in Southampton, and another, curated by the children's author Michael Rosen and radio producer Emma-Louise Williams, on their home turf of Bow in East London. Elwin Hawthorne was able to depict the North Foreland Lighthouse for Shell once he and the Steggle brothers began to travel around the country Though they had no formal art school training, the paintings they produced were highly sophisticated. Encouraged by an inspirational teacher, John Cooper, at evening classes in Mile End and Bow, they painted what they saw around them in London's industrial, poverty-stricken East End, finding the extraordinary in the everyday. For the most part, their subjects were smog-shrouded scenes of canals, railway bridges, terraced houses and scrubby back gardens. There's no traffic in their pictures, and very few people, giving them an eerie, slightly surreal quality. And their paintings are a valuable record of a world long since vanished thanks to the wartime Blitz and post-war redevelopment. Harold Steggles with the car bought thanks to the brothers' success Harold Steggles (left) worked as a solicitor's clerk, his brother Walter worked for a shipping firm For eight years in the 1930s they staged an annual exhibition at one of London's most prestigious commercial art galleries, Alex Reid & Lefevre in Mayfair.  Wealthy art collectors bought the group's paintings and critics raved about them. David Buckman, who has written a book about the group, says they received enormous press coverage in leading newspapers like The Times and the Daily Mail. ""They were well received, and received as equals,"" he says, pointing out that two of the group were invited to exhibit paintings at the 1936 Venice Biennale alongside many of Britain's leading artists. The Southampton show has been curated by Alan Waltham, whose interest in the group was sparked because two of its members were his wife's uncles. Hawthorne's Demolition of Bow Brewery immortalises a world now disappeared Cecil Osborne's Sunday Morning Harold Steggles worked as a solicitor's clerk; his brother Walter worked for a shipping firm.  Each day they commuted into the City from Romford and later Chadwell Heath, returned to have their tea and then, three evenings a week, travelled back into the East End for Cooper's classes. Albert Turpin had multiple jobs from fireman to mayor but sketched whenever he could Their sister Dilly, Waltham's mother-in-law and now aged a frail 100, remembers they had a ""studio"" - one room in the family home - and sometimes let their little sister watch them at work. Had she wanted to paint too? I asked her.  ""Me? No! I couldn't paint a daffodil!"" she says. The brothers' success meant they were able to buy a car (a Ford built at nearby Dagenham) and with their friend Elwin Hawthorne and his wife Lilian, who were fellow members of the group, they broadened their range by travelling round the country to paint. Grove Hall Park, Bow by Harold Steggles All three men contributed images to Shell's famous series of posters depicting English scenes - Cookham in Berkshire in Walter's case, Bungay in Suffolk in Harold's, while Hawthorne's picture was of North Foreland lighthouse in Kent. Another leading member of the group was Albert Turpin, window cleaner, wartime fireman and war artist, firebrand socialist, Labour councillor and post-war Mayor of Bethnal Green. His work is at the centre of the second exhibition at Bow's Nunnery Gallery. Michael Rosen says the group's work is fascinating because of their insistence on painting what they saw in unfashionable places. ""Why paint shabbiness?  It's perverse.  But that's what makes their work interesting and really rather wonderful."" Walter Steggles's painting of Canvey Island Turpin's daughter, Joan Barker, who was adopted by Turpin and his wife Sally aged two at the end of the war, recalls a man who was forever sketching: his family, his fellow councillors and the streets around him.  After the war he made a point of sketching buildings due for demolition, and their replacements as they went up. Barker has her father's pre-war scrapbook, full of newspaper clippings about Councillor ""Dick"" Turpin and his run-ins with the law as he fought Oswald Mosley's fascist agitators.  And she has his post-war sketchbooks and several of his paintings. Elwin Hawthorne's Cumberland Market: Once a major hay market, it became an attractive area for artists But sadly much of his work has vanished.  After her father's death in 1964, her mother decided to clear out the shed at the family's Bethnal Green flat.  Most of her father's paintings from the 1920s, 30s and 40s were burnt. But it's not just Turpin's work that has disappeared. Waltham, who runs a Twitter feed devoted to promoting the group, says more than 700 East London Group paintings were exhibited in the 1930s.  He has been able positively to locate just 113 of them. Some may have been destroyed.  But many others may be hanging unrecognised on walls or sitting in attics up and down the country, still waiting to be rediscovered. From Mile End to Mayfair at Southampton City Art Gallery runs until January.  The Working Artist at the Nunnery Gallery in Bow, East London opens on 29 September.

"Over the past year, we've been exploring50 key things that have contributed to the development of the modern economy, including inventions such asthe diesel engine,the battery,the shipping container,Google,antibioticsandthe Billy bookcase. But what did we miss? What should be the 51st thing that made the modern economy? We've received hundreds of suggestions, which we've whittled down to a shortlist of six. You can vote for your favourite, and the winner will feature ina special programme and podcaston 28 October 2017. The first option of our six traces its history to 1960, in Minnesota in the US. Dorothea Parry was ironing when her husband, Forrest, came home from work at the computer giant IBM. How was his day? Well, he had a problem. IBM had worked out how to encode information on magnetic strips. They wanted to fix the strips to plastic cards. But he couldn't work out how. Dorothea could. She ironed them on. Behavioural economists say we spend differently on plastic compared with cash The addition of the magnetic stripe was a huge boost for credit cards, which were just a few years old and struggling for acceptance. Merchants shown a Diners Club or American Express card had to phone the bank. IBM's magnetic strip paved the way for a far less cumbersome approach. The new credit cards were pushed aggressively. And people soon found that having a ""flexible friend"" could make us drop our financial guard: behavioural economists tell us that spending on plastic is psychologically much easier than spending cash. The price of convenience has been ballooning household debt. But it's hard to imagine the modern economy without them. Our second suggestion also requires heat to manufacture, but a household iron won't do the job. You need temperatures of 1,700C to make glass. Who first did that is lost to history, but they probably lived in Egypt, Syria or Mesopotamia, about 5,500 years ago. Did they look at sand and have an unlikely brainwave: ""I wonder what would happen if we melted it?"" Or did they discover glass by accident, perhaps while smelting bronze? Who knows? But it's safe to bet that the early glassmakers could never have predicted how it would shape the economy. And if you choose glass as the 51st thing, my challenge will be choosing how to tell its story. Glass touchscreen technology has driven the development of smartphones and tablets Perhaps you're reading this on a touchscreen device, accessing the internet via fibre-optic cables. Is that the story of glass? Or I could focus, so to speak, on the lens - how the telescope and microscope changed our knowledge of the world. Spectacles, windows, or fibreglass could each fill an episode of their own. One of the real challenges when choosing my list of 50 was that so many inventions overlap, one bright idea later enabling another. The story of clocks, for example, concluded by observing that GPS wouldn't work without extremely accurate timekeeping. But many of you felt that GPS deserves a story of its own, and that's our third possibility. GPS technology has revolutionised transportation If you've got a smartphone, it probably has a GPS receiver. There are 31 satellites flying around the Earth right now, constantly transmitting their position and the time. If your phone can pick up signals from at least four of them, it can do some clever maths to work out where it is, and plot its position for you on a map. Like many of our 50 things, GPS has military origins: the US Department of Defense developed it to win the Cold War. Now, in turn, GPS is enabling bright ideas that will make the economy of the future - new business models that connect buyers and sellers, and new technologies such as self-driving vehicles, robots and drones. The fourth item on our shortlist begins with an old story about a flood. It's not the Judaeo-Christian tale of Noah's Ark, but the Chinese story of Emperor Yu, the founder of China's first dynasty 4,000 years ago. Noah floated on the waters, but Emperor Yu tamed them, recruiting an army of labourers - along with a dragon and a giant turtle - to assist in setting up irrigation and drainage. The traditional irrigation system used in Bali's Jatiluwih rice fields has Unesco world heritage status Great Yu changed China, and irrigation continues to shape our economy, from California, where arguments rage over the most valuable use of scarce water, to Bali, where the intricacy of the water-management system has astonished visiting experts. The only woman to receive a Nobel Memorial Prize in economics, Lin Ostrom, spent much of her life studying irrigation systems. Ostrom was fascinated by how humans cooperate to manage common resources. There are few more important questions than that - and few better case studies than how we decide who gets how much water, as it trickles - often crossing borders - from the hills down to the sea. Paperwas one of our 50 things. Should we add the pencil to the list? It does have a special place in the history of economic thought. In 1958, the libertarian economist Leonard Read published an essay calledI, Pencil,external, in which an ordinary pencil explained the miracle of its existence. The humble pencil can demonstrate the sophistication of the modern globalised economy The pencil boasted cedar from Oregon which had been milled in California, graphite from Sri Lanka, a brass ferule, a rubber made from Italian pumice and Indonesian rape-seed oil, and more besides. Leonard Read's point was that in a modern economy, behind even the humblest of objects was a tale of international supply chains, complex manufacturing, capital investment and science. No one person can make a pencil from scratch, yet the miracle of market forces makes pencils available for pennies. The pencil is a small enough player on the global scale - but a perfect way to understand the sophistication of the modern economy. Time for one more idea, plucked from a list of hundreds. But where did we store that list? On a spreadsheet, of course. Or perhaps I should say, 'On a digital spreadsheet' - because pencil-and-paper spreadsheets used to be ubiquitous. The accountants of the 1970s would fill out row upon row of cost and revenue assumptions. A single change might require hours - or even days - with a calculator, a pencil and a rubber. Spreadsheets transformed accountancy and made extremely sophisticated analysis possible The first electronic spreadsheet, VisiCalc, came in 1979. It was the brainchild of Dan Bricklin - a computer-savvy student at Harvard Business School. He fantasised about creating a spreadsheet that would recalculate itself. His software revolutionised finance. Wall Street and the City of London started trading financial products that could hardly be said to exist - let alone be comprehended - without a spreadsheet. It reshaped accountancy, destroying the jobs of clerks who had pored over paper spreadsheets. But it created new jobs for analysts, exploring one scenario after another. We increasingly understand the world around us through numbers, and the digital spreadsheet deserves much of the credit for that. You can vote for one of the six things listed above on the50 Things That Made the Modern Economy programme website, where you can also see the full terms and conditions. Voting closes at 12:00 GMT on Friday 6 October 2017, and the winning 51st thing will be announcedin a special programme and podcast on 28 October 2017.

"This video can not be played Footage of police and other emergency services around Stratford has been shared on social media Six people have been injured in Stratford, east London, in a reported acid attack. Police were called to Stratford Centre, opposite Westfield, just before 20:00 BST, following an ""altercation"" between two groups of males where a noxious substance was thrown. Ambulance crews treated six males at the scene for their injuries, and three of them were taken to hospital. A 15-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. Those reported injured were believed to be in a number of different locations, sparking initial fears that people had been sprayed at random. However, the Met Police said those injured were connected to the initial attack. Ch Supt Ade Adelekan said: ""I would like to be very clear concerning this incident. ""What initially may have been perceived as a number of random attacks has, on closer inspection, been found to be one incident involving two groups of males."" No-one suffered life-threatening or life-changing injuries. Witnesses at the scene said an argument had broken out among a group of people. A man who gave his name as Hossen, an assistant manager at Burger King, said a victim had run into the fast food chain to ""wash acid off his face"". One man said a victim ran into a Burger King to ""wash acid off his face"" The 28-year-old added: ""There were cuts around his eyes and he was trying to chuck water into them."" Tahseen Taj lives in one of the buildings just opposite the shopping centre and was disturbed by the noise. ""I could hear a lot of ambulances and police from around 20:45, but also there's a West Ham match today; I thought it must be a football brawl,"" she said. ""But after some time it just increased and increased, and there were a lot of fire brigades and ambulances and police, and it was quite chaotic to be honest. ""I was quite worried.""

"This video can not be played Leaders and protesters react to the election result German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been re-elected for a fourth term while nationalists have made a historic surge in federal elections. Her conservative CDU/CSU bloc has seen its worst result in almost 70 years but will remain the largest in parliament. Its current coalition partner, the social democratic SPD, says it will go into opposition after historic losses. The nationalist AfD has won its first seats and is set to be the third party, a result that sparked some protests. Dozens of demonstrators gathered outside the right-wing, anti-Islam party's headquarters in Berlin on Sunday night, some with placards saying ""Refugees are welcome"". Protests were also held in several other cities, including Frankfurt and Cologne. While her alliance has remained the largest party, it is the worst result for the alliance between the Christian Democrat (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) since 1949, when national elections were held in Germany for the first time after World War Two. Addressing supporters, Mrs Merkel, who has been in the job for 12 years, said she had hoped for a ""better result"". She added that she would listen to the ""concerns, worries and anxieties"" of voters of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in order to win them back. Why this vote is a turning point What does Alternative for Germany (AfD) want? Mrs Merkel also said her government would have to deal with economic and security issues as well as addressing the root causes of migration - one of the main reasons behind the AfD's result. ""Today we can say that we now have a mandate to assume responsibility and we're going to assume this responsibility calmly, talking with our partners of course."" A chaotic day for German politics: Jenny Hill, BBC News, Berlin It has been a long and bruising election campaign. Angela Merkel may have won the election but it does not feel like much of a victory. This election will go down in the history books for two reasons. Mrs Merkel may have won a fourth term but it is her worst-ever general election result. And right-wing nationalists are now part of the German establishment. The result is a verdict, perhaps, on Mrs Merkel's decision to open Germany's doors to one million refugees. What is the political norm in many other European countries was considered unthinkable in post-war Germany. Not any more. Read more from Jenny The Social Democrats (SPD) also had their worst election result since 1949. The party's loss of support while junior partner in government saw leader Martin Schulz declare the end of the ""grand coalition"" with Mrs Merkel's alliance, to cheers and applause. ""It's a difficult and bitter day for social democrats in Germany,"" Mr Schulz told supporters. ""We haven't reached our objective."" He also vowed to prevent the AfD from being the main opposition party. Mrs Merkel will have to find new coalition partners after Martin Schulz (left) said his SPD would go into opposition With the possibility of an alliance with the SPD rejected, Mrs Merkel's options are narrow, and the process of forming a new coalition could take months. Six parties will be in the German parliament for the first time since the 1950s. Election marks unprecedented shift Long read: Angela Merkel's quiet power The most likely scenario is of a ""Jamaica"" coalition, so-called because of the colours of Jamaica's flag. It includes the black CDU/CSU, the yellow, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) - who are returning to parliament after a four-year hiatus - and the Greens. It is not a marriage made in heaven, as the Greens want to phase out 20 coal-fired power plants and the FDP disagree, but it is the only formation that would guarantee enough seats in the new Bundestag, German broadcaster ZDF says. All parties have rejected working with the AfD. The party is expected to take 94 seats in the 709-seat federal parliament after capitalising on a backlash against Mrs Merkel's policy towards migrants and refugees, many of them from war-torn, mainly Muslim countries like Syria. Alternative for Germany was founded in 2013 as an anti-euro party but later turned its focus to immigration and Islam. It called for a ban on minarets and declared Islam incompatible with German culture. Several of its candidates have been linked to far-right remarks. Those hardline positions helped it to win seats in 13 of Germany's 16 state parliaments in the last few years. Protesters took to the streets to voice their opposition to AfD Prominent AfD figure Frauke Petrysaid on Twitter (in German),externalthat Germany had experienced an incomparable ""political earthquake"". The party's performance was better than forecast in opinion polls. It performed particularly well in what was formerly East Germany, taking 21.5% of the vote as the second most popular party. This video can not be played German post-war politics in two minutes Beatrix von Storch, one of the party's leaders, told the BBC that the result would change the political system in Germany, giving ""a voice"" to the people she said were not represented in the last parliament.

"More than 50 years after her iconic turn as Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's, Audrey Hepburn's style is attracting the attention of a new generation of fashion lovers. A collection of the actress's little black dresses, trench coats and a sleeping mask are among thousands of personal items on display at Christie's in central London. Almost 500 lots are to be sold in the coming weeks, but it was not only potential buyers browsing the auction house as the exhibition opened on Saturday. A younger generation - many born after Hepburn's death nearly 25 years ago - are turning out to see the clothes worn by the 20th Century muse. Adrian Hume-Sayer, director of private collections at Christie's, said a huge part of Hepburn's fanbase was born after she died. But what is it about her style that appeals to the millennial fashionista? ""Everyone says how wearable the clothes are today - that cleanness of line, the simplicity, that she really made her own,"" Mr Hume-Sayer said. Margreet and Henry were some of the younger admirers at the collection For 23-year-old Margreet Mateboer, who travelled from the Netherlands to see the collection, there is something ""relatable"" about Hepburn. Margreet, whose first experience of Hepburn was when she watched Breakfast at Tiffany's aged 12, said: ""She was very humble and human. ""She was glamorous, but not in a diva kind of way."" And if she could take home one item from the sale? ""The brown shearling sheepskin jacket she wore in Wait until Dark... I'd wear that."" Accompanying Margreet was Henry Wilkinson, an aspiring costume designer in London, whose first introduction to Audrey Hepburn was seeing the 1964 comedy My Fair Lady. ""That was 10 years ago, but it still resonates with me,"" the 20-year-old said. Henry said Hepburn had been modern for her time, adding that she avoided wearing heels and would often look quite ""boyish and wear trousers"". Indeed, many of Hepburn's clothes on display would not look out of place on nearby Oxford Street. A black mini dress adorned with feathers appears alongside a fur-trimmed wool coat and sequin-adorned jacket. ""She worked with what she had,"" Henry said. ""And this stuff is relatively attainable."" It is true that while there are designer pieces from Givency and Valentino, there are also simple cotton dresses and ballet pumps. The majority of accessories - which include a diamante-encrusted serpent belt - are costume jewellery and not of the quality you might expect of a Hollywood actress. ""She owned very little real jewellery,"" said Mr Hume-Sayer. ""She was not interested in it. That lack of ostentation (showed) her humbleness. She was incredibly grounded."" Items on sale include annotated scripts, posed portraits and a personalised Cartier swizzle stick - or cocktail stirrer - with a reserve price of Â£2,000-Â£3,000. It is hoped some of the items will find their way into the hands of younger fans. ""(Her sons) were keen for us to make as many small lots as possible, to make it as accessible as we can,"" said Mr Hume-Sayer. Happy bidding. The collection is open to the public in King Street, London, free of charge, until Tuesday 26 September.

"This video can not be played The Labour leader told Andrew Marr he supported workers asking for a decent public sector pay rise Jeremy Corbyn has promised to listen to Labour members' calls to keep the UK in the EU single market - but warned it could hamper the government's ability to protect jobs and invest in industry. The Labour leader said EU restrictions on state aid and pressure to privatise sectors like rail could cause problems. He also predicted ""a lot"" of people would continue to come from the EU to work in the UK after Brexit. Mr Corbyn was speaking on day one of the Labour conference in Brighton. Boosted by Labour's better-than-forecast general election result in June, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he wanted 10 years in office to implement Labour's agenda, saying at least two electoral terms would be needed to address challenges on housebuilding and inequality. Setting the scene for Labour conference Burnham: Labour is too London-centric More than 40 senior party figuressigned an open letter,externalto the Observer urging Mr Corbyn to commit to remaining in the European single market and customs union after Brexit. But delegates in Brighton have rejected demands from a number of constituencies for a vote on single market membership during the conference. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said that, in practice, it means there will be no vote on one of the most contentious issues in the party. Labour has already said it would keep the UK in both agreements during a transitional period. Theresa May has suggested a two-year timeframe for a transition period, but Mr Corbyn said Labour's version would last ""as long as necessary"". It is ""impossible"" to say at this stage how long it would be, he argued. Pro-EU protesters marched in Brighton as the Labour conference got under way Asked about his plans beyond this period, Mr Corbyn said the ""important priority"" was seeking tariff-free trade access to the EU's markets, and that it was necessary to ""look very carefully"" at the terms of any trade deal to avoid restrictions on state aid, citing the UK's steel industry as an example. ""We need to be quite careful about the powers that we need as national governments,"" he said. Mr Corbyn wants to return a number of key industries, including the railways, to public ownership, but says EU competition laws present significant obstacles to that. One of the signatories to the letter, former minister Ben Bradshaw, told BBC News remaining in the market was ""the only place we can sensibly be if we want to save the economy, end austerity and pursue the sort of vision of Britain that Jeremy Corbyn says he wants"". The customs union is the EU's tariff-free trading area, which imposes the same taxes on imports from certain countries outside the union. The single market also includes the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. Speaking at the Labour conference, Stephen Kinsella, a lawyer specialising in EU law, said he was ""puzzled and slightly troubled"" by Mr Corbyn's comments about state aid. ""I think what we see in the UK is too often government refers to EU law as an excuse, as a reason for not investing. But it could do so, and it could do so within the law,"" said Mr Kinsella, who is a Labour Party member. The letter urging long-term commitment to the single market and customs union, co-ordinated by the Open Britain campaign, was signed by both Blairite and left-wing MPs, along with some prominent trade union leaders. It said: ""The supposed benefits of a clean break with the EU are a fantasy. ""The economic impact of leaving the single market would hit the most vulnerable in our society hardest."" Mr Corbyn is also facing calls to maintain the free movement of EU workers after Brexit from some Labour members, despite this being ruled out in Labour's general election manifesto. ""Manifestos evolve and change,"" MP Clive Lewis, one of those pushing for the matter to be debated at conference, told the Sunday Politics. But fellow Labour MP Caroline Flint said she did not think maintaining the current arrangements ""would be acceptable to British people"". Asked about free movement, Mr Corbyn said he understood ""the importance of workers moving from one place to the other"", but some employers had ""grotesquely exploited"" the system to pay EU workers very low wages. ""That has to stop. But we have to recognise that in the future we're going to need people to work in Europe, and people from Europe are going to need to work here. There's going to be a lot of movement."" In his Marr interview, Mr Corbyn also promised an end to the public sector pay cap. He would not commit to the 5% increase called for by some, but promised workers a rise in line with inflation - currently 2.9% - in addition to recognition of the ""sacrifice"" they had made in recent years. The Labour leader side-stepped questions about whether he would support illegal strike action by public sector workers against the cap, as backed by his ally, Unite leader Len McCluskey. A new law requires a 50% turnout for successful strike ballots, but Unite is calling for co-ordinated action across sectors regardless of the threshold reached. Repeatedly pressed on whether he would back unions defying the law, Mr Corbyn said: ""I will be with those workers demanding a decent pay rise."" But speaking on Sky News, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the party would not back unions in such circumstances. ""I have actually received a letter from Len McCluskey this week where he says he accepts Labour MPs aren't going to support calls for illegal strike action,"" he said. Mr McCluskey confirmed that was the case, saying he did not expect support from the party's leadership or any of its MPs. ""I know that they are opposed to the current law and they will do all that they can inside Parliament to change this law,"" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday.

"Corrie Mckeague's mother, Nicola, and brothers Darroch and Makeyan (left) retrace the missing airman's steps The mother of a missing airman has led a large group of supporters along her son's final known steps on the anniversary of his disappearance. Corrie Mckeague has not been seen since 24 September 2016 following a night out in Bury St Edmunds. Suffolk Police believe he was taken to a landfill site after falling asleep in a bin, but have not found his body. More than 100 people joined his family on a 90-minute walk around the haunts where the airman was last seen on CCTV. Ms Urquhart described the search for her son, who was aged 23 when he went missing, as ""like grieving"". Corrie Mckeague: The mystery of the missing airman Ms Urquhart said she would never stop searching for her lost son She said she wanted to do ""something positive"" to assist police, after the20-week trawl of rubbishat the landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire, ended. Corrie Mckeague's uncle, Tony Wringe, and brother Darroch, joined the group Corrie Mckeague's mother returned to the site where her son was last seen Mr Mckeague, from Dunfermline, Fife, was first reported missing when he failed to turn up at RAF Honington on Monday, 26 September 2016. Ms Urquhart, along with her two other sons, Makeyan and Darroch, and their uncle Tony Wringe, began the walk at Langton Place, near So Bar, where Corrie started his night out. Corrie Mckeague went missing after a night out in Bury St Edmunds The procession of well-wishers, supporters, media and police then carried on to the Corn Exchange Wetherspoon's and Flex Bar venues, the Hughes Electrical doorway where he fell asleep, and the Mama Mia pizzeria. It concluded in the Horseshoe area, where the final CCTV footage of him was recorded. ""I don't know if we will ever find out what happened,"" Ms Urquhart said, ""but I am determined to find Corrie. ""We may find him but not ever know how - if he's dead - how he died. But my determination is to find Corrie. ""It's like grieving. It's my son. I am never, ever, ever going to stop trying to look for him. I know that the police investigation will have to stop at some point but we're nowhere close to that just yet. ""My determination as far as my children go is limitless. It will never stop."" A 20-week search of a landfill site in Cambridgeshire ended after no traces of the airman were found A special police pod has been in position in Bury St Edmunds during the weekend, in a bid to encourage witnesses to come forward. Suffolk Police said the search for the airman remained ""an active investigation"". In March, specialist teams embarked on a search of a landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire, where the contents of the bins in the Horseshoe area would have ended up. Police later revealed a bin lorry, seized shortly after the gunner vanished, was carrying a heavier load than first thought. The landfill search was called off in July.

"Bradley, seen on tour in June 2017, before the sudden cancellation of his winter tour Charles Bradley, a soul singer who found fame in his later years, has died from cancer aged 68. The former James Brown impersonator, nicknamed ""the screaming eagle of soul"" released his first album No Time For Dreaming in 2011, aged 62. He had recently returned to live performance after receiving treatment for stomach cancer late last year. His death came just two weeks after the remainder of his 2017 tour dates were cancelled due to illness. Charles Bradley spent much of his life working odd jobs as a handyman - and some of it living on the streets, sleeping in subway cars in New York City. But he continued to pursue music, having been inspired by the singer James Brown during a performance he saw as a teenager. He was eventually signed to a New York label in the early 2000s, securing a spot as the opening act on tour for soul revival singer Sharon Jones -who died last year aged 60. Allow Twitter content?

"Some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers use the Uber app in London London Mayor Sadiq Khan says anger from customers and drivers over Uber losing its licence should be directed at the company. More than 500,000 people have signed a petition, started by Uber, to urge Transport for London (TfL) to reverse its decision not to renew the licence. TFL said Uber could not hold a private hire operator licence on the grounds of ""public safety and security"". The ride-hailing app firm said it would appeal against TfL's decision. The petition says: ""If this decision stands, it will put more than 40,000 licensed drivers out of work and deprive millions of Londoners of a convenient and affordable form of transport."" TfL's concerns include Uber's approach to carrying out background checks on drivers and reporting serious criminal offences. What does London's Uber ban mean? Seven things people will miss if Uber goes Your views: Uber London loses licence Women's safety fears over Uber licence Uber's licence is due to expire on 30 September. It has 21 days to appeal and can continue to operate while any appeals are ongoing. Reacting to the petition reaching more than 500,000 signatures, Mr Khan said: ""I know that Uber has become a popular service for many Londoners - but it would be wrong for TfL to licence Uber if there was any way this could pose a threat to Londoners' safety or security. ""As mayor of London I welcome innovative new companies that help Londoners by providing a better and more affordable service - but providing an innovative service is not an excuse for not following the rules."" This video can not be played Drivers and passengers react to news that Uber's licence in London will be revoked Fred Jones, Uber's UK head of cities, said the mayor and TfL had ""caved to pressure from a small number of individuals and groups that want to protect the status quo and reduce consumer choice and competition from London"". He said the company had operated in London for five-and-a-half years, during which it was audited by TfL. ""The last time they audited us to check we were playing by the rules, they found that there were zero errors in our processes. ""This was one of the strange things around the TfL notice yesterday is they are the ones who do all of the checks and license the drivers."" He said when a driver signed up to the app, Uber made sure they had all the correct paperwork from TfL and that Uber did not carry out background checks itself. In a message to staff, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said: ""It's worth examining how we got here. The truth is that there is a high cost to a bad reputation. ""It really matters what people think of us."" Kajal Odedra, UK director at Change.org, said it was ""the fastest growing petition we've seen in the UK this year"". ""The speed with which this grew shows how powerful online campaigning can be."" She said the petition showed how quickly the voices of citizens could become part of the debate between governments and corporations. Petitioner Glenn Gathercole, from London, said he added his signature because: ""Uber provides a much-needed alternative to minicabs and black cabs. It is more efficient, safer and economical than the alternatives."" Brighton: Local MP Caroline Lucas said Uber's business model was ""irresponsible to the core"" and that it needed to improve passenger safety so that it could get its licence back Bristol: The city council says it would ""keep an eye on the outcome"" of the dispute with TfL Cambridge: The council will ""look closely"" when it comes to renew Uber's current licence which will expire in December,reports Cambridge News,external Manchester: Uber Britania - a separate company to Uber London - is licensed until 2021 Nottingham: Uber has a licence until 2020, and the council has ""no intention"" to review it any earlier Woking: The borough council says it follows different licensing practices to TfL and has brought in a new strict criminal convictions policy And Twitter user @Gabbysalaza_said,externalshe was ""annoyed"" at the decision as Uber allowed her to get out of ""uncomfy"" situations if out at night. Others have said that the ruling was within the company's control. In 2015, hundreds of black cab drivers held a protest against Uber ""Uber knew the rules. TFL asked them to comply with the rules. Uber refused. What is TFL supposed to do?"" said political commentatorOwen Jones,external. Danielle Louiseâwrote on Twitter,external: ""Londoners are literally more outraged at the loss of Uber than the fact women are being sexually assaulted in fake taxis."" Conservative MP and minister for London Greg Hands said, while the company must address safety concerns, Mr Khan was threatening to leave users ""stranded"" and put thousands out of work. Uber has said the move ""would show the world that, far from being open, London is closed to innovative companies"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said TfL was there to ""protect all of us and I think they are doing the right thing"". Analysis: From BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones Throughout its short, tempestuous life, Uber has clashed with regulators around the world - and more often than not it has come out on top. Its tactic has often been to arrive in a city, break a few rules, and then apologise when it's rapped over the knuckles. Some regulators have backed down, others have run the company out of town. In London, despite protests from angry taxi drivers, the company has had a relatively easy ride until now. But a wave of bad publicity about its corporate culture, its lax attitude to checks on its drivers and its treatment of this freelance army seems to have spurred TfL into action. Make no mistake, Uber will use every legal avenue to fight this ban. It will argue that consumers, in the shape of the millions of mainly young Londoners who rely on its service, will be seriously let down if it can no longer operate. But the courts will have to balance that with the serious concerns about public safety raised by TfL. Some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers use the Uber app in London. Wes Streeting, chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Taxis, says the blame lies with Uber for not following the rules. ""You cannot have a situation where, however big the customer base or however big the driver base, an operator that's providing a service like this in a city like ours can simply flout rules and regulations and on things as serious as criminal records checks for their own drivers, and this goes to the heart of passenger safety.""
