"This video can not be played Thousands have been evacuated from at-risk areas Storm Barry has made landfall in Louisiana, where officials have warned of potentially life-threatening floods. The storm reached hurricane strength as it neared land, but has now weakened to a storm packing sustained wind speeds of 60mph (96km/h). The system is crawling north-west at a speed of just 8mph, dumping heavy rainfall as it tracks inland. The worst of the storm is expected to hit an area west of New Orleans, and affect the wider region. Thousands have been evacuated from areas most at risk of flooding and other residents have been told to shelter in place. More than 100,000 households in Louisiana are already without power, according to tracking tool poweroutage.us. How do hurricanes form? Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones explained All flights in and out of Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport on Saturday were cancelled. President Donald Trump declared a federal state of emergency in Louisiana before the storm hit. A woman in Mandeville, Louisiana watches the rising waters In its latest update at 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT), the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) confirmed Storm Barry's winds had weakened. But it said ""life-threatening storm surge inundation"" continued as it moved inland. Before it made landfall near Intracoastal City, it was confirmed as the first hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic season.

At least one levee, in Plaquemines Parish in the state's tip, was already overtopped by water by midday on Saturday. Officials have told residents there to immediately evacuate, if it is safe to do so, or risk being cut off for several days. Louisiana's most populous city, New Orleans, looks set to avoid a direct hit from the hurricane - with the worst expected further west near the city of Lafayette instead. Heavy rain is expected throughout the state. Louisiana's governor, John Bel Edwards, has urged residents not to become complacent. ""I want to caution everybody. This is just the beginning,"" he said at a Saturday news conference. This video can not be played New Orleans has already been hit by flooding With recent flash-flooding and heavy rainfall, there was particular concern about the flooding risk to low-lying New Orleans. Most of the city's flood defences, improved after more than 1,800 died in Hurricane Katrina in 2005, are built between 20-25ft (6-7.6m) high. The National Weather Service (NWS) earlier warned the Mississippi River could crest at 19ft or 20ft during the storm, but on Friday revised their estimate down to 17ft. No city-wide mandatory evacuation is in place, but locals were told to hunker down and stock-up on essentials. New Orleans is particularly vulnerable to floods The city's emergency preparedness campaign has urged residents to remain vigilant and stay patient. The NHC warned that ""life-threatening, significant flash flooding and river flooding"" would become increasingly likely across areas of south and south-east Louisiana as the storm moved further inland. ""The slow movement of Barry will result in a long duration heavy rainfall and flood threat from Sunday into next week"", it said. While there is no definitive link between climate change and Storm Barry, rising temperatures are increasingly a factor in making the impact of events like this more intense. As the air has warmed over recent decades it is now able to hold much more moisture, meaning tropical storms are pre-loaded with large amounts of rain. The warming world is also making these storms more sluggish. Over the past seven decades tropical events like Barry have slowed down, going 20-30% less quickly over land in North America. This is what happened with Hurricane Harvey in 2017, when it weakened to a tropical storm and then stalled for days over the Houston area dumping enormous quantities of rainwater which cost lives and did huge damage. Sea levels have also increased as a result of global heating, so if winds are blowing towards shore, this makes flooding much more likely during high tides. How do hurricanes form?

"Some convicted killers, sex offenders and drug dealers could have their records wiped under new plans to help them back to work. People sentenced to more than four years in prison currently have to disclose their conviction to employers for the rest of their working life. Justice secretary David Gauke wants to scrap this rule to ""break barriers"" to employment for reformed criminals. The change will not apply to the most serious crimes - including murder. ""The responsibility, structure and support provided by regular work is an essential component of effective rehabilitation, something which benefits us all by reducing reoffending and cutting the cost of crime,"" said Mr Gauke. ""That's why we are introducing reforms to break barriers faced by ex-offenders who genuinely want to turn their lives around through employment."" The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said the new legislation in England and Wales is most likely to apply to lower level, non-violent offences after a ""rehabilitation period"" - during which they do not reoffend - has passed. It will not apply to those convicted of serious sexual, violent and terrorism offences, or where offences attract the most serious sentences, including life. However, it could be applied to people who have served sentences for offences including manslaughter, assault, robbery and some sex offences. Prison review: 'Don't ask about convictions' Criminal record checks to be relaxed Fall in number barred from working with children The exact length of these ""rehabilitation periods"" - the specified period after which the conviction will not have to be disclosed - will be decided after consultation with the justice sector, the MoJ said. People applying for sensitive roles, including working with children and vulnerable adults and positions of public trust will still be required to disclose any convictions, even those committed as a child. In addition to the rule change for sentences of more than four years, the period of time for which shorter and community sentences have to be revealed to employers will be scaled back under the new proposals. The MoJ said the new rules on disclosure will also stand for applications by ex-offenders for housing, adoption, education and insurance. Mr Gauke said the reforms were intended to remove the stigma of convictions, insisting the government ""will never compromise public safety"". ""That is why separate and more stringent rules will continue to apply for sensitive roles, including those which involve working with children and vulnerable adults,"" he said. According to the MoJ, regular work is a major factor in breaking the cycle of crime but many ex-offenders find it impossible to get a job - and reoffending is on the rise in England and Wales. Just 17% of offenders are in employment a year after their release from prison, and half of employers say they would not consider hiring an ex-offender, research suggests. The reforms set out will be introduced as new legislation when parliamentary time becomes available. Penelope Gibbs, chairwoman of the Standing Committee for Youth Justice, said: ""Currently anyone convicted of shop-lifting twice aged 12 must disclose that when applying to be a traffic warden aged 55. ""Shortening rehabilitation periods should be a first step in reform of whole criminal records disclosure system."" The charity Unlock also welcomed the justice secretary's plans but questioned how effective the legislation will be when information remains online. Christopher Stacey, co-director of Unlock, said: ""The government needs to make sure that the legislation does what it is intended to do - give people a chance to live free of the stigma of their past. ""We look forward to working with the government so that law-abiding people with convictions have a real chance to move on positively with their lives without their criminal record hanging over them."" The Institute of Directors said the proposal ""merits serious consideration"" with employers being ""much more open to giving people a second chance than is often thought"". ""The details matter, of course, but this could fit with efforts by companies to find ways or removing bias from the recruitment process,"" a spokesperson added. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) also said ex-offenders who have changed their ways deserve a second chance. Craig Beaumont, FSB's director of external affairs and advocacy, said: ""With employment levels at record highs, and one in three smaller firms citing skills shortages as a major barrier to growth, it's critical that we bring those furthest from the labour market into our workforces.""

"The oil tanker is suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria Royal Marines have boarded an oil tanker on its way to Syria thought to be breaching EU sanctions, the government of Gibraltar has said. Authorities said there was reason to believe the ship - Grace 1 - was carrying Iranian crude oil to the Baniyas Refinery in Syria. The refinery is subject to European Union sanctions against Syria. Britain's ambassador in Tehran, Robert Macaire, has been summoned over the incident. Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi was quoted on Iranian state TV as saying the ambassador had been summoned over the ""illegal seizure"" of the tanker. Gibraltar's chief minister, Fabian Picardo, praised the marines who detained the ship. ""Be assured that Gibraltar remains safe, secure and committed to the international, rules-based, legal order,"" he said, thanking the police, customs and port authorities for their involvement in detaining the ship. The British overseas territory of Gibraltar stands at the gateway to the Mediterranean Gibraltar port and law enforcement agencies detained the super tanker and its cargo on Thursday morning with the help of the marines. The BBC has been told a team of about 30 marines, from 42 Commando, were flown from the UK to Gibraltar to help seize the tanker, at the request of the Gibraltar government. A defence source described it as a ""relatively benign operation"" without major incident. Mr Picardo said he had written to the presidents of the European Commission and European Council to give details of the sanctions that have been enforced. The Baniyas refinery, in the Syrian Mediterranean port town of Tartous, is a subsidiary of the General Corporation for Refining and Distribution of Petroleum Products, a section of the Syrian ministry of petroleum. The EU says,externalthe facility therefore provides financial support to the Syrian government, which is subject tosanctions,externalbecause of its repression of civilians since the start of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. The refinery has beensubject to EU sanctions since 2014,external. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said she welcomed the ""firm action"" by the Gibraltarian authorities.

"HMS Montrose was shadowing a British tanker as it moved into the Strait of Hormuz The UK has raised the threat to British shipping in Iranian waters in the Gulf to the highest level - where the risk of attack is ""critical"". The step was taken on Tuesday, amid growing tensions in the region. On Wednesday, Iranian boats tried to impede a British oil tanker in the region - before being driven off by a Royal Navy ship, the MoD said. Iran had threatened to retaliatefor the seizure of one of its own tankers, but denied any attempted seizure. The Department for Transport said it regularly provided security advice to UK ships in high-risk areas. The threat level means British ships are advised not to enter Iranian waters, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said. Gulf crisis: Are we heading for a new tanker war? Iranian official threatens to seize British tanker Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? Boats believed to belong to Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) approached the British Heritage tanker and tried to bring it to a halt as it was moving out of the Gulf into the Strait of Hormuz. HMS Montrose, a British frigate shadowing the BP-owned tanker, was forced to move between the three boats and the ship, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said. He described the Iranians' actions as ""contrary to international law"". Guns on HMS Montrose were trained on the Iranian boats as they were ordered to back off, US media reported. The boats heeded the warning and no shots were fired. Last week, British Royal Marines helped the authorities in Gibraltarseize an Iranian tankerbecause of evidence it was carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. A spokesman for the Royal Gibraltar Police said they had arrested the captain and chief officer of the Iranian tanker on Thursday, on suspicion of breaching EU sanctions, but neither had been charged. The BBC has been told British Heritage was near the island of Abu Musa when it was approached by the Iranian boats. Although Abu Musa is in disputed territorial waters, HMS Montrose remained in international waters throughout. Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt said the government was concerned by the incident and urged the Iranian authorities to ""de-escalate the situation"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt added the UK would monitor the situation ""very carefully"". Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said the government was ""committed to maintaining freedom of navigation in accordance with international law"". A spokesperson for the US State Department condemned Iran's actions and said that Washington would continue to work closely with the UK. Morgan Ortagus said: ""We commend the actions of the Royal Navy in ensuring freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce through this critically important waterway."" Commander of the US Fifth Fleet Vice Adm Jim Malloy described the incident as ""unlawful harassment"" and said the fleet would continue to work closely with the Royal Navy to defend ""the free flow of commerce"". The navy of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps has denied claims it tried to seize the tanker, Iranian news agencies reported. IRGC's navy said there had been no confrontation with any foreign vessels in the past 24 hours. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the UK made the claims ""for creating tension"". ""These claims have no value,"" Mr Zarif added, according to the Fars news agency. Two tankers were attacked in the Strait of Hormuz in June The relationship between the UK and Iran has become increasingly strained, after Britain said the Iranian regime was""almost certainly"" responsible for the attacks on two oil tankersin June. Tensions grew after the seizure of an Iranian oil tanker by authorities in Gibraltar, assisted by British Royal Marines. On Thursday an Iranian official told the BBC the seizure was ""unnecessary and non-constructive escalation by the UK"" and called for the tanker, Grace 1, to be released. An Iranian official previously saida British oil tanker should be seizedif Grace 1 was not released. British Royal Marines helped to detain the oil tanker, Grace 1, near Gibraltar earlier this month On Wednesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the UK ""scared"" and ""hopeless"" for using Royal Navy warships to shadow another British tanker in the Gulf. ""You, Britain, are the initiator of insecurity and you will realise the consequences later,"" Mr Rouhani said. This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? The Royal Navy has a frigate, four minehunters and a Royal Fleet Auxiliary support ship already stationed in a permanent Naval Support Facility in the region, at Mina Salman in Bahrain. This is enough to provide reassurance, but probably not to deal with a crisis, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said. Ministers would now have to consider sending another Royal Navy ship to the region - but this could further escalate tensions with Iran, our correspondent said. Foreign Office officials said they were keeping the UK's military posture in the region under constant review but insisted they did not want to see tensions escalate. By Paul Adams, diplomatic correspondent The government says it absolutely doesn't want to get sucked into a confrontation with Iran, but cannot ignore the fact that life for British-flagged ships in the Gulf is becoming increasingly precarious. Hence the decision to raise the ship security level to its highest category - essentially a warning to British ships not to enter Iranian waters. This is an unusual but not unprecedented step, a reflection of the government's mounting concern. With limited military resources in the Gulf (one frigate and four mine countermeasures vessels), there's a limit to how much protection the Royal Navy can offer to British shipping. On any given day, there are between 15 and 30 large UK ships, including oil and gas tankers, in the Gulf, with between one and three transiting the Strait of Hormuz. The United States is looking to put together a coalition to ensure freedom of navigation through the Gulf, but has yet to share details or make requests of possible partners.  With the US and Iran locked in a bitter dispute over the future of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, some countries who already participate in a 33-nation Combined Maritime Force, based in Bahrain, may be reluctant to get more involved. The Strait of Hormuz, through which all ships must pass to enter the Gulf, is so narrow - just 21 nautical miles (39km) at its narrowest - that Iranian and Omani territorial waters meet in the middle, BBC Security correspondent Frank Gardner says. So instead of sailing through international waters, ships must pass through Iranian or Omani territory which both extend 12 nautical miles out from their coasts. Ships do this under something called Rights of Straits Passage - part of a UN convention which gives ships free passage through the world's chokepoints like the Strait of Gibraltar and the Malacca Strait. In the case of the Strait of Hormuz, shipping is channelled through two lanes heading in opposite directions, each one two nautical miles wide. This is called the Traffic Separation Scheme. Both Iran and the US Navy deploy warships to patrol this area and have narrowly avoided confrontation on several occasions. Once ships pass through the Strait of Hormuz and enter the Gulf they need to be wary of a contested area around the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs. These are claimed by both Iran and the UAE but occupied solely by Iranian forces. It is understood British Heritage was not carrying cargo at the time of the incident with the Iranian boats. The vessel is registered at the port of Douglas, in the Isle of Man. The US has blamed Iran for attacks on six oil tankers in May and June. On Wednesday, the chairman of the US military's Joint Chiefs of Staffsaid it wanted to create a multi-national military coalition to safeguard waters around Iran and Yemen. However, the UK and the rest of Europe were more cautious, fearing this would escalate tensions, BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said. It follows the Trump administration's decision to pull out of an international agreement on Tehran's nuclear programme and reinforcepunishing sanctions against Iran. Iran-US tensions: What's going on? Trumplomacy: What's the US endgame in Iran? Tehran has begun to nudge the levels of its enriched uranium beyond the limits of anuclear deal agreed with a group of world powers. Iran's ambassador to the UN Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBCEuropeans must do moreto compensate Tehran for economic losses inflicted by US sanctions - or Iran would continue to step up its nuclear programme.

"This video can not be played 'Always wear sun cream and protect your eyes' There are calls for a country-wide policy on sun-safety in schools after claims children are getting sunburnt. There is no blanket guidance to keep children protected and councils in Wales say it is up to individual schools. Unions advise teachers not to apply sun cream to children, and some schools do not allow pupils to bring their own in because of allergy concerns. But parents said one application of sun cream before school is not enough. The charity Tenovus Cancer Care says one blistering sun burn as a child can double the risk of skin cancer in later life, and called for the Welsh Government to make education on staying safe in the sun to be compulsory in schools. The government said schools have a duty of care to children and should agree a local approach to the issue. Caitlin Sandford, 24, from Aberystwyth, haspsoriasis,externalon her hands, a skin condition which means she cannot apply sun cream to her child. Caitlin's son Samuel, pictured with his younger brother, has come home from school sunburnt ""I brought some in but the teachers said they could not apply it and my son would have to apply it himself, apparently he didn't even have help since he came back with sunburn on the back of his neck,"" she said. ""I understand being worried about allergies but if you provided the sun cream and your child has trouble putting it on a teacher should help.

"This video can not be played How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded US regulators have approved a record $5bn (Â£4bn) fine on Facebook to settle an investigation into data privacy violations, reports in US media say. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been investigating allegations that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained the data of up to 87 million Facebook users. The settlement was approved by the FTC in a 3-2 vote, sources told US media. Facebook and the FTC told the BBC they had no comment on the reports. The consumer protection agency the FTC began investigating Facebook in March 2018 following reports that Cambridge Analytica had accessed the data of tens of millions of its users. The investigation focused on whether Facebook had violated a 2011 agreement under which it was required to clearly notify users and gain ""express consent"" to share their data. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Are we addicted to the âlikeâ button? Facebook, Google and Twitter in data regulators' sights The $5bn fine was approved by the FTC in a 3-2 vote which broke along party lines, with Republican commissioners in favour and Democrats opposed. The New York Times reported that the Democrats wanted stricter limits on the firm,external, while other Democrats have criticised the fine as inadequate. ""With the FTC either unable or unwilling to put in place reasonable guardrails to ensure that user privacy and data are protected, it's time for Congress to act,"" US Senator Mark Warner said. The fine still needs to be finalised by the Justice Department's civil division, and it is unclear how long this may take, the sources said. If confirmed, it would be the largest fine ever levied by the FTC on a tech company. However, the amount falls in line with estimates by Facebook,which earlier this year said it was expecting a fine of up to $5bn. Investors responded positively to the news, pushing Facebook shares up 1.8%. Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter in San Francisco Facebook had been expecting this. It told investors back in April that it had put aside most of the money, which means the firm won't feel much added financial strain from this penalty. What we don't yet know is what additional measures may be placed on the company, such as increased privacy oversight, or if there will be any personal repercussions for the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. The settlement, which amounts to around one quarter of the company's yearly profit, will reignite criticism from those who say this amounts to little more than a slap on the wrist. Cambridge Analytica was a British political consulting firm that had access to the data of millions of users, some of which was allegedly used to psychologically profile US voters and target them with material to help Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The data was acquired via a quiz, which invited users to find out their personality type. As was common with apps and games at that time, it was designed to harvest not only the user data of the person taking part in the quiz, but also the data of their friends. Facebook has said it believes the data of up to 87 million users was improperly shared with the now defunct consultancy. The scandal sparked several investigations around the world. In October,Facebook was fined Â£500,000 by the UK's data protection watchdog, which said the company had let a ""serious breach"" of the law take place. Canada's data watchdog earlier this year saidFacebook had committed ""serious contraventions"" of its privacy laws. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Are we addicted to the âlikeâ button?

"UK ambassador Sir Kim Darroch (l) called President Trump's administration ""inept"" in leaked emails Scotland Yard has been criticised for warning media organisations against publishing leaked government documents. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu advised editors it ""could be a criminal matter"". His comments came as a criminal investigation was launched into the leak of diplomatic emails from the UK ambassador in the US, Sir Kim Darroch. Evening Standard editor George Osborne described Mr Basu's statement as ""stupid"" and ""ill-advised"". The investigation was launched by the Met Police Counter Terrorism Command, which takes national responsibility for investigating allegations of criminal breaches of the Official Secrets Act. ""The publication of leaked communications, knowing the damage they have caused or are likely to cause, may also be a criminal matter,""said Mr Basu.,external He added: ""I would advise all owners, editors and publishers of social and mainstream media not to publish leaked government documents that may already be in their possession, or which may be offered to them, and to turn them over to the police or give them back to their rightful owner, Her Majesty's Government."" Police launch probe of ambassador emails 'leak' Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? 'No evidence' Sir Kim Darroch email was a hack Mr Osborne, the former chancellor,tweeted,externalthat to maintain credibility the Met Commissioner, Cressida Dick, should distance herself from ""this very stupid and ill-advised statement from a junior officer who doesn't appear to understand much about press freedom"". Other newspaper editors and MPs were also critical of Mr Basu's statement. Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman asked if Ms Dick had cleared the ""sinister, absurd, anti-democratic statement... threatening journalists with arrest for printing government leaks?"" He added, onTwitter:,external""Do you have any comprehension of a free society? This isn't Russia."" Peter Spiegel, Financial Times US managing editor,wrote:,external""Well, this is rather chilling from a major police force in a western democracy. What are you going to do, Met Police, arrest us?"" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he defended ""to the hilt"" the right of the press to publish leaks if they ""judge them to be in the public interest"". Allow Twitter content?

His Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson said it was correct the person responsible for the leak was ""hunted down and prosecuted"" but it was wrong for police to target the media. He said: ""A prosecution on this basis would amount to an infringement on press freedom and have a chilling effect on public debate."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said freedom of the press was ""vital"" and it was right there were ""considerable protections"" in place for journalists to reveal information. MP Tom Tugenhadt, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, told Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""a reasonable request"" to ask the media not to publish leaked documents which undermine security, but he ""doubted"" whether it was a crime. However, former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the leak was a clear breach of the Official Secrets Act and the police were entitled to try to prevent further disclosures. ""If they [the press] are receiving stolen material they should give it back to their rightful owner,"" he told the Today programme. ""They should also be aware of the huge damage that has already been done, and the potentially even greater damage to be done by further breaches ofthe Official Secrets Act."" Journalists are not above the law, but it is understood ""in a free, liberal and democratic society"" that the media ""should be free to report on leaked documents that they believe are in the public interest"", says Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors. Mr Murray maintains it is unlikely police are going to ""shoot the messenger"", adding that to hold authority to account journalists can't be allowed to be bullied into handing over documents. Who decides what is in the public interest, however, can be contentious. ""It's a difficult line to tread between what's in the public interest and what interests the public,"" Mr Murray says. However, he adds that the idea that one particular body would make that decision - or no-one would have to decide because journalists have ""dutifully"" handed in documents to the police is ""appalling"". The government has already opened an internal inquiry into the publication of the memos, which were critical of the Trump administration - and prompted a furious reaction from the US president, who said he would no longer deal with Sir Kim. President Trump branded him ""a very stupid guy""after confidential emails emerged where the ambassador had called his administration ""clumsy and inept"". Sir Kim stepped down as ambassador on Wednesday, saying it was ""impossible"" for him to continue. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Sir Kim Darroch Sir Kim's resignation prompted widespread support for him - as well as criticism of Tory leadership frontrunner Mr Johnson. According to some Whitehall sources, Sir Kim decided to resign after Mr Johnson failed to fully support him during a TV debate on Tuesday night. Mr Johnson denied any culpability, saying he had spoken to Sir Kim on Thursday to express his sadness over his resignation and the ambassador told him he had not watched the ITV debate. But on Friday,Mr Johnson told the BBC a ""misrepresented"" account of his remarksrelayed to Sir Kim had been ""a factor"" in his decision to step down. This video can not be played Trump: 'I wish the British ambassador well' Prime Minister Theresa May said Sir Kim's departure was ""a matter of deep regret"" and public servants should be able to give ""full and frank advice"".

"This video can not be played 'Always wear sun cream and protect your eyes' There are calls for a country-wide policy on sun-safety in schools after claims children are getting sunburnt. There is no blanket guidance to keep children protected and councils in Wales say it is up to individual schools. Unions advise teachers not to apply sun cream to children, and some schools do not allow pupils to bring their own in because of allergy concerns. But parents said one application of sun cream before school is not enough. The charity Tenovus Cancer Care says one blistering sun burn as a child can double the risk of skin cancer in later life, and called for the Welsh Government to make education on staying safe in the sun to be compulsory in schools. The government said schools have a duty of care to children and should agree a local approach to the issue. Caitlin Sandford, 24, from Aberystwyth, haspsoriasis,externalon her hands, a skin condition which means she cannot apply sun cream to her child. Caitlin's son Samuel, pictured with his younger brother, has come home from school sunburnt ""I brought some in but the teachers said they could not apply it and my son would have to apply it himself, apparently he didn't even have help since he came back with sunburn on the back of his neck,"" she said. ""I understand being worried about allergies but if you provided the sun cream and your child has trouble putting it on a teacher should help. ""Especially considering sun cream probably won't be very effective at lunch break if it was applied at 8:30 in the morning."" However Louise Jeffreys, from near Aberystwyth, highlighted concerns of cross-contamination to children who have allergies if teachers are applying sun cream brought in by pupils. This video can not be played Sun Cream: Are you applying it properly? The skin cancer charity Skcin said sunscreen needs reapplying at least every two hours to provide adequate protection. Leigh O'Connor, from Caerphilly, said his son's school does not allow pupils to bring in cream to apply themselves due to allergy worries, and his son has overheated and other children have burnt. ""It started up recently with the hot weather. It seems to be that every school has a different policy,"" Mr O'Connor said. ""My son's school doesn't allow it. It's a bit of a nightmare, really."" He hasstarted a petition,externalcalling on teachers at all schools to be allowed to apply sun cream with parents' consent. 'Love Island generation' skin cancer fear Which sun cream offers best protection? Sun cream: 'It takes two to do it properly' ""I have had quite a lot of feedback from other parents - one mum told me there were three incidents where her child burned before the school changed policy,"" he added. Caerphilly council was asked to comment. In short, there isn't one. Most councils which responded to BBC Wales said it was up to individual schools to decide what is best. But Wrexham council said guidance to its head teachers advises it is ""reasonable"" for schools to apply hypoallergenic sun cream if a child has not been provided any or is unable to apply it. Conwy council said staff were not prevented from applying or helping pupils apply sun cream and it provides a sun safe policy to all schools to be shared with parents. And Powys said while it was up to individual schools, it does provideadvice from Cancer Research UK,externalwhich includes the use of sun cream. Ceredigion said staff can help children who are too young to apply cream with parental consent, but again it is up to individual schools. However, a Flintshire council spokesman said: ""Schools will usually work on the basis that if a child brings in sun cream, it is for them to apply themselves and not a member of staff."" The Welsh Government said: ""Schools have a duty of care to pupils and should actively engage with parents to agree a local approach to the provision and application of sunscreen so that warm weather can be enjoyed safely."" Public Health Wales provides advice as part of the Healthy Schools Framework, which the government expects all schools to consider. Schools in Wales can also sign up toSun Safe Accreditation,external, a partnership between Skcin and Tenovus to educate children about sun safety. Tenovus has visited more than 90 primary schools in Wales since the partnership began in May, delivering sun safety workshops and assemblies and creating lesson plans. More schools are booked to take part in September. Tenovus and Skcin have been educating primary pupils about sun safety St Nicholas Church In Wales primary school in Vale of Glamorgan said: ""The children were all very enthused by the assembly. They recalled the song from last year and have been singing it on the yard ever since. ""We have used the cues and ideas to develop our school grounds and plans."" Kathryn Clifford from Skcin said the issue was one that was UK-wide and the charity spoke about it during a parliamentary event in the House of Commons on Wednesday. ""The issue of policy and sunscreen in primary schools is without doubt the hardest nut to crack,"" she added. ""Excuses from schools not to complete the accreditation due to mandatory stipulations within our policy come in various forms - the greatest obstacle being the provision and/or application of sunscreen."" While some councils say teachers are free to apply sun cream to pupils as necessary, the National Union of Teachers (NUT) in Wales advises them not to ""due to the potential for allegations of abuse"" and the time it would take. The NUT said if schools allow staff to apply sun cream, parental consent should be obtained and staff who wish to do so should only apply it to the face, neck and arms. It says parents should be encouraged to provide protective clothing and hats, and schools should amend the uniform and timetables as necessary in summer and provide shady areas. David Evans, Wales Secretary for the NUT, said: ""Each school should have a policy on the administration of sunscreen, which encourages parents and carers to provide children with their own, as well as encouraging them to provide children with suitable long-sleeved clothing and wide-brimmed hats. ""Our members can apply sunscreen in certain circumstances, but this will be with written permission from parents and a suitable risk assessment carried out. Children can have allergies or intolerances to certain products, which we would be keen to avoid."" Parents want to be able to give permission for teachers to apply suncream in schools Apart from sunburn being painful and unpleasant, Tenovus said melanoma (skin cancer) is one of the most common cancers affecting young adults (aged 15-34) in the UK. According to the NHS, about 13,500 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed each year among people of all ages. Melanoma can metastasize and spread to organs, while with non-melanoma this is rare. Maura Matthews from Tenovus said the charity ""wants every child in Wales to be taught how to be safe in the sun"" and ""would like the Welsh Government to make this compulsory in schools"". ""We know that skin cancer is the most preventable of all cancers,"" she said. ""We believe that every school should be sun safe accredited and every child in Wales should be taught these essential sun safety skills."" She added 86% of skin cancer cases are preventable. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light,externalis thought to cause most melanomas. The type of exposure that causes melanoma is sudden intense exposure - for example, while on holiday, which leads to sunburn. Skcin,externalsays rates of skin cancer are increasing faster than any other cancer in the UK, with figures doubling every 10-20 years, and more people die of it in the UK than in Australia.

"This video can not be played How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded US regulators have approved a record $5bn (Â£4bn) fine on Facebook to settle an investigation into data privacy violations, reports in US media say. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been investigating allegations that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained the data of up to 87 million Facebook users. The settlement was approved by the FTC in a 3-2 vote, sources told US media. Facebook and the FTC told the BBC they had no comment on the reports. The consumer protection agency the FTC began investigating Facebook in March 2018 following reports that Cambridge Analytica had accessed the data of tens of millions of its users. The investigation focused on whether Facebook had violated a 2011 agreement under which it was required to clearly notify users and gain ""express consent"" to share their data. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Are we addicted to the âlikeâ button? Facebook, Google and Twitter in data regulators' sights The $5bn fine was approved by the FTC in a 3-2 vote which broke along party lines, with Republican commissioners in favour and Democrats opposed. The New York Times reported that the Democrats wanted stricter limits on the firm,external, while other Democrats have criticised the fine as inadequate. ""With the FTC either unable or unwilling to put in place reasonable guardrails to ensure that user privacy and data are protected, it's time for Congress to act,"" US Senator Mark Warner said. The fine still needs to be finalised by the Justice Department's civil division, and it is unclear how long this may take, the sources said. If confirmed, it would be the largest fine ever levied by the FTC on a tech company. However, the amount falls in line with estimates by Facebook,which earlier this year said it was expecting a fine of up to $5bn. Investors responded positively to the news, pushing Facebook shares up 1.8%. Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter in San Francisco Facebook had been expecting this. It told investors back in April that it had put aside most of the money, which means the firm won't feel much added financial strain from this penalty. What we don't yet know is what additional measures may be placed on the company, such as increased privacy oversight, or if there will be any personal repercussions for the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. The settlement, which amounts to around one quarter of the company's yearly profit, will reignite criticism from those who say this amounts to little more than a slap on the wrist. Cambridge Analytica was a British political consulting firm that had access to the data of millions of users, some of which was allegedly used to psychologically profile US voters and target them with material to help Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The data was acquired via a quiz, which invited users to find out their personality type. As was common with apps and games at that time, it was designed to harvest not only the user data of the person taking part in the quiz, but also the data of their friends. Facebook has said it believes the data of up to 87 million users was improperly shared with the now defunct consultancy. The scandal sparked several investigations around the world. In October,Facebook was fined Â£500,000 by the UK's data protection watchdog, which said the company had let a ""serious breach"" of the law take place. Canada's data watchdog earlier this year saidFacebook had committed ""serious contraventions"" of its privacy laws. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Are we addicted to the âlikeâ button?

"This week's review is different. It is, as they say in the land of promotions, a two-for-one. We are looking at Olafur Eliasson's new exhibition at Tate Modern from two perspectives: mine, and further down this page, Laura Hackett's (winner of the Radio 4 Today programme's student critic of the year award). We see things a bit differentlyâ¦ There are few crystal balls as opaque as the one into which museum folk stare to see how many punters might turn up to a forthcoming exhibition. Words like ""blockbuster"" or ""niche""' get bandied about by curators, marketeers, and Dave from finance (whose opinion is never sought and ignored when proffered). In my time working at the Tate I sat in countless such meetings. Sometimes we got it about right. Sometimes we erred (too high for DalÃ­ & Film, which was a turkey; too low for Edward Hopper). But there was one occasion in 2003 when we truly excelled ourselves. Our guesstimate for an installation in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall by an unknown Nordic artist was so spectacularly wrong that we were left with no other choice but to blame Dave. We thought around 100,000 people would come to see Olafur Eliasson's The Weather Project during its six-month run. Of course, we hoped for a few more because it had been very expensive creating the giant sun effect in such a big space (lots of mirrors on the ceiling). But we had to be realistic. The Weather Project, 2003, saw representations of the sun and sky dominate the Turbine Hall of Tate Modern In the end over two million visitors came to see and experience what would become the most famous piece of immersive art in the world. It was epic in every sense: an instant masterpiece that was the making of both Tate Modern and Olafur Eliasson. Sixteen years later he returns to Tate Modern with a career retrospective that doesn't include a re-installation of his giant, misty ""Sun"", to the huge and obvious disappointment of a couple of London cabbies to whom I was talking. However, it does have some other notable pieces of his signature immersive art. The best of which by some distance is the aptly named Your Blind Passenger (2010), which is the Danish term for a stowaway. It consists of a long walkway of bright, white fog that makes seeing much beyond your outstretched arm impossible. If you're a skier or a hiker, you'd call it a white-out: if you live in Beijing now or were in London in the '50s it is reminiscent of dense smog: a peasouper. Your Blind Passenger, 2010, takes you through a corridor of dense fog, which the artist says helps ""you realise that you are not completely blind, you have a lot of other senses which start to kick in"" Except, the environment Eliasson has created is sweeter (literally, the mist is sugar-based) and gentler. You will be disorientated and restricted but the discombobulated feeling is more of purity and wonderment than fear or repulsion. Keep walking and the optical effects start happening. But you must be alone. If you see someone else the impact is severely diminished. It is typical of Eliasson's thoughtful, quietly provocative art, which when at its best stimulates your senses and your mind. That's the case with Your Uncertain Shadow (2010), another stand-out work in an otherwise slightly disappointing show. It is exploring his primary artistic concerns of light and colour, environment and perception. You walk into a white-walled gallery that doesn't look much until you stand in front of five floor-mounted coloured spotlights and look on the back wall. There you will see, and be enchanted by, your silhouette writ large in five overlapping pastel shades. Your Uncertain Shadow (colour), 2010, challenges the way we see our environment Will Gompertz getting into Eliasson's art Eliasson is at his best when there's an element of playfulness in his work, which is evident again in Beauty (1993), a black-box room with misty water falling from the ceiling through beams of light. He is less convincing when being overly earnest, as with the scaffold waterfall situated outside the building. Beauty, 1993, evokes the meteorological phenomenon of a rainbow inside the show On the terrace outside Tate Modern you see Waterfall, 2019, a new installation measuring over 11 metres in height There's no doubt he is a very good artist with important things to say. But this show somehow fails to capture his spirit. It feels disjointed and thin, which is incredible given how prolific Eliasson has been over the years. Maybe Dave has decided to flex his muscles and imposed some budget restrictions? Eliasson's exhibition doesn't have an obvious entrance. There are doors, yes, but the viewer's experience begins long before that. Outside, you can't avoid his waterfall. With its scaffolding laid bare, the huge sculpture is a testament to the human power to get inside nature and remake it in our own image, but also nature's power to get inside us. Stand beside it and close your eyes, and the busy urban landscape is replaced by an elemental non-human scene. The waterfall stands beside a Tate cafe, and if you're peckish you can enjoy a set menu created in conjunction with the chefs at Studio Olafur Eliasson - vegetarian offerings designed to be shared and eaten slowly. The philosophy behind this exhibition has entered you before you have really entered it. If you take the lift, you might wonder whether the museum's lights are faulty, but you are in a rebirth of Eliasson's 1997 Room for one Colour - mono-frequency lamps reduce everything to yellow and black, and the uncanny atmosphere continues in the blindingly bright foyer. In Room for one Colour, 1997, the space is bathed in light from mono-frequency lamps Eliasson's art is not contained to the exhibition space; it spills outside, refusing the idea of a frame. Inside the exhibition proper, some of the Scandinavian artist's best known pieces from the past 20 years find new meaning. The giant moss wall, which will dry out, be watered, and re-grow over the course of the exhibition, has a new sense of urgency in the context of climate crisis. Its overwhelming size is concurrent with its vulnerability, and a sense of misplaced-ness in this pristine environment. Moss wall, 1994, shows the Outdoors being brought Indoors But often it's the viewer who feels out of place. Water trickles outside the windows, to simulate rain, serving as a reminder of the falsity of our constructed indoor worlds. Buildings are recalibrated as not only forces of protection, but also imprisonment, separating us from the natural world. One room is empty, with bright white walls, until you walk in and your silhouette appears in five colours. This piece is titled Your Uncertain Shadow - you might create the art, but your silhouette is split up. You lose structural integrity. Another features a rotating irregular blotch of light which manages to be at once cosmic and embryonic, unbearably close and unimaginably distant. If the posters are anything to go by, Your Uncertain Shadow is the leading image of the exhibition, but for me the stand-out piece was Beauty, a darkened room with a spotlight shining through falling mist. As you tip-toe around (this is a space which implicitly demands silence), you might catch a glimpse of a rainbow, and watch the mist change pattern and direction. Eliasson says Beauty demonstrates our capacity to see different things but still be together. It does this, but even more powerfully, it  manages to create a space which is both inside and outside, not simply in-between. It forms the climax of an exhibition whose resounding message is the mutual implication of mankind and our environment, an implication which Eliasson believes should be celebrated, but also recognised as a responsibility to protect the world we live in. âââââ Recent reviews by Will Gompertz Idris Elba's Tree âââââ George Clooney's Catch-22 âââââ Paula Rego show in Milton Keynes âââââ Follow Will Gompertzon Twitter,external 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?
