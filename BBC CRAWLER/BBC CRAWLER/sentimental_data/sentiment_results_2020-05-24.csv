"The UK government is conducting a new review into the impact of allowing Huawei telecoms equipment to be used in British 5G networks. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) involvement comes after the US brought fresh sanctions against the Chinese company, citing security fears. In January, the UK resisted US pressure to ban Huawei from contributing to 5G. A NCSC spokesman said: ""The security and resilience of our networks is of paramount importance."" ""Following the US announcement of additional sanctions against Huawei, the NCSC is looking carefully at any impact they could have to the UK's networks."" The sanctions restrict Huawei from using US technology and software to design its semiconductors. The US Department of Commerce is concerned Huawei has flouted regulations implemented last year that require the firm to obtain a licence in order to export US items. It says Huawei got around this rule by using US semiconductor manufacturing equipment at factories in other countries. The UK government had previouslyapproved a limited role for Huaweiin building the country's new mobile networks. The tech giant was banned from supplying kit to ""sensitive parts"" of the network, known as the core. In addition, it is only allowed to account for 35% of the kit in a network's periphery, which includes radio masts. UK mobile operators were told by the NCSC - part of the intelligence agency GCHQ - that they would have three years to comply with caps on the use of Huawei equipment in their networks. Huawei has won 91 5G contracts with mobile operators around the world Responding to the review, Victor Zhang, vice-president at Huawei, said: ""Our priority remains to continue the rollout of a reliable and secure 5G networks across Britain."" He added: ""We are happy to discuss with NCSC any concerns they may have and hope to continue the close working relationship we have enjoyed for the last 10 years."" Coronavirus: Huawei urges UK not to make 5G U-turn after pandemic Huawei set for limited role in UK 5G networks Critics argue it is a security risk to allow the Chinese company to play any role at all in the UK's 5G network, due to fears it could be used by Beijing to spy on or even sabotage communications. In March,a backbench rebellion within the Conservative partysignalled efforts to overturn the move. And on 4 April, a group of 15 Conservative MPs called for a rethink on relations with China in their own letter to the Prime Minister, written a day before he was admitted to hospital. In response, Huawei wrote an open letter to the UK government, urging it not to ""disrupt"" Huawei's involvement in the rollout of 5G. In January, after a prolonged and difficult debate, the government decided to allow Huawei to play a role in 5G but to limit its market share to 35% of the network and keep it out of the most sensitive parts. But there was a significant backbench rebellion over the issue in March and pressure has grown domestically since the Coronavirus crisis began to take a tougher line on China. At the same time the Trump administration has not let up in its campaign for the UK and other allies to exclude Huawei entirely. Even though this review is based on the technical considerations about the impact of US sanctions, it could potentially offer the government a route to move away from its earlier decision and exclude the company or impose further limits - although that may involve economic costs at home and increased tension with Beijing. Huawei stressed that the coronavirus pandemic had placed ""significant pressure"" on British telecoms systems and highlighted how many people in the country - particularly those living in rural communities - do not have good access to the internet. 5G, which promises faster mobile internet data speeds, a stable network that can handle more connections, and more bandwidth for a multitude of different technological applications, has been touted as being a way to bridge the digital divide in areas where broadband internet rollouts have been inconsistent. According to latest data released by Huawei, the firm has so far won 91 5G contracts across the world. Huawei has always denied that it would help the Chinese government attack one of its clients. The firm's founder has saidhe would ""shut the company down"" rather than aid ""any spying activities"". Three out of four of the UK's mobile networks had already decided to use and deploy Huawei's 5G products outside the core in the ""periphery"", namely Vodafone, EE and Three. Two of them - Vodafone and EE - now face having to reduce their reliance on the supplier, as more than 35% of their existing radio access network equipment was made by it.

"Brazil is the country with the second highest number of cases The US has imposed travel restrictions on foreign nationals who have been to Brazil in the last 14 days. The South American nation recently became the world's second major hotspot for coronavirus cases. Brazil has recorded more than 360,000 cases, the country's health ministry announced on Sunday, while over 22,000 people have died with the virus. A White House spokeswoman said the restrictions would help ensure new cases are not brought into the US. ""Today's action will help ensure foreign nationals who have been in Brazil do not become a source of additional infections in our country,"" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement. Non-Americans who have been in Brazil in the two weeks before they request entry to the US will be denied that entry. The restriction will not affect trade between the two countries. The suspension is to take effect on 28 May at 23:59 EDT (03:59 GMT). Is Latin America the next coronavirus epicentre? Disease meets deforestation at heart of Brazil's Amazon 'Undocumented virus explosion' sweeps Brazil The travel ban will not apply to US citizens, or to the spouse, parent, legal guardian, or child of a US citizen or lawful permanent resident, and most siblings under the age of 21. ""The potential for undetected transmission of the virus by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States from [Brazil] threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security,"" said the suspension order published by the White House on Sunday. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? ON FRONTLINE:The young doctors being asked to play god REASON TO HOPE:The good that may come out of this crisis AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories Earlier on Sunday, White House National security adviser Robert O'Brien told CBS ""Face the Nation"" that travel restriction for Brazil were expected shortly. ""We hope that'll be temporary, but because of the situation in Brazil, we're going to take every step necessary to protect the American people,"" Mr O'Brien said. This video can not be played Sao Paulo: Latin America's biggest graveyard from the sky He added that ""we'll take a look at the other countries on a country-by-country basis for sure"". US President Donald Trump suggested earlier this week that he was considering imposing a ban on travel from Brazil. The US currently leads the world in coronavirus cases. It has over 1.6 million known cases and is nearing 100,000 deaths linked to the virus. Sunday's announcement is the latest travel restriction imposed by the US in a bid to combat the spread of the virus. Foreign nationals who have recently visited China, Iran, the European Schengen area, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland are already barred from entry to the US. Canada and the US also recently agreed to extend the closure of their shared border to non-essential travel. Brazil recently overtook Russia with regards to known cases of the virus. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the risks posed by the virus. President Bolsonaro hugged a young child while meeting supporters on Sunday The number of deaths in Brazil has been doubling roughly every two weeks, compared to about every two months in the UK, four months in France, and five months in Italy. Experts have warned that the real figure may be far higher due to a lack of testing. The rising death toll and infections in Brazil are clearly worrying the rest of the world, but President Jair Bolsonaro shows no signs of treating it seriously. On Sunday, he was out once again, mingling with hundreds of supporters in Brasilia - and once again he was not wearing a mask. President Bolsonaro seems more caught up in fighting political battles - he's facing accusations of political interference to protect his family - than looking at how to rein in the country's spiralling health crisis. These past few days have revealed some ugly truths here. Not only has Brazil become one of the epicentres of the coronavirus crisis, but it's clear that the president and his team are unable - or even willing - to lead the country out of it. There's no doubt this decision by President Trump, a man whom President Bolsonaro has always openly admired, will sting - but the question is, will it do anything to change the Brazilian leader's approach?

"Industry leaders have warned the government that the UK risks being left behind, unless it quickly agrees ""air bridge"" deals with other nations. Business groups have written to Boris Johnson, saying a 14-day quarantine on all air passengers arriving in the UK will have ""serious consequences"" for the economy. On Friday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said it will come into force on 8 June. But firms say the UK should relax the measure with low-risk countries. So-called air bridges would allow visitors from countries where coronavirus infection rates are low into the UK, without having to self-isolate for two weeks. In a letter to the prime minister, bosses of airlines like EasyJet, Tui, Jet2 and Virgin Atlantic, as well as industry bodies Airlines UK, the British Chambers of Commerce, UK Hospitality and manufacturing association Made UK said that while they fully support the government's commitment to public health, they have ""serious reservations"" about a ""blanket approach"" to all arrivals into Britain. What are the UK travel quarantine rules? Ryanair: Air passenger quarantine plans 'idiotic' Coronavirus: UK airlines warn quarantine will 'kill air travel' Instead, they are asking for a more ""targeted, risk-based"" approach when establishing air links with countries that have high infection rates from the pandemic. ""The alternative risks major damage to the arteries of UK trade with key industry supply chains, whilst pushing the UK to the back of the queue as states begin conversations for opening up their borders,"" says the letter. Passengers, pictured here at Manchester Airport, are required to stand at least 2m apart from others Ms Patel said on Friday: ""We recognise how hard these changes will be for our travel and leisure sectors, who are already struggling in these unprecedented times. ""Across government, we continue to work with them and support what is an incredibly dynamic sector to find new ways to reopen international travel and tourism in a safe and responsible way."" She added that the 14-day self-isolation rule will be reviewed every three weeks. Some airlines have announced plans to increase flight numbers this summer after air travel ground to a virtual halt because of the coronavirus lockdowns imposed by many governments. However, some have argued that the two-week-long quarantine will put people off travel and be difficult to enforce. Michael O'Leary, boss of Ryanair, which will ramp up flight numbers in July, recently told BBC Radio 5's Live Breakfast programme that the 14-day quarantine rule was ""idiotic"" and would prove to be ""ineffective"".

"This video can not be played Tony Hall on the future of the BBC and the role the corporation has played during the Covid-19 crisis People have ""turned to the BBC in their droves"" in recent weeks, according to the BBC's director general. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Tony Hall said 94% of the UK accessed the BBC for ""information, entertainment or education"" during the pandemic. He said he ""took his hat off"" to staff who had created ""excellent"" content, even though 92% of the workforce were now working from home. The BBC could lose Â£125m in revenue because of coronavirus, he added. Lord Hall also said he recognised the need for a ""big debate"" about the future of the BBC and the way it is funded. The director general, who is set to leave his role in the summer, said younger audiences had been coming back to the BBC during the lockdown, with shows such as Normal People becoming huge hits. The corporation said that 94% of the British public used the BBC in the third week of March when social distancing began in the UK - with 86% of younger people between the ages of 16-34 also accessing BBC content. Normal People TV series: 'It's so easy to relate to' BBC 'must reflect nation' says culture secretary BBC could scale back output if hit by coronavirus Lord Hall also credited this success to its""biggest ever educational programme"", as well the launch of Culture in Quarantine - an arts and culture service which Lord Hall says keeps ""the arts alive in people's homes and support the arts sector during challenging times"". He was pressedon plans to bring back BBC Three as a regular TV channel,four years after it was taken off air and moved online to save costs. Lord Hall said the initial plans had been a ""fantastic, creative success"" and showed ""the importance of developing our iPlayer, developing our sounds and making sure that our new services are in tip top position for young audiences to come to"". Normal People has attracted record audiences for BBC Three on iPlayer However, he acknowledged that the broadcaster could potentially lose Â£125m as a result of coronavirus, meaning it would have to spend ""wisely"" in future. The BBC is facing financial pressure after being forcedto delay the end of the free TV licence schemefor all over-75s. It also had to postponeplans to cut 450 jobs, and said there was uncertainty around commercial revenues. Lord Hall said that he hopes in future, there will be a ""big debate"" about how the BBC should be funded post 2027, when the current charter comes to an end. He said: ""The question is, what's the best way of funding that universally so that everybody, this great democratic idea, gets something we can all share. ""I hope even when I've left I can take part in that debate and we should look at the easiest way to pay, learn from what happens in other countries, are there fairer ways to pay, but the underpinning for all that is the idea of a BBC which is providing something for everyone."" It comes aftera public consultation was launched by the government on whether failure to pay for a TV licenceshould stop being a criminal offence, with the BBC warning it would cost the corporation more than Â£1bn over five years.

"Aya Hachem died from a gunshot wound to the chest A 34-year-old man has become the sixth person to be charged with the murder of a law student in a drive-by shooting. Aya Hachem, 19, died when shots were fired from a passing car in Blackburn on 17 May. Ayaz Hussain, 34, of Calgary Avenue in Blackburn, has been charged with her murder and the attempted murder of a man who officers think was the intended target of the shooting. He will appear before magistrates in Preston on Monday. Feroz Suleman, 39, Abubakir Satia, 31, Uthman Satia, 28, Judy Chapman, 26, and Kashif Manzoor, 24, were previously charged with Ms Hachem's murder and the attempted murder of the intended target. They have been remanded in custodyto appear at Preston Crown Court on Wednesday. Ms Hachem was walking along King Street to the Lidl supermarket when she was hit by one of two bullets fired from a car. The Lebanese-born teenager, who was a second-year student at the University of Salford, was buried in the town of Koleileh on Saturday. Her parents have paid tribute to her as the ""most loyal devoted daughter"" who ""dreamed of becoming a solicitor"". Aya Hachem was a young trustee for the Children's Society A total of 14 people were arrested in the days after her death, including the five men and one woman who have been charged with murder. Two men arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder have been bailed pending further inquiries, while five people have been released under investigation. A 22-year-old man, from Blackburn, who was arrested on Friday on suspicion of murder and attempted murder, has been released without charge. Det Supt Andy Cribbin said the police investigation had ""moved at a fast pace"" but was ""far from over"". ""Our resolve and determination to get to the bottom of what happened and who was responsible for Aya's needless and senseless death remains as strong as ever,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Tony Hall on the future of the BBC and the role the corporation has played during the Covid-19 crisis People have ""turned to the BBC in their droves"" in recent weeks, according to the BBC's director general. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Tony Hall said 94% of the UK accessed the BBC for ""information, entertainment or education"" during the pandemic. He said he ""took his hat off"" to staff who had created ""excellent"" content, even though 92% of the workforce were now working from home. The BBC could lose Â£125m in revenue because of coronavirus, he added. Lord Hall also said he recognised the need for a ""big debate"" about the future of the BBC and the way it is funded. The director general, who is set to leave his role in the summer, said younger audiences had been coming back to the BBC during the lockdown, with shows such as Normal People becoming huge hits. The corporation said that 94% of the British public used the BBC in the third week of March when social distancing began in the UK - with 86% of younger people between the ages of 16-34 also accessing BBC content. Normal People TV series: 'It's so easy to relate to' BBC 'must reflect nation' says culture secretary BBC could scale back output if hit by coronavirus Lord Hall also credited this success to its""biggest ever educational programme"", as well the launch of Culture in Quarantine - an arts and culture service which Lord Hall says keeps ""the arts alive in people's homes and support the arts sector during challenging times"". He was pressedon plans to bring back BBC Three as a regular TV channel,four years after it was taken off air and moved online to save costs. Lord Hall said the initial plans had been a ""fantastic, creative success"" and showed ""the importance of developing our iPlayer, developing our sounds and making sure that our new services are in tip top position for young audiences to come to"". Normal People has attracted record audiences for BBC Three on iPlayer However, he acknowledged that the broadcaster could potentially lose Â£125m as a result of coronavirus, meaning it would have to spend ""wisely"" in future. The BBC is facing financial pressure after being forcedto delay the end of the free TV licence schemefor all over-75s. It also had to postponeplans to cut 450 jobs, and said there was uncertainty around commercial revenues. Lord Hall said that he hopes in future, there will be a ""big debate"" about how the BBC should be funded post 2027, when the current charter comes to an end. He said: ""The question is, what's the best way of funding that universally so that everybody, this great democratic idea, gets something we can all share. ""I hope even when I've left I can take part in that debate and we should look at the easiest way to pay, learn from what happens in other countries, are there fairer ways to pay, but the underpinning for all that is the idea of a BBC which is providing something for everyone."" It comes aftera public consultation was launched by the government on whether failure to pay for a TV licenceshould stop being a criminal offence, with the BBC warning it would cost the corporation more than Â£1bn over five years.

"The family of Debbie Makki (fourth from right) said they would ""miss her dearly"" The mother of a teenager who was fatally stabbed in the heart by a friend has died. Debbie Makki, 55, died in the early hours of Sunday, almost 14 months after the death of her son Yousef Makki, 17, in Hale Barns, Greater Manchester. Her daughter Jade Akoum said ""the toll of losing Yousef was colossal, but the injustice and the constant uphill battle we had to fight meant she never found peace"". ""Her heart was broken,"" she said. Manchester Grammar student Yousef died in a fight with Joshua Molnar in March 2019. Mr Molnar said it was self-defence andwas acquitted of murder and manslaughterby a jury at Manchester Crown Court in July. Yousef Makki was a scholarship pupil at Manchester Grammar School Ms Akoum said her mother's mental and physical health had ""deteriorated dramatically over the past year"" and she was rushed to hospital in an ambulance two days ago. ""There have been a lot of false promises to our family, beacons of hope from individuals that have amounted to nothing,"" she  said. ""I want to assure everyone that we will get to the bottom of this. ""My mum was the strongest, bravest lady I have ever met and we will miss her dearly."" Debbie Makki (second from left) died in the early hours of Sunday In a joint statement, Ms Makki's family said their ""world has fallen apart all over again and we are all in complete shock"". ""We were unable to be with her in her last moments, just as we were unable to be with Yousef - but they are together now which brings us some comfort,"" they added. Allow Twitter content?

"The congregation of Dunseverick Baptist Church in Bushmills attended a service in their cars on Sunday Church services in Northern Ireland have changed. This weekend, congregations didn't gather in buildings - but car parks. It's after theStormont Executive relaxed coronavirus lockdown restrictionsand allowed worshippers to gather in their vehicles. Churches recently reopened for people to pray privately, with appropriate social distancing and the cleaning of shared-contact hard surfaces. Butdrive-in services are permitted, as long as people stay in their cars.,external The service was led by Pastor Billy Jones, who said it was a ""symbolic day"" A number of drive-in sermons took place on Sunday, like the one at Dunseverick Baptist Church outside Bushmills in County Antrim. An orchestrated beeping of horns got proceedings under way. Worshippers were able to attend church from the comfort of their cars This definitely wasn't your typical Sunday at church. NI five-step plan for easing lockdown published The service was led by Pastor Billy Jones who said the day was hugely symbolic. ""Yes, I know socially isolating in our own cars, but the fact that we can come to one place together to worship God means an important amount to many, many people,"" he said. Drive-in services are permitted in Northern Ireland, as long as people stay in their cars Several members of the congregation spoke of the service symbolising ""light at the end of the tunnel"". Another said: ""We don't need a church because the people are the church, but it's just lovely to come together again."" It wasn't the first drive-in service at Dunseverick Baptist Church. In previous summers it has staged similar services for tourists. Now it was for necessity, not novelty. It was all smiles as the congregation got back to church About 100 vehicles lined up in front of the outdoor stage where Pastor Jones delivered his service, helped by two powerful speakers. Worshippers sat with their car windows down amid plenty of waves, smiles and sing-a-longs. This event isn't likely to be a one-off. Pastor Jones says he is happy to facilitate other drive-ins until the congregation can once again gather inside. After an hour, an orderly queue of cars formed for the exit. For the 200 or so present, it was a return to some kind of normality.

"This video can not be played WW2 paratrooper who jumped again aged 97 passes away A WW2 veteran, whose parachute jump to mark the 75th anniversary of a major wartime operation went viral last year, has died at the age of 97. Sandy Cortmann, from Aberdeen, made an emotional return to the Netherlands to commemorate the anniversary of Operation Market Garden last September. He was just 22 when he parachuted near Arnhem in 1944, before being taken prisoner by the Germans. The events in 1944 were immortalised in the 1977 epic A Bridge Too Far. Mr Cortmann's family said he had passed away at his care home in Aberdeen on Saturday. Veteran, 97, parachutes again over Arnhem Mr Cortmann described the jump last year as ""thoroughly terrifying but wonderful"". Footage of the jump went viral on social media, and not long after returning to Scotland from his adventure he received hundreds of fan letters from people in the Netherlands. Sandy Cortmann was just 22 when he parachuted near Arnhem in 1944 Dutch people were so moved his his story, a campaign was launched to send well wishes and thank you messages to the Aberdonian. Operation Market Garden saw 35,000 British, American and Polish troops parachute or glide behind German lines in a bid to open up an attack route for allied forces. The fighting around Arnhem saw more than 1,500 British soldiers killed and nearly 6,500 captured. Some 1,500 people took part in amass parachute dropto commemorate the allied assault. Recalling 1944, Mr Cortmann said: ""When the fighting started we were just in amongst it. ""You can describe it as brave, you thought you were brave, but once you got down there, Jesus Christ, terrified, absolutely terrified. ""You just heard bangs and machine guns. I didn't understand what that was all about."" Sandy Cortmann did the tandem jump last year Allied soldiers had been parachuted in to secure bridges on the Dutch and German border. Mr Cortmann remembered seeing treatment areas for the wounded ""strewn with bodies"". He recalled one young soldier calling out repeatedly for his mother and being told to help quieten him. ""I crawled out, I just touched his hand, grabbed it and he died,"" he said. ""I thought, 'what a thing to happen'. I was choking, but I was alive."" The veteran paratrooper and his comrades had tried to escape the fighting by crossing a river to safety, but Mr Cortmann was forced to admit he could not swim. He said that instead of abandoning him his fellow soldiers put their clothes back on and stayed. Mr Cortmann was eventually captured and endured a seven-hour train ride in a packed wagon to Germany where he was held for a year. Friend Bob Crocker, a fellow member of the Aberdeen Airborne Alliance, said: ""I'm really saddened by the passing of Sandy, the humble kind gentleman Airborne soldier. ""Sandy was a treasure in many ways and especially to us in the Airborne community, we've not only lost an Airborne brother but a friend and a gentleman. It was a privilege knowing and spending time with him, we'll all miss him and his spirit. Rest in peace warrior.""

"Industry leaders have warned the government that the UK risks being left behind, unless it quickly agrees ""air bridge"" deals with other nations. Business groups have written to Boris Johnson, saying a 14-day quarantine on all air passengers arriving in the UK will have ""serious consequences"" for the economy. On Friday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said it will come into force on 8 June. But firms say the UK should relax the measure with low-risk countries. So-called air bridges would allow visitors from countries where coronavirus infection rates are low into the UK, without having to self-isolate for two weeks. In a letter to the prime minister, bosses of airlines like EasyJet, Tui, Jet2 and Virgin Atlantic, as well as industry bodies Airlines UK, the British Chambers of Commerce, UK Hospitality and manufacturing association Made UK said that while they fully support the government's commitment to public health, they have ""serious reservations"" about a ""blanket approach"" to all arrivals into Britain. What are the UK travel quarantine rules? Ryanair: Air passenger quarantine plans 'idiotic' Coronavirus: UK airlines warn quarantine will 'kill air travel' Instead, they are asking for a more ""targeted, risk-based"" approach when establishing air links with countries that have high infection rates from the pandemic. ""The alternative risks major damage to the arteries of UK trade with key industry supply chains, whilst pushing the UK to the back of the queue as states begin conversations for opening up their borders,"" says the letter. Passengers, pictured here at Manchester Airport, are required to stand at least 2m apart from others Ms Patel said on Friday: ""We recognise how hard these changes will be for our travel and leisure sectors, who are already struggling in these unprecedented times. ""Across government, we continue to work with them and support what is an incredibly dynamic sector to find new ways to reopen international travel and tourism in a safe and responsible way."" She added that the 14-day self-isolation rule will be reviewed every three weeks. Some airlines have announced plans to increase flight numbers this summer after air travel ground to a virtual halt because of the coronavirus lockdowns imposed by many governments. However, some have argued that the two-week-long quarantine will put people off travel and be difficult to enforce. Michael O'Leary, boss of Ryanair, which will ramp up flight numbers in July, recently told BBC Radio 5's Live Breakfast programme that the 14-day quarantine rule was ""idiotic"" and would prove to be ""ineffective"".

Transport Secretary Michael Matheson will update the Scottish Parliament on revised codes of social distancing on trains and buses north of the border on Tuesday. UK counterpart Grant Shapps yesterday suggested that the transport system would still only run at a fifth of its usual capacity as the country moves out of lockdown. He announced a Â£283m package of investment in buses and light rail services to improve safety and restore services during the coronavirus pandemic and, although it only covers England, he claimed it would help the UK as a whole ""start moving back to a full timetable"" as it moves out of lockdown. Mr Shapps said the government would also bring in more marshals - volunteers called ""Journey Makers"" - at stations to join British Transport Police officers, Network Rail and train operator staff currently advising passengers and monitoring social distancing. But the transport secretary says social distancing will cut capacity to a fifth of the usual amount.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A protester demonstrates outside the home of Dominic Cummings on Sunday Charlie Cooper of Politico asks about the prime minister's support for his top adviser Dominic Cummings, wondering if rules have changed to allow anyone with symptoms who has concerns about childcare to travel to another home. Boris Johnson gives a short riposte, saying the government's advice remains unchanged . ""That is that if you have symptoms then you should self isolate for 14 days - and that's what Mr Cummings and his family did"", he says. The advice makes it ""absolutely clear "" that childcare has to be ""taken into account"", Mr Johnson adds. ""I think it was a real risk and I think it was responsible of Dominic Cummings to see the risk to his family ...and to take steps to avert it"". ITV's Robert Peston asks about Dominic Cummings' trip to Durham. He says the aide, in a ""prima facie"" sense, breached three lockdown rules, and asks if people in the same position as Mr Cummings are allowed to do what he did. Boris Johnson says he thought what the family did was ""totally understandable"" and said there was guidance about that particular scenario. ""Looking at the situation any father, any parent would frankly understand what he did,"" he said. The prime minister added he acted in such a way as to avoid the spread of the virus. Scott Macnab, from The Scotsman, points out that Dr Catherine Calderwoodresigned as Scotland's chief medical officerfollowing discussions with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon after twice visiting a second home during the lockdown. He asks whether, if the prime minister sticks by Dominic Cummings for travelling 260 miles to self-isolate, it undermines the rules he expects the public to follow. Boris Johnson replies: ""No, the sharp distinction is that, unlike the lady you mentioned, Mr Cummings actually went into lockdown because he had symptoms, went into self isolation for 14 days or more. ""That is what you should do. The particular circumstances of his isolation, as I've said now several times now, were determined by the childcare needs of the family.""  Allow Twitter content?

Boris Johnson says Dominic Cummings ""acted responsibly"" when he travelled to the North East during lockdown. After confronting the question of his advisor's future, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has given the daily death figures, announcing a further 118 deaths from Covid-19 in the UK. It takes the total to 36,793. NHS England's medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, says the country is seeing ""a steady but sustained decline in the number of deaths reflecting success in reducing the transmission of virus in the community"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent As expected, Boris Johnson has backed his chief aide. He clearly feels his actions can be explained within the rules. It strikes me Boris Johnson is taking a political gamble here; that the public will understand his decision or arenât that bothered by a ""Westminster row"". Indeed, Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings are seen as political operators who can judge the public mood well. But many - including several Tory MPs - think theyâve got this wrong. They believe the public does care and see it as one rule for us, one rule for them. The prime minister said he takes the allegations against his chief adviser Dominic Cummings ""so seriously"" but believes he has done nothing wrong after their ""extensive"" talks. ""I've concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus and when he had no alternative, I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent and I do not mark him down for that,"" said Mr Johnson. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says Dominic Cummings ""followed the instincts of every father and parent"" and has in every respect acted ""responsibly, legally and with integrity"". Mr Johnson says he has held ""extensive face-to-face conversations"" with his his chief adviser, who has faced calls to resign afterallegations he broke coronavirus lockdown rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to lead the UK's briefing shortly. It comes as his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is facing calls to resign overclaims he broke lockdown rules to visit family. Here are some of the latest lines which are likely to be mentioned when we head to Downing Street at 17:00 BST. The deaths of three women at a care home on Skye at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak are being investigated by police. Ten residents at Home Farm care home in Portree have died in the outbreak. Police Scotland said it is looking into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of three women - aged 84, 86 and 88 - at the home. The investigation comes after the Care Inspectorate raised serious concerns about the care offered at the home. The watchdog began legal action to remove owner HC-One as a care provider earlier this month. Police investigate the deaths of three women at Home Farm care home where 10 residents have died in a Covid-19 outbreak.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played WW2 paratrooper who jumped again aged 97 passes away A WW2 veteran, whose parachute jump to mark the 75th anniversary of a major wartime operation went viral last year, has died at the age of 97. Sandy Cortmann, from Aberdeen, made an emotional return to the Netherlands to commemorate the anniversary of Operation Market Garden last September. He was just 22 when he parachuted near Arnhem in 1944, before being taken prisoner by the Germans. The events in 1944 were immortalised in the 1977 epic A Bridge Too Far. Mr Cortmann's family said he had passed away at his care home in Aberdeen on Saturday. Veteran, 97, parachutes again over Arnhem Mr Cortmann described the jump last year as ""thoroughly terrifying but wonderful"". Footage of the jump went viral on social media, and not long after returning to Scotland from his adventure he received hundreds of fan letters from people in the Netherlands. Sandy Cortmann was just 22 when he parachuted near Arnhem in 1944 Dutch people were so moved his his story, a campaign was launched to send well wishes and thank you messages to the Aberdonian. Operation Market Garden saw 35,000 British, American and Polish troops parachute or glide behind German lines in a bid to open up an attack route for allied forces. The fighting around Arnhem saw more than 1,500 British soldiers killed and nearly 6,500 captured. Some 1,500 people took part in amass parachute dropto commemorate the allied assault. Recalling 1944, Mr Cortmann said: ""When the fighting started we were just in amongst it. ""You can describe it as brave, you thought you were brave, but once you got down there, Jesus Christ, terrified, absolutely terrified. ""You just heard bangs and machine guns. I didn't understand what that was all about."" Sandy Cortmann did the tandem jump last year Allied soldiers had been parachuted in to secure bridges on the Dutch and German border. Mr Cortmann remembered seeing treatment areas for the wounded ""strewn with bodies"". He recalled one young soldier calling out repeatedly for his mother and being told to help quieten him. ""I crawled out, I just touched his hand, grabbed it and he died,"" he said. ""I thought, 'what a thing to happen'. I was choking, but I was alive."" The veteran paratrooper and his comrades had tried to escape the fighting by crossing a river to safety, but Mr Cortmann was forced to admit he could not swim. He said that instead of abandoning him his fellow soldiers put their clothes back on and stayed. Mr Cortmann was eventually captured and endured a seven-hour train ride in a packed wagon to Germany where he was held for a year. Friend Bob Crocker, a fellow member of the Aberdeen Airborne Alliance, said: ""I'm really saddened by the passing of Sandy, the humble kind gentleman Airborne soldier. ""Sandy was a treasure in many ways and especially to us in the Airborne community, we've not only lost an Airborne brother but a friend and a gentleman. It was a privilege knowing and spending time with him, we'll all miss him and his spirit. Rest in peace warrior.""

"The congregation of Dunseverick Baptist Church in Bushmills attended a service in their cars on Sunday Church services in Northern Ireland have changed. This weekend, congregations didn't gather in buildings - but car parks. It's after theStormont Executive relaxed coronavirus lockdown restrictionsand allowed worshippers to gather in their vehicles. Churches recently reopened for people to pray privately, with appropriate social distancing and the cleaning of shared-contact hard surfaces. Butdrive-in services are permitted, as long as people stay in their cars.,external The service was led by Pastor Billy Jones, who said it was a ""symbolic day"" A number of drive-in sermons took place on Sunday, like the one at Dunseverick Baptist Church outside Bushmills in County Antrim. An orchestrated beeping of horns got proceedings under way. Worshippers were able to attend church from the comfort of their cars This definitely wasn't your typical Sunday at church. NI five-step plan for easing lockdown published The service was led by Pastor Billy Jones who said the day was hugely symbolic. ""Yes, I know socially isolating in our own cars, but the fact that we can come to one place together to worship God means an important amount to many, many people,"" he said. Drive-in services are permitted in Northern Ireland, as long as people stay in their cars Several members of the congregation spoke of the service symbolising ""light at the end of the tunnel"". Another said: ""We don't need a church because the people are the church, but it's just lovely to come together again."" It wasn't the first drive-in service at Dunseverick Baptist Church. In previous summers it has staged similar services for tourists. Now it was for necessity, not novelty. It was all smiles as the congregation got back to church About 100 vehicles lined up in front of the outdoor stage where Pastor Jones delivered his service, helped by two powerful speakers. Worshippers sat with their car windows down amid plenty of waves, smiles and sing-a-longs. This event isn't likely to be a one-off. Pastor Jones says he is happy to facilitate other drive-ins until the congregation can once again gather inside. After an hour, an orderly queue of cars formed for the exit.

"This video can not be played PM: Phased reopening of schools to begin from June 1 Parents and teachers should prepare for the phased reopening of schools in England to start on 1 June as planned, the prime minister has confirmed. Boris Johnson said the government intended to reopen then for early years pupils, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6. On June 15, up to a quarter of Year 10 and Year 12 will be allowed ""some contact"" to help prepare for exams. Schools closed on 20 March, except for key workers' children and vulnerable children, as Covid-19 spread in the UK. Speaking at the daily Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson said he was setting out the government's intention so teachers and parents could ""plan in earnest"" for school to resume in just over a week. He said the formal decision would be taken as part of the three-week review into the lockdown measures, which the government is legally required to carry out by Thursday. With many teachers expressing concerns about wider reopening, Mr Johnson said he acknowledged that it ""may not be possible"" for all schools, adding that the government will support those ""experiencing difficulties"" to reopen as soon as possible. More councils warn over opening schools on 1 June Key evidence on opening schools revealed Is your local authority reopening schools? Mr Johnson said reopening schools was a crucial part of the next phase of the government's response to the pandemic because ""the education of our children is crucial for their welfare, their health, their long-term future and for social justice"". ""So in line with the decisions taken in many other countries, we want to start getting our children back into the classroom in a way that is as manageable and as safe as possible,"" he said. Schools have been preparing measures to teach safely during the pandemic The proposal had prompted concerns from teaching unions, head teachers and many local authorities. Speaking after the prime minister's announcement, Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the union did not agree that it would be right to reopen more widely. He called on the government to ""engage meaningfully"" with unions to address concerns over issues such such as protective equipment for staff and procedures for dealing with an outbreak. A BBC Breakfast survey with responses from 99 councils found that only 20 were advising schools to open more widely on 1 June. Another 15 said they would not be advising schools to reopen to more pupils and 68 said they could not guarantee reopening for Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 as the government intended. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? The timetable also sets England apart from other parts of the UK, where schools are not expected to open until later. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeontweeted,externalafter the prime minister's briefing ""to avoid a resurgence we must move carefully"". Schools in Scotland are scheduled to begin to reopen on 11 August, the beginning of the autumn term. In Northern Ireland, they are not expected to reopen before September. And Wales has ruled out a return to school on 1 June, with the education minister saying only that they will reopen ""when it is safe to do so"". The government ""has not done a good job in building confidence"", said head teachers' leaders. This tough report card wasn't about political events - but the way that reopening schools in England is being handled. Boris Johnson repeated the aim for opening primary schools on 1 June - although at the same time acknowledging the reality that many will not really open, with teachers' unions and some local authorities and parents not convinced of its safety. There are some adjustments. Secondary school pupils in Years 10 and 12 will now go back from 15 June. The first few primary year groups are still set to return on 1 June. But heads still have no explanation for how for the last month of term they are meant to fit all their primary years into school full-time, while at the same time only allowing 15 children per classroom. A lack of trust still seems to be confusing plans for a return to school - only a week before children should be getting ready for their first day back since March. Mr Johnson said teaching unions, head teachers and local authorities in England would be able to ""ask questions and probe the evidence"" further over the coming days and said that""detailed guidance"" had been published,externalsetting out how to ensure safety. That included smaller classes, staggered times for breaks, drop-offs and pick-ups, and reducing the use of shared items, the prime minister said. Staff and students would have access to coronavirus testing, he said, and ""if they test positive we will take the appropriate reactive measures"".

"This video can not be played Aya Hachem is believed to have been shot dead in a case of mistaken identity The funeral of a law student killed in a drive-by shooting in Blackburn has taken place in her hometown in Lebanon. Aya Hachem, 19, died when shots were fired from a passing car on 17 May. Five people have appeared in court charged with her murder while officers have been granted more time to question another murder suspect. Police have also appealed for dashcam footage from anyone traveling along the A666 between Bolton and Blackburn between 14:00 and 16:00 BST. ""I appreciate this is quite a long period of time but knowing who was moving along that road at those times is key to us,"" said Det Supt Andy Cribbin, from Lancashire Police. Ms Hachem was walking along King Street to the supermarket when she was hit by one of two bullets fired from a car. Aya Hachem died from a gunshot wound to the chest Ms Hachem's parents paid tribute to her as the ""most loyal devoted daughter"" who ""dreamed of becoming a solicitor"". The Lebanese-born teenager, who was a second-year student at the University of Salford, was buried in the town of Koleileh on Saturday. Her mother Samar Hachem, who had travelled to Lebanon for the funeral, recalled the moment she was informed of her daughter's death. ""I started to shout, maybe to scream, I thought maybe an accident, maybe a car or something like that,"" she said. ""I asked, what's happened to her? Is she still in hospital? ""And he told me, she's dead."" The funeral of Aya Hachem was held in Lebanon on Saturday Feroz Suleman, of Shear Brow in Blackburn, and Abubakir Satia, of Oxford Close in Blackburn, were the first people to be charged in connection with her death on Friday. They appeared at Preston Magistrates' Court along with Uthman Satia, of Oxford Close in Blackburn, Judy Chapman, of St Hubert's Road in Great Harwood, and Kashif Manzoor, of Shakeshaft Street in Blackburn, who were charged later. They have also been charged with the attempted murder of their intended target Pashar Khan, the court heard. They were remanded in custody to appear at Preston Crown Court on Wednesday.

"Mr Netanyahu is the first serving Israeli prime minister to go on trial The trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on corruption charges has opened in Jerusalem, days after he began a new term in office. Mr Netanyahu, 70, is the first standing leader to face trial in the country's history. He denies accusations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Arrived at the courthouse for a brief hearing, he said the cases were aimed at ""toppling him in any way possible"". He was sworn back into office as head of a rare unity government a week ago. His political rival, Benny Gantz, agreed to share power following three inconclusive elections in under a year. He has rejected calls by opponents to step down while he fights the cases. Netanyahu trial: What are the allegations? Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM This video can not be played November 2019 - Benjamin Netanyahu rails against corruption charges The leader of the right-wing Likud party is Israel's longest-serving prime minister, having been in power continuously since 2009. He also served a term in office from 1996-1999. What happened at the court? As he arrived at the Jerusalem District Court on Sunday, he told reporters: ""I'm here with a straight back and my head held high."" ""When you need to take me down, a strong prime minister from the right, everything is possible,"" he added. At the start of the hearing, which lasted about an hour, Mr Netanyahu told the judges: ""I read and I understand the indictment."" He stood in a face mask and refused to sit down on the defendants' bench until the reporters left the room, local media say. His lawyers say they need several months to prepare their defence. The date for the next hearing has been set for 19 July. Mr Netanyahu has been indicted in three cases, known as 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000: Case 1,000 - Fraud and breach of trust: he is accused of receiving gifts - mainly cigars and bottles of champagne - from powerful businessmen in exchange for favours Case 2,000 - Fraud and breach of trust: Mr Netanyahu is accused of offering to help improve the circulation of Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot in exchange for positive coverage Case 4,000 - Bribery, fraud and breach of trust: as PM and minister of communications at the time of the alleged offence, Mr Netanyahu is accused of promoting regulatory decisions favourable to the controlling shareholder in the Bezeq telecom giant, Shaul Elovitch, in exchange for positive coverage by Mr Elovitch's Walla news site Mr Netanyahu has strongly denied all the charges against him, branding them a ""witch-hunt"" by political opponents, and has vowed to clear his name. According to Israeli law, a leader charged with a crime is not required to resign. But there is no precedent. A former prime minister, Ehud Olmert, stepped down as party leader when he was under investigation for corruption in 2008 but technically remained prime minister until elections the following year - polls which brought Benjamin Netanyahu to power. Mr Netanyahu has resisted calls to step down, vowing to clear his name Under the power-sharing deal with Benny Gantz, a new role of ""alternate prime minister"" was created, which means when the two men switch positions in 18 months' time, Mr Netanyahu will still occupy a prime ministerial office and stay on as Mr Gantz's deputy. In short, a serving prime minister occupying the most powerful office in the land simultaneously trying to clear his name and avoid jail-time. Opposition leader Yair Lapid called it ""an embarrassment"" and ""horrible for the spirit of the nation"" though it is not expected to affect government policy. Mr Netanyahu is still likely to press ahead with plans to annex Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley - territory in the occupied West Bank - in the coming months, a move certain to infuriate the Palestinians. The trial is unlikely to affect controversial plans to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank Opinion in Israel as to whether he should carry on as prime minister is split: critics say the spectacle of a trial makes Mr Netanyahu's job untenable, but his supporters - including his party - say he has been democratically elected and should not be forced out. Even if he is convicted, Mr Netanyahu will not be required to resign unless and until any appeals are exhausted - which could, in theory, be many months or years into the future. In Ehud Olmert's case, the former prime minister went on trial in 2009 and after he was convicted only began serving his sentence in 2016 due to the long legal process.

"May's school half-term would normally have boosted trade in tourist towns like Tenby Wales' tourism sector could ""struggle to generate any significant revenue"" before next Easter at the earliest, according to the economy minister. Ken Skates said it could be longer, depending on ""how soon we can get the virus under control"". Tourism is estimated to be worth Â£3bn to the Welsh economy and bosses have alsoexpressed fears for its future. ""We have to protect the 2021 season by making sure we get rid of the virus as soon as possible,"" said Mr Skates. ""The tourism sector is really going to struggle to generate any significant revenue before certainly Easter of next year, possibly the summer of next year,"" he told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement. Tourism businesses in Wales fear for the future Animals in zoos 'lonely' without visitors Mr Skates said an ""incredibly generous"" package of support had been put in place for businesses but it was ""vitally important"" that people continued to follow the lockdown restrictions to ""kill off the virus"" as soon as possible. He went on to say that some sections of the tourism industry, such as caravan parks, could see some return of business activity, but only if it was safe, and as part of aneasing of lockdown measures. Restrictions currently ban all but essential travel in Wales and visitors are not allowed to come from over the English border despite more relaxed rules there. The minister also warned that unemployment could increase, depending on how the economy recovers. Latest figuresshowed the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits leapt in April, the first full month of the coronavirus lockdown.

SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? ""Unemployment could rise to 10%, possibly more - it depends on the recovery though,"" said Mr Skates. ""If it is a V-shaped recovery then we'd expect to be able to get people back into work much sooner,"" he said. David Jones, the Conservative MP for Clwyd West, told Sunday Supplement that reopening zoos and other attractions with ""wide open spaces"" should be a ""priority"" when it was ""safe to do so"". He pointed out they were facing crippling costs and unable tofurlough staffas they had to continue to look after the animals. Mr Jones said it was costing about Â£30,000 each week to maintain the Welsh Mountain Zoo in Colwyn Bay which has been closed since March. Andrew Campbell, chair of Wales Tourism Alliance which represents 6,000 tourism businesses, told BBC Wales'Country Focusprogramme thatextra bank holidaysor vouchers to direct people to less-visited parts of the country could help save the industry when it comes out of lockdown. ""Rural areas are just the right sort of assets to have for a tourism destination so we are really hoping that people will come back here, but we need businesses to survive,"" he said.

"""Covid-19 anxiety"" is being felt by many with new lockdown routines Mental health experts are offering advice to help adults and children cope with ""Covid-19 anxiety"". A Cardiff trauma psychotherapist says many people are experiencing feelings of fear and uncertainty. This includes NHS staff, who are said to beat risk of high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, without the right support. Specialist Colette Hart said the virus ""ticks all the boxes"" to trigger a distress response. She said being forced to adapt to new routines, such as social distancing, self-isolation, home schooling or compulsory interaction with family added to the issues. Colette Hart said many people report feeling overwhelmed Worries about finances, health concerns and loved ones can lead to ""a natural response to life's events"", said Ms Hart. ""Is it any wonder with little control over our lives many of us report feeling overwhelmed by a sense of heightened anxiety, hyper vigilance, fear and loss of meaning?"" she added. How to protect your mental health 'Anxiety, anxiety, anxiety' Nadiya Hussain shares lockdown anxiety 'struggle' But the psychotherapist said there are ways to cope - and to help prevent future mental health issues developing. ""There's no doubt that, going forward, another 'normal' will take the place of this one, and some of us may seek professional help to try and make sense of our world and re-set our buttons,"" said Ms Hart. ""And some may not. It's important to understand we can't control what happens with the coronavirus or the economy, but we can control how we respond to it."" Dr Pippa Mundy said keeping a routine for children was important The impact of coronavirus upon children and young people will be greatly influenced by those they live with, especially their parents or guardians, according to consultant clinical psychologist Dr Pippa Mundy. ""Keeping a routine is helpful for children in good times and is especially important in difficult times. Routines give order and predictability when we feel the world is changing around us,"" she said. Such routines could include having regular family meals together, providing opportunities to check-in with each other, playing games, dancing, exercising and listening to music together to give a sense of solidarity, she said. Be safe and stay connected- Self-isolation doesn't mean cutting off all communication, in fact, it's more important than ever to talk and listen, share stories and advice, and stay in touch with the people who matter to you. Take notice of things that make you feel good- Eating healthy food, keeping moving by going out for walks or exercising can help us to feel good. Notice the beauty outside your window or on a walk around the block, taking time to acknowledge people you see. Go on an information mini-break- the endless updates from news outlets and people on social media can be completely overwhelming. Pick one trusted source of information and visit it once a day only. Share how you're feeling- Talk to loved ones and friends. Talking has the effect of lifting our mood and really helps us to begin to feel more positive if we're having a tough time. Keep moving- Find ways to move your body and your mood every day. It's OK to go for a walk, run or ride your bike, as long as you avoid other people. Stick to a routine- This sounds dull but it will help you get through each day. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time, eat regularly, shower, change your clothes, get some fresh air, book in video-chats with colleagues or friends, do your chores. Make time for fun! Find ways to relax and distract- Finding things that help you breathe deeply, consciously setting your worries aside or focusing on the moment to recharge can be helpful. Distracting yourself by watching films or TV programmes, reading or listening to music will help you to set things in context and provide relief from anxious feelings.

"The congregation of Dunseverick Baptist Church in Bushmills attended a service in their cars on Sunday Church services in Northern Ireland have changed. This weekend, congregations didn't gather in buildings - but car parks. It's after theStormont Executive relaxed coronavirus lockdown restrictionsand allowed worshippers to gather in their vehicles. Churches recently reopened for people to pray privately, with appropriate social distancing and the cleaning of shared-contact hard surfaces. Butdrive-in services are permitted, as long as people stay in their cars.,external The service was led by Pastor Billy Jones, who said it was a ""symbolic day"" A number of drive-in sermons took place on Sunday, like the one at Dunseverick Baptist Church outside Bushmills in County Antrim. An orchestrated beeping of horns got proceedings under way. Worshippers were able to attend church from the comfort of their cars This definitely wasn't your typical Sunday at church. NI five-step plan for easing lockdown published The service was led by Pastor Billy Jones who said the day was hugely symbolic. ""Yes, I know socially isolating in our own cars, but the fact that we can come to one place together to worship God means an important amount to many, many people,"" he said. Drive-in services are permitted in Northern Ireland, as long as people stay in their cars Several members of the congregation spoke of the service symbolising ""light at the end of the tunnel"". Another said: ""We don't need a church because the people are the church, but it's just lovely to come together again."" It wasn't the first drive-in service at Dunseverick Baptist Church. In previous summers it has staged similar services for tourists. Now it was for necessity, not novelty. It was all smiles as the congregation got back to church About 100 vehicles lined up in front of the outdoor stage where Pastor Jones delivered his service, helped by two powerful speakers. Worshippers sat with their car windows down amid plenty of waves, smiles and sing-a-longs. This event isn't likely to be a one-off. Pastor Jones says he is happy to facilitate other drive-ins until the congregation can once again gather inside. After an hour, an orderly queue of cars formed for the exit. For the 200 or so present, it was a return to some kind of normality.

"This video can not be played Tony Hall on the future of the BBC and the role the corporation has played during the Covid-19 crisis People have ""turned to the BBC in their droves"" in recent weeks, according to the BBC's director general. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Tony Hall said 94% of the UK accessed the BBC for ""information, entertainment or education"" during the pandemic. He said he ""took his hat off"" to staff who had created ""excellent"" content, even though 92% of the workforce were now working from home. The BBC could lose Â£125m in revenue because of coronavirus, he added. Lord Hall also said he recognised the need for a ""big debate"" about the future of the BBC and the way it is funded. The director general, who is set to leave his role in the summer, said younger audiences had been coming back to the BBC during the lockdown, with shows such as Normal People becoming huge hits. The corporation said that 94% of the British public used the BBC in the third week of March when social distancing began in the UK - with 86% of younger people between the ages of 16-34 also accessing BBC content. Normal People TV series: 'It's so easy to relate to' BBC 'must reflect nation' says culture secretary BBC could scale back output if hit by coronavirus Lord Hall also credited this success to its""biggest ever educational programme"", as well the launch of Culture in Quarantine - an arts and culture service which Lord Hall says keeps ""the arts alive in people's homes and support the arts sector during challenging times"". He was pressedon plans to bring back BBC Three as a regular TV channel,four years after it was taken off air and moved online to save costs. Lord Hall said the initial plans had been a ""fantastic, creative success"" and showed ""the importance of developing our iPlayer, developing our sounds and making sure that our new services are in tip top position for young audiences to come to"". Normal People has attracted record audiences for BBC Three on iPlayer However, he acknowledged that the broadcaster could potentially lose Â£125m as a result of coronavirus, meaning it would have to spend ""wisely"" in future. The BBC is facing financial pressure after being forcedto delay the end of the free TV licence schemefor all over-75s. It also had to postponeplans to cut 450 jobs, and said there was uncertainty around commercial revenues. Lord Hall said that he hopes in future, there will be a ""big debate"" about how the BBC should be funded post 2027, when the current charter comes to an end. He said: ""The question is, what's the best way of funding that universally so that everybody, this great democratic idea, gets something we can all share. ""I hope even when I've left I can take part in that debate and we should look at the easiest way to pay, learn from what happens in other countries, are there fairer ways to pay, but the underpinning for all that is the idea of a BBC which is providing something for everyone."" It comes aftera public consultation was launched by the government on whether failure to pay for a TV licenceshould stop being a criminal offence, with the BBC warning it would cost the corporation more than Â£1bn over five years.

"This video can not be played Aya Hachem is believed to have been shot dead in a case of mistaken identity The funeral of a law student killed in a drive-by shooting in Blackburn has taken place in her hometown in Lebanon. Aya Hachem, 19, died when shots were fired from a passing car on 17 May. Five people have appeared in court charged with her murder while officers have been granted more time to question another murder suspect. Police have also appealed for dashcam footage from anyone traveling along the A666 between Bolton and Blackburn between 14:00 and 16:00 BST. ""I appreciate this is quite a long period of time but knowing who was moving along that road at those times is key to us,"" said Det Supt Andy Cribbin, from Lancashire Police. Ms Hachem was walking along King Street to the supermarket when she was hit by one of two bullets fired from a car. Aya Hachem died from a gunshot wound to the chest Ms Hachem's parents paid tribute to her as the ""most loyal devoted daughter"" who ""dreamed of becoming a solicitor"". The Lebanese-born teenager, who was a second-year student at the University of Salford, was buried in the town of Koleileh on Saturday. Her mother Samar Hachem, who had travelled to Lebanon for the funeral, recalled the moment she was informed of her daughter's death. ""I started to shout, maybe to scream, I thought maybe an accident, maybe a car or something like that,"" she said. ""I asked, what's happened to her? Is she still in hospital? ""And he told me, she's dead."" The funeral of Aya Hachem was held in Lebanon on Saturday Feroz Suleman, of Shear Brow in Blackburn, and Abubakir Satia, of Oxford Close in Blackburn, were the first people to be charged in connection with her death on Friday. They appeared at Preston Magistrates' Court along with Uthman Satia, of Oxford Close in Blackburn, Judy Chapman, of St Hubert's Road in Great Harwood, and Kashif Manzoor, of Shakeshaft Street in Blackburn, who were charged later. They have also been charged with the attempted murder of their intended target Pashar Khan, the court heard. They were remanded in custody to appear at Preston Crown Court on Wednesday.

Transport Secretary Michael Matheson will update the Scottish Parliament on revised codes of social distancing on trains and buses north of the border on Tuesday. UK counterpart Grant Shapps yesterday suggested that the transport system would still only run at a fifth of its usual capacity as the country moves out of lockdown. He announced a Â£283m package of investment in buses and light rail services to improve safety and restore services during the coronavirus pandemic and, although it only covers England, he claimed it would help the UK as a whole ""start moving back to a full timetable"" as it moves out of lockdown. Mr Shapps said the government would also bring in more marshals - volunteers called ""Journey Makers"" - at stations to join British Transport Police officers, Network Rail and train operator staff currently advising passengers and monitoring social distancing. But the transport secretary says social distancing will cut capacity to a fifth of the usual amount.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A protester demonstrates outside the home of Dominic Cummings on Sunday Charlie Cooper of Politico asks about the prime minister's support for his top adviser Dominic Cummings, wondering if rules have changed to allow anyone with symptoms who has concerns about childcare to travel to another home. Boris Johnson gives a short riposte, saying the government's advice remains unchanged . ""That is that if you have symptoms then you should self isolate for 14 days - and that's what Mr Cummings and his family did"", he says. The advice makes it ""absolutely clear "" that childcare has to be ""taken into account"", Mr Johnson adds. ""I think it was a real risk and I think it was responsible of Dominic Cummings to see the risk to his family ...and to take steps to avert it"". ITV's Robert Peston asks about Dominic Cummings' trip to Durham. He says the aide, in a ""prima facie"" sense, breached three lockdown rules, and asks if people in the same position as Mr Cummings are allowed to do what he did. Boris Johnson says he thought what the family did was ""totally understandable"" and said there was guidance about that particular scenario. ""Looking at the situation any father, any parent would frankly understand what he did,"" he said. The prime minister added he acted in such a way as to avoid the spread of the virus. Scott Macnab, from The Scotsman, points out that Dr Catherine Calderwoodresigned as Scotland's chief medical officerfollowing discussions with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon after twice visiting a second home during the lockdown. He asks whether, if the prime minister sticks by Dominic Cummings for travelling 260 miles to self-isolate, it undermines the rules he expects the public to follow. Boris Johnson replies: ""No, the sharp distinction is that, unlike the lady you mentioned, Mr Cummings actually went into lockdown because he had symptoms, went into self isolation for 14 days or more. ""That is what you should do. The particular circumstances of his isolation, as I've said now several times now, were determined by the childcare needs of the family.""  Allow Twitter content?

Boris Johnson says Dominic Cummings ""acted responsibly"" when he travelled to the North East during lockdown. After confronting the question of his advisor's future, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has given the daily death figures, announcing a further 118 deaths from Covid-19 in the UK. It takes the total to 36,793. NHS England's medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, says the country is seeing ""a steady but sustained decline in the number of deaths reflecting success in reducing the transmission of virus in the community"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent As expected, Boris Johnson has backed his chief aide. He clearly feels his actions can be explained within the rules. It strikes me Boris Johnson is taking a political gamble here; that the public will understand his decision or arenât that bothered by a ""Westminster row"". Indeed, Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings are seen as political operators who can judge the public mood well. But many - including several Tory MPs - think theyâve got this wrong. They believe the public does care and see it as one rule for us, one rule for them. The prime minister said he takes the allegations against his chief adviser Dominic Cummings ""so seriously"" but believes he has done nothing wrong after their ""extensive"" talks. ""I've concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus and when he had no alternative, I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent and I do not mark him down for that,"" said Mr Johnson. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says Dominic Cummings ""followed the instincts of every father and parent"" and has in every respect acted ""responsibly, legally and with integrity"". Mr Johnson says he has held ""extensive face-to-face conversations"" with his his chief adviser, who has faced calls to resign afterallegations he broke coronavirus lockdown rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to lead the UK's briefing shortly. It comes as his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is facing calls to resign overclaims he broke lockdown rules to visit family. Here are some of the latest lines which are likely to be mentioned when we head to Downing Street at 17:00 BST. The deaths of three women at a care home on Skye at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak are being investigated by police. Ten residents at Home Farm care home in Portree have died in the outbreak. Police Scotland said it is looking into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of three women - aged 84, 86 and 88 - at the home. The investigation comes after the Care Inspectorate raised serious concerns about the care offered at the home. The watchdog began legal action to remove owner HC-One as a care provider earlier this month. Police investigate the deaths of three women at Home Farm care home where 10 residents have died in a Covid-19 outbreak.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Tony Hall on the future of the BBC and the role the corporation has played during the Covid-19 crisis People have ""turned to the BBC in their droves"" in recent weeks, according to the BBC's director general. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Tony Hall said 94% of the UK accessed the BBC for ""information, entertainment or education"" during the pandemic. He said he ""took his hat off"" to staff who had created ""excellent"" content, even though 92% of the workforce were now working from home. The BBC could lose Â£125m in revenue because of coronavirus, he added. Lord Hall also said he recognised the need for a ""big debate"" about the future of the BBC and the way it is funded. The director general, who is set to leave his role in the summer, said younger audiences had been coming back to the BBC during the lockdown, with shows such as Normal People becoming huge hits. The corporation said that 94% of the British public used the BBC in the third week of March when social distancing began in the UK - with 86% of younger people between the ages of 16-34 also accessing BBC content. Normal People TV series: 'It's so easy to relate to' BBC 'must reflect nation' says culture secretary BBC could scale back output if hit by coronavirus Lord Hall also credited this success to its""biggest ever educational programme"", as well the launch of Culture in Quarantine - an arts and culture service which Lord Hall says keeps ""the arts alive in people's homes and support the arts sector during challenging times"". He was pressedon plans to bring back BBC Three as a regular TV channel,four years after it was taken off air and moved online to save costs. Lord Hall said the initial plans had been a ""fantastic, creative success"" and showed ""the importance of developing our iPlayer, developing our sounds and making sure that our new services are in tip top position for young audiences to come to"". Normal People has attracted record audiences for BBC Three on iPlayer However, he acknowledged that the broadcaster could potentially lose Â£125m as a result of coronavirus, meaning it would have to spend ""wisely"" in future. The BBC is facing financial pressure after being forcedto delay the end of the free TV licence schemefor all over-75s. It also had to postponeplans to cut 450 jobs, and said there was uncertainty around commercial revenues. Lord Hall said that he hopes in future, there will be a ""big debate"" about how the BBC should be funded post 2027, when the current charter comes to an end. He said: ""The question is, what's the best way of funding that universally so that everybody, this great democratic idea, gets something we can all share. ""I hope even when I've left I can take part in that debate and we should look at the easiest way to pay, learn from what happens in other countries, are there fairer ways to pay, but the underpinning for all that is the idea of a BBC which is providing something for everyone.""

"People are sending in images and thoughts on the coronavirus pandemic as part of a project at Swansea University How will the coronavirus pandemic be remembered? Neil Prior takes a look at the projects documenting history-in-the-making in the age of the internet. When future historians study the global coronavirus pandemic and how Wales responded, the material available to them will differ from previous major events. Because of the impermanent nature of internet communications, it is vital we consciously collect our history, believes Rosemary Davies, who teaches the subject at Ysgol Dyffryn Taf school in Whitland, Carmarthenshire. ""What would have been the pencilled notes and written diaries of a century or two ago are now WhatsApp messages and texts which can disappear in a moment,"" she said. Cardiff students take final exams from home Young carers 'turned away' from shops in lockdown ""I can take my pupils to the Imperial War Museum and show them letters written from the Western Front, letters which the author would never have expected to have survived this long. ""Whilst it seems strange, we have to start making a conscious effort to gather these electronic communications, even in the midst of all this madness, so future generations have access to the sorts of contemporaneous primary sources we've been able to utilise in studying other historic events."" Children have drawn rainbows and displaying them in their windows during lockdown Already, at least six projects are underway across Wales to record and archive people's coronavirus experiences, including efforts by Swansea University, National Museum Wales and the National Library of Wales. National Museum Wales is aiming to create a network of community collectors who will gather oral histories, images and objects relating to the pandemic, such as a saucepan used to ""clap for carers"",  or an early attempt by someone learning a new skill like knitting.

Chief executive and librarian Pedr ap Llwyd said officials were busy collecting a variety of items - from newspapers to official publications and archiving web content - but that this alone could not tell the full story. ""Since its inception over a century ago, the library has collected and preserved records of events in our history as Welsh people, and making it available to current and future generations,"" he said. ""During this period we will archive an official record of the Covid-19 crisis and its effect on Wales and on the people of Wales. ""However, this wouldn't provide a full picture of the times. Therefore we are also eager to collect personal experiences, and record the effect of the current situation on the everyday life of the nation."" The Swansea University's CoronaDiaries project, led by senior lecturer in social science Dr Michael Ward, was launched in  mid-March and has since attracted more than 160 contributors from 12 different countries, ranging in age from 10 to 89 years old. ""It's a social science experiment of how we're feeling right now, to be accessed and utilised immediately,"" he said. Posters and artworks have been appearing on streets during lockdown ""If it turns out to be useful in the future then all the better, but I believe there are potential dangers in knowingly setting out to log history."" Dr Ward's primary concern is that contributors may respond differently if they are aware that their accounts are forming social history. He added: ""Not all by any means, but many of the letters and diaries we think of as primary sources were candid accounts of how the writer was feeling in that moment, completely oblivious to the fact that they'd be read centuries in the future. ""If you went back in time and told them that what they were writing would shape our understanding of history, then they'd have probably created a very different document indeed.""

""People start to look for parallels. In truth these are quite different times,"" he said. ""World War Two was a frenzy of activity - a fight for life with very little time to think -  whereas the accounts I'm receiving are of a much more contemplative experience."" Dr Ward urged anyone who wants to share their experiences to do so with a trusted source, such as a university or the national museum and library. ""As with everything in life, think about the personal data you're sharing, who you're sharing it with, and what it could be used for,"" he said. As for life after lockdown, Mrs Davies believes society will need some sort of focal point to remember what has happened. ""In the same way that we have Remembrance Sunday or Holocaust Remembrance day, I think once this is all over there should be a national day to commemorate the people who have died, the efforts of the key workers, and the troubled times we've all lived through.""

"This video can not be played Hong Kong protesters flee tear gas during rally against China's draft security law Police in Hong Kong have fired tear gas and water cannon at protesters rallying against China's plans to impose a new security law on the territory. Thousands of demonstrators have been marching through the city centre. Police say 120 have been arrested. Earlier, 200 senior politicians from around the world issued a joint statement criticising China's plan. But China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the legislation should be brought in ""without the slightest delay"". China is seeking to pass a law that would ban ""treason, secession, sedition and subversion"" in the territory. Activists fear it is an attempt to limit freedoms and silence Beijing's opponents. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong so worried? All the context you need on Hong Kong's protests How bad are China's economic woes? Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who is seen as part of the pro-Beijing political establishment, has pledged full support for the proposed law and said the city's rights would remain unchanged. China has dismissed concerns the legislation would harm foreign investors in Hong Kong, an important financial centre, and lashed out at ""meddling"" countries. Protesters gathered in the busy Causeway Bay and Wan Chai districts of the city on Sunday, chanting slogans against the government and waving banners. Riot police fired tear gas and water cannon at demonstrators, who were wearing face masks to protect against the spread of coronavirus. Crowds of protesters march through the city's popular shopping district The rally comes despite earlier warnings from authorities against unauthorised assembly and a ban on large public gatherings to enforce social distancing. Some protesters threw objects such as umbrellas and water bottles at officers, and used bins and other debris to set up road blocks. Reports say Sunday's protest followed a similar pattern to many of last year's demonstrations, many of which turned violent. More than 8,400 people have been arrested in Hong Kong since pro-democracy protests erupted last year. Danny Vincent, BBC News, Hong Kong For many protesters Sunday's protest was seen a stress test. They wanted to see how the police would react to large scale demonstrations following months of relative quiet. The young and old chanted familiar slogans from last year's movement. They called for the Hong Kong government to respond to the five political demands they set out last year. But there were new slogans, too. Some protesters called openly for Hong Kong independence. They claimed that it was now the only way forward for the semi-autonomous city. The police were quick to disperse the crowds. They fired several rounds of tear gas before charging towards the protesters. The national security proposal has united protesters willing to risk both breaking the law and social distancing measures in order to show their anger at plans that many fear could spell the end to one country two systems. The ""draft decision"" - as it is known before approval by China's National People's Congress - includes an article that says Hong Kong ""must improve"" national security. It adds: ""When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law."" Police fire water cannon to disperse protesters in Causeway Bay That means China could potentially have its own law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong, alongside the city's own. Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woes China scraps annual growth target for first time How is Hong Kong run? Earlier this week,US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemnedthe plans, which he described as a ""death knell"" for the city's freedoms. The UK, Australia and Canada have also expressed their ""deep concern"". This video can not be played Hong Kongers give their reaction to the controversial national security law in May Relations between Washington and Beijing are already strained over trade disputes and the coronavirus pandemic. The US is currently considering whether to extend Hong Kong's preferential trading and investment privileges. President Trump has also weighed in, saying the US would react strongly if the law went through - without giving details. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Wang accused countries said ""some political forces in the US"" were pushing the two countries ""to the brink of a new Cold War"". The Chinese government argues the law is necessary to ""prevent, stop and punish"" protests such as those that rocked Hong Kong last year. They were sparked by a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The statement was drafted by former Hong Kong Governor Christopher Patten and former British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, and signed by 186 policy makers and politicians from 23 countries. This video can not be played Former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten: ""UK should tell China this is outrageous"" It describes Beijing's plans as a ""flagrant breach"" of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, under which Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997. ""If the international community cannot trust Beijing to keep its word when it comes to Hong Kong, people will be reluctant to take its word on other matters,"" the signatories wrote. They include 17 members of the US Congress, and 44 UK MPs. The NPC is expected to vote on the draft law at the end of its annual session, on 28 May. It will then be forwarded to the NPC's Standing Committee, China's top legislature, which is expected to finalise and enact the law by the end of June.

"Coronavirus has been described as an invisible killer. What could be more terrifying than that? A deadly pathogen we cannot spot, and then when it hits, we cannot treat. It is unsurprising, therefore, that many people are fearful of going out, returning life to normal or even letting children go back to school. People want to be safe. But the problem is we are no longer as safe as we once were. There is, after all, a new virus around that can have catastrophic consequences. So what should we do? Some have argued restrictions need to continue until safety can be guaranteed. But those arguments generally ignore the fact that continuing to do so carries risk in itself. UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty often describes these as the ""indirect costs"" of the pandemic. They include everything from poor access to healthcare for other conditions through to rises in mental illness, financial hardship and damage to education. So as restrictions ease, society and individuals themselves are going to have to make decisions based on balancing competing sets of risks. Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at Edinburgh University, says the question we should be asking is whether we are ""safe enough"". ""There will never be no risk. In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community it's about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling."" She was referring to the row over schools, but the concept can equally be applied to many other scenarios. She says part of that equation depends on the steps taken by government on things such as social distancing, the provision of protective equipment and the availability of testing and then tracing of contacts to contain local outbreaks. She has been critical of the way the government has handled all of them. But as more freedoms are returned, the role of individual decision-making will come more to the fore. It is perhaps not about finding the right option, rather finding the least worst option. Statistician Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in risk from Cambridge University and government adviser, says it has, in effect, become a game of ""risk management"" - and because of that we need to get a handle on the magnitude of risk we face. There are two factors that influence the risk we face from coronavirus - our risk of becoming infected and, once infected, our risk of dying or becoming seriously ill. If we are not in hospital or a care home our best guide to the risk of infection comes from the government's surveillance programme run by the Office for National Statistics. The data published this week suggests around one in 400 people is currently infected. The chances of coming into close contact with one of those individuals - certainly as we are practising social distancing even when out and about - is considered to be pretty slim. Although clearly some people, depending on their jobs, are at higher risk than others. The hope is that level of infection will reduce even further in time if the government's test, track and trace programme keeps the virus suppressed. Then if we do become infected, the fact remains that for most people, coronavirus is a mild-to-moderate illness - only one in 20 people who shows symptoms is believed to need hospital treatment. Those with pre-existing health conditions are most at risk. Deaths among under-65s with no illnesses are ""remarkably uncommon"", research shows. Perhaps the easiest way is to ask yourself to what extent you are worried about the thought of dying in the next 12 months. What is remarkable about coronavirus is that if we are infected our chances of dying seems to mirror our chance of dying anyway over the next year, certainly once we pass the age of 20. For example, an average person aged 40 has around a one-in-1,000 risk of not making it to their next birthday and an almost identical risk of not surviving a coronavirus infection. That means your risk of dying is effectively doubled from what it was if you are infected. And that is the average risk - for most individuals the risk is actually lower than that as most of the risk is held by those who are in poor health in each age group. So coronavirus is, in effect, taking any frailties and amplifying them. It is like packing an extra year's worth of risk into a short period of time. If your risk of dying was very low in the first place, it still remains very low. As for children, the risk of dying from other things - cancer and accidents are the biggest cause of fatalities - is greater than their chance of dying if they are infected with coronavirus. During the pandemic so far three under 15s have died. That compares to around 50 killed in road accidents every year. So what seems crucial as we all try to balance risks is identifying those at significant risk of serious illness from coronavirus - whether we fall into one of those groups ourselves or have close contact with someone who does. Currently the government is asking 2.5 million people to completely isolate themselves. This includes people who have had organ transplants, are having cancer treatment and those with severe respiratory disease. On top of those, there are more than 10 million people who fall into higher risk groups. These include all the over-70s and people with health conditions ranging from diabetes to heart conditions. Prof Sarah Harper, an expert in ageing at the University of Oxford, has argued the ""blanket and arbitrary use of age"" needs looking at as the actual level of risk within this higher risk group varies enormously. Atool developed by University College London,externalhas attempted to tease out some of the differences in risk. Finding out more about these is going to be crucial as we move forward.

"The families of care staff who die in the pandemic will receive a Â£60,000 payment, say the Scottish government. It comes after ministers announced a similardeath in service payment for families of NHS workerslast month. The health secretary also said enhanced sick pay would be given to care staff testing positive for coronavirus. On Thursday, Scotland's biggest private care home provider said carers who were self-isolating would receive full pay if they tested positive for Covid-19. HC-One had come under pressure to change its policy after lobbying from unions and fears that staff would continue working with symptoms of the virus for fear their income would drop to Â£95.85 a week - the current rate of statutory sick pay. The company, which runs 56 care homes in Scotland includingHome Farm in Skye where 10 residents have died in a coronavirus outbreak, said the extra money would also be paid retrospectively to those who were given statutory sick pay having tested positive, following a campaign by the GMB union. Ten residents have died after a coronavirus outbreak at Home Farm care home on Skye In additional to its sick pay fund, the Scottish government said a one-off payment of Â£60,000 would be given to a named survivor of any social care worker who died without death in service cover in their contracted pension arrangements. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said: ""Social care staff provide a critical and valuable service, never more apparent than during this emergency period. ""While some employers offer employment contracts closer to the Scottish government's fair work principles, it is clear that others do not."" Ms Freeman said ""fair work issues"" and how they were realised in commissioning contracts would require to be addressed in future. She added: ""We will continue to work with local government, social care providers and trades unions on further details of the plans over the course of next week."" A survey carried out by the GMB union last week found 78% of its 1,000 respondents were worried about taking a test in case they were found to be positive, and then had to lose money. Its Scottish secretary, Gary Smith, told BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetime programmehe was pleased HC-One had listened to staff concerns, but he now urged other care home companies to follow suit. Mike Kirby, Unison Scottish secretary welcomed the Scottish government's announcement and said the current low level of statutory sick pay had left workers with an ""extremely difficult"" choice. He added: ""The fact that social care workers often have their weekly income reduced to statutory sick pay is immoral and left care workers with exceptionally difficult choice between protecting they own health, protecting those they care for or putting them and their families in a very difficult financial situation.""

"""Covid-19 anxiety"" is being felt by many with new lockdown routines Mental health experts are offering advice to help adults and children cope with ""Covid-19 anxiety"". A Cardiff trauma psychotherapist says many people are experiencing feelings of fear and uncertainty. This includes NHS staff, who are said to beat risk of high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, without the right support. Specialist Colette Hart said the virus ""ticks all the boxes"" to trigger a distress response. She said being forced to adapt to new routines, such as social distancing, self-isolation, home schooling or compulsory interaction with family added to the issues. Colette Hart said many people report feeling overwhelmed Worries about finances, health concerns and loved ones can lead to ""a natural response to life's events"", said Ms Hart. ""Is it any wonder with little control over our lives many of us report feeling overwhelmed by a sense of heightened anxiety, hyper vigilance, fear and loss of meaning?"" she added. How to protect your mental health 'Anxiety, anxiety, anxiety' Nadiya Hussain shares lockdown anxiety 'struggle' But the psychotherapist said there are ways to cope - and to help prevent future mental health issues developing. ""There's no doubt that, going forward, another 'normal' will take the place of this one, and some of us may seek professional help to try and make sense of our world and re-set our buttons,"" said Ms Hart. ""And some may not. It's important to understand we can't control what happens with the coronavirus or the economy, but we can control how we respond to it."" Dr Pippa Mundy said keeping a routine for children was important The impact of coronavirus upon children and young people will be greatly influenced by those they live with, especially their parents or guardians, according to consultant clinical psychologist Dr Pippa Mundy. ""Keeping a routine is helpful for children in good times and is especially important in difficult times. Routines give order and predictability when we feel the world is changing around us,"" she said. Such routines could include having regular family meals together, providing opportunities to check-in with each other, playing games, dancing, exercising and listening to music together to give a sense of solidarity, she said. Be safe and stay connected- Self-isolation doesn't mean cutting off all communication, in fact, it's more important than ever to talk and listen, share stories and advice, and stay in touch with the people who matter to you. Take notice of things that make you feel good- Eating healthy food, keeping moving by going out for walks or exercising can help us to feel good. Notice the beauty outside your window or on a walk around the block, taking time to acknowledge people you see. Go on an information mini-break- the endless updates from news outlets and people on social media can be completely overwhelming. Pick one trusted source of information and visit it once a day only. Share how you're feeling- Talk to loved ones and friends. Talking has the effect of lifting our mood and really helps us to begin to feel more positive if we're having a tough time. Keep moving- Find ways to move your body and your mood every day. It's OK to go for a walk, run or ride your bike, as long as you avoid other people. Stick to a routine- This sounds dull but it will help you get through each day. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time, eat regularly, shower, change your clothes, get some fresh air, book in video-chats with colleagues or friends, do your chores. Make time for fun! Find ways to relax and distract- Finding things that help you breathe deeply, consciously setting your worries aside or focusing on the moment to recharge can be helpful. Distracting yourself by watching films or TV programmes, reading or listening to music will help you to set things in context and provide relief from anxious feelings.

"Mr Netanyahu is the first serving Israeli prime minister to go on trial The trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on corruption charges has opened in Jerusalem, days after he began a new term in office. Mr Netanyahu, 70, is the first standing leader to face trial in the country's history. He denies accusations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Arrived at the courthouse for a brief hearing, he said the cases were aimed at ""toppling him in any way possible"". He was sworn back into office as head of a rare unity government a week ago. His political rival, Benny Gantz, agreed to share power following three inconclusive elections in under a year. He has rejected calls by opponents to step down while he fights the cases. Netanyahu trial: What are the allegations? Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM This video can not be played November 2019 - Benjamin Netanyahu rails against corruption charges The leader of the right-wing Likud party is Israel's longest-serving prime minister, having been in power continuously since 2009. He also served a term in office from 1996-1999. What happened at the court? As he arrived at the Jerusalem District Court on Sunday, he told reporters: ""I'm here with a straight back and my head held high."" ""When you need to take me down, a strong prime minister from the right, everything is possible,"" he added. At the start of the hearing, which lasted about an hour, Mr Netanyahu told the judges: ""I read and I understand the indictment."" He stood in a face mask and refused to sit down on the defendants' bench until the reporters left the room, local media say. His lawyers say they need several months to prepare their defence. The date for the next hearing has been set for 19 July. Mr Netanyahu has been indicted in three cases, known as 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000: Case 1,000 - Fraud and breach of trust: he is accused of receiving gifts - mainly cigars and bottles of champagne - from powerful businessmen in exchange for favours Case 2,000 - Fraud and breach of trust: Mr Netanyahu is accused of offering to help improve the circulation of Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot in exchange for positive coverage Case 4,000 - Bribery, fraud and breach of trust: as PM and minister of communications at the time of the alleged offence, Mr Netanyahu is accused of promoting regulatory decisions favourable to the controlling shareholder in the Bezeq telecom giant, Shaul Elovitch, in exchange for positive coverage by Mr Elovitch's Walla news site Mr Netanyahu has strongly denied all the charges against him, branding them a ""witch-hunt"" by political opponents, and has vowed to clear his name. According to Israeli law, a leader charged with a crime is not required to resign. But there is no precedent. A former prime minister, Ehud Olmert, stepped down as party leader when he was under investigation for corruption in 2008 but technically remained prime minister until elections the following year - polls which brought Benjamin Netanyahu to power. Mr Netanyahu has resisted calls to step down, vowing to clear his name Under the power-sharing deal with Benny Gantz, a new role of ""alternate prime minister"" was created, which means when the two men switch positions in 18 months' time, Mr Netanyahu will still occupy a prime ministerial office and stay on as Mr Gantz's deputy. In short, a serving prime minister occupying the most powerful office in the land simultaneously trying to clear his name and avoid jail-time. Opposition leader Yair Lapid called it ""an embarrassment"" and ""horrible for the spirit of the nation"" though it is not expected to affect government policy. Mr Netanyahu is still likely to press ahead with plans to annex Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley - territory in the occupied West Bank - in the coming months, a move certain to infuriate the Palestinians. The trial is unlikely to affect controversial plans to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank Opinion in Israel as to whether he should carry on as prime minister is split: critics say the spectacle of a trial makes Mr Netanyahu's job untenable, but his supporters - including his party - say he has been democratically elected and should not be forced out. Even if he is convicted, Mr Netanyahu will not be required to resign unless and until any appeals are exhausted - which could, in theory, be many months or years into the future. In Ehud Olmert's case, the former prime minister went on trial in 2009 and after he was convicted only began serving his sentence in 2016 due to the long legal process.

"This video can not be played Hong Kong protesters flee tear gas during rally against China's draft security law Police in Hong Kong have fired tear gas and water cannon at protesters rallying against China's plans to impose a new security law on the territory. Thousands of demonstrators have been marching through the city centre. Police say 120 have been arrested. Earlier, 200 senior politicians from around the world issued a joint statement criticising China's plan. But China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the legislation should be brought in ""without the slightest delay"". China is seeking to pass a law that would ban ""treason, secession, sedition and subversion"" in the territory. Activists fear it is an attempt to limit freedoms and silence Beijing's opponents. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong so worried? All the context you need on Hong Kong's protests How bad are China's economic woes? Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who is seen as part of the pro-Beijing political establishment, has pledged full support for the proposed law and said the city's rights would remain unchanged. China has dismissed concerns the legislation would harm foreign investors in Hong Kong, an important financial centre, and lashed out at ""meddling"" countries. Protesters gathered in the busy Causeway Bay and Wan Chai districts of the city on Sunday, chanting slogans against the government and waving banners. Riot police fired tear gas and water cannon at demonstrators, who were wearing face masks to protect against the spread of coronavirus. Crowds of protesters march through the city's popular shopping district The rally comes despite earlier warnings from authorities against unauthorised assembly and a ban on large public gatherings to enforce social distancing. Some protesters threw objects such as umbrellas and water bottles at officers, and used bins and other debris to set up road blocks. Reports say Sunday's protest followed a similar pattern to many of last year's demonstrations, many of which turned violent. More than 8,400 people have been arrested in Hong Kong since pro-democracy protests erupted last year. Danny Vincent, BBC News, Hong Kong For many protesters Sunday's protest was seen a stress test. They wanted to see how the police would react to large scale demonstrations following months of relative quiet. The young and old chanted familiar slogans from last year's movement. They called for the Hong Kong government to respond to the five political demands they set out last year. But there were new slogans, too. Some protesters called openly for Hong Kong independence. They claimed that it was now the only way forward for the semi-autonomous city. The police were quick to disperse the crowds. They fired several rounds of tear gas before charging towards the protesters. The national security proposal has united protesters willing to risk both breaking the law and social distancing measures in order to show their anger at plans that many fear could spell the end to one country two systems. The ""draft decision"" - as it is known before approval by China's National People's Congress - includes an article that says Hong Kong ""must improve"" national security. It adds: ""When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law."" Police fire water cannon to disperse protesters in Causeway Bay That means China could potentially have its own law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong, alongside the city's own. Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woes China scraps annual growth target for first time How is Hong Kong run? Earlier this week,US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemnedthe plans, which he described as a ""death knell"" for the city's freedoms. The UK, Australia and Canada have also expressed their ""deep concern"". This video can not be played Hong Kongers give their reaction to the controversial national security law in May Relations between Washington and Beijing are already strained over trade disputes and the coronavirus pandemic. The US is currently considering whether to extend Hong Kong's preferential trading and investment privileges. President Trump has also weighed in, saying the US would react strongly if the law went through - without giving details. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Wang accused countries said ""some political forces in the US"" were pushing the two countries ""to the brink of a new Cold War"". The Chinese government argues the law is necessary to ""prevent, stop and punish"" protests such as those that rocked Hong Kong last year. They were sparked by a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The statement was drafted by former Hong Kong Governor Christopher Patten and former British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, and signed by 186 policy makers and politicians from 23 countries. This video can not be played Former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten: ""UK should tell China this is outrageous"" It describes Beijing's plans as a ""flagrant breach"" of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, under which Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997. ""If the international community cannot trust Beijing to keep its word when it comes to Hong Kong, people will be reluctant to take its word on other matters,"" the signatories wrote. They include 17 members of the US Congress, and 44 UK MPs. The NPC is expected to vote on the draft law at the end of its annual session, on 28 May. It will then be forwarded to the NPC's Standing Committee, China's top legislature, which is expected to finalise and enact the law by the end of June.

Transport Secretary Michael Matheson will update the Scottish Parliament on revised codes of social distancing on trains and buses north of the border on Tuesday. UK counterpart Grant Shapps yesterday suggested that the transport system would still only run at a fifth of its usual capacity as the country moves out of lockdown. He announced a Â£283m package of investment in buses and light rail services to improve safety and restore services during the coronavirus pandemic and, although it only covers England, he claimed it would help the UK as a whole ""start moving back to a full timetable"" as it moves out of lockdown. Mr Shapps said the government would also bring in more marshals - volunteers called ""Journey Makers"" - at stations to join British Transport Police officers, Network Rail and train operator staff currently advising passengers and monitoring social distancing. But the transport secretary says social distancing will cut capacity to a fifth of the usual amount.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A protester demonstrates outside the home of Dominic Cummings on Sunday Charlie Cooper of Politico asks about the prime minister's support for his top adviser Dominic Cummings, wondering if rules have changed to allow anyone with symptoms who has concerns about childcare to travel to another home. Boris Johnson gives a short riposte, saying the government's advice remains unchanged . ""That is that if you have symptoms then you should self isolate for 14 days - and that's what Mr Cummings and his family did"", he says. The advice makes it ""absolutely clear "" that childcare has to be ""taken into account"", Mr Johnson adds. ""I think it was a real risk and I think it was responsible of Dominic Cummings to see the risk to his family ...and to take steps to avert it"". ITV's Robert Peston asks about Dominic Cummings' trip to Durham. He says the aide, in a ""prima facie"" sense, breached three lockdown rules, and asks if people in the same position as Mr Cummings are allowed to do what he did. Boris Johnson says he thought what the family did was ""totally understandable"" and said there was guidance about that particular scenario. ""Looking at the situation any father, any parent would frankly understand what he did,"" he said. The prime minister added he acted in such a way as to avoid the spread of the virus. Scott Macnab, from The Scotsman, points out that Dr Catherine Calderwoodresigned as Scotland's chief medical officerfollowing discussions with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon after twice visiting a second home during the lockdown. He asks whether, if the prime minister sticks by Dominic Cummings for travelling 260 miles to self-isolate, it undermines the rules he expects the public to follow. Boris Johnson replies: ""No, the sharp distinction is that, unlike the lady you mentioned, Mr Cummings actually went into lockdown because he had symptoms, went into self isolation for 14 days or more. ""That is what you should do. The particular circumstances of his isolation, as I've said now several times now, were determined by the childcare needs of the family.""  Allow Twitter content?

Boris Johnson says Dominic Cummings ""acted responsibly"" when he travelled to the North East during lockdown. After confronting the question of his advisor's future, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has given the daily death figures, announcing a further 118 deaths from Covid-19 in the UK. It takes the total to 36,793. NHS England's medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, says the country is seeing ""a steady but sustained decline in the number of deaths reflecting success in reducing the transmission of virus in the community"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent As expected, Boris Johnson has backed his chief aide. He clearly feels his actions can be explained within the rules. It strikes me Boris Johnson is taking a political gamble here; that the public will understand his decision or arenât that bothered by a ""Westminster row"". Indeed, Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings are seen as political operators who can judge the public mood well. But many - including several Tory MPs - think theyâve got this wrong. They believe the public does care and see it as one rule for us, one rule for them. The prime minister said he takes the allegations against his chief adviser Dominic Cummings ""so seriously"" but believes he has done nothing wrong after their ""extensive"" talks. ""I've concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus and when he had no alternative, I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent and I do not mark him down for that,"" said Mr Johnson. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says Dominic Cummings ""followed the instincts of every father and parent"" and has in every respect acted ""responsibly, legally and with integrity"". Mr Johnson says he has held ""extensive face-to-face conversations"" with his his chief adviser, who has faced calls to resign afterallegations he broke coronavirus lockdown rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to lead the UK's briefing shortly. It comes as his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is facing calls to resign overclaims he broke lockdown rules to visit family. Here are some of the latest lines which are likely to be mentioned when we head to Downing Street at 17:00 BST. The deaths of three women at a care home on Skye at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak are being investigated by police. Ten residents at Home Farm care home in Portree have died in the outbreak. Police Scotland said it is looking into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of three women - aged 84, 86 and 88 - at the home. The investigation comes after the Care Inspectorate raised serious concerns about the care offered at the home. The watchdog began legal action to remove owner HC-One as a care provider earlier this month.

"The families of care staff who die in the pandemic will receive a Â£60,000 payment, say the Scottish government. It comes after ministers announced a similardeath in service payment for families of NHS workerslast month. The health secretary also said enhanced sick pay would be given to care staff testing positive for coronavirus. On Thursday, Scotland's biggest private care home provider said carers who were self-isolating would receive full pay if they tested positive for Covid-19. HC-One had come under pressure to change its policy after lobbying from unions and fears that staff would continue working with symptoms of the virus for fear their income would drop to Â£95.85 a week - the current rate of statutory sick pay. The company, which runs 56 care homes in Scotland includingHome Farm in Skye where 10 residents have died in a coronavirus outbreak, said the extra money would also be paid retrospectively to those who were given statutory sick pay having tested positive, following a campaign by the GMB union. Ten residents have died after a coronavirus outbreak at Home Farm care home on Skye In additional to its sick pay fund, the Scottish government said a one-off payment of Â£60,000 would be given to a named survivor of any social care worker who died without death in service cover in their contracted pension arrangements. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said: ""Social care staff provide a critical and valuable service, never more apparent than during this emergency period. ""While some employers offer employment contracts closer to the Scottish government's fair work principles, it is clear that others do not."" Ms Freeman said ""fair work issues"" and how they were realised in commissioning contracts would require to be addressed in future. She added: ""We will continue to work with local government, social care providers and trades unions on further details of the plans over the course of next week."" A survey carried out by the GMB union last week found 78% of its 1,000 respondents were worried about taking a test in case they were found to be positive, and then had to lose money. Its Scottish secretary, Gary Smith, told BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetime programmehe was pleased HC-One had listened to staff concerns, but he now urged other care home companies to follow suit.

"Coronavirus has been described as an invisible killer. What could be more terrifying than that? A deadly pathogen we cannot spot, and then when it hits, we cannot treat. It is unsurprising, therefore, that many people are fearful of going out, returning life to normal or even letting children go back to school. People want to be safe. But the problem is we are no longer as safe as we once were. There is, after all, a new virus around that can have catastrophic consequences. So what should we do? Some have argued restrictions need to continue until safety can be guaranteed. But those arguments generally ignore the fact that continuing to do so carries risk in itself. UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty often describes these as the ""indirect costs"" of the pandemic. They include everything from poor access to healthcare for other conditions through to rises in mental illness, financial hardship and damage to education. So as restrictions ease, society and individuals themselves are going to have to make decisions based on balancing competing sets of risks. Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at Edinburgh University, says the question we should be asking is whether we are ""safe enough"". ""There will never be no risk. In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community it's about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling."" She was referring to the row over schools, but the concept can equally be applied to many other scenarios. She says part of that equation depends on the steps taken by government on things such as social distancing, the provision of protective equipment and the availability of testing and then tracing of contacts to contain local outbreaks. She has been critical of the way the government has handled all of them. But as more freedoms are returned, the role of individual decision-making will come more to the fore. It is perhaps not about finding the right option, rather finding the least worst option. Statistician Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in risk from Cambridge University and government adviser, says it has, in effect, become a game of ""risk management"" - and because of that we need to get a handle on the magnitude of risk we face. There are two factors that influence the risk we face from coronavirus - our risk of becoming infected and, once infected, our risk of dying or becoming seriously ill. If we are not in hospital or a care home our best guide to the risk of infection comes from the government's surveillance programme run by the Office for National Statistics. The data published this week suggests around one in 400 people is currently infected. The chances of coming into close contact with one of those individuals - certainly as we are practising social distancing even when out and about - is considered to be pretty slim. Although clearly some people, depending on their jobs, are at higher risk than others. The hope is that level of infection will reduce even further in time if the government's test, track and trace programme keeps the virus suppressed. Then if we do become infected, the fact remains that for most people, coronavirus is a mild-to-moderate illness - only one in 20 people who shows symptoms is believed to need hospital treatment. Those with pre-existing health conditions are most at risk. Deaths among under-65s with no illnesses are ""remarkably uncommon"", research shows. Perhaps the easiest way is to ask yourself to what extent you are worried about the thought of dying in the next 12 months. What is remarkable about coronavirus is that if we are infected our chances of dying seems to mirror our chance of dying anyway over the next year, certainly once we pass the age of 20. For example, an average person aged 40 has around a one-in-1,000 risk of not making it to their next birthday and an almost identical risk of not surviving a coronavirus infection. That means your risk of dying is effectively doubled from what it was if you are infected. And that is the average risk - for most individuals the risk is actually lower than that as most of the risk is held by those who are in poor health in each age group. So coronavirus is, in effect, taking any frailties and amplifying them. It is like packing an extra year's worth of risk into a short period of time. If your risk of dying was very low in the first place, it still remains very low. As for children, the risk of dying from other things - cancer and accidents are the biggest cause of fatalities - is greater than their chance of dying if they are infected with coronavirus. During the pandemic so far three under 15s have died. That compares to around 50 killed in road accidents every year. So what seems crucial as we all try to balance risks is identifying those at significant risk of serious illness from coronavirus - whether we fall into one of those groups ourselves or have close contact with someone who does. Currently the government is asking 2.5 million people to completely isolate themselves. This includes people who have had organ transplants, are having cancer treatment and those with severe respiratory disease. On top of those, there are more than 10 million people who fall into higher risk groups. These include all the over-70s and people with health conditions ranging from diabetes to heart conditions. Prof Sarah Harper, an expert in ageing at the University of Oxford, has argued the ""blanket and arbitrary use of age"" needs looking at as the actual level of risk within this higher risk group varies enormously. Atool developed by University College London,externalhas attempted to tease out some of the differences in risk. Finding out more about these is going to be crucial as we move forward.

"The families of care staff who die in the pandemic will receive a Â£60,000 payment, say the Scottish government. It comes after ministers announced a similardeath in service payment for families of NHS workerslast month. The health secretary also said enhanced sick pay would be given to care staff testing positive for coronavirus. On Thursday, Scotland's biggest private care home provider said carers who were self-isolating would receive full pay if they tested positive for Covid-19. HC-One had come under pressure to change its policy after lobbying from unions and fears that staff would continue working with symptoms of the virus for fear their income would drop to Â£95.85 a week - the current rate of statutory sick pay. The company, which runs 56 care homes in Scotland includingHome Farm in Skye where 10 residents have died in a coronavirus outbreak, said the extra money would also be paid retrospectively to those who were given statutory sick pay having tested positive, following a campaign by the GMB union. Ten residents have died after a coronavirus outbreak at Home Farm care home on Skye In additional to its sick pay fund, the Scottish government said a one-off payment of Â£60,000 would be given to a named survivor of any social care worker who died without death in service cover in their contracted pension arrangements. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said: ""Social care staff provide a critical and valuable service, never more apparent than during this emergency period. ""While some employers offer employment contracts closer to the Scottish government's fair work principles, it is clear that others do not."" Ms Freeman said ""fair work issues"" and how they were realised in commissioning contracts would require to be addressed in future. She added: ""We will continue to work with local government, social care providers and trades unions on further details of the plans over the course of next week."" A survey carried out by the GMB union last week found 78% of its 1,000 respondents were worried about taking a test in case they were found to be positive, and then had to lose money. Its Scottish secretary, Gary Smith, told BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetime programmehe was pleased HC-One had listened to staff concerns, but he now urged other care home companies to follow suit.

"This video can not be played Hong Kong protesters flee tear gas during rally against China's draft security law Police in Hong Kong have fired tear gas and water cannon at protesters rallying against China's plans to impose a new security law on the territory. Thousands of demonstrators have been marching through the city centre. Police say 120 have been arrested. Earlier, 200 senior politicians from around the world issued a joint statement criticising China's plan. But China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the legislation should be brought in ""without the slightest delay"". China is seeking to pass a law that would ban ""treason, secession, sedition and subversion"" in the territory. Activists fear it is an attempt to limit freedoms and silence Beijing's opponents. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong so worried? All the context you need on Hong Kong's protests How bad are China's economic woes? Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who is seen as part of the pro-Beijing political establishment, has pledged full support for the proposed law and said the city's rights would remain unchanged. China has dismissed concerns the legislation would harm foreign investors in Hong Kong, an important financial centre, and lashed out at ""meddling"" countries. Protesters gathered in the busy Causeway Bay and Wan Chai districts of the city on Sunday, chanting slogans against the government and waving banners. Riot police fired tear gas and water cannon at demonstrators, who were wearing face masks to protect against the spread of coronavirus. Crowds of protesters march through the city's popular shopping district The rally comes despite earlier warnings from authorities against unauthorised assembly and a ban on large public gatherings to enforce social distancing. Some protesters threw objects such as umbrellas and water bottles at officers, and used bins and other debris to set up road blocks. Reports say Sunday's protest followed a similar pattern to many of last year's demonstrations, many of which turned violent. More than 8,400 people have been arrested in Hong Kong since pro-democracy protests erupted last year. Danny Vincent, BBC News, Hong Kong For many protesters Sunday's protest was seen a stress test. They wanted to see how the police would react to large scale demonstrations following months of relative quiet. The young and old chanted familiar slogans from last year's movement. They called for the Hong Kong government to respond to the five political demands they set out last year. But there were new slogans, too. Some protesters called openly for Hong Kong independence. They claimed that it was now the only way forward for the semi-autonomous city. The police were quick to disperse the crowds. They fired several rounds of tear gas before charging towards the protesters. The national security proposal has united protesters willing to risk both breaking the law and social distancing measures in order to show their anger at plans that many fear could spell the end to one country two systems. The ""draft decision"" - as it is known before approval by China's National People's Congress - includes an article that says Hong Kong ""must improve"" national security. It adds: ""When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law."" Police fire water cannon to disperse protesters in Causeway Bay That means China could potentially have its own law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong, alongside the city's own. Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woes China scraps annual growth target for first time How is Hong Kong run? Earlier this week,US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemnedthe plans, which he described as a ""death knell"" for the city's freedoms. The UK, Australia and Canada have also expressed their ""deep concern"". This video can not be played Hong Kongers give their reaction to the controversial national security law in May Relations between Washington and Beijing are already strained over trade disputes and the coronavirus pandemic. The US is currently considering whether to extend Hong Kong's preferential trading and investment privileges. President Trump has also weighed in, saying the US would react strongly if the law went through - without giving details. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Wang accused countries said ""some political forces in the US"" were pushing the two countries ""to the brink of a new Cold War"". The Chinese government argues the law is necessary to ""prevent, stop and punish"" protests such as those that rocked Hong Kong last year. They were sparked by a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The statement was drafted by former Hong Kong Governor Christopher Patten and former British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, and signed by 186 policy makers and politicians from 23 countries. This video can not be played Former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten: ""UK should tell China this is outrageous"" It describes Beijing's plans as a ""flagrant breach"" of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, under which Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997. ""If the international community cannot trust Beijing to keep its word when it comes to Hong Kong, people will be reluctant to take its word on other matters,"" the signatories wrote. They include 17 members of the US Congress, and 44 UK MPs. The NPC is expected to vote on the draft law at the end of its annual session, on 28 May. It will then be forwarded to the NPC's Standing Committee, China's top legislature, which is expected to finalise and enact the law by the end of June.

"Louise Smith was described as a ""lovely girl with a heart of gold"" by a friend Police searching for Louise Smith have confirmed that a body recovered from woodland is the missing teenager. The body of the 16-year-old, who was last seen on 8 May, was found in Havant, Hampshire, on Thursday. Louise, from the Leigh Park area, was reported missing on the same day. Hampshire Police said on Saturday evening formal identification procedures were complete and Louise's family informed. They previously said the death was suspicious. The family were being supported by specialist officers, police added. Remains were discovered in Havant Thicket on Thursday Friends of the teenager have spoken of their devastation. Mandy Ferdinando, who had known Louise since she was a young girl, laid flowers at the entrance to Havant Thicket, where the teenager's body was found. She previously told the Press Association: ""She was a lovely girl with a heart of gold. ""The community is devastated, sad, shocked, I can't speak for everybody but when anyone hears of a young person, whoever it may be, it's very sad."" Louise had not been in touch with her friends or family since being seen in Somborne Drive, a short distance from where the body was found. Louise was last seen in Somborne Drive on 8 May Police forensic officers carried out searches of a flat in the street and blacked out the property's windows. Neighbours previously said it is believed that Louise had been staying with a couple at the flat. John Singleton said: ""I saw her on the day she went missing, she just went out walking, I didn't know where she was going. ""It's very sad, the outcome is the saddest, for a while we had some hope."" Describing the police activity at the flat, he added: ""The police have been in and out carrying stuff."" A man and a woman, both aged 29, had previously been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and released on bail. Hampshire police previously asked people in the area to save any dashcam and CCTV footage from 7 and 8 May - particularly any filmed at VE Day anniversary celebrations - for officers to review.
