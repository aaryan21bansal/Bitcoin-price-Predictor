"Several of the papers lead on what theDaily Mail describes as ""the best heart drug since statins"",external. Scientists are said to have found that a new drug, given by injection every three months, can cut the risk of heart attacks by a quarter. It is called Canakinumab and works by reducing inflammation. The Sun calls it a ""wonder drug"",externalthat ""slashes the risk"" of cancer too. The i newspaper hails the dawn,externalof ""a new era in heart disease treatment"" but says the price will have to come down before it can be approved. The Times says the drug currently costs,externalÂ£40,000 per patient per year as an arthritis treatment - so that could delay widespread use of the medicine alongside statins as a heart treatment. According to the Guardian,external, Jeremy Corbyn is facing a backlash from senior MPs in Labour's heartlands because of the party's ""shift to soft Brexit"". Three of them, from the Midlands and northern England, have told the paper that the move risks alienating thousands of voters in traditional seats who support greater controls on immigration. TheFinancial Times,externalsays Labour's announcement is putting Theresa May under renewed pressure from her own party over Brexit. Pro-European Conservatives, the paper says, will be emboldened to urge the prime minister to accept a softer deal. One unnamed senior pro-remain Tory is quoted as saying: ""The leverage among soft-Brexit Tories has increased significantly"". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The Times leads on the case of a white, Christian five-year-old girl,externalwho, it says, has been taken from her family and forced to live with a foster carer who wears a niqab. In an internal report seen by the Times, a supervisor at Tower Hamlets council in London describes the child sobbing and begging not to be sent back to the foster carer's home because ""they don't speak English"". The council put out a statement saying:  ""All our foster carers receive training and support from the council to ensure they are fully qualified to meet the needs of the children in their care."" ""Charles must be our king"" is the bold messagespelt out in a purple box on the front of the Sun,external, pointing to an article inside by the paper's famed royal photographer, Arthur Edwards. He has decided to speak out after a recent poll suggested 51% want Prince William to be the next monarch. Edwards disagrees: ""The monarchy doesn't work like that. It's not an X Factor vote. Charles will be our next king, it's his birthright."" The photographer says his job has given him a unique insight into Charles's mindset - he's educated, passionate and very bright, has been heir for 65 years - and will be a good king. Finally, back to Brexit and theDaily Express reports a surge in vacuum cleaner sales,externalas shoppers rush to beat an EU ban on the most powerful models. ""Buy now while stocks last"", the paper says. ""It is a British person's inalienable right to have a vacuum cleaner of such ferocity that it sucks up your underlay and your floorboards.""

"Judie McRae did not have the means to flee before the storm struck In the detritus of Hurricane Harvey a splash of red, white and blue catches the eye. It is a rain-sodden American flag, half-hidden under the green leaves of fallen trees. A few paces away Judie McRae, 44, is inspecting the damage to her trailer home. Judie has lived more than half of her life here but she says this is her first hurricane. She spent it hunkered down in bed, unable to sleep. She does not want to see another one. ""I just felt like my roof was going to come off at any minute,"" she says, describing a terrible sound of ""cracking and creaking"" that only stopped for a few minutes of calm when the eye of the hurricane  passed directly over her head. ""I was very fortunate that only two little windows got broke,"" she says. Exactly how fortunate is obvious. Three of her neighbours' houses lie in ruins. Sheet metal has been twisted out of shape and insulation foam hangs from the trees. Books and clothes are soaking in the rain. One powder blue trailer home has caved in completely, its wooden skeleton broken and exposed. As we examine the damage a young man arrives, agitated. He asks us if we have checked inside for the owner. We have not. ""Dan, are you in here?"" he shouts. We climb into the wreckage to help search for Dan, gingerly stepping over the missing man's possessions and clambering around his bathtub. There is no-one here. Judie, meanwhile, is worried about two other neighbours. Both got out before the storm struck and have not yet returned to learn that their homes are destroyed. She is particularly concerned about the elderly woman who lives two trailers along. ""She has no money and that was her home and it was already crap so..."" Judie tails off as if she can think of no useful way to complete the thought, no hope to offer. Meanwhile, down on the shore of Rockport, Robert Zbranek, 56, is trying to secure his boat to the dock after it broke free during the storm. Alongside, a small sailing yacht is under water. The yacht, Robert explains, was his home. He was inside when the hurricane swept over, smashing the hull. At the height of the most powerful storm in Texas since 1961, with winds blowing at 130mph (215km/h), he had to get out and scramble into his car, which he had parked behind a truck for shelter. Even then he did not feel safe as, he says, the vehicle was lifted off the ground by the high winds but it worked. What was it like? ""Rough,"" he laughs. I suggest that some people might question his sanity. This video can not be played The BBC's James Cook found a scene of devastation in Rockport ""I know I'm crazy,"" he says with a smile. ""It was supposed to be a category two, maybe a category three but it didn't turn out that way. It was absolutely ridiculous. Ferocious."" ""I still got a house,"" he adds. ""It's just a little tore up."" A boat on its side after the storm As we are chatting Robert's friend, Craig Hack, 56, appears. He too rode out the storm on a small sailing yacht. ""I just about lost my mast,"" he says, cackling when I ask how it was. ""No brains"" is his answer. Both men say they stayed because they wanted to be with their boat homes and their vehicles. They agreed that many folk like them would have lost money in the storm because they did not have insurance. Here in this coastal town that is a familiar story, of people struggling to make ends mean, let alone to thrive. Rockport was founded as a cattle abattoir and meat-packing port after the American civil war of 1861-1865. Named after its geology - it sits on a solid rock ledge - the town and its adjoining neighbour, Fulton, did well for many years, first on the beef trade and later thanks to fishing and shrimping. The storm flipped this plane over at Aransas County Airport By the time the 20th Century had dawned, a railway was bringing in tourists too. They still come, spending time and money boating and birdwatching, with ornithologists keen to see whooping cranes and hummingbirds. But their money does not seem to have done much for the people of the port or of its wooded suburbs. ""Hardscrabble"" is the word Americans use to describe a place like Rockport. It is overwhelmingly white (88.7% at the last census in 2010) andvoted decisively for Donald Trump,externalin the 2016 presidential election. Life here is tough, says Judie, never more so than now. There is some good news though. Judie thinks that Dan, the missing man, got out with relatives or friends just before the storm. ""God was with us,"" she says of her own survival though as she glances around at the destruction, she sounds a little unsure. Judie stayed, she tells me, because she had no means to leave and no place to go. ""I had some problems getting out of town, a little broke and stuff, so I had to come home and, you know, tough it out,"" she says. ""We're all the working class people. ""We're the ones who go to the restaurants and wait on you and pick up your trash and do all that work. We don't have a lot of money."" ""Fighting for the American dream,"" she adds, with a rueful laugh. US storm to bring 'catastrophic' flooding In pictures: Texas battered 'I'm basically homeless' after Harvey.

"Conor McGregor's first words at his post-fight news conference drew focus on his own branded whiskey. It was another sell at the end of arguably the greatest sell in boxing history. Former five-weight world champion Floyd Mayweather stopped the Irish UFC fighter, who was making his boxing debut, in the 10th round after one of the most hyped fights of all time. Beforehand, the media pored over every word - racist, homophobic or otherwise. Boxing purists despaired, while the MMA community dreamed their relatively young sport would topple the more established form of combat. Journalists literally pushed and shoved one another for position at media events. Photographers charged towards the fighters as if they were the Beatles reunited. It was comical, exciting and at times sickeningly transparent in its core purpose - to make as much money as possible. Podcast: 'It was called a circus - it was a real fight' McGregor rues 'early stoppage' Mayweather chose right 'dance partner' for final fight Mayweather stops McGregor to win Vegas super-fight The figures will be staggering. An hour after picking apart a tiring McGregor, Mayweather said the bout had surpassed the $72.2m (Â£59.9m) earned at the gate when heovercame Manny Pacquiaoin 2015. Pay-per-view figures will be firmed up next week but bank on the total exceeding $620m (Â£480m), roughly what Mayweather-Pacquiao delivered. Probably the richest bout in history then. Mayweather hopes to pick up $300m (Â£232m) - he was making almost $10m (Â£7.7m) a minute. Did he earn it? Yes, the 40-year-old grafted in promoting the fight but when laid bare, the contest was always his. ""Floyd didn't look concerned one bit,"" said Britain's former undisputed heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis. ""He was smiling, very comfortable, composed. I didn't see the point of the whole thing. I didn't think [McGregor] did well at all."" This video can not be played I would rather have been knocked out - McGregor Punch stats - though at times debatable - show McGregor landed nine more than the victor for six rounds. The next four rounds saw Mayweather throw 70 more than his rival. That is some acceleration in pace, arguably all too easy. Respected boxing writer Tris Dixon commented: ""McGregor won what Mayweather let him win."" It sounds brutally harsh. No-one can deny McGregor's guts or his will to break new ground. He is a credit to UFC but about 5,000 spare seats at the T-Mobile Arena indicates some saw him as part of an overhyped, expensive and flawed product. Former super-middleweight champion Carl Froch said if McGregor were an established boxer, the term ""outclassed"" would be used. ""What was it people bought into?"" said boxing promoter Frank Warren. Personality and intrigue undoubtedly. McGregor is not an established boxer and his efforts in the ring were honest. But when the dust settles, the intricacies of the fight are analysed and the behaviour of all involved in the build-up is dissected, the legacy may be a rather hollow feeling. McGregor will make do with around $100m (Â£77.5m) - roughly $3m (Â£2.3m) a minute. In the ring, he paid for not having Mayweather's 21 years of pure-boxing conditioning. ""Questions or shall I prattle on?"" he said on hitting the stage afterwards. The world outside of UFC has learned he needs no invitation. But from now on, he will have invitations aplenty. Mayweather might have out-earned him but 'The Notorious' brand has gone stratospheric in recent weeks. And hence this boxing gamble will pay dividends. New brands will want a slice of him; those who already own a slice will look to protect it. Mayweather and McGregor embrace at the post-fight news conference Asked about McGregor boxing again, UFC president Dana White answered emphatically: ""I would rather he did not. I don't think there is anything left to prove."" McGregor - sporting sunglasses and a colourful suit - ruled nothing out, including a trilogy fight in the UFC with Nate Diaz, or more boxing. ""Conor McGregor is now a huge attraction in boxing,"" said BBC Radio 5 live commentator Mike Costello. ""You've seen the sparring videos and their fall-out, so now Conor McGregor v Paulie Malignaggi on St Patrick's Day next March is a legitimate fight. The build-up for that starts now."" If he doesn't fancy more boxing, McGregor has the microphone skills for WWE - as well as an energy and swagger which some say points to Hollywood. Referee Robert Byrd stops the fight one minute and five seconds into round 10 Refreshingly, he was reflective afterwards. Just as he was after his biggest UFC defeat to date against Diaz last year. True champions quickly find solutions and he promised to address a lull in energy he believes he feels midway through his MMA fights and says affected him here. Hearing him speak about his craft in this mood is intoxicating. He does not pay lip service; rather, every word he utters has clearly come from deep thought. This studious nature combined with gripping personality mean that with Mayweather retired, he is the biggest name in combat sports. ""I have many options in MMA and I'm sure there will be options that present themselves in the boxing ring,"" said the 29-year-old. ""I am open. I love competing. Tonight was a damn good fight. I enjoyed myself and I can't tell you exactly what is next."" Who knows? But it will be big. McGregor did his share to hype this bout in pursuit of more money than he will ever need. Just don't bank on him quietly disappearing with his earnings. To watch Mayweather is to see a man practically box on autopilot. Those decades spent honing his craft meant even at 40, the American - who had been retired for almost two years - was a force. Afterwards, he made no attempt to hide his motivation. ""I have retired before but I'm not a damn fool,"" he said. ""If I see an opportunity to make $300m in 36 minutes I will. But this is my last one."" Who wouldn't do the same? And in his defence, amid the hype of recent weeks he was the quieter man. Often his barbs felt forced, delivered because he could not be seen to say nothing as McGregor's antics reached new heights. But he pushed for this fight, floating it to UFC bosses by his own admission. This win showed his quality to a new audience - those sucked in by the anarchy. Perhaps that is a positive - more people have seen his genius. Mayweather was up on all three cards when the fight was stopped And 1950s world heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano's perfect 49-fight record has been surpassed. Hence as it ends - again - Mayweather's career should be lauded. Making it to the top was not easy. He spoke of his first $100,000 cheque - received at the age of 19. ""I came from poverty,"" he pointed out. ""I wasn't listening at that meeting, I just wanted that cheque."" To reach a point where he has now taken part in the two richest fights in history and banked hundreds of millions of dollars shows genius from a business perspective too. ""I look forward to becoming a boxing trainer, helping fighters,"" he said. ""I want to teach fighters about becoming a superstar not just in the ring but outside. It takes a lot of work on the outside to become a megastar."" Mayweather took his perfect career record to 50-0 He is a megastar and boxing has lost its marquee name again. Perhaps this fight illustrates just how hard it will be to find a replacement. If candidates were plentiful, it would never have happened in the first place. Boxing purists have their fancied names but the casual fan wants something simple, something they don't have to work to understand amidst the myriad of belts and weight classes. This bout gave them that and the opportunist in Mayweather pounced. Inside and outside the ring, that opportunistic nature was key for possibly the greatest the game has seen.

"Westeros and Great Britain may have more in common than you think The seventh season of fantasy TV drama Game of Thrones has hurtled to a close, and the burning question for fans right now is: ""Who will inherit the Iron Throne?"" The world of Westeros may be fictional, but its origins are far from imaginary. ""Medieval Britain has played an enormous impact on the series,"" creator George RR Martinonce said,external. What better way to determine the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms than by using the rules that govern the British monarchy? Who will win the Game of Thrones? We've compiled a list of contenders for the coveted Iron Throne (the seat of the kingdom's monarchy) and enlisted royal commentatorRichard Fitzwilliams,externaland medieval academics professorSarah Peverley,externaland DrGordon McKelvie,externalto weigh in on each candidate's chances. What do fans think will happen? Game of Thrones in numbers Cast emotional as they head for finale Follow the BBC's Game of Thrones coveragehere Cersei and Queen Margaret have quite a lot in common Born and bred in Westeros, Cersei is a devoted mother who married into royalty. Her late husband Robert Baratheon led a bloody rebellion and overthrew the ruling Targaryen dynasty. Her children came from an incestuous relationship with her brother Jamie (both their sons became young kings). While plotting the deaths of her rivals, Cersei lost her three children but ascended to the throne. Incest has always been taboo - the Lannisters' incestuous relationship would be frowned upon Richard Fitzwilliams:In Britain, an heir is determined by descent and parliamentary statute. Succession is also determined by the sequence of royal family members. Cersei declared herself queen without any legitimacy. Her claim rests on two things: being Robert Baratheon's widow and the mother of two dead kings. She resembles the villainous Margaret of Anjou, queen by marriage to the feeble King Henry VI. Margaret was also ruthless and highly influential. Sarah Peverley:Inheritance in the Seven Kingdoms is based on real medieval laws, often prone to contradictory interpretations. Generally speaking, thelaw of primogeniture,externalseems to govern the Iron Throne, which females can claim in the event of no male heir. Or they can act until a young king comes of age, as Cersei attempted to do. But her current claim rests solely on the power she wields. Gordon McKelvie:There have been plenty of unpopular queens with too much influence and power. Cersei seems to share their qualities. I can't think of any historical example where a king (with no children) dies and passes the crown to his mother. No one in medieval England made such a dramatic grab for power like Cersei did. Her desire for the Iron Throne is well known, but is the dragon queen entitled to it? The dragon queen's journey has been impressive, starting out as the timid daughter of Aerys Targaryen, the ""Mad King"" who was overthrown by Robert Baratheon. She went on to become an assertive ruler with a formidable army and dragons. Her ambition earned her the loyalty of many aides and allies. She fought to abolish slavery and now has her sights set on the Iron Throne, where she plans to end the vicious cycle of power politics. Like any monarch, Daenerys isn't short of titles. ""First of Her Name"" and ""Queen of the Andals"" are some names she goes by. Will she be able to avenge her family's name? Game of Thrones was inspired by the Wars of the Roses, a civil war that wreaked great havoc in England Richard Fitzwilliams:The Targaryens were the rightful rulers of Westeros before their dynasty was usurped. In this respect, Daenerys's claims certainly have validity, being in exile would not alter this. For centuries, monarchy has favoured the precedence of males over females. In 2015, an act known asSuccession to the Crown Billcame into force and this meant the eldest living child of a monarch succeeds, regardless of sex. This would have been good news for Daenerys, were it not for the fact her deceased older brother had a legitimate son.(Editor's note:Latest events have shown Jon Snow is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.,external) Daenerys has the support of her dragon children. The dragon we have in the UK rests on the Welsh flag, first used by Henry Tudor at the 1485 Battle of Bosworth which saw the defeat of Richard III and ended the Wars of the Roses. The flag of Wales: Parallels with House Targaryen? Sarah Peverley:Any house that previously ruled can make a relevant claim to the Iron Throne. However, the problem in Westeros is that nobody follows pre-determined laws. Daenerys's ancestor Aegon I was a conqueror. In turn, his descendants were overthrown during a rebellion incited by Robert Baratheon. If we apply these precedents, anyone able to conquer lands and hold them possesses the right to rule. In Daenerys's case, she has a legitimate ancestral claim. She also has an army, dragons and is beloved by those she liberates. This combination gives her a superior claim over others as she has the interests of the people at heart, rather than her own ambitions. Will military assets and dragons win the hearts of the common people? Gordon McKelvie:She is the last Targaryen, or at least she thinks she is. This means a Targaryen restoration was an option, though not necessarily a popular one. It was important for any monarch to be popular with their nobility as the crown needs to have people willing to fight for it in times of war. Lord Randyll Tarly's dislike for Daenerys as a foreign invader was a sentiment that would be shared by many throughout British history. Like any respected ruler, Jon Snow has led troops onto the field and fought with them in battle Now a celebrated Northern leader, Jon Snow has come a long way from being outcast as Ned Stark's bastard child. Illegitimate no more, he is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen (Daenerys's brother), rightful heir to the Iron Throne. The prince legally wed Jon's mother Lyanna Stark in a secret ceremony(Editor's note: All this he does not know yet). Blood from two of Westeros's most powerful houses signals one of the strongest claims to the throne. But would the monarchy have favoured this revelation? Many rooting for Jon think he will make an excellent (but reluctant) Westeros king Richard Fitzwilliams:As his father was Rhaegar, Jon obviously has a very strong claim. He is more entitled to the throne than Daenerys. Sarah Peverley:Being labelled the ""rightful heir"" isn't quite as clear-cut as it sounds. The Targaryens were a dynasty that ruled by right of conquest. So did the Baratheons. As Daenerys believes she is the only living Targaryen heir, we can't know for sure how she would respond to Jon's lineage. It is entirely possible that she would follow ""tradition"" and defer to him, following the lines of primogeniture. Gordon McKelvie:Now that Jon is indeed Rhaegar's legitimate son, this puts him second in line to the throne. After his father was killed in battle, Jon can be considered the next heir. Did monarchy laws overlook royal bastards like fan-favourite Gendry? Could Robert's last surviving son give others on our list a good fight? Young Gendry made his appearance as the late king's bastard child. With Baratheon blood running through his veins, fans are rooting for the talented blacksmith to uphold one of Westeros's last great houses. But is he entitled to? Richard Fitzwilliams:Compared to others on this list, Gendry won't stand a great chance. But the unexpected often happens: William the Conqueror was born a bastard but took the throne by force at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. He defeated King Harold and became King of England. Like Gendry, William the Conqueror was born out of wedlock Sarah Peverley:Gendry was born out of wedlock so this makes his claim weaker than Daenerys (and possibly Jon). As a medieval rule, bastards could not inherit, especially if legitimate heirs existed. Gordon McKelvie:Gendry is a great character but the law made it unlikely he would ever become king. In England, being a bastard was always a problem so it was unlikely Gendry would fare well against a pure-blooded candidate like Daenerys. King Henry I had 24 bastard children. Some royal bastards ended up in positions of wealth and influence. Perhaps this is Gendry's fate? Treachery and deceit defined the ambitious Little Finger Here was a candidate with no royal lineage but made his desire to rule strongly known. The low-born Petyr Baelish (nicknamed Little Finger) worked his way into prominence and eventually landed in the late King Robert's court. He was a skilled manipulator, known to have played out key allies. Baelish's story was said to mirror that of Thomas Cromwell, who served as royal chief minister from 1532 to 1540. But his cunning plans soon caught up with him and now he's paid the price with his life. His story was said to have been inspired by English statesman Thomas Cromwell Richard Fitzwilliams:His chances were nil. He had no royal blood or charisma. Petyr Baelish could have risen high but it's a dangerous place to be, as Cromwell, who was later executed by King Henry VIII, eventually found. Britain is the last European country to have coronation ceremonies with imposing religious rituals. These have remained remarkably similar over the centuries. Crowning yourself would bear no legitimacy, even during the most turbulent times in history. But Baelish's schemes amounted to nothing in the end. Like Cromwell, he was executed Sarah Peverley:Little Finger could use his status to style himself as a ""man of the people"". If he gained the support of a significant number of lords, there was nothing to prevent him from trying to attain the crown. He could read others well and he made people do his bidding so he'd probably have made a very strong ruler. Gordon McKelvie:As much as I enjoy watching Petyr Baelish's schemes, it would not have worked in medieval Britain. He was similar to many unpopular courtiers, who were seen as exerting more power and influence than they deserved. When a king was replaced, it was always by someone who descended from an earlier king. So my answer for Little Finger's royal ambitions: they simply were not possible.

" A thick layer of acrid, blue smoke hovers just above the waterfront slums that skirt Lagos lagoon, filtering out sunrise and sunset. This man-made mist that clings to the rusted shack rooftops comes from the countless fish-smoking cabins that drive the slum economy. There’s an uninterrupted view of the city’s dramatic sprawl of poverty from the road bridges that carry daily commuters between the islands and the mainland. Fishing and sand-dredging boats drift to work, heading deep into the lagoon. Many of the slums’ wooden huts are on stilts, others are just basic shacks shoddily built on the unstable ground of trodden-down rubbish dumps. Nobody knows exactly how many people live in Lagos, but they all agree on one thing – Nigeria's biggest city is growing at a terrifying rate. The UN says 14 million. The Lagos State government thinks it’s nearer 21 million, as rural Nigerians are drawn by the hope of a better life to one of Africa’s few mega-cities. By 2050 Nigeria will have twice the population it has today, more than half will live in cities, and about 60% of them will be under 25. In an overcrowded neighbourhood on mainland Lagos, Muktar Abdulhamid, 36, is pressing shirts with a heavy, old-fashioned iron filled with charcoals. Abdulhamid is from a rural village in the northern state of Kano, and he’s left his wife and one-year-old child at home and come here to try to make money. Muktar Abdulhamid: Just one of many rural Nigerians drawn to Lagos “This isn’t what I intended to be doing. I want to do business – to buy and sell,” he says. “It’s not easy to leave your wife, your child, it’s lonely, but I have no choice – it’s for the future of the family.” There are few good jobs and housing is in high demand, but at least there are opportunities. Every week tens of thousands of people arrive in Lagos, heading to neighbourhoods where friends and relatives have come before – many end up in the slums. But Lagos State is planning tower blocks and transformation, reclaiming land from the sea for ambitious new developments. In a rush to transform the city, the waterfront slums are being cleared, court rulings are being ignored, and luxury apartment blocks are springing up. Can Lagos persuade wealthy investors to buy into a futuristic vision, while helping pull the poorest people out of poverty? In about 30 years Nigeria will overtake the US to become the world’s third most populated country behind China and India. It vies with South Africa for the status of the continent’s biggest economy, but it’s now in recession - beset by a drop in oil prices, and having to fund the fight against both Boko Haram Islamists and separatists targeting oil pipelines in the Niger Delta. Like everywhere else in Africa trying to break out of poverty, Nigeria hopes fast population growth will bring it a “demographic dividend” – a young workforce that can drive economic growth. If they can all be put to work. Already there’s migration north to Libya and on to Europe, and the young who are left idle and without much hope are easily radicalised by Boko Haram. It’s going to take great management, smart politics and increasing security and stability to turn rapid population growth into a positive and avoid the potential for disaster. Source: Google/ Landsat / Copernicus “Africa’s Model Megacity” flashes up in the glitzy video of beautiful sunsets and impressive artists' impressions of the big Lagos city development plan. Soaring luxury skyscrapers sit alongside a port, enterprise parks and a new city-wide transport system of train lines, ferries and bus lanes. But in the waterfront slums circling the lagoon, this vision is a threat to livelihoods, not a hope for the future. Elebiomayo Folashade was a relatively well-off woman living in a sand-slum – but now she’s angry. Pulling up her elegant blue dress, she leans down to inspect the damage done to one of her boats by security forces, and begins to cry. “They destroyed my boats and my husband’s boats and now I cannot pay the school fees, so the children have been withdrawn from school,” she says. “I am old – what am I going to do now?” Many boats with huge holes in their hulls have been hauled up and abandoned on a beach that just a year ago was busy with work. Ebute Ilaje is a place that has lived off sand-dredging for decades. Wooden boats with food-sack sails would bring sand from deep in the lagoon to sell as building material, employing thousands of people. But then the government “taskforce” came – smashing holes in their boats and threatening to burn down the slum if they continued to work. Now Folashade’s livelihood has gone – as has that of many in a community that depended on the sand-dredgers to keep the economy afloat. Many believe what’s labelled a security crackdown against crime is an excuse to drive them out. “The state government is interested in the land in all these waterfront communities... so the rich can benefit from it,” says former dredger Oladipupo Aireomiye. His fears stem from the recent clearance of Otodo Gbame slum, which went ahead despite a court order halting its destruction. Otodo Gbame, after the bulldozers went in The bulldozers came in with the taskforce, smashing tin shacks, burning anything wooden to the ground. “The police seized our documents and fired tear gas… some people fled, others were shot,” says Maxwell Hunga, who lived in Otodo Gbame. The moment you demolish a slum, naturally two or three more slums will spring up because people need somewhere to sleep “The most challenging thing we are facing is the threat of eviction that is hanging around the community’s neck,” says Samuel Akinrolabu from the Nigerian Slum and Informal Settlement Federation. “Over 40 communities are under the threat of eviction and 300,000 people would be rendered homeless eventually if this action is carried out,” he says. “But forced eviction will not make slums disappear. Rather the moment you demolish a slum, naturally two or three more slums will spring up because people need somewhere to sleep."" Klote Kakini, fisherman They have the same fears in Ago Egun, the next slum along, where the men catch fish and the women smoke them on circular wire grills. Their shacks are built on a floating rubbish dump - trodden down and compacted over the years, its paths wobble disconcertingly underfoot. Klote Kakini is an old fisherman whose father lived here before him. He is worried his family will be evicted while he’s in the boat. “When we leave to catch fish, we are afraid something will happen to our wives and children at home,” he says. “Maybe the government will send agents to demolish everything or scatter our families.” But Steve Ayorinde, the Lagos State and governor’s spokesman, says these fears are unfounded: “This is a government with a human face, this is a government that won’t just descend on helpless citizens and just bulldoze them away.” He denies they have been heavy-handed by driving people from land they have lived on for many years. “I’m not aware that there has been any community that has been living within the waterfront for generations. It’s always a convenient lie for people to tell just to demonise the government,” he says. “All over the world there will always be the need for regeneration of certain areas. It’s happened in New York, in London... and Lagos is not an exception.” He gives two examples where people were resettled and compensation was paid. “Of course at some point there will be mild resistance, but this government believes in dialogue – in engaging with people so they can see the bigger picture of what the benefits would be.” But Samuel Akinrolabu describes a different reality: “The basic reason is land-grabbing, to be honest. Lagos government has seen that the waterfront communities are prime land where they can build the five-star hotels... and people can wake up and see the ocean view.” He believes the answer to redevelopment is to leave people where they are, improve their lives in situ and create new space to house them. ""We are in an urban age and people are going to keep coming, so we are just going to have to find more creative ways to accommodate more people,” says Taibat Lawanson, associate professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Lagos. And they do keep coming - from other towns and cities, and from remote rural communities. Lagos has become Nigeria’s centre of gravity. Lagos is crowded, chaotic, and crumbling. In the slums of the old city the spirits of the dead appear to have returned to cleanse it of evil and pray for its peace and prosperity. The tall men, wrapped in white, jump and crouch, sweeping their long sticks at the crowd. Their heads are veiled and topped with brightly coloured hats, as they spin through the streets towards the palace of their “Oba” – the king of Lagos. The Eyo Festival (pronounced Ay-oh) usually marks the death of the city’s most important or influential people, but this ceremony – the first in seven years – is celebrating the 50th anniversary of Lagos State. The original spot where 15th Century Yoruba fishermen settled on Lagos Island is now an edgy, poor, densely packed neighbourhood. Degraded buildings lean into each other, appearing to sag under the weight of people packing the balconies to watch the procession. The roads are potholed, there are few schools or clinics, let alone parks or playing fields – it desperately needs a new lease of life. Lateef Shelobo, Lagos State Urban Renewal Agency “Lagos has no choice but to go up,” says Lateef Sholebo, head of Lagos State Urban Renewal Agency. “How are we going to accommodate all the population? There is no way we can continue to sprawl.”After 25 years as a city planner in Los Angeles, he has now returned home to put into practice the lessons of urban renewal he has learned. Emerging from the rusty tin rooftops and towering above the Eyo parade route is a multi-storey apartment block – a gleaming, modern show home rising from the slum. “This project is very important because it shows the people in the community how a slum area can be transformed from what it used to be to a more modern, more sustainable environment,” he says, enthusiastically. Eleven families lived on the land – they were persuaded to combine their plots and stay elsewhere while the 48-flat tower block was built. Now they have 11 modern apartments to move into – and 37 extra new homes for their neighbours. “The air-space is useless – nobody is using it. Now we are able to go vertical we can reduce the overcrowding,” says Sholebo. “If we are able to convince all the rest of the families to participate in this kind of programme I think it’s better for them, it’s better for the government – and it’s better for everybody.” But it took years to build and was hugely expensive - too expensive for the government to roll out across Lagos. The city needs to be rebuilt without moving whole communities out. That’s where Sholebo’s American experience could make the difference – using imaginative tax tricks to generate finance for the infrastructure to bring in private developers. “We have to come up with different ways, or creative ways to provide such affordable housing,” says Sholebo. But those with the money to invest are looking for better returns elsewhere. Landmark Towers From the 11th-storey penthouse of the luxury Landmark Towers there’s an amazing view of the ocean and the sprawling waterfront developments. “We are trying to create West Africa’s first one-stop shop, live, work and play destination,” explains property developer Paul Onwuanibe. The Landmark Group chief executive lives in the penthouse suite, and from the large, open terrace points out what will go where on the five-hectare, $100m development. There’s already a Hard Rock Cafe, a fine dining restaurant, and an events centre which seats 4,000 people – hugely popular for expensive weddings. Land has been cleared for a Marriott hotel, a small shopping mall, an IMAX cinema, two office blocks and two apartment buildings. Here, people can avoid the Lagos chaos of overcrowding and terrible traffic congestion – the selling point is that if you can afford to live here, you never need to leave. Onwuanibe’s five hectares are dwarfed by the massive Eko Atlantic project next door. The Eko Atlantic development Earthmovers are landscaping this vast spur of land reclaimed from the sea, roads are being built and the first few tower blocks are beginning to take shape. It’s a stark contrast from life in the slums – a symbol of the vast inequality in Lagos. “There will always remain the super-rich and there will always remain the people just simply below the poverty line, but the hope is that over the next few years you will see that gap bridged as more people get more jobs,” says Onwuanibe. “I believe in trickle-down economics – so that wealth you create actually goes through the system, so the very people that feel that they’re displaced end up getting helped.” Rural Yanoko is a long way from the sprawl and chaos of Lagos. Most women in this village have about seven children. That’s typical for the surrounding region - the countryside overlapping northern Nigeria and southern Niger. It's the area with the highest birth rate in the world. And this birth rate is helping put Nigeria well on its way to becoming the world’s third-largest country by 2050. More than half of women are married before they are 15 and having many children is considered a sign of good fortune – and they are a good source of farm labour. There’s a huge push to reduce the fertility rate, but the population here is expected to triple in the next 30 years. There’s little for people to do, and lack of opportunity drives them to the city. Muktar Abdulhamid has optimism written across his chest. The 36-year-old wears a bright Superman T-shirt while very precisely ironing shirts in the overcrowded Lagos mainland neighbourhood of Agege. It wasn’t what he intended to do when came here from Yanoko, but well-paying work is rare and it helps him get by while waiting for that big business opportunity to come along. “When I arrived I thought it would be easy, but then I realised how much harder it was to get work, but you can’t just sit here without a job,” says Muktar. “I want to buy and sell, to have a shop in Kano and make enough money to go back to school to get a Western education.” Many people in this particular Lagos neighbourhood are from northern Nigeria and speak the same language, and so it feels a little more like home. But he misses the wife and young son he left behind nine months ago when he came to make it in the big city. Back home in Yanoko it’s the rainy season - and bright green fields jump out from the stark background of burnt orange mud buildings. There are only six cars, electricity is something they had for about a week before the new power lines fell dormant, and since the only bridge collapsed four years ago, it’s been even harder to reach the nearest health centre 27km away. Seven thousand people live here - a two-hour ride on a rocky road from Kano, which is the biggest city in northern Nigeria. Muktar Abdulhamid’s family are sitting together to talk about the man who left it all to make his fortune in the city. “We don’t have money to eat, so we had to send the boy to go look for money,” says his sister Ramatu Abdulkarim. “He is getting a little bit every day, just enough to survive, thank God. Sometimes he sends us 40, 50, or 60,000 Naira,” Muktar’s sister says. That’s between $110 and $165 (£85-£125), equivalent to two months’ worth of the annual income the family makes from farming maize, rice, soya or chillies. “We use the money for the farm and for buying food and clothing for the children – he also sent money for [his wife] Ramatu. “She’s not comfortable that he’s not close to her. And he’s not happy that he’s far from her.” Ramatu Muktar, 22, nods in agreement as one-year-old Abdulhamid plays on the floor – the whole family are praying Muktar will do well and take them both to Lagos to be with him. She’s shy and says little, but Muktar’s good friend and cousin Saidu Yahaya says it’s all about having money – to improve life and plan for the unexpected. “They are making money there, but you know how things are, it’s meagre money. You have to manage the little you have for survival,” says Saidu. About 150 young men from Yanoko are also trying to get work in Lagos – and the road to town is only going to get busier. “Lagos has always had that mixed blessing of having to deal with an influx of people. Unfortunately for us in the last two or three years it has been a deluge,” says the Lagos State and Governor’s spokesman Steve Ayorinde. He says 27 or 28 of the 36 states in Nigeria are struggling to pay local government salaries and it’s harder for people to migrate abroad. “We want other people to be here – to bring ideas, to bring values, to bring innovation, but we’re just unable to deal with it endlessly,” he says. “The prosperity of Lagos, in a way, is also tied to how open it is... so visitors will always have a great role to play in Lagos if they play by the rules.” More than half the population in Lagos is already under 25, and if there was work for them to do, and the birth rate was to slow down, the economy would get a welcome boost. This is where the “demographic dividend” comes in - an opportunity to take advantage of a big and active workforce. But if enough jobs aren’t created, the country suffers from the other side of that coin. Too many unemployed young people provides a fertile recruiting ground for Islamists like Boko Haram or a market for the people-smugglers peddling dreams of wealth and a better life in Europe. So if Africa's biggest challenge is everyone's problem, what's the solution? The newly-trained staff in the glossy new Lagos factory are carefully packing phones into boxes. As production lines go it's small, but for “the first indigenous mobile, tablet, phone and computer assembly plant in Nigeria”, at least it's a start. The company, Afrione, wants to tap into the big market for devices that a fast-growing young population provides, by producing cheap phones and tablets with the tagline “Made in Nigeria”. At the moment at least 90% of the components are imported, but company director Lekan Akinjide wants to steadily decrease that by 4 or 5% a year. “What we are actually doing fundamentally is starting the process - no-one else has really tried, no one else has really invested in a factory and the training of a skilled workforce,” he says. “We've looked at China, we've looked at India, we've also looked at what people have done here and tried not to make the mistakes they have made.” China had a fast growing population. It had deep and pervasive poverty, it was a rural economy and it turned itself around in a generation, mainly through manufacturing. But the window of time to take advantage of the “demographic dividend” is short – lots of jobs are needed now – and it’s perhaps worth looking a little closer to home. There are some places in Africa where a new industrial revolution is seen as the key to putting the idle youth to work and cashing in on a growing population. Ethiopia’s economy is dwarfed by that of Nigeria, but it’s the continent’s fastest growing and is betting it all on massive infrastructure investment and an industrial revolution to transform a nation of farmers into makers. There are beautiful new six-lane highways, an electric railway line to the ocean, and vast estates of social housing are being built with government-run mortgage schemes to get the poor on the housing ladder. And Nigeria knows massive investment in infrastructure is the answer to a growing economy and to get a congested city moving. The population is even outgrowing the supply of electricity. Generators which fill the gaps are a constant background soundtrack to the city. Taibat Lawanson, planning expert Stage one of Nigeria’s first electric railway line - through Lagos - is almost finished, but it can’t start moving a quarter of a million people a day from the suburbs to the city until its own power station is up and running. “There’s a lot of new infrastructure being built, but it’s skewed and the effects are not felt by the common man,” says planning expert Taibat Lawanson. “There’s a gap between the rich and the poor.” She believes by just improving transport links between residential suburbs and downtown, the government is missing the point – new satellite cities have to be planned and built so people can work near their homes and avoid commuting. “The government has got to understand that people are going to keep coming. “The current thinking is that they need to reverse urbanisation and get people to go back to the villages and stay away, but that’s not going to work.” The luxury waterfront developer Paul Onwuanibe says inequality is everywhere, but he believes it's “a little more acute, or visible” in Lagos. “That’s just part and parcel of mega-cities, but one of the things the government would have to think of is some kind of social platform... some sort of welfare platform that catches people below a certain safety net. “As this country and this city develops, you will see the gap bridged to some extent. “There will be a lot of people that will always remain under the poverty line just because of the sheer numbers,” he says, but believes the trickle-down from a growing economy and better private sector will see more people better off. So what does Steve Ayorinde, the Lagos Governor and State spokesman, think the city will look like in 50 years? “The pride of the black race,” he answers quickly. “Where technology will drive practically everything.” He talks about making Lagos a “smart city” - but millions of people living in slums just want better education and health, somewhere to live and somewhere to work. “Just build modern houses for us - we are happy with where we are living,” says Moses Sangoloke, a long-time resident of the threatened Ago Egun fishing slum, who chairs the community development association. The government knows it needs to build. The people will keep coming. Lagos will keep growing. Built with Shorthand",Positive,1.0
"Yaya Sangare with his four-year-old daughter, Deborah Three photos are all that Yaya Sangare has to remind him of the family he once had. It was nine months ago when his wife and sons drowned off the coast of Libya. ""I was holding my newborn son Kami Davide in my arms when he died,"" he says quietly, as he goes through the small album of photos on his cracked mobile phone. His wife Seri Dejezi and their other two sons - 12-year-old Eli and 14-year-old Elise - also died when their boat went down in the Mediterranean. Sitting on the steps of the Piazza Garibaldi in the Napoli heat, the 38-year-old lingers over the photo of his sons. ""These boys... I love them so much."" Yaya's two elder sons Eli, 12, and Elise, 14, both drowned when the boat they were in was lost at sea Now it is only Yaya and his four-year-old daughter, Deborah, left to pick up the pieces. She is smiling and singing, occasionally grabbing her father's hand for attention. Deborah was also on the boat that fateful night, but Yaya says they don't talk about it. ""I'll tell her one day what happened. She remembers sometimes. But one day I'll sit down and tell her all the stories, but not now. It's too hard."" Watch: The desert trek from Africa to Europe Are migrants paying price as EU targets smugglers? Originally from the Ivory Coast, Yaya left during the first civil war in 2002. Crossing the desert into Mali and then Algeria, he and his young family lived in refugee camps before making the journey to Libya, where they stayed for three months. However, Yaya had wanted to reach Europe by sea. With its islands, and exposed coastline on either side, Italy has been the main destination for refugees and migrants. Between January and August this year, 97,000 people came illegally by boat according to the UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM). But the route is often a fatal one. More than 2,000 people have died in the sea so far this year. Pope Francis has called the Mediterranean a ""vast cemetery"", but Yaya says he knew he was taking a risk coming here. Yaya's son Kami Davide, who he says died in his arms ""We wanted to leave because Libya was very difficult and I wanted to make a better life for my family in Europe,"" he says. He paid more than â¬3,000 (Â£2,766; $3,560) to traffickers to get to Sicily but like many endured violence at their hands. They smashed the top row of his teeth as they pushed him and his family on to one of 19 small rickety boats. ""When we got on, there were 154 people on my boat and we were all on top of each other. It was terrible,"" Yaya says. The boats gave way in the night - only 19 people survived from his. Three other vessels and all their passengers vanished into the dark waters. Yaya's eyes start welling up, his voice cracks, but he takes a deep breath to avoid crying in front of Deborah. ""I couldn't find my wife Dejezi and the boys, my heart hurt. I couldn't help them. Then I saw their bodies floating."" He and Deborah finally arrived in Sicily, with a small backpack of clothes. Just the two of them. There is a saying in this city: ""Vedi Napoli e poi muori"" (see Naples and die). It traces back to the times when the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies - of which Naples was the capital - was an affluent and prestigious part of the world. The meaning behind the old proverb is that once you have seen the glory of Naples, there is nothing else worth seeing, but for Yaya it is very much the opposite. ""This is a bad city. There is nothing here for us. Many things have happened here."" Yaya's wife Seri Dejezi also perished off the coast of Libya Yaya lives in a refugee centre in the city with his young daughter. They both have refugee status from the UN Refugee Agency in Liberia. But he wants to get out, and angrily recalls a story over how a man approached him to buy Deborah. ""I'll never forget it. I got approached by a man with a phone number and was told, this man wants to buy your daughter for â¬30,000. ""I go to my office (refugee reception centre) and said 'see what's happened'. I gave them the number, I told them my story. I started to cry,"" Yaya says. He adds that nothing was done and that the man was never caught. But he fears that eventually the city could destroy him and Deborah. ""I don't like the way some men look at my daughter. I worry she may be exploited into drugs and prostitution,"" he says. Libya exposed as child migrant abuse hub African migrants sold in 'slave markets' As he tells his story, there are dozens of other young men and women, of African origin, congregated on the Piazza Garibaldi. Pointing to them he says: ""I don't want to live like this. I'm fearing that I'll be left in Napoli. ""I am strong enough to work but I can't get a job. I want to keep moving and take Deborah to the US or Australia."" Last week, a Catholic priest who helps refugees urged his fellow Africans not to turn their backs on their homeland. Don Mussie Zeraisaid that people should think twice before making the perilous journey to Europe. But Yaya shakes his head when I mention this: ""I can't go back home. I don't like the politics there. Also I promised a better life for my family."" He says that he is focused on his plans and will only go back to get his mother and other family members. ""My mother is Christian. I get my strength from her and from God, and from my daughter Deborah. I do this all for Deborah."" Start of migrants' desert trek to Europe.

"Theresa May will announce new measures this week Businesses who pay excessive salaries to senior executives represent the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"", Prime Minister Theresa May has said. The ""excesses"" of some bosses was undermining confidence and ""damaging the social fabric of our country"", she wrotein the Mail on Sunday,external. Firms that face shareholder revolts over salaries and bonuses will be named on a new public register, Mrs May said. She also said firms could decide how workers are represented in boardrooms. The Conservatives' manifesto said executive pay should be approved byan annual vote of shareholders. Mrs May's article does not mention this commitment, but instead says firms that have a ""shareholder revolt"" on pay will be named on a new public register. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said that a ""revolt"" would be defined as 20% of shareholder opposition. UK trade body the Investment Association has been appointed to set up the public register, which it said would be ""the world's first of its kind"". It said it would launch the register by the end of the year. Firms named on the list would need to detail how they intend to address investors' concerns, it added. Investment Association chief executive Chris Cummings said the register would hold the UK's ""biggest businesses to account"". ""The creation of the public register on shareholder voting is an important step in increasing accountability and transparency of those listed companies that see significant shareholder rebellions during the AGM season,"" he added. Stefan Stern, director of independent think tank, the High Pay Centre, told the BBC: ""These shareholder votes are already in the public domain, and reported by the media. ""But the symbolism of being named on a list is something that will get the attention of company boards. ""They won't want to be on this list, for as well as the adverse attention it brings, it could also make them potentially vulnerable to hostile investors."" By Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent The Royal Dutch Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden saw his total pay packagesoar by 54% to Â£7mlast year. The Reckitt Benckiser boss Rakesh Kapoor took a pay cut of one third in 2016 - and still pocketed Â£14.6m. But they are both dwarfed by Sir Martin Sorrell. The advertising giant WPP paid him Â£42m last year andÂ£210m over the past five years. At the moment, shareholders have a vote on these payouts every year, but it is not binding on the executive team. Even if it were, in order to change how bosses are paid it would still need a sustained change in culture by the giant institutional investors - as they own most of the shares in listed companies. Pension funds and banks would need to consistently vote in large numbers against the chief executive's pay and that - despite regular talk of a ""shareholder spring"" - has yet to happen. Mr Stern said that Mrs May's proposals were ""a step in the right direction"", but that more needed to be done to address the systemic issue of high executive pay. Mrs May said new measures - to be announced this week - would also ensure workers' voices were ""properly heard in the boardroom"". She said the government will set an ""expectation"" that publicly-listed companies have in place an employee advisory panel, or an employee representative on their boards. Mrs May said most of the UK's biggest businesses invested in their workforces and looked after the interests of employees and investors. However, she said that ""too often in recent years we have also seen another, unacceptable, face of capitalism"". A ""minority of firms are falling short of the high standards we expect of them,"" she added. ""Some have deliberately broken rules that are designed to protect their workers. ""Others have ignored the concerns of their shareholders by awarding pay rises to bosses that far outstrip the company's performance."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Earlier this year theÂ£48m pay package of WPP's Sir Martin Sorrellwas rejected by one in five shareholders at the firm. It was the seventh year in a row that more than a fifth of shareholders voted against his pay. In a non-binding vote last year,BP shareholders rejected a pay packageof almost Â£14m for chief executive Bob Dudley. This month, a report revealed the pay of top chief executives'had fallen in the past year. However, the High Pay Centre's research said there was still ""a huge gap"" between the pay of the bosses of FTSE 100 companies and the rest of their staff.

"Graham's doctor suggested he join a local walking group in Stockport two years ago. Graham Ward was 60 when he was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes. It came after decades of eating and drinking too much in a high-stress, sedentary job: ""It was an explosion waiting to happen,"" he said. For Graham, whose wife had become increasingly disabled through multiple sclerosis, the diagnosis was a wake-up call. ""I need to be able to help her - and I need to be around for longer,"" he said. Graham is not alone in his diagnosis. Public Health England estimates that 42% of 45- to 64-year-olds have a long-term health condition such as diabetes or heart disease. This week,it urged middle-aged people to walk more often and more briskly. It is encouraging those between the ages of 40 and 60 to start doing regular brisk walks of just 10 minutes a day. One in five middle-aged people is physically inactive, engaging in less than 30 minutes of exercise a week, it says. To help, the government agency is promoting a free app -Active 10,external- which can monitor the amount of brisk walking an individual does and provide tips on how to incorporate more of it into the daily routine. When he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2015, Graham, pictured here with his wife, weighed 18 stone When Graham was diagnosed as a diabetic, he realised he needed to make changes: ""My clothes were getting tighter, and I was hearing how being overweight could affect my life and health in other ways,"" he said. Diabetes has been linked to other issues such as heart disease, stroke and kidney disease, causing a reduction in one's life expectancy. He said beforehand he had managed to turn a blind eye to this. ""When someone is in front of you telling you it's you, there's nowhere to hide,"" he said. ""They're not talking about the other millions of people out there."" Graham's doctor suggested he should join a local walking group in Stockport. ""I started and I was a bit nervous. With a couple of hills, it was more walking than I'd been doing,"" he said. He was talked into the 1.9 mile walk by the group leader. ""After the first time, I overcame all those fears."" He invested in a pair of new shoes and gradually increased his walks to reach five miles. Over a period of months, Graham graduated from walking three kilometres to eight kilometres ""It was a very quick improvement, once you realise after the first one or two that you don't become immediately breathless and that you can walk further from home than you thought,"" said Graham. ""I moved on from walking with that group, to walking by myself, walking further distances and the pounds started falling off me."" He used a pedometer to make sure he was reaching the recommended 10,000 steps a day. Now he does about 15,000 steps and has lost 50lb. ""My trousers were falling off me. I had to throw away all the clothes I owned,"" he said. Graham said the benefits were not only physical. ""I'm fitter, healthier, more confident.  When you start walking you see things in your area that you haven't seen before, such as discovering canal towpaths."" His advice to others is not to be ""disappointed if it doesn't happen in the first few weeks"". Now, he and his wife diet and swim together. ""When I'm playing with my grandchildren now, it's them that get tired before me,"" Graham said.

"Claim:It takes longer today to get from Chester to Manchester than it did in 1962. Verdict:True, but the fastest service on that route now stops in more places. The vast majority of other routes have seen improvements in journey times. The Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has argued that the north of England is underserved in terms of rail infrastructure. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that it now took rail passengers longer to make the journey from Chester to Manchester than in 1962. ""We cannot continually be put at the back of the queue,"" he said. ""People here -  taxpayers - here deserve a modern transport system on a par with London."" Figures from Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) indicate that Mr Burnham is correct. Its analysis of historical train timetables show that in 1962 the fastest service from Chester to Manchester took 56 minutes, stopping at one station in between. Today it takes 60 minutes but makes seven station stops. By contrast, according to TfGM, the fastest journey from Manchester to London in 1962 was 220 minutes. It is now 124 minutes, a reduction of nearly 44%. TfGM has also looked at how other journeys to and from Manchester have fared since 1962. All of them are now faster. Andy Burnham: North 'needs transport investment now' August Bank Holiday: Where to avoid on roads and rail A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We are committed to improving trans-Pennine services, and are working with Transport for the North to cut journey times and increase capacity between the major cities of the north. "" Journey times are not the only way to measure improvement (or otherwise) on Britain's railways, or how the rate of progress differs between regions. It is important to consider the number of passengers. They made 1.7bn journeys on Britain's train network in 2016-17, 79% more than in 1962. This is often given as a reason why most of the infrastructure investments carried out today focus on increasing capacity rather than speeding up journey times. Gary Cooper, the director of planning, engineering and operations at the industry body the Rail Delivery Group, said: ""The number of journeys has doubled in the last twenty years [after falling in the years following 1962] meaning there are more trains making more stops on a busier railway."" ""While this means journey times may not have reduced in some places, it has helped to connect more communities and drive economic growth."" But is it true that communities in the North are ""at the back of the queue"" when it comes to transport spending? Total government transport spending for England in 2011-2012 was Â£15.8bn. That covered all forms of transport. A third of it went to London, while only a quarter was spent on the North East, the North West, and the Yorkshire and Humber regions combined. By 2015-16 that had jumped to Â£24.3bn, and proportionate spending was roughly the same. No other English region comes close to receiving the amount spent on London - which includes the tube network and recently the Crossrail development. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said in an article for the Yorkshire Post,externalthat ""unprecedented investment"" has been allocated to the North between 2015 and 2021. ""We are spending Â£13bn on Northern transport in this Parliament - the largest in government history."" A breakdown of that figure reveals Â£3.8bn is earmarked explicitly for rail enhancements. Looking ahead, it appears that London will still receive the lion's share of funding. The think tankIPPR North looked at planned spending on projects,externalthat were either funded publicly or by a combination of public and private investment. They excluded projects that spanned more than one region. They found that per person, spending in London was set to be considerably higher in from 2016-17 onwards: London: Â£1,900 North West: Â£680 North East: Â£220 Yorkshire and the Humber: Â£190 Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter,external Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes South Korea impeached president arrested after investigators scale walls Obesity needs new definition beyond BMI, says global report Red Sea dive-boat survivors accuse authorities of cover up Chris Mason: Political heat map flashes red over Treasury They hired Banksy for Â£50 then painted over his mural 'We sing to them': LA stables turn Noah's Ark for fire rescue animals Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution Almost 100 strikes hit Gaza 'humanitarian zone', BBC Verify analysis suggests LA fire victims fear new housing crisis Trapped in the dark for 35 hours - Red Sea dive-boat survivors tell of terrifying escapes 'Your husband's being tortured, and it's your fault' The classic reality show starring Paris Hilton Can jet setters Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie give up their A-list lifestyles?

"Sir Keir has been shadow Brexit secretary since last year Labour would keep the UK in the EU single market and customs union for a transitional period after leaving the EU, the party has said. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer set out Labour's new positionin the Observer,external. The shift in policy would mean accepting the free movement of labour after leaving the EU in March 2019. Sir Keir said the transition would be ""as short as possible but as long as necessary"". Meanwhile, Brexit Secretary David Davis has urged the European Commission to have a flexible approach to talks. Money and other disputes dog talks EU applications for UK citizenship up 80% Food industry warns of workforce shortage 'Net migration fall' since Brexit vote Labour's leadership has been criticised by opponents for a lack of clarity on what deal Britain should seek immediately after leaving the EU. Sir Keir said a transitional period was needed to avoid a ""cliff edge"" for the economy, so that goods and services could continue to flow between the EU and UK while negotiations on the permanent deal continued. ""Labour would seek a transitional deal that maintains the same basic terms that we currently enjoy with the EU,"" he wrote. ""That means we would seek to remain in a customs union with the EU and within the single market during this period. ""It means we would abide by the common rules of both."" He compared this with the government's preference for ""bespoke"" transitional arrangements after leaving the EU, which, Sir Keir said, were highly unlikely to be negotiated before March 2019. He did not say how long the transitional period would be - only that it would be ""as short as possible, but as long as is necessary"". Jeremy Corbyn's office confirmed the proposals had been agreed with him and were official policy By BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake A significant shift or simply the clarification of a confused picture? Either way, Labour's plan for a transitional period after the UK leaves the EU only takes us so far. Yes, we now know that a Labour government would keep the UK in the customs union and single market for some time after March 2019. But how long for? And what happens after that? Sir Keir has suggested continued membership of the customs union and single market with stricter controls on immigration. That idea is likely to go down about as well as a flat beer in Brussels. In the words of the EU's chief negotiator, ""cherry picking is not an option"". Labour's plan will be music to the ears of its remain-voting supporters in London and beyond. But to those in the party's heartlands, keen to see the back of Brussels, it may sound more like an alarm bell. The customs union is the EU's tariff-free trading area, which imposes the same taxes on imports from certain countries outside the union. The single market also includes the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. ""Those who campaigned to leave the EU are likely to be concerned that this could see unlimited  migration continue for some time after Brexit,"" said the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson. After the transitional period, Sir Keir said, the new relationship with the EU would ""retain the benefits of the customs union and the single market"", but how that would be achieved ""is secondary to the outcome"".

Remaining in a form of customs union with the EU was a ""possible end destination"" for Labour, he said, but that must be ""subject to negotiations"". He said a final deal must address the ""need for more effective management of migration"". Jeremy Corbyn's office confirmed that the proposals had been agreed with him and were official policy. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said it was a ""sensible and reasonable"" approach to take, and would give working people ""certainty"" on their jobs and rights at work. Customs union, free trade area and single market - an explainer Reality Check: The UK's customs union proposals Labour MP Chuka Umunna, co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on EU relations, told BBC News the change in policy was ""welcome"" and urged Labour to commit to staying in the single market after the transition period. However, a spokesman for Labour Leave, a pro-Brexit movement, warned the party risked losing the 37% of Labour voters who voted to leave the EU. ""Seven out of 10 Labour constituencies voted Leave. Single market membership is EU membership in all but name. Labour must honour the referendum,"" it tweeted. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said it was ""all spin and no principle"". Meanwhile, the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said Labour was simply delaying the UK's departure from the market, saying: ""Labour still face a cliff edge, only later than the Tories."" Former-UKIP leader Nigel Faragetweeted,externalthat Mr Corbyn had ""betrayed every Labour voter"", having said he would support the UK leaving the single market during the general election campaign. The governmenthas also called for a transition periodto help business adjust after Brexit. But chancellor Philip Hammond and trade secretary Liam Fox said the UK would be ""outside the single market and outside the customs union"" during this period. A paper subsequently published by the government said it could ask Brussels to establish a ""temporary customs union"" after March 2019. But during this period, it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals - something it cannot do as an EU customs union member. Meanwhile, Brexit Secretary David Davis will meet the European Commission's chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday to formally open Brexit discussions. The government said this week's negotiations were ""likely to be technical in nature"", ahead of more substantial talks in September. It said both sides must be ""flexible and willing to compromise"" when it comes to solving areas where they disagree.

The official opening ceremony saw thecharity singleBridge Over Troubled Water performed and a multi-faith prayer was said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said although the 51st carnival took place in a ""context of sadness and sorrow"", it was a celebration of London's diversity. At 15:00 BST, sound systems were turned off to mark a minute's silence. Firefighters and paramedics were among those who bowed their heads in tribute to victims. Another silence will be observed on Monday. The carnival route passes near the tower and a ""ring of care"" has been formed around it by police. More than 80 people are believed to have died in the fire on 14 June. Doves were released as the opening ceremony concluded The white birds were released from the hands of survivors and local residents, as well as leader of Kensington and Chelsea council Elizabeth Campbell, Mr Khan and local MP Emma Dent Coad. Hamid Ali Jafari, 33, whose 82-year-old father Ali Yawar Jafari was killed in the blaze, helped to release the doves.

Jouvert means ""open of the day"" in French, and marks the beginning of festivities Earlier, the carnival got under way with a traditional paint fight. The tradition, known as Jouvert, meaning ""open of the day"", sees revellers hurl paint at each other which dancing to steel bands and African drummers. Handmade green hearts and streamers adorned the judging area, while spectators were decked out in green following a campaign encouraging people to go ""green for Grenfell"", which organisers said they hoped would symbolise ""reverence and respect amidst the revelry"". Organisers encouraged people to wear green for Grenfell Hundreds took part in the traditional Jouvert opening parade, which involves hurling paint at each other In her speech, Ms Dent Coad,who had previously likened the carnival to a wake, praised the ""Grenfell generation"" of young people and urged them to set aside sadness and worries. ""Carnival is for dancing, laughing, singing along and having a wonderful time with our community and those closest to us,"" she said. Performers from Muraldo Mass want the victims to know the whole of London supports them Thousands of energetic performers with strikingly colourful costumes are entertaining tens of thousands lining the streets in west London in stunning weather. There is, above all, a relaxed and joyous atmosphere despite the sombre tone interspersed into proceedings. Doves were released for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire after a street service attended by religious and political leaders at which the mayor was applauded for saying those responsible for the fire that killed at least 80 people half a mile from here need to be held to account. Some people are wearing green in honour of the victims and messages of remembrance and anger have been drawn onto wooden hoardings and metal stalls. Summing up the poignancy of this year's annual party, Hackney-based dancers Muraldo Mass in flowing blue iridescent hooped dresses and camouflage tops, told me they wanted to dance here to show Grenfell survivors they are supported by a community not just based locally, but from across the city. Pepe Francis, chairman of the carnival trust, said: ""This will be the first opportunity for visitors to Carnival to pay their respects for those affected by Grenfell."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan has met families of the victims of the fire Hundreds of hand-drawn tributes, flowers and candles will be protected by fencing, while the public have been asked not to take selfies at the site. A reflection zone will be placed near the burnt high-rise, where performers will lower the volume of their music. The event runs close to the tower A spokesman for Grenfell United, a residents and survivors group, said: ""We hope people will follow these requests from us and our friends and family in the wider community. ""They will enable people to pay their respects; be conscious of our vulnerability; and show solidarity for our ongoing demands for housing and full justice, in the creative spirit of Carnival.""

The little town has not been destroyed but it is in bad shape, particularly in the poorer quarters where trailer homes have been smashed open by the wind. Debris is trailing from the tops of trees and on the porch of one modest property a rain-sodden American flag lies on the ground: a splash of red, white and blue amid the green leaves of fallen trees. Most people appear to have got out just in time with many leaving only at the last minute as the full power of the storm became clear. Too poor to flee the hurricane Hurricane Harvey as it happened Rockport has not been destroyed by the storm but it is in bad shape Texas Governor Greg Abbott has warned that flooding in the state is not going to disappear overnight Harvey began as a major category four hurricane - the first to make landfall in the US in 12 years - before it was downgraded to a tropical storm later on Saturday. Mr Abbott warned of the ""potential for very dramatic flooding"" from the storm while expanding a declaration of emergency in the state from 30 counties to 50. He has mobilised 1,800 military personnel to help with rescue and repair operations. Forecasts say that up to 40in (1m) of rain could fall in some areas of the middle and upper Texas coast,the hurricane center (NHC) warned,external. Such precipitation could trigger flooding in low-lying areas and near water outlets and rivers. The National Weather Service,externalcautioned that the storm was so severe that many areas could be uninhabitable for months. The storm has now mostly moved inland, officials say, with several places already reported to have received well over 10in of rain. But coastal areas will also be flooded by storm surges during high tide, the NHC said. Some Rockport residents lost both their homes and their furniture and belongings Many buildings in the path of the storm - such as this church - have been badly damaged Meteorologist Wendy Wong told the Houston Chronicle,externalthat at least seven tornadoes stemming from the hurricane had struck the Houston area between Friday evening and Saturday afternoon. The tornadoes destroyed buildings and homes and are likely to continue throughout Sunday and Monday. Earlier, Harvey made a double landfall: north-east of the city of Corpus Christi initially late on Friday local time, then just north of Rockport a few hours later. When the storm struck close to Corpus Christi it had winds of up to 130mph (215km/h), but by 18:00 GMT its sustained winds had dropped to 70mph - therefore becoming a tropical storm. It was moving at an extremely low speed - 2mph. The port of Corpus Christi - which closed on Thursday in preparation for the storm - only received ""minor damage"".  Its navigation channel is due to reopen after a survey is completed by engineers. Texas City also expects to open its port within 48 hours. Utility companies say nearly 300,000 customers have been without electricity. President Donald Trump has freed up federal aid for the worst-affected areas and Governor Abbott praised the administration for ""stepping up"". In a teleconference with cabinet members Mr Trump ""emphasised his expectations that all departments and agencies stay fully engaged and positioned to support his number one priority of saving lives"", the White House said. At least 18 people have been rescued from vessels in distress by Coast Guard helicopters. ABC Newshas tweeted,externala video of four people being rescued off the coast of Port Aransas. Rockport, normally home to about 10,000 people, appears to have been the hardest hit town. Families are returning to their homes in Rockport Tornadoes have destroyed buildings and homes and are likely to continue throughout Sunday and Monday Travis Pettis, a reporter with the Caller Times newspaper in Corpus Christi, told the BBC that strong winds when the storm arrived made the rain feel like ""needles"". Trees came down in the city and power supplies were cut, but thousands of residents had heeded warnings and boarded up their homes before fleeing. This video can not be played Tornadoes caused much damage as the hurricane made landfall Port Aransas, a city on Mustang Island, near Corpus Christi, is also reported to have extensive damage. Local media reports say a search and rescue operation is under way at a trailer park. Animated guide: Hurricanes,external What is storm surge? Harvey is the first major storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. It is forecast to meander across south-east Texas until Wednesday. Mr Trump is likely to visit Texas early next week, the White House said. The storm is the strongest to hit the US since Charley in August 2004 and the most powerful to hit Texas since Hurricane Carla in 1961, which killed 34 people, according to the Houston Chronicle.

"According to the Mail on Sunday,external, the prime minister has launched an outspoken war on fat cat bosses - executives whose salaries outstrip the performance of their companies. Writing in the paper, Theresa May accuses them of damaging ""the social fabric"" and emboldening those on the far left who ""advocate state control of industry"". She proposes that if one in five shareholders complain about an executive's pay deal they should be named in a public register - with the risk that investors will take their money elsewhere. But the Mail says the measures are a slimmed down version of wider curbs promised by Mrs May in the past. It claims that Chancellor Philip Hammond vetoed putting workers' representatives on boards. And the prime minister is criticised by one of her own MPs, George Freeman, who accuses her of ""flirting with anti-capitalism"". The lead in the Sunday Times is also concerned with fat cats,external- this time in the education sector. Former Chief Inspector of Schools Sir Michael Wilshaw and Lord Adonis, who used to be a Labour schools minister, are calling for ministers to impose limits on the money earned by academy bosses. The paper says more than 100 of them are receiving more than Â£150,000, the salary paid to the prime minister. And it points out that some of these are overseeing schools where children performed poorly in GCSEs and A-levels. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Photos of the horrific crash on the M1 can be found in many of the papers, including theDaily Star Sunday,externalwhich shows the flattened wreckage of the minibus. A charity worker who was one of the first on the scenetells the Sunday Mirror,externalhow he comforted a five-year-old girl trapped in the wreckage, using his jacket to keep her warm and doing his best to distract her. The Observer believes Labour's new Brexit policy,externalcould transform the debate. It says the party's election manifesto pledge - to retain the benefits of the single market while promising to end freedom of movement - lacked clarity. The paper welcomes Labour's new promise to keep the UK in the single market and customs union during a transitional period, arguing this is the only short-term position that makes sense. It says it is now down to moderate, pragmatic Conservative MPs to rally behind Labour to bring realism to the Brexit process. The Sun on Sunday blames EU negotiators,externalfor a stalemate in the Brexit negotiations. It says it is clear they are determined to make the talks all about Britain's exit bill, before adding that as anyone in any divorce will testify you cannot agree the settlement until you have worked out the terms. It thinks Mrs May needs to bang some heads together by making a strong speech warning Brussels will not get a blank cheque from the UK. The Sunday Express focuses on the background,externalof one of the latest contestants on the Great British Bake Off. Kate Lyon is a health and safety officer, which gives the paper an excuse to delve into all the risks facing budding cooks. Apparently, insurance claims for fires caused by cooking go up markedly while Bake Off is on the air. It leads one insurer to give this advice: ""At the end of the day, a soggy bottom is better than a burnt one.""

"After the queues came the recriminations. When supermarket Lidl offered boxes of budget booze, bargain hunters arrived early, lining up across the country in their hundreds, in search of cheap prosecco to toast the bank holiday weekend. But with limited supply and purchase restrictions in place, many intrepid fizz-hunters were left empty-handed and feeling flat. And cross. Some were very cross indeed. Allow Twitter content?

It seems that the country has now effectively divided into two camps - those who arrived at Lidl early enough to purchase cheap prosecco, and everyone else. The first group can be identified by their characteristic desire to tell anyone who will listen that they bought some prosecco.

The second group may display symptoms including regret, confusion and rage.

Shoppers claimed stores had sold out as early as 8am, with many complaining that stock was too limited. Many reported that just 20 cases of prosecco were made available to each store with some feeling short changed as a result. ""Misleading of Lidl to promote all month and never mention [the sale was] limited to just twenty cases of cheap prosecco per store,"" one social media user commented, reflecting the mood of many. A spokesperson for Lidl said the deal had been limited ""to ensure as many customers as possible"" could benefit from the offer. ""We have, however, experienced unprecedented demand and sincerely apologise to anyone that hasn't been able to take advantage of the offer on this occasion.""

"Forcecasters are now warning of 'catastrophic flooding' Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas late on Friday local time, arriving with life-threatening winds and the risk of severe flooding. Gales of up to 130mph (215 km/h) battered the coast. The hurricane -the worst to hit the US mainland in 13 years- has since been downgraded to a tropical storm, due to decreasing wind speeds, but it is moving slowly. It has left significant damage, with the town of Rockport one of the worst affected. Vehicles and buildings were destroyed at the town's airport.... ...as were several light planes. Rockport was directly hit overnight. The town's mayor had said before the storm hit that anyone staying should write their names and social security numbers on their arms, suggesting they were putting themselves in a high-risk situation. Residents in the coastal city of Corpus Christi experienced a citywide power failure overnight on Friday. On Saturday, they woke up to deserted streets, and scenes of damage that the storm had caused, including house fires. But the town was spared the kind of devastation seen in Rockport. On Friday, before landfall, the sight of the roiling seas drew curious locals and storm-chasers, though most then moved to places of safety. Many people left the city and businesses were boarded up to prevent damage. Authorities now warn of ""catastrophic"" floods in coming days, as torrential rains continue. High rainfall of more than 10 inches has already been seen in several areas. There has been flooding in Galveston. And Port Lavaca. Residents in the city of Houston - the country's fourth-largest city - have been stocking up on essential supplies, leaving supermarket shelves bare. Authorities warn that in the Houston area, the most severe weather is yet to come. Harvey has severely hampered Gulf of Mexico oil production and air travel. About 45% of US oil refining takes place on the Gulf of Mexico coast An oil tank was damaged near Seadrift, a city in Calhoun County. Images posted by Nasa have revealed what the storm looks like from the space. This photo was taken by astronaut Jack Fischer, from the International Space Station.

"According to the Mail on Sunday,external, the prime minister has launched an outspoken war on fat cat bosses - executives whose salaries outstrip the performance of their companies. Writing in the paper, Theresa May accuses them of damaging ""the social fabric"" and emboldening those on the far left who ""advocate state control of industry"". She proposes that if one in five shareholders complain about an executive's pay deal they should be named in a public register - with the risk that investors will take their money elsewhere. But the Mail says the measures are a slimmed down version of wider curbs promised by Mrs May in the past. It claims that Chancellor Philip Hammond vetoed putting workers' representatives on boards. And the prime minister is criticised by one of her own MPs, George Freeman, who accuses her of ""flirting with anti-capitalism"". The lead in the Sunday Times is also concerned with fat cats,external- this time in the education sector. Former Chief Inspector of Schools Sir Michael Wilshaw and Lord Adonis, who used to be a Labour schools minister, are calling for ministers to impose limits on the money earned by academy bosses. The paper says more than 100 of them are receiving more than Â£150,000, the salary paid to the prime minister. And it points out that some of these are overseeing schools where children performed poorly in GCSEs and A-levels. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Photos of the horrific crash on the M1 can be found in many of the papers, including theDaily Star Sunday,externalwhich shows the flattened wreckage of the minibus. A charity worker who was one of the first on the scenetells the Sunday Mirror,externalhow he comforted a five-year-old girl trapped in the wreckage, using his jacket to keep her warm and doing his best to distract her. The Observer believes Labour's new Brexit policy,externalcould transform the debate. It says the party's election manifesto pledge - to retain the benefits of the single market while promising to end freedom of movement - lacked clarity. The paper welcomes Labour's new promise to keep the UK in the single market and customs union during a transitional period, arguing this is the only short-term position that makes sense. It says it is now down to moderate, pragmatic Conservative MPs to rally behind Labour to bring realism to the Brexit process. The Sun on Sunday blames EU negotiators,externalfor a stalemate in the Brexit negotiations. It says it is clear they are determined to make the talks all about Britain's exit bill, before adding that as anyone in any divorce will testify you cannot agree the settlement until you have worked out the terms. It thinks Mrs May needs to bang some heads together by making a strong speech warning Brussels will not get a blank cheque from the UK. The Sunday Express focuses on the background,externalof one of the latest contestants on the Great British Bake Off. Kate Lyon is a health and safety officer, which gives the paper an excuse to delve into all the risks facing budding cooks. Apparently, insurance claims for fires caused by cooking go up markedly while Bake Off is on the air. It leads one insurer to give this advice: ""At the end of the day, a soggy bottom is better than a burnt one.""

"Aldi has apologised after customers in some Midlands stores were charged twice for purchases made this month. The company said a ""processing error"" led to a number of its customers at ""some"" stores in the Midlands being charged a second time on Thursday for purchases made on 4 and 7 August. Some 4% of all transactions made in the UK on those dates were affected by the technical fault, Aldi said. All affected customers were reimbursed within 24 hours, the supermarket added. When asked if customers would be refunded for any overdraft fees they might have incurred, a spokesman for the company said it was advising customers to contact their bank.

Off-duty Sgt Tangye,winner of the Police Twitter Awards in 2016,external, wrote: ""Addicted to drugs? I'm fed up with being your keeper. You knew the risks.

Sgt Tangye told BBC News the tweets were his views, not the force's, and he was referring to drug addicts who refused to get help. ""Some are quite criminal and create merry hell and they are destroying a lot of towns and cities,"" he said. ""They should accept help but some are feeding on other victims and creating other victims around them. ""I am a very 'people person' but I see the same names time and time again destroying areas.""

Devon and Cornwall Police said in a statement that ""social media interaction"" by officers with the public ""is vital"" and ""there has been, and no doubt in the future will be examples of posts and subjects discussed, some of which can be controversial"". It added: ""The issue of addiction is hugely complex; understanding and tackling this is something that takes the resources and efforts of a number of public bodies and not just the police."" And it said despite ""personal frustrations"" from officers seeing the negative effects of addiction, ""we as a force will always expect our officers to work with and support those who need our help, and to signpost those in need of specialist care towards the appropriate body"". The BBC approached a number of drugs charities but none wanted to comment. However, a former addict who is now a volunteer at the Narcotics Anonymous helpline said his family's ""tough love"" helped him recover. ""I was one of those troublemakers,"" he said. ""Most drug addicts are in denial and for years I did not think I had a problem. ""It was only when my family stopped enabling me, stopped putting a roof over my head, that I accepted responsibility that it was my problem and I did something about it. ""So I agree with everything he says.""

"The alcohol content of Carling - one of the most popular lagers in the UK - is weaker than advertised, it has emerged. Carling advertises the lager as 4% alcohol by volume (ABV) but it has been brewed at 3.7% since 2012, its US owners Molson Coors have said. ABV was reduced in order to cut tax on Carling products, the firm said during a hearing brought by HMRC. Molson Coors said beer was allowed to have a natural variation of 0.5%, and said customers had not been misled. There is no suggestion Molson Coors has broken any laws. Beer brewed in the UK is subject to excise duty decided by its alcoholic strength - meaning stronger products pay higher rates of tax. According todocuments from the tax tribunal,external- held in February and March this year - HMRC argued Carling had underpaid tax by more than Â£50m between 1 September 2012 and 31 January 2015. It claimed the owners of Carling should have paid tax according to the 4% alcohol strength stated on cans, bottles and other products. However, the firm successfully argued the actual strength of the lager meant it was right to pay less tax. Giving evidence to the tribunal, Philip Rutherford, vice president of tax for Molson Coors Europe, argued Carling it should pay tax on ""the actual ABV of the beer"" rather than the one stated on the label. According to the papers, Mr Rutherford told the tribunal the ""key driver"" behind the decision not to change the labelling on Carling products was to stop retailers - including supermarkets and pub chains - demanding ""a slice"" of the savings. The tribunal found in favour of Molson Coors. According to EU laws relating to the labelling of alcohol, products are allowed an ABV tolerance of +0.5% or -0.5% on products between 1.2% and 5.5% ABV. Molson Coors said Carling customers have not been misled. ""As a major brand, the trust of our consumers is paramount. We abide by all legal requirements in the brewing and labelling of Carling,"" it said in a statement. ""The natural process of brewing means all batches of Carling vary fractionally in alcohol content - the variation range for Carling is less than a quarter of 1% (0.23%). ""It is completely normal for consumable products to have a slight variation. For example, the allowed variation for wine is 1%.""

"Hannah Gadsby and John Robins both win Â£10,000 prize money Two separate acts have been named joint winners of the Edinburgh Comedy Awards for the first time in the history of the city's Fringe festival. Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby's show Nanette shares the Best Comedy Award with British stand-up John Robins' The Darkness of Robins. The winners saw off competition from seven other nominees, including Ahir Shah, Sophie Willan and Spencer Jones. The comedians will each receive Â£10,000 in prize money. Mr Robins' show focused on the end of his relationship with fellow comedian Sara Pascoe, while Ms Gadsby said Nanette would be her last outing as a stand-up. Awards director Nica Burns said the decision to have two winners was ""fitting that in the 70th anniversary year of the Fringe something extraordinary has happened"". He added: ""Both shows, which could not be more different, were hotly debated and fiercely fought for. ""Comedy has many possibilities and audiences [have] very different funny bones. These two incredibly talented winners make you laugh and touch your heart. ""And yes, they will both receive Â£10,000 each so it's been an expensive year. In the 37 years of the lastminute.com Edinburgh Comedy Awards this has never happened before and it is unlikely it will ever happen again.""
