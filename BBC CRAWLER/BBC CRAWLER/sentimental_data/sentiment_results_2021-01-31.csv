"This video can not be played Prof Susan Hopkins: ""We have to relax things really quite slowly"" A record 598,389 people were given their first coronavirus vaccination in one day across the UK on Saturday, government figures show. As of Saturday a total of 8,977,329 people had received a jab, and 491,053 of those have had a second dose. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""delighted"", adding each vaccine ""brings us one step closer to normal"". However, a further 587 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were reported on Sunday. It takes the UK's total by that measure to 106,158, although the number of reported deaths tends to be lower over the weekend.

Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),described the volume of vaccinations,externalas a ""staggering achievement"". TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? Earlier, the health secretary predicted ""a happy and free Great British summer"" but warned of a ""a tough few months"" as national restrictions continue across the UK while vaccinations are administered. His comments came after Dr Susan Hopkins, Public Health England's Covid strategy chief, warned that ending the current coronavirus lockdown must happen ""very slowly, very cautiously"". ""It is better to be cautious, let's get the population vaccinated,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr. England's current lockdown will continue until 8 March, when it is hoped schools could begin to reopen, while national restrictions are also in place across Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The vaccines record comes after a week which had seen a row with the European Union over vaccine distribution. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin said therewere ""a lot of lessons to be learnt""after Brusselsreversed its threatto put checks on the Irish border - a move which had been widely condemned. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen had assured Prime Minister Boris Johnson that ""there will be no disruption of contracts that we have with any producer in the EU"". Meanwhile,the situation in hospitals has ""stabilised"", according to intensive care doctor Prof Rupert Pearse, who said it was going to be ""another very hard year"" for NHS staff. His comments came before it was announced that charity fundraiserCaptain Sir Tom Moore, 100, had been admitted to hospital with coronavirus.

"This video can not be played Myanmar coup: What's happened so far? Myanmar's military has seized power after detaining Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratically elected leaders. Troops are patrolling the streets and a night-time curfew is in force, with a one-year state of emergency declared. US President Joe Biden raised the threat of new sanctions, with the UN and UK also condemning the coup. The army alleges the recent landslide election win by Ms Suu Kyi's party was marred by fraud. She urged supporters to ""protest against the coup"". In a letter written in preparation for her impending detention, she said the military's actions would put the country back under a dictatorship. The military has already announced replacements for a number of ministers. Myanmar's coup: Why now - and what's next? How the military disrupted the internet Who is the general behind the coup? On the streets of the main city, Yangon (Rangoon), people said they felt their hard-fought battle for democracy had been lost. One 25-year-old resident, who asked not to be named, told the BBC: ""Waking up to learn your world has been completely turned upside down overnight was not a new feeling, but a feeling that I thought that we had moved on from, and one that I never thought we'd be forced to feel again."" Myanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces from 1962 until 2011, when a new government began ushering in a return to civilian rule. Aung San Suu Kyi, seen here at a coronavirus vaccination clinic in January, is Myanmar's de facto leader She spent nearly 15 years in detention between 1989 and 2010. She was internationally hailed as a beacon of democracy and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi But her international reputation suffered severely following an army crackdown on the mostly Muslim Rohingya minority. Former supporters accused her of refusing to condemn the military or acknowledge accounts of atrocities. In the early hours of Monday, the army's TV station said power had been handed over to commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. Ms Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other leaders of the National League for Democracy (NLD) were arrested in a series of raids. It is not clear where they are being held. No major violence has been reported. Soldiers blocked roads in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, and the main city, Yangon. International and domestic TV channels, including the state broadcaster, went off air.Internet and phone serviceswere disrupted. Banks said they had been forced to close. Later, the military announced that 24 ministers and deputies had been removed, and 11 replacements had been named, including in finance, health, the interior and foreign affairs. A curfew is now reportedly in effect from 20:00 local time to 06:00 (13:30-23:30 GMT). Queues formed at ATMs in Yangon and other cities The military takeover follows weeks of tensions between the armed forces and the government followingparliamentary elections lost by the army-backed opposition. The opposition had demanded a re-run of the election, raising allegations of widespread fraud that were not backed by the electoral commission. So it is official. The armed forces in Myanmar have confirmed that they have carried out a coup d'etat, their first against a civilian government since 1962, and in apparent violation of the constitution which the military promised to honour as recently as last Saturday. The grievances which have been driving tension between the military and the government are well enough known. The military-backed party, the USDP, performed poorly in last November's general election, whereas the NLD did even better than in 2015. The timing of this coup is also easily explained. This week the first session of parliament since the election was due to start, which would have enshrined the election result by approving the next government. That will no longer happen. But the military's longer game plan is hard to fathom. What do they plan to do in the year they have given themselves to run the country? There will be public anger over a coup so soon after an election in which 70% of voters defied the Covid-19 pandemic to vote so overwhelmingly for Aung San Suu Kyi. Famously stubborn, she is unlikely to co-operate with a gun held to her head. Her ally, President Win Myint, is the only person authorised under the constitution to enact a state of emergency. He has been detained with her. For the moment the military's action appears reckless, and puts Myanmar on a perilous path. Michael Ghilezan, a partner of a US law firm who lives in Yangon, told the BBC he had expected military vehicles and protests in the city, but there was instead an eerie calm. ""The most common reaction from my Burmese friends has been anger. They feel deeply betrayed by the military and the USDP."" This was reflected in other comments from the streets, although there have been some supporters of the army out waving flags in Yangon. Theinny Oo, a development consultant, told Reuters: ""We had a lawful election. People voted for the one they preferred. We have no protection under the law now."" Many people feared giving their names. One 64-year-old resident of Hlaing township told AFP: ""I don't want the coup. I have seen many transitions in this country and I was looking forward to a better future."" Author and historian Thant Myint-U tweeted that a door had opened to a ""very different future"", and he feared for the millions who had been descending into poverty. Allow Twitter content?

Joe Biden released a statement saying,external""force should never seek to overrule the will of the people or attempt to erase the outcome of a credible election"". He said the removal of sanctions over the past decade as Myanmar progressed to democracy would be immediately reviewed, adding: ""The United States will stand up for democracy wherever it is under attack.""

European Union leaders have issued similar condemnations. China, which has previously opposed international intervention in Myanmar, urged all sides in the country to ""resolve differences"", while some regional powers, including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines, said it was an ""internal matter"". Military chief Min Aung Hlaing is now in power Aung San Suu Kyi, 75, is the daughter of Myanmar's independence hero, Gen Aung San who was assassinated just before the country gained independence from British colonial rule in 1948. She remained popular with the public despite spending years under house arrest. She was released in 2010, and in November 2015 she led the NLD to a landslide victory in Myanmar's first openly contested election for 25 years and became de facto leader. This video can not be played How did this peace icon end up at a genocide trial? In recent years, her leadership has been defined by the treatment of the country's mostly Muslim Rohingya minority. In 2017 hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh due to an army crackdown sparked by deadly attacks on police stations in Rakhine state.

"AstraZeneca was first approved in the UK, and only in the EU last Friday The EU says UK-Swedish drug firm AstraZeneca will now supply an additional nine million Covid vaccine doses by March, after days of criticism of the bloc's vaccination programme. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it was a ""step forward"". But the 40m doses now expected are still only about half of what had been hoped, amid continuing supply problems. The Commission has been involved in a much-criticised row with both the UK and AstraZeneca this week. In particular it was condemned over its threat to put checks on the Northern Ireland border to prevent vaccines produced in the EU from reaching the UK. The border was one of the most difficult problems to overcome in the recently agreed Brexit deal, following the UK's departure from the EU. The EU was angry that Britain was getting its UK-made contracted supplies from AstraZeneca while it suffered a shortfall. So the bloc announced it was introducing export controls on coronavirus vaccines made inside the EU to try to protect its supplies. The Brexit deal ensures there are no obstacles to trade between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland . How effective is the Oxford vaccine? Why is EUâs vaccine rollout so slow? Is it OK to get a leftover Covid-19 vaccine? In a tweet, Ms von der Leyen said AstraZeneca would ""deliver 9 million additional doses in the first quarter (40 million in total) compared to last week's offer & will start deliveries one week earlier than scheduled"". She said this represented a 30% increase on the previous amount. Irish broadcaster RTE is reporting that the country will get another 100,000 doses as a result. The EU signed a deal in August for 300 million AstraZeneca doses, with an option for 100 million more. Ursula von der Leyen has faced mounting criticism over the vaccine programme It was hoped 80 million would be delivered in the first quarter of 2021 - although other sources had put the figure at 100 million - but AstraZeneca said there were production problems at its Dutch and Belgian plants. Media reported this would mean a 60% cut in supplies to the end of March. There followed a terse exchange between the two parties on contractual obligations, the EU arguing it was binding and the drug firm saying it had only to provide its ""best reasonable efforts"". The contract between the two was partly published as both tried to win the argument. The Commission pointed out it could be supplied from UK-based plants, but the UK staunchly defended its supply contracts with AstraZeneca. The UK was the first country to approve the vaccine, on 30 December - the EU only did so on Friday. The EU, also on Friday, announced its so-called transparency mechanism, which gives countries in the bloc powers to deny authorisation for vaccine exports if the company making them has not honoured existing contracts with the EU. The EU's attempt to apply measures to the Irish border was widely condemned, and the heads of the UK- and Europe-wide industry bodies warned against export bans. The EU stepped back and, in a call with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Ursula Von Der Leyen said that ""there will be no disruption of contracts that we have with any producer in the EU"". In addition to her announcement on the doses, Ms Von Der Leyen said she had had a video-conference with vaccine manufacturers. In an earlier tweet she spoke of ""our new initiative to strengthen bio-defence preparedness"", adding: ""We're discussing how to address Covid-19 variants & scale up manufacturing, be better prepared for future pandemics."" This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? There was no reference to the talk earlier in the week of legal action and ""hijacking"" of supplies. The BBC's Kevin Connolly says this was a curiously flat and bland conclusion to a week of stormy rhetoric. The additional doses announcement will be greeted with relief in Brussels, our correspondent says, but it still leaves the European Commission facing awkward questions about how its signing of supply contracts and approval processes have lagged behind those of other wealthy nations. Even Ms Von Der Leyen's reference to AstraZeneca expanding its production in Europe and the earlier supply date were partly signalled by the firm last week. But she said on Sunday that the EU was maintaining its ""target of vaccinating 70% of adults by the end of summer"". ""Our opponent is the virus and the pharmaceutical industry is part of the solution,"" Ms Von Der Leyen told German public broadcaster ZDF. Remember just how long and difficult the Brexit negotiations were in reaching an agreement on Northern Ireland? Think about how often the EU lectured the UK government about the importance of respecting the detail of the arrangement; how peace in Northern Ireland was at stake. Yet the impression the European Commission gave on Friday - however incorrect or unintended, which is what it insists - is that those concerns could be thrown aside in a heartbeat. The European Commission back-tracked late on Friday (although it has reserved the right to revisit the issue, it says, if it sees EU-manufactured vaccines entering the rest of the UK via Northern Ireland). The U-turn was publicly welcomed by Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin. But take a look at political and press reaction in Ireland, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and you'll see a lot of damage had already been done.

"This video can not be played Prof Susan Hopkins: ""We have to relax things really quite slowly"" Ending the current coronavirus lockdown must happen ""very slowly, very cautiously"", Public Health England's Covid strategy chief has said. Dr Susan Hopkins said the focus should be on getting people vaccinated and preventing another wave of infections. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""I hope that this summer will be similar to last summer... and that will allow us to do things that feel more normal."" Meanwhile, Matt Hancock predicted ""a happy and free Great British summer"". But the health secretary warned of a ""a tough few months"" as national restrictions continue across the UK while vaccinations are administered. ""We have to follow the data, we have to see the impact of the vaccine on the ground. It's a difficult balance: we've got to move as fast as we can but in such a way that keeps people safe,"" he told BBC Politics East. A record 598,389 first vaccinations were given on Saturday, UK government figures show, taking the total number of people who had received their initial jab to 8,977,329. A further 21,088 positive coronavirus cases were identified on Sunday and a further 587 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded - death figures tend to be lower at the weekend. Hospitals 'stable' but 'another hard year ahead' 'Lessons to be learnt' from vaccine row - Irish PM The vaccines that work - and the others on the way Dr Hopkins said that, while final decisions are taken by politicians, restrictions should be relaxed ""really quite slowly so that if cases start to increase we can clamp down quite fast"". She added: ""The NHS is going to be under pressure until the end of March, as normal in winter, but even more so with the amount of inpatients they still have with Covid-19. ""Any releases that we have will have to happen very slowly, very cautiously, watching and waiting as we go with a two-week period to watch and see the impact of that relaxation because it takes that [time] to see what's happening in the population."" National restrictions in England will last until at least 8 March - the soonest schools could reopen to all pupils Dr Hopkins said every effort must be made to avoid another wave of infections similar to that experienced during the current winter period. ""It is better to be cautious, let's get the population vaccinated,"" she added. The latest data indicates 8.98m people in the UK have now received a first vaccine dose, with experts saying all current vaccines should show at least 50% effectiveness against emerging new variants, such as the one first identified in South Africa. Dr Hopkins described the news that two new vaccines - produced by Novavax and Janssen - are at least 60% effective against the South African variant as ""reassuring"". England's current lockdown will continue until 8 March, when it is hoped schools could begin to reopen. National restrictions are also in place across Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? It came as International Trade Secretary Liz Truss guaranteed there will be no disruption to Pfizer vaccines being supplied to the UK from within the EUafter a dispute over exports. She told the Marr programme: ""The prime minister has spoken to the president of the European Commission, she has assured him that there will be no disruption of contracts that we have with any producer in the EU."" She said it was ""too early"" to say when the UK would send vaccine doses abroad amid predictions there will be a surplus of jabs here. The UK would ""work with friends and neighbours... [and] developing countries because we're only going to solve this issue once everybody in the world is vaccinated,"" she added. A paper modelling,externalhow and when coronavirus restrictions might be lifted once the most vulnerable are vaccinated suggested that releasing measures suddenly could lead to ""substantial additional deaths"". Scientists predicted that continuing measures, such as social distancing, for a longer period - at least until all adults are vaccinated - may be key to controlling infections. Dr Sam Moore, an epidemiological modeller at Warwick University who led the study, warned that even if vaccines do significantly reduce infections the impact will not be seen ""for some time to come"". He said restrictions should ""relax slowly"", and added ""we're going to have to be patient"". Asked whether social-distancing measures would be in place for the rest of the year, Ms Truss said autumn ""is a very long time away"" with the focus now being on the vaccine rollout.

"Pippa Hamshaw says the costs and worry of fire-safety regulations have left her in tears Thousands of flat owners are facing large bills for fire-safety improvements demanded following the Grenfell disaster. Labour says they're not getting enough help, but the government insists it's taking appropriate action. ""The building should never have been signed off in the first place,"" says Pippa Hamshaw. ""The flats are all valued at nothing. Mortgage companies won't offer mortgages on any of them."" Pippa, 31, is also expecting a Â£70,000 bill for her share of renovations on her block of flats in Leeds. ""I go from being really angry with the situation to being in tears,"" she tells BBC 5 live's Naga Munchetty. ""It's taken over my life."" Cladding crisis: 'Delays could bankrupt us' New body to ban dangerous building materials No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs Pippa is one of thousands of people facing large payments for safety renovations required following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, in west London, in which 72 people died when flames spread via combustible exterior cladding. Many fire-safety concerns have come up in inspections since then, but those not relating to cladding - such as missing fire breaks and flammable balconies - are not covered by the government's Building Safety Fund. And a report by MPs has said that the Â£1.6bn the government has allocated for removing dangerous cladding is insufficient - with the real cost nearer Â£15bn. This video can not be played Starmer: ""Three and a half years after Grenfell, most people would not believe this is the situation we are in"" Fixing safety faults has seen costs surge for leaseholders like Pippa, whose monthly service charge has risen from Â£240 to Â£630. ""I just feel totally let down by the whole system,"" she says. ""The government could do something right now... I feel like everyone's winning bar the leaseholder."" After Grenfell, round-the-clock fire patrols known as ""waking watches"" were put in place in hundreds of buildings, costing groups of leaseholders tens of thousands of pounds every month. ""I don't feel any safer,"" says Pippa. ""I don't see how they are going to be much use. They literally have to go and knock on every door of the flats to tell you that the building is on fire. We've got 10 floors in my property. Are they really going to be able to knock on every door?"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is accusing ministers of offering ""half-baked solutions"" to the problems exposed by Grenfell and has called for a national cladding taskforce, modelled on a similar body set up in Australia. He argues this would ""drive forward"" work on funding the removal of dangerous cladding, while pursuing ""those responsible for the cladding scandal"", protecting residents from costs and ensuring they can sell their properties. Builders remove cladding from a block in Greater Manchester Jenny Garrett, who bought her flat in Sheffield in 2019, says that, when the survey was carried out, ""absolutely nothing"" wrong was found. Only later did she find out the building's cladding was flammable. ""The whole situation is quite overwhelming because there's the issue of feeling unsafe,"" she says. ""On top of that, there's the issue about the financial pressure and worrying about what's coming down the road."" Residents have seen insurance costs on buildings with fire safety problems rocket. Flat owners in one Cheshire development had their combined premiums rise from Â£34,000 in 2018 to more than Â£500,000. Some are now paying almost Â£2,000 a year for building insurance. Meanwhile,data released last month shows,externalthat cladding removal and repair work has been completed on only 58% of social housing blocks and 30% of private sector buildings. The Association of British Insurers says the slow pace of getting buildings fixed means means high policy prices reflect risks accurately. ""For the last two or three years, a lot of our lives have been completely ruined,"" says Giles, a flat owner from Manchester. ""We're living in fear and limbo. All we've been told so far is the government wants us to pay sums running into the tens of thousands of pounds, simply to make our homes safe. ""It's all got even worse over the last year, because we're trapped in our homes for 23 hours a day during the pandemic. We almost feel safer outside than inside."" People attended a commemoration to mark the third anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire in 2020 ""We all want to see homes made safer, as quickly as possible... we are making good progress on remediating unsafe homes,"" a Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman says. ""Leaseholders shouldn't have to worry about the unaffordable costs of fixing safety defects in high-rise buildings that they didn't cause - and should be protected from large-scale remediation costs wherever possible,"" he adds. ""The Building Safety Bill is the appropriate legislative mechanism for addressing these issues and will be brought forward in due course."" The House of Commons backed a Labour motion calling for further action on cladding on Monday by 263 votes to none. The Conservative leadership asked its MPs to abstain and the result is not binding on the government. LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Need some assistance with home-schooling?

"Teachers should be vaccinated against Covid once the most vulnerable have received their doses, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves has said. She added that Labour wanted the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisation (JCVI) to look at the evidence on prioritising key workers. Labour has argued vaccinating teachers could help reopen schools. But International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said ""the most important thing is protecting lives"". Speaking to Sky News, Ms Truss said: ""For every person you vaccinate who isn't in the most vulnerable group, that is somebody in the most vulnerable group who isn't getting their vaccine and who is more likely to die in the next few weeks and months."" She said it was right that the JCVI - an independent body of experts - looked at these issues. Starmer's vaccine stance shot by both sides No split over vaccines policy, Labour insists How many people have been vaccinated so far? The vaccinations committee has said early vaccination of certain professions should be considered - but only once those in the top nine priority groups have been offered a first jab. The first four priority groups cover those aged over 70 and care home residents and workers. The government aims to offer vaccines to everyone in these groups by mid-February. The next five groups include people over the age of 50 and those between 16-64 with underlying health conditions. The committee is expected to look at the next priority groups for vaccination in the coming month. On Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for all school staff to be vaccinated during the February half-term, saying they should receive doses alongside priority groups five to nine. However on Friday, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford - a Labour politician - said he would prioritise teachers for vaccinations only if advised to do so by the JCVI. Labour later clarified that moving teachers up the queue was a decision for the JCVI - something that had not been made explicit when the Labour leader first announced the policy. This video can not be played Rachael Reeves: ""It would take just a couple of days to get our teaching staff vaccinated"" And speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Ms Reeves reiterated that Labour wanted the JCVI to look at the evidence but added that using the February half-term to vaccinate school staff would be ""the sensible thing to do"". ""The government say that getting our kids back to school is a priority - Labour agree but the government have no plan to achieve this."" She said children will have had ""the best part of a year"" out of school and that although online learning exists ""there is no substitute for being in the classroom with a qualified teacher."" ""It would take just a couple of days to get our teaching staff vaccinated so the JCVI should look at this,"" she said. Her position was supported by former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, who said there was a ""very strong case"" for teachers to be vaccinated before schools reopen. But Conservative Party Chairwoman Amanda Milling MP said Labour had ""abandoned the science and is playing politics with the vaccine"". Starmer's vaccine stance shot by both sides No split over vaccines policy, Labour insists How many people have had boosters so far?

"Ben Hughes, at Jawbone Brewing, has struggled to find the right packaging Jawbone Brewing, a newly launched craft brewery in Twickenham, south-west London, was all ready with its new pale ale when it came across a stumbling block. It couldn't get hold of any boxes. The boom in online ordering during the pandemic has also meant rocketing demand for cardboard, as consumers have started  taking delivery of everything from bicycles to houseplants. In the end Jawbone had to delay the launch of online deliveries by three weeks while the company looked for packaging. They put out a plea to local customers on social media: could you bring a box with you? And founder Ben Hughes went on a mad scramble to find the right kind of double-walled delivery boxes that would protect the cans of beer adequately in the post. ""I wanted to get the boxes branded. But we haven't been able to. All the suppliers are saying you have to wait a few months for that."" Cardboard prices are rising The Confederation of Paper Industries (CPI) says while there is always a peak in demand in the run up to Christmas, stockpiling around the Brexit deadline exacerbated the problem. Covid-19 also led to complications with shipping and staffing challenges, which affected the industry on a global basis. The CPI described it as a ""perfect storm"" but said new capacity coming on stream would help ease the pressure. Multinational packaging firm, DS Smith, said the problem lies partly in the recycling chain. Pre-pandemic when most deliveries were made in bulk to High Street shops and restaurants, packaging found its way quickly back into the system via recycling firms. ""All our boxes are made from recycled material,"" said group chief executive Miles Roberts. ""One of the challenges for us is that, with so much packaging now in peoples homes or in their garages, how do we get that paper back into the recycled network, how we can get it back into our mills so we can convert it into paper and reuse it again?"" Richard Ellison had to explain the problems to some disappointed customers. About 100 customers, expecting a next-day delivery of organic wine from Wanderlust Wine, saw their orders slip by a day or two. Wanderlust Wine faced delays due to cardboard shortages Some were ""massively hacked off"", he says. Like Jawbone, Wanderlust Wine had run short of packaging. ""We were warned there was a shortage of raw materials,"" says Mr Ellison. Prices jumped and the lead time on orders went from a week to three months. ""That's a huge lead time to get boxes made,"" he says. He ended up buying 3,000 boxes at double the cost, he says. And now he's switched to using non-branded standard boxes rather than the bespoke ones designed for Wanderlust. Even supermarkets are feeling the pinch with Asda, Lidl and the Co-op, finding they had to switch to plastic boxes for their eggs for the same reason, prompting criticism on social media. ""There is a shortage of the pulp used to make the cardboard boxes that is affecting all retailers. These plastic ones are 100% recyclable but we hope to go back to the cardboard ones as soon as we can,"" Asda responded on Twitter. Axl Barber, boss of packaging firm Rightbox, says the problems started back in October but now ""it's really crazy"". ""A standard box with flaps at top and bottom can get made up in days and delivered in a week in a normal times,"" he says. ""At the moment it's two months, three months."" He's helping small firms find solutions on a case-by-case basis, using whatever boxes can be found. One firm selling PPE resorted to using boxes without lids by wrapping them thoroughly. Some firms are blaming the suppliers of raw materials themselves, others point the finger at the retail behemoths, like Amazon for taking more than their fair share. Amazon said it has been reducing the amount of packaging it uses in recent years, including sometimes shipping products in their own packages without additional ""shipping boxes"". Online shoppers warned about hidden price rises Amazon buys its first planes to expand air network LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"This video can not be played Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the EU was ""blindsided"" by the AstraZeneca vaccine row ""There are a lot of lessons to be learnt,"" Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said after Brussels reversed its threat to put checks on the Irish border. This came as part of EU efforts to control vaccine exports, amid dose shortages in the bloc. People had been ""blindsided"" by the row but insisted the EU's move was ""not an act of hostility,"" Mr Martin said. The UK says it is confident the EU will not block vaccines entering the UK. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen had assured Prime Minister Boris Johnson that ""there will be no disruption of contracts that we have with any producer in the EU"". Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, she added that she was ""very pleased"" the EU stepped back from its plan to implement the border checks. ""What I want to do now is work with fellow trade ministers to keep these supplies open and to move away from the idea of vaccine nationalism and protectionism which we know simply harms our global health efforts and harms our global economy."" EU 'fiasco' on NI heaps pressure on Commission What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? WHO criticises EU over vaccine export controls Speaking on the same show, Taoiseach Mr Martin said he first became aware of the EU's plan to put checks on the Irish border when the commission issued a public announcement. He said he immediately contacted European Commission President Mrs von der Leyen and ""articulated the very serious implications the move would have"" - and that Mrs von der Leyen ""took on board"" his concerns and ""thankfully"" the commission pulled back from its stance. Mr Martin added that the commission should have spoken to him first and said there were ""a lot of lessons to be learnt"" from the incident and that issues with the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland needed ""fine-tuning"". Acknowledging the tension between the EU and vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca was ""terrible"", he stressed the need for all sides to ""calm down"" and ""dial down the tone"". However he also noted that there had been ""shock"" in the EU when ""it emerged the original commitment [by AstraZeneca] of delivering 100 million doses wasn't going to be realised."" Earlier this week AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said the contract with the EU obliged the company to make its ""best effort"" to meet EU demand, without compelling the company to stick to a specific timetable. This comes as the World Health Organizationsaid ""vaccine nationalism""could prolong the pandemic and further widen global inequality. Ms Truss told the BBC: ""This is a global problem that needs global solutions and what we want to do is help other countries, including the developing world get the vaccines they need to make sure the whole world is vaccinated."" The EU's threat of border controls came amid a deepening dispute over delays to the production and distribution of Covid vaccines across the continent. The bloc is introducing a so-called transparency mechanism, which gives countries in the bloc powers to deny authorisation for vaccine exports if the company making them has not honoured existing contracts with the EU. The EU's attempt to apply measures to the Irish border was widely-condemned, and the heads of the UK- and Europe-wide industry bodies have warned against export bans. Former prime minister Tony Blair said the EU's threat was ""a very foolish thing to do and fortunately they withdrew it very quickly"". ""Companies are working as fast as they can to protect everyone. Export restrictions do no one any good and we urge governments to avoid them,"" Richard Torbett, head of the UK's Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, and Nathalie Moll, head of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations,wrote in the Observer.,external The EU has insisted that its controls are a temporary scheme, and not an export ban. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? On Saturday Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the government expected vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and AstraZeneca to be supplied to the UK but said it would work with the EU to ""make sure that their own problems can be tackled"". ""Our first priority is vaccinating people in the United Kingdom, but we also want to work with our friends and neighbours in the European Union in order to help them as well,"" he said. By Naomi Grimley health correspondent Like many rich countries, the UK has bought more vaccines than it needs in order to hedge its bets in an emergency. That's led some to argue that the UK should consider donating some - either to a neighbouring EU country such as Ireland which does not have such a plentiful supply or to poorer countries which currently have none. But ministers say it's too early to make that call yet. The World Health Organization wants richer countries to commit to donating their excess once they have enough to vaccinate their most vulnerable. Norway has said it will do this and India has already given some vaccines to Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh in what's been called ""vaccine diplomacy"". The UK government said a further 587 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus as of Sunday, taking the total deaths by that measure to 106,158. There have been a further 21,088 lab-confirmed cases of the virus in the UK, while 8,977,329 have received their first dose of a vaccine and 491,053 have been given the second dose.

"People queue outside a Perth supermarket ahead of the lockdown The Australian city of Perth has begun a snap five-day lockdown after a security guard working at a quarantine hotel tested positive for coronavirus. Western Australia - the state of which Perth is the capital - had not had a case of locally acquired coronavirus for 10 months. The lockdown began at 18:00 (10:00 GMT) and runs until Friday night. Schools, restaurants, bars, cinemas and gyms have been ordered to close. Only essential travel is allowed and masks must be worn. People in the city of two million - along with people living in the nearby Peel and South West regions - must stay at home, except for essential work, healthcare, food shopping or exercise, said Western Australia state Premier Mark McGowan. A scheduled return of schools on Monday has also been delayed by a week. Australian states reopen to Sydney after outbreak Sydney cut off from rest of Australia amid outbreak ""I know for many Western Australians this is going to come as a shock,"" Mr McGowan said at a news conference. ""We cannot forget how quickly this virus can spread, nor the devastation it can cause. ""Our model is to deal with it very, very quickly and harshly... so that we can bring it under control and not have community spread of the virus as you have seen in other countries around the world,"" he added. Mr McGowan said the guard may have the UK variant of the virus: ""We are told the guard was working on the same floor as a positive UK variant case."" The guard and his family have been placed into quarantine at a state-run facility, he added. Leaders of other states and territories have also been contacted and advised not to allow people to travel into the state. Australian Open to allow up to 30,000 fans 'Luck of the draw': What it's like in hotel quarantine Australia has recorded nearly 29,000 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began, for a populations of about 25 million - far fewer than many other countries. In recent months in particular, the nation has taken swift and aggressive actions to contain outbreaks at their source, and it currently has a travel ban in place preventing residents from overseas travel. Earlier this month, Queensland's capital,Brisbane, completed a three-day lockdown over the detection of a single case. Earlier this week,Australia also suspended a travel bubble with New Zealandafter its first Covid case in months was confirmed to be a more contagious variant. It has now reopened the travel bubble with New Zealand. Travellers to Australia will be screened before and after flights for the next 10 days, but will no longer be required to enter quarantine. Until the Perth case, Australia had not had any locally acquired infection for the past 14 days. Its only infections had been in returned overseas travellers in hotel quarantine.

"The US has pledged to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to poorer nations from next year - bringing its total commitment to more than one billion. ""To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere,"" US President Joe Biden told a virtual Covid-19 summit. The donation will be routed through Covax - the international scheme designed to ensure low-income countries aren't left behind in the fight against Covid. It came amid growing warnings over the pace of global vaccinations, and inequity of access. Covax,externalwas created last year to ensure that Covid vaccines are made available around the world, with richer countries subsidising costs for poorer nations. The scheme hopes to distribute enough vaccines to protect at least 20% of the population in 92 low- or medium-income countries - starting with healthcare workers and the most vulnerable groups. Its initial goal was to provide two billion doses of vaccines worldwide in 2021, and 1.8 billion doses to 92 poorer countries by early 2022. Covax is run by a number of international organisations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN children's charity, Unicef. Ghana was the first country to receive Covax vaccines in February. Since then, more than 303 million doses have been shipped through Covax to 142 countries around the world, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia and Fiji. Most doses are going to poorer countries, but some have been sent to wealthier countries such as Canada,which defended its request. Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Covax works with with governments and vaccine manufacturers around the world. Supporters include the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the UAE, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Portugal. Countries have pledged to donate both money and surplus doses from their own vaccine supplies. The US joined Covax after President Biden took office in January 2021 The UK, Japan, Canada and the European Union are among those to have committed to supplying tens of millions of doses. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus previously criticised wealthier nations for ""gobbling up"" the global vaccine supply. G7 countries have purchased over a third of the world's vaccine supply, despite making up only 13% of the global population. Six vaccines have been given ""emergency use authorisation"" by the WHO, meaning they can be shared via Covax: AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and Sinovac. However, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses have been delivered so far. Moderna has agreed to supply 500 million doses at its ""lowest-tiered price"", but most won't be available until 2022. Covax has been criticised for being slow. Some initial targets were missed, partly as a result of the poor health infrastructure in many of the recipient countries, and partly because of vaccine hesitancy. Covax supplied AstraZeneca Covid vaccines arriving in Madagascar in May 2021 Deliveries were also delayed because of the deteriorating situation in India. Officials thererestricted exports to protect their own populationamid soaring infection rates. Theseare set to resume from October. Covax has told the BBC that too many donations have come in small quantities, at the last minute and with little time left before they expire. This makes it very hard to get them to where they are needed. Representatives of the scheme also note that only a small percentage of the pledges made earlier this year have turned into actual doses. Unicef executive director Henrietta Fore said countries needed to ""accelerate their donation plans"", with low-income nations unable to wait any longer. While many high-income countries have now given at least one shot to more than half their populations, only 2% of people in low-income countries have had their first dose, according to data from the University of Oxford. Covax says it is now expecting to hit its ""key milestone"" of releasing two billion doses for delivery some time early next year. Why are vaccines being destroyed in Africa? Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? In total, some six billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 195 countries worldwide. However, while some countries have fully vaccinated a large amount of their population, many others have only just begun, or in some cases are still waiting for their first doses to arrive. Covax aims to close that gap. ""With a fast-moving pandemic, no one is safe, unless everyone is safe,"" the WHO says on its website. But even if Covax meets its goal to vaccinate 20% of the population in its 92 target countries, that's well short of the level of immunity that experts say is needed to end the pandemic. The WHO has suggested that figure is at least 70%. People may also need booster doses to remain protected.

"This video can not be played International trade secretary Liz Truss says Asia Pacific countries ""will provide big markets"" in the future for British products The UK will apply to join a free trade area with 11 Asia and Pacific nations on Monday, a year after it officially left the EU. Joining the group of ""fast-growing nations"" will boost UK exports, the government says. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership - or CPTPP - covers a market of around 500 million people. But they are harder to reach than neighbouring markets in Europe. Members include Australia, Canada, Japan and New Zealand. Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam are also founder members of the bloc, which was established in 2018. ""In future it's going to be Asia-Pacific countries in particular where the big markets are, where growing middle-class markets are, for British products,"" International Trade Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC's Andrew Marr. ""Of course British businesses will have to reach out and take these opportunities, but what I'm doing is I'm creating the opportunities, the low tariffs, removing those barriers so they can go out and do that."" Joining the bloc would reduce tariffs on UK exports such as whisky and cars, as well as service industries, she said. However the immediate impact is likely to be modest as the UK already has free trade deals in place with several CPTPP members, some of which were rolled over from its EU membership. The UK is negotiating deals with Australia and New Zealand. In total, CPTPP nations accounted for 8.4% of UK exports in 2019, roughly the same proportion as Germany alone. UK wants to join the club - but what is the CPTPP? How many trade deals has the UK done so far? The US was originally in talks to be part of the CPTPP, butformer President Donald Trump pulled outwhen he took office. If the new administration in Washington were to reconsider the CPTPP, that would make membership much more attractive to the UK. It could allow a much closer UK-US trading relationship, without waiting for a bilateral trade deal to be negotiated. Exactly a year after it said goodbye to the EU, the UK is eying a new trading club. It sounds a win-win: those Pacific Rim nations represent 13% of global income and 500 million people - and the UK would retain the freedom to strike deals elsewhere. There'd be agreement on how standards and regulations are set (with minimums to be adhered to) - but they wouldn't need to be identical. In practice, however, the short-terms gains for households and business would be limited. The UK already has trade deals with seven of the 11 nations - and is pursuing two more. In total, CPTPP nations account for less than 10% of UK exports, a fraction of what goes to the EU. This deal would however deepen some of those ties - and allow UK manufacturers who source components from multiple nations in the bloc some benefits under ""rules of origins"" allowances. But the real boost could come in the future, if others join - in particular the US, as President Biden has hinted. That would give the UK that hoped-for trade deal with America - within a trading bloc wielding considerable power on the global stage. Read more from Dharshini The UK is the first non-founding country to apply to join the CPTPP and, if successful, would be its second biggest economy after Japan. The free trade block aims to reduce trade tariffs - a form of border tax - between member countries. It includes a promise to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges- although some of these charges are kept to protect some home-made products, for example Japan's rice and Canada's dairy industry. In return, countries must cooperate on regulations, such as food standards. However, these standards and regulations do not have to be identical, and member countries can strike their own trade deals. The government was putting place strategies that would ""deliver for Britain in 2030 and 2050"", Ms Truss said. She said services, robotics, data and digital industries were particularly set to gain, which could lead to more UK jobs. Membership will also offer the potential for faster and cheaper visas for business people, the government said. The formal request to join will be made on Monday, with negotiations expected in the spring. NEWSCAST:A row has erupted between the EU and drugs company AstraZeneca over vaccine shortages.

"This video can not be played Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the EU was ""blindsided"" by the AstraZeneca vaccine row ""There are a lot of lessons to be learnt,"" Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said after Brussels reversed its threat to put checks on the Irish border. This came as part of EU efforts to control vaccine exports, amid dose shortages in the bloc. People had been ""blindsided"" by the row but insisted the EU's move was ""not an act of hostility,"" Mr Martin said. The UK says it is confident the EU will not block vaccines entering the UK. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen had assured Prime Minister Boris Johnson that ""there will be no disruption of contracts that we have with any producer in the EU"". Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, she added that she was ""very pleased"" the EU stepped back from its plan to implement the border checks. ""What I want to do now is work with fellow trade ministers to keep these supplies open and to move away from the idea of vaccine nationalism and protectionism which we know simply harms our global health efforts and harms our global economy."" EU 'fiasco' on NI heaps pressure on Commission What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? WHO criticises EU over vaccine export controls Speaking on the same show, Taoiseach Mr Martin said he first became aware of the EU's plan to put checks on the Irish border when the commission issued a public announcement. He said he immediately contacted European Commission President Mrs von der Leyen and ""articulated the very serious implications the move would have"" - and that Mrs von der Leyen ""took on board"" his concerns and ""thankfully"" the commission pulled back from its stance. Mr Martin added that the commission should have spoken to him first and said there were ""a lot of lessons to be learnt"" from the incident and that issues with the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland needed ""fine-tuning"". Acknowledging the tension between the EU and vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca was ""terrible"", he stressed the need for all sides to ""calm down"" and ""dial down the tone"". However he also noted that there had been ""shock"" in the EU when ""it emerged the original commitment [by AstraZeneca] of delivering 100 million doses wasn't going to be realised."" Earlier this week AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said the contract with the EU obliged the company to make its ""best effort"" to meet EU demand, without compelling the company to stick to a specific timetable. This comes as the World Health Organizationsaid ""vaccine nationalism""could prolong the pandemic and further widen global inequality. Ms Truss told the BBC: ""This is a global problem that needs global solutions and what we want to do is help other countries, including the developing world get the vaccines they need to make sure the whole world is vaccinated."" The EU's threat of border controls came amid a deepening dispute over delays to the production and distribution of Covid vaccines across the continent. The bloc is introducing a so-called transparency mechanism, which gives countries in the bloc powers to deny authorisation for vaccine exports if the company making them has not honoured existing contracts with the EU. The EU's attempt to apply measures to the Irish border was widely-condemned, and the heads of the UK- and Europe-wide industry bodies have warned against export bans. Former prime minister Tony Blair said the EU's threat was ""a very foolish thing to do and fortunately they withdrew it very quickly"". ""Companies are working as fast as they can to protect everyone. Export restrictions do no one any good and we urge governments to avoid them,"" Richard Torbett, head of the UK's Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, and Nathalie Moll, head of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations,wrote in the Observer.,external The EU has insisted that its controls are a temporary scheme, and not an export ban. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? On Saturday Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the government expected vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and AstraZeneca to be supplied to the UK but said it would work with the EU to ""make sure that their own problems can be tackled"". ""Our first priority is vaccinating people in the United Kingdom, but we also want to work with our friends and neighbours in the European Union in order to help them as well,"" he said. By Naomi Grimley health correspondent Like many rich countries, the UK has bought more vaccines than it needs in order to hedge its bets in an emergency. That's led some to argue that the UK should consider donating some - either to a neighbouring EU country such as Ireland which does not have such a plentiful supply or to poorer countries which currently have none. But ministers say it's too early to make that call yet. The World Health Organization wants richer countries to commit to donating their excess once they have enough to vaccinate their most vulnerable. Norway has said it will do this and India has already given some vaccines to Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh in what's been called ""vaccine diplomacy"". The UK government said a further 587 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus as of Sunday, taking the total deaths by that measure to 106,158. There have been a further 21,088 lab-confirmed cases of the virus in the UK, while 8,977,329 have received their first dose of a vaccine and 491,053 have been given the second dose.

"This video can not be played Prof Susan Hopkins: ""We have to relax things really quite slowly"" Ending the current coronavirus lockdown must happen ""very slowly, very cautiously"", Public Health England's Covid strategy chief has said. Dr Susan Hopkins said the focus should be on getting people vaccinated and preventing another wave of infections. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""I hope that this summer will be similar to last summer... and that will allow us to do things that feel more normal."" Meanwhile, Matt Hancock predicted ""a happy and free Great British summer"". But the health secretary warned of a ""a tough few months"" as national restrictions continue across the UK while vaccinations are administered. ""We have to follow the data, we have to see the impact of the vaccine on the ground. It's a difficult balance: we've got to move as fast as we can but in such a way that keeps people safe,"" he told BBC Politics East. A record 598,389 first vaccinations were given on Saturday, UK government figures show, taking the total number of people who had received their initial jab to 8,977,329. A further 21,088 positive coronavirus cases were identified on Sunday and a further 587 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded - death figures tend to be lower at the weekend. Hospitals 'stable' but 'another hard year ahead' 'Lessons to be learnt' from vaccine row - Irish PM The vaccines that work - and the others on the way Dr Hopkins said that, while final decisions are taken by politicians, restrictions should be relaxed ""really quite slowly so that if cases start to increase we can clamp down quite fast"". She added: ""The NHS is going to be under pressure until the end of March, as normal in winter, but even more so with the amount of inpatients they still have with Covid-19. ""Any releases that we have will have to happen very slowly, very cautiously, watching and waiting as we go with a two-week period to watch and see the impact of that relaxation because it takes that [time] to see what's happening in the population."" National restrictions in England will last until at least 8 March - the soonest schools could reopen to all pupils Dr Hopkins said every effort must be made to avoid another wave of infections similar to that experienced during the current winter period. ""It is better to be cautious, let's get the population vaccinated,"" she added. The latest data indicates 8.98m people in the UK have now received a first vaccine dose, with experts saying all current vaccines should show at least 50% effectiveness against emerging new variants, such as the one first identified in South Africa. Dr Hopkins described the news that two new vaccines - produced by Novavax and Janssen - are at least 60% effective against the South African variant as ""reassuring"". England's current lockdown will continue until 8 March, when it is hoped schools could begin to reopen. National restrictions are also in place across Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? It came as International Trade Secretary Liz Truss guaranteed there will be no disruption to Pfizer vaccines being supplied to the UK from within the EUafter a dispute over exports. She told the Marr programme: ""The prime minister has spoken to the president of the European Commission, she has assured him that there will be no disruption of contracts that we have with any producer in the EU."" She said it was ""too early"" to say when the UK would send vaccine doses abroad amid predictions there will be a surplus of jabs here. The UK would ""work with friends and neighbours... [and] developing countries because we're only going to solve this issue once everybody in the world is vaccinated,"" she added. A paper modelling,externalhow and when coronavirus restrictions might be lifted once the most vulnerable are vaccinated suggested that releasing measures suddenly could lead to ""substantial additional deaths"". Scientists predicted that continuing measures, such as social distancing, for a longer period - at least until all adults are vaccinated - may be key to controlling infections. Dr Sam Moore, an epidemiological modeller at Warwick University who led the study, warned that even if vaccines do significantly reduce infections the impact will not be seen ""for some time to come"". He said restrictions should ""relax slowly"", and added ""we're going to have to be patient"". Asked whether social-distancing measures would be in place for the rest of the year, Ms Truss said autumn ""is a very long time away"" with the focus now being on the vaccine rollout.

"The Law Commission wants to see changes in England and Wales to allow people to marry at home, outdoors and even remotely. Restrictions forcing couples to cancel weddings during the coronavirus pandemic have highlighted ""archaic"" marriage laws, a legal body has said. With wedding venues and churches closed for months, many couples have had to put their big days on hold. The Law Commission wants to see changes in England and Wales to marry at home, outdoors - and even remotely. The Ministry of Justice said it wanted to ensure the law ""better reflects modern society"". The Law Commission said the pandemic had highlighted the laws, some of which date back to the 19th Century, were ""ancient"" and ""unnecessarily restrictive"" and had led to weddings becoming more expensive. Vicars and celebrants told BBC Wales many couples had realised during lockdown they did not care about the ""bells and whistles"" and just wanted to get married as soon as possible. While rules havechanged in Scotland,externalandNorthern Ireland, in England and Wales couples must choose between a civil or religious ceremony with an officiant and certain wording, with no option for a legally-binding ceremony reflecting other beliefs. Most couples must have their weddings in a registered building - either a place of worship or a licensed venue - and cannot marry outdoors, meaning many had been forced to be postponed due to venues being closed. But under changes,proposed by the Law Commission,external, people would be allowed to marry legally ""anywhere"". Weddings could also be permitted via video call during any future national emergency, such as another pandemic. What are Wales' lockdown rules? The end of the big Indian wedding What does a humanist believe? Professor Nick Hopkins, family law commissioner at the Law Commission, which reviews legislation, said the marriage laws in England and Wales had ""not kept up with changes in society"". ""Our proposals would give couples the freedom to choose the wedding venue they want and a ceremony that is meaningful for them,"" he said. Budget 2018: Outdoor venue plan 'to cut wedding costs' Are weddings getting out of control? Amy Neagle and her fiancÃ© Matt Bartlett say it would be much easier if they could just have the one ceremony which reflected their wishes and life After getting engaged at the Glastonbury Festival, Amy Neagle and her fiancÃ© Matt BartlettÂ had hoped to get married in a weekend-long glamping celebration in the Brecon Beacons in May. But with their humanist ceremony not being legally recognised, the couple had planned to attend a register office the week before, which Ms Neagle said was not easy when things feel ""so uncertain"". This video can not be played Elizabeth Facer and Ian Choi had planned to tie the knot in front of 300 guests but had to scale down their plans ""My biggest concern is, is it going to take away from the actual day, as we have already signed the paper...to us it feels like an administrative task,"" she said. ""It would be great to have the full focus on the wedding day and for it to be legally binding."" Ms Neagle said the couple would go ahead with the date, but might have to change their plans and make tough decisions. ""If worse comes to worse and we can't go Brecon then it would be nice if we could get married in the garden over Zoom,"" she added. However, she said they would still have to go to the register office. ""It's sad, but our family and friends understand that we just want to start our married lives together."" Last year during the pandemic, celebrant Sian Julia Jackson performed a ceremony in a back garden of the groom's childhood home, around a tree where his mother's ashes were scattered. ""That was really special ceremony,"" said Ms Jackson, from Neath Valley. ""People were probably looking from their gardens and could see what was going on. ""For that to be recognised legally would be incredible"". Some Islamic ceremonies do not take place in Mosques and some are performed by friends or community members Many Muslim weddings are not classed as legally binding under English and Welsh law, and couples are required to have a civil ceremony if they want to have it legally recognised. Abdul-Azim Ahmed, the Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Wales, said Islamic marriages could be undertaken by ""anyone, anywhere"" and the existing laws were ""too bureaucratic "" and not reflective of the diverse cultures and traditions of modern Wales. He said changing the law would give couples greater protection in courts, but that there needed to be flexibility to recognise the many reasons couples may not want their marriage to be binding under UK law. ""If the location did not have to be registered that would help remove barriers to getting a ceremony which is recognised in civil law as well as religiously valid for Muslims,"" he said. In 2018, 2,223 weddings were held in Church in Wales churches. With couples paying a standard fee of Â£455, weddings contributed more than Â£1m in total towards the estate. But due to uncertainty during the pandemic, and changing rules regarding ceremonies and receptions, many weddings planned for 2021 have already been pushed back. At St Giles' Parish Church, Wrexham, the Rev Dr Jason Bray said that while changes in the 1990s to allow people to get married in approved places - like hotels - had seen a drop in bookings, he did not imagine that would happen again. St Giles' Parish Church, Wrexham, is a large building and the postponement of weddings has put a ""dent"" in upkeep funds during the pandemic ""For many brides in Wrexham it is their dream place to get married,"" he said. Dr Bray said when churches were allowed to reopen, a number of couples had asked to get married as soon as possible, despite restrictions. ""It's been a bit strange really,"" he said. ""But we've tried to make sure we can give them the best experience we can under the circumstances."" The Church in Wales said that while changes would ""likely have an impact on local churches"" it welcomed any moves to make it easier for people to get married. ""We believe a church wedding continues to be a very special experience. Churches are not only beautiful buildings, they are rich in meaning from centuries of use by their communities,"" a spokeswoman said. The Law Commission's review into marriage law was announced in June 2019 by the UK government and following a consultation the body is considering publishing its findings. The Ministry of Justice said it had commissioned the review into weddings in England and Wales to ensure the law ""better reflects modern society"" and would respond after the findings were published.

"Jonathan Reuben says he became suspicious when he saw the value of his funds plummet ""I was following this guy on Instagram and he always posts with his car, a rose gold Maserati, saying that he's rich and self-made and really young, he's only 21,"" says Jonathan Reuben, 24, an accountant. He discovered a foreign exchange trade investment scheme through an account he followed on Instagram. ""At first I put in Â£1,000 and once I saw I was getting money I deposited a bit more and more. In the end I was scammed out Â£17,000,"" he told the BBC's Money Box programme. Jonathan is one of a rising number of Instagram users who have lost money to alleged fraudsters posting on the social networking service. Since the coronavirus outbreak began last year, the average number of Instagram frauds reported each month has increased by more than 50%, according to new figures by Action Fraud, the UK police national reporting centre for fraud and cyber crime. There's also been a rise in the reported amount of money lost. Before the pandemic it averaged Â£60,000 a month, but it has now risen to about Â£200,000 a month. Gurvin Singh claims he got rich quick through foreign exchange trading Jonathan said the alleged fraudster, Gurvin Singh, a man from Plymouth, claimed he got rich quick through foreign exchange trading. Mr Singh then offered users who follow him on Instagram the chance to follow his get-rich-quick trades. ""He said any trade he does will be copied to my account when I signed up."" Jonathan said he was promised almost immediate profits and given access to a trading platform called Infinox, where he could analyse his investment's performance. At first, his profits rose and he invested more money. But he became suspicious after a few months, when he saw his funds plummet over two days. ""I did attempt to withdraw, but it just said withdrawal failed. I asked them for an explanation and their excuse was that the profits dropped because of Brexit. After a few days all my money was gone and I could no longer contact Gurvin or anyone involved,"" Jonathan said. ""I've reported it to the police, my banks and Instagram."" Jake Moore, a cyber security specialist, says that with a lot of young people looking at social media every day, scams like this are becoming more common. ""People are sucked in and want to believe it and want that lifestyle, especially these days, with young people struggling to get jobs,"" he said. ""You definitely see more people looking at different and newer ways to make more money."" ""There are billions of social media accounts and algorithms aren't sophisticated enough yet, we can't rely on computers to do this. Social media companies have got a steep wall up against them."" He urged social media users to never part with money when they are dealing with somebody they don't know. ""There are accounts out there offering these wonderful schemes where you can double, triple, quadruple your money. These are scams,"" he said. Facebook, which owns Instagram, says it fights proactively against this type of content with spam detection technology and is investigating Mr Singh's account. ""There's no place for fraudulent or inauthentic behaviour on Instagram. We have a safety and security team of 35,000 people working to keep our platforms safe and we block millions of inauthentic accounts every day,"" a Facebook company spokesperson said. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates financial markets in the UK, said Mr Singh had been added to a list of unauthorised traders targeting people in the UK. It strongly advised investors to only deal with financial firms that are authorised by the FCA. Action Fraud's National Fraud Intelligence Bureau said the activities of Mr Singh were being investigated, but said there was no criminal inquiry. Mr Singh did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. A spokesperson from Infinox, the platform Jonathan used, said any suggestion that it had acted without integrity or breached any rules was rejected. The spokesperson said it could not comment on the activities of Gurvin Singh as they did not relate to any services Infinox provides.

"Lisa Enroth will live in the Pater Noster lighthouse for a week A Swedish nurse has won a competition to watch the entire 60-movie programme of the Goteborg Film Festival from a lighthouse on an isolated island off the coast of Sweden. Lisa Enroth beat 12,000 film fans from around the world who applied. The nurse, who has worked on Covid-19 wards during the pandemic, said she hoped to enjoy ""being part of a totally different kind of reality for a week"". Festival organisers were forced to curtail the festival by the pandemic. There will be no screenings in cinemas - instead, the entire programme will be streamed online. Organisers said they were searching for a genuine movie fan that was emotionally and psychologically up to the task, the BBC's Maddy Savage reports from Stockholm. Ms Enroth, who said she has been ""drained of energy"" due to the pandemic, will spend a week living alone in the Pater Noster lighthouse on Hamneskar island, without a phone, computer, books or any other form of entertainment. However, she will be given a tablet, for limited periods, so she can record a daily video diary. And one other person will also be on the island for security reasons and will check in on her once a day. To watch the films, a screen has been set up in the lantern room at the top of the lighthouse, where Ms Enroth can also experience a 360-degree view of her new surroundings. ""The wind, the sea, the possibility of being part of a totally different kind of reality for a week - all this is really attractive,"" the nurse said. She usually lives in Skovde, a small city east of Goteborg, where she is part of a local movie club. On Saturday morning, Ms Enroth was taken by boat to the island, which lies off the coast near Marstrand. Festival CEO Mirja Wester said it felt right to give the unique opportunity to one of the many heroes working in healthcare during the pandemic.

Mr Martin added that the commission should have spoken to him first and said there were ""a lot of lessons to be learnt"" from the incident and that issues with the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland needed ""fine-tuning"". Acknowledging the tension between the EU and vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca was ""terrible"", he stressed the need for all sides to ""calm down"" and ""dial down the tone"". However he also noted that there had been ""shock"" in the EU when ""it emerged the original commitment [by AstraZeneca] of delivering 100 million doses wasn't going to be realised."" Earlier this week AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said the contract with the EU obliged the company to make its ""best effort"" to meet EU demand, without compelling the company to stick to a specific timetable. This comes as the World Health Organizationsaid ""vaccine nationalism""could prolong the pandemic and further widen global inequality. Ms Truss told the BBC: ""This is a global problem that needs global solutions and what we want to do is help other countries, including the developing world get the vaccines they need to make sure the whole world is vaccinated."" The EU's threat of border controls came amid a deepening dispute over delays to the production and distribution of Covid vaccines across the continent. The bloc is introducing a so-called transparency mechanism, which gives countries in the bloc powers to deny authorisation for vaccine exports if the company making them has not honoured existing contracts with the EU. The EU's attempt to apply measures to the Irish border was widely-condemned, and the heads of the UK- and Europe-wide industry bodies have warned against export bans. Former prime minister Tony Blair said the EU's threat was ""a very foolish thing to do and fortunately they withdrew it very quickly"". ""Companies are working as fast as they can to protect everyone.

"This video can not be played Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the EU was ""blindsided"" by the AstraZeneca vaccine row ""There are a lot of lessons to be learnt,"" Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said after Brussels reversed its threat to put checks on the Irish border. This came as part of EU efforts to control vaccine exports, amid dose shortages in the bloc. People had been ""blindsided"" by the row but insisted the EU's move was ""not an act of hostility,"" Mr Martin said. The UK says it is confident the EU will not block vaccines entering the UK. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen had assured Prime Minister Boris Johnson that ""there will be no disruption of contracts that we have with any producer in the EU"". Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, she added that she was ""very pleased"" the EU stepped back from its plan to implement the border checks. ""What I want to do now is work with fellow trade ministers to keep these supplies open and to move away from the idea of vaccine nationalism and protectionism which we know simply harms our global health efforts and harms our global economy.""

"Detained protesters in Moscow: Filip Kuznetsov is front right Filip Kuznetsov spent an entire night crammed into a police van with 17 other protesters because Moscow's detention centres were all full. He was among a record 4,002 people arrested across Russia last week, as large crowds took to the streets to demand the release of the opposition politician Alexei Navalny. Further protests have been called for Sunday, threatening to strain the system even further. ""We didn't sleep all night. One person always had to stand for space, so we took it in turns,"" Filip told me by phone on Wednesday from the back of the police van, which he described as an ""ancient vehicle with metal bars all round"". Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, fiercely critical of the Kremlin, was imprisoned on his recent return to Russia after recovering from an attempt to kill him with a nerve agent. This video can not be played Alexei Navalny says the latest case against him was fabricated A judge had sentenced Filip to 10 days in custody on Monday for his part in the protest. But it took police a further two days to find space in city cells. By the time we spoke, his group had been waiting outside Moscow Detention Centre No 2 for 17 hours, fed only by volunteers who brought sandwiches to the van. Filip, a small-business owner, is not a fan or follower of Mr Navalny, but he is disturbed by how a fellow citizen is being treated. ""They're punishing him for nothing - which means anyone could be next, including me,"" he explained. Many of the Moscow protesters had taken to the streets for the first time Few protesters we spoke to at Moscow's Pushkin Square last Saturday mentioned Mr Navalny's near-fatal poisoning, but all were shocked at how his flight home had been diverted so he could be detained at the border. He then faced a bizarre, makeshift court hearing in a police station. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic One poll suggests as many as 42% in the Moscow crowd were moved to protest for the first time. The rallies were also unprecedented in their spread, covering towns and cities usually seen as politically ""passive"". The biggest demonstration was in central Moscow, but there were protests in dozens of cities across the country ""In Moscow, we have safety in numbers, places to work if we get fired, but in the regions it's much more constricted,"" political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann points out. ""People there take higher risks."" In Vladivostok, Russia's far east, Mr Navalny's team say there haven't been demonstrations in the city on last Saturday's scale for over a decade. Katerina Ostapenko, his local co-ordinator there, did not take part herself: she was picked up by police the day before. But she says up to 3,000 people came out, motivated partly by Navalny's latest video exposÃ©: a corruption investigation targeting President Vladimir Putin himself. Katerina Ostapenko organises for Mr Navalny in Vladivostok The film claimed that Mr Putin had a secret, opulent palace,externalbuilt for him on the Black Sea, complete with an aqua-disco and a pole-dancing salon. ""I think people in the regions are much angrier and that's why so many protested,"" Ms Ostapenko told me. ""They're really angry because they have no money, and now look how much Putin has! And it's our tax money that paid for his palace."" That's not my palace, says Putin Russia threatens to fine TikTok over protest posts In pictures: Defiant Russians rally for opposition Vladimir Putin has denied any link to the giant property in Gelendzhik, calling the film a poor montage meant to brainwash people. It's already been watched on YouTube more than 100 million times. ""The number of views is staggering,"" Ekaterina Schulmann says, arguing that the scale of subsequent protests reflects deepening discontent here. The much-watched video claims the property features a casino, an ice rink and a vineyard ""[There's] the year of lockdown measures, the frustration and weariness collected inside people in that time, and the ongoing economic stagnation and declining incomes,"" she notes, adding that Mr Putin's trust rating has been sliding since his re-election two years ago. ""We are in a turbulent period."" So, unsurprisingly, the response to Saturday's protest has been swift and hard. After rounding up thousands of protesters on the day, issuing fines or short-term detention, officials are now going after key allies of Alexei Navalny including his brother, doctor, and a lawyer at his Anti-Corruption Foundation. Alexei Navalny's brother Oleg (left) was taken to court on Friday after being arrested at his flat in Moscow Police in black balaclavas, armed with crowbars, launched raids at their flats and offices across Moscow, as a criminal case was opened for calling a protest mid-pandemic. The fact that Moscow's mayor just lifted a curfew on bars and nightclubs, claiming that Covid-19 is in retreat, made no difference. On Friday, a court placed the three under house arrest for two months, barred from using the internet, while the investigation continues. The Kremlin spokesman denies the prosecutions are politically motivated, telling journalists that law enforcement officers are ""just doing their job"". But with another day of demonstrations ahead, the authorities clearly want to remove the ringleaders. The crackdown may well shrink the crowd this weekend: criminal cases have been launched against ordinary protesters, too - serious charges, including violence against police and hooliganism. Record numbers have been arrested in the capital in the past week But many have vowed to come out regardless. ""We share one problem, the way we're governed,"" Danya says - a student who was detained last Saturday along with several friends. ""We're all protesting for one thing: the alternation of power."" His friend Kirill says their group were standing quietly when the police ""flew at us and started to beat us with their batons"". ""I'm not a direct supporter of Navalny,"" Kirill explains, but he considers his treatment ""illegal"". ""So as citizens of a country we love and want to be better, we have to protest."" One person who definitely won't join him is Filip Kuznetsov, who still has several days of his sentence left to run. But on Friday he sent word that he and other protesters were being moved ""at great haste"". ""They're making space for the protest on the 31st,"" he messaged me, before being bundled into another police van and driven to a detention centre for illegal migrants 100km (60 miles) out of town.

"Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny was long the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin. The 47-year-old blogger had survived poisoning attempts and years in some of Russia's most notorious jails, after his group had exposed corruption at almost every level of the Russian state - frequently targeting President Putin himself. Even from behind bars, unable to challenge the president at the ballot box, his voice had retained power. But in February 2024, it fell silent. According to the prison service, he had gone for a walk when he lost consciousness and died. Navalny was often asked: Do you fear for your life? Navalnyâs life in 'Polar Wolf' remote penal colony In the immediate aftermath, the Kremlin simply said that it was aware of his death, and the president had been informed. Across the world, however, there was shock and anger, as tributes were paid to a man who some said gave his life standing up to Russia's all-powerful leader. Alexei Navalny was born in 1976, in a village just to the west of Moscow. He grew up in Obninsk, a town 100km (62 miles) south-west of Moscow, eventually graduating in law at Moscow's Peoples' Friendship University of Russia in 1998. But it was another decade before he began his rise as a force in Russian politics, making his name as a grassroots anti-corruption campaigner. His blog took aim at alleged malpractice and corruption at some of Russia's big state-controlled corporations. One of his tactics was to become a minority shareholder in major oil companies, banks and ministries, and to ask awkward questions about holes in state finances. His consistent message was a simple one: that Mr Putin's party was full of ""crooks and thieves"". UKRAINECAST:Navalny: What next for Russia? He accused the president of ""sucking the blood out of Russia"" through a ""feudal state"" concentrating power in the Kremlin. That patronage system, he claimed, was like tsarist Russia. It helped that Navalny spoke the street language of younger Russians, and used it to powerful effect on social media. His Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) made detailed claims about official corruption. Then, in 2011, he would lead large street protests against President Putin. Navalny's wife Yulia, pictured with him in 2015, was at most court cases to support him For the rest of his life, he would be in and out of jail, while his organisations would be banned as ""extremist"". In 2017, he was barred from standing in the general election. At the time, he was widely regarded as the only candidate with a chance of challenging President Putin. He would also survive several suspected - and one confirmed - attempts on his life. The first time Navalny suspected he had been poisoned, he was in prison serving a sentence for calling for unauthorised protests. Then 43, he was taken to hospital with a swollen face, eye problems and rashes on his body. At the time, reports suggested it was an allergic reaction - something he and his doctor were quick to question. Officially, he was diagnosed with ""contact dermatitis"". Navalny - who had previously suffered chemical burns to an eye after been targeted with antiseptic green dye in 2017 - later wrote that the doctors who treated him acted ""like they had something to hide"". But it was the second alleged poisoning a year later which really caught the attention of the international media. In August 2020, Navalny collapsed on a flight over Siberia and was rushed to hospital in Omsk. That emergency landing saved his life. A German-based charity persuaded Russian officials to allow him to be airlifted to Berlin for treatment. Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life In September, the German government revealed that tests carried out by the military found ""unequivocal proof of a chemical nerve warfare agent of the Novichok group,external"". The Kremlin denied any involvement and rejected the Novichok finding. The EU then imposed sanctions on six top Russian officials and a Russian chemical weapons research centre, accusing them of direct involvement in the poisoning. Russiaretaliated with tit-for-tat sanctions. Novichok was the chemical weapon which nearly killed former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England, in March 2018. A local woman later died from contact with Novichok. Mr Putin admitted that the state was keeping Navalny under surveillance - it was justified, he alleged, because US spies were helping the blogger. Navalny - pictured with his family - was taken to Berlin for treatment after the Novichok poisoning in 2020 Recovered, Navalny returned to Moscow on 17 January 2021 and was immediately detained, as he knew he would be. He said on Instagram that he felt he had never left - so there was no choice but to return. He would never be free again, despite his supporters staging mass protests across Russia. Police responded to the protests with force, detaining thousands for attending the unauthorised rallies. The arrests did not deter his team from their mission. A video of""Putin's palace"" on YouTube,externalwas quickly published, focusing on a vast luxury Black Sea palace, allegedly gifted to Mr Putin by rich associates. The video has been viewed well over 100 million times. The Kremlin dismissed it as a ""pseudo-investigation"" and Mr Putin called it ""boring"", denying the claims. Later billionaire businessman Arkady Rotenberg, one of Mr Putin's closest friends, said it was his own palace. Putin: Russia's action man president The court case which followed allowed Navalny to make public his allegations against President Putin, in what was now an intensely personal battle: he accused the president of ordering state agents to poison him - and repeated that in court. ""His main gripe with me is that he'll go down in history as a poisoner,"" Navalny told the court scornfully. ""We had Alexander the Liberator, Yaroslav the Wise, and we will have Vladimir the Underpants Poisoner."" Underpants had become a social media meme in Russia after Navalny carried out a telephone sting in December 2020 on a Russian FSB state security agent, who revealed that Novichok, a highly toxic Russian chemical weapon, had been smeared on Navalny's underwear. But while it highlighted once more the Kremlin's alleged attempts on his life, it did not stop the court finding him guilty. On 2 February 2021, a Moscow court jailed Navalny for violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence for fraud - a case which he said had been politically motivated in the first place. Meanwhile, he and his anti-corruption team - all banned from standing in parliamentary elections - were still fighting the Kremlin, this time creating a ""smart voting"" app that encouraged voters to back candidates who had a chance of defeating Mr Putin's United Russia party in September 2021. This video can not be played Hundreds of protesters in Moscow were detained by police But Navalny was not a simple hero, battling against a powerful regime. He has been accused of xenophobia. In videos dating back to 2007, he is seen appearing to compare ethnic conflict to tooth decay and likened immigrants to cockroaches. He also said the Crimea peninsula ""de facto belongs to Russia"", despite international condemnation of Russia's 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian territory. The comments led - controversially - to Amnesty International revoking his status as a ""prisoner of conscience"" in February 2021, before conceding it had been subjected to an ""orchestrated campaign"" to ""delist"" him and then reversing its decision. Millions watch jailed critic's 'Putin palace' film Kremlin critic Navalny recalls near-death torment Meanwhile, the Russian government continued to punish Navalny. In March 2022, his sentence was increased by nine-years after he was found guilty on new charges of embezzlement and contempt of court. He was moved to a new penal colony at Melekhovo, around 250km (150 miles) east of Moscow. In June 2022, his allies raised the alarm after they discovered he was no longer in that prison. Federal prison authorities later admitted he had been moved to a penal colony with a tough reputation, the IK-6 prison, more than 155 miles (249km) east of Moscow, where he said he was repeatedly placed in solitary confinement. His last sentence, handed down by judges in August 2023 and which extended his jail term to 19 years, saw him moved to a maximum security penal colony usually reserved for Russia's most dangerous criminals. This video can not be played Watch: Navalny jokes in court a day before his death His harsh treatment reflected the fact that Mr Putin and his regime feared the influence that Navalny's campaigns had been gaining, Prof Nina Khrushcheva, the great-granddaughter of former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and international affairs experts, told the BBC at the time. ""Putin doesn't even mention his name, anybody in the Kremlin can't his mention name,"" she said, drawing a comparison with the fictional Harry Potter character Voldemort - who is also referred to as ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"". ""Navalny is a threat to Putin's personal power, Putin's personal reputation of himself. And Putin doesn't really treat his enemies lightly and Navalny unfortunately took this - as they say in Russian - this ticket to be Putin's personal enemy."" Yet despite the confinement of his last years, Navalny became one of the leading domestic voices against the war in Ukraine. During a court appearance in May 2022, he accused Mr Putin of starting a ""stupid war"" with ""no purpose or meaning"". And in September, he accused Russian elites of having a ""bloodthirsty obsession with Ukraine"" in an article for the Washington Post. His foundation also continued to oppose the government throughout his imprisonment, speaking out against the mobilisation of some 300,000 civilians to fight in Ukraine and pledging to be a ""partisan underground"" movement inside Russia. Navalny told the BBC that the best thing Western states could do for justice in Russia was to crack down on ""dirty money"". ""I want people involved in corruption and persecution of activists to be barred from entering these countries, to be denied visas."" The news of his death on 16 February was immediately greeted by a wave of tributes from around the world. He had made the ""ultimate sacrifice"" in his fight ""for the values of freedom and democracy"", said the European Union Council president Charles Michel, while French foreign minister StÃ©phane SÃ©journÃ© said he had ""paid with his life for his resistance to a system of oppression"". However, exactly how - or why - he died has yet to be established. He leaves behind his wife, Yulia, and two children. According to his team, they had not been informed directly of his death when it broke in newspapers across the world. ""I don't know whether or not to believe the news, the terrible news"", Yulia Navlanaya said at the Munich Security Conference, hours after news of her husband's death broke. ""You all know this - we can't believe Putin and Putin's government. They're always lying,"" she added. ""But if this is true, I want Putin and all of his entourage, Putin's friends and his government to know that they will be held accountable for what they have done to our country, to my family and to my husband."" She left the stage to a standing ovation.

You can find our latest news storieshereand we will be back with rolling updates on the pandemic tomorrow. Lesley Mitchell, 75, and Janice Mitchell, 70, from Newmarket celebrate their vaccinations Thank you for following our updates today. We're finishing up in a moment, but here's a summary of the day's news: As our thoughts go out to Captain Tom Moore, who is in hospital having tested positive for Covid, let's remind ourselves of how hecaptured the hearts of the nation. It all started with a sponsored walk of 100 laps of his Bedfordshire garden with the hope of raising Â£1,000 for NHS charities. ""To all those people who are finding it difficult at the moment,"" he said, addressing a British public who had seen life turned upside down by coronavirus, ""the sun will shine on you again, and the clouds will go away."" By the time he had reached the finish line, he had become a social media phenomenon and raised an astonishing Â£12m. By teatime the same day, donations had risen to Â£15m. And the total keeps growing and growing and has now passed Â£39m. Now knighted and labelled a ""national treasure"", Captain Tom's life story is to become the subject of a major new film. The as-yet-untitled film will focus on the veteran's relationship with his younger family, who he moved in with following the death of his wife Pamela. The couple were married for 40 years. The picture will also draw on his military career and show how the horrors of war shaped his life and inspired him to keep walking, despite having endured a long battle with skin cancer and a broken hip. Now there is speculation about who will play him. Politicians have sent well wishes to Captain Tom Moore who is in hospital with pneumonia and has tested positive for Covid. Health secretary Matt Hancock said he was sending his ""best wishes"" to the family. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""The whole nation hopes you get well soon Captain Tom Moore. You've been an inspiration to us all throughout this crisis"". Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi tweeted that he was ""praying"" for him. And the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan tweeted: ""Thank you to our brilliant NHS for taking care of Captain Tom Moore. ""Hoping for a speedy recovery and to see Captain Tom back home with his family soon.""  As the UK sets a new record for the number of Covid vaccinations given in one day, here's a couple of graphs showing how the programme is going: Captain Tom Moore is in hospital with pneumonia and has tested positive for Covid,his daughter says.,external The 100-year-old,who was knighted after raising millions for NHS charities during the first coronavirus lockdown, was admitted to Bedford Hospital earlier where he is receiving ""additional help with his breathing"", says Hannah Ingram-Moore. The former British Army veteran was being treated at home for the last few weeks, she says. The medical care he has received has been ""remarkable"" and she hopes he will return home as soon as possible.  More than 50 doctors are working as intensive care nurses to help coronavirus patients in Leicester, a health boss has said. University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust's medical director Andrew Furlong says the hospitals are currently operating at 155% of normal capacity. During the pandemic, other wards have closed and some elective operations paused, allowing consultants from other departments to assist nurses, theLocal Democracy Reporting Service says. Mr Furlong says: ""We have more than 50 of our consultants working on intensive care in a capacity - not as doctors but actually as nurses to support staff and patients on the intensive care unit."" Speaking straight after an intensive care shift, Dr Jennifer Briggs says a colleague told her it is the worst he has seen it in 32 years. ""Staff are exhausted but doing everything they can. News of the vaccine lifted the mood, we were all very excited and looking forward to the opportunity to be able to have it,"" she says. Here's a look at the UK's coronavirus data in graphs. They show that the cases of new infections are falling but the daily deaths and numbers of people in hospital are still high. Rugby Australia has offered to host this summer's British and Irish Lions series against South Africa, where the games face uncertainty due to Covid-19. The Lions are due to visit South Africa in July and August with a three-Test series against the world champions. But issues around Covid-19, including the emergence of a new variant in South Africa, has led to uncertainty over the viability of the tour. ""We're here to help,"" Rugby Australia chairman Hamish McLennantold the Sydney Morning Herald,external. ""What we learnt from the Tri Nations last year and the tennis that's happening now is that Australia can successfully stage global tournaments in a Covid world."" The Lions board arediscussing contingency plansin the event the trip has to be abandoned, including the possibility of hosting games in the UK and Ireland. Thousands of ultra-Orthodox mourners have gathered in Jerusalem to attend the funeral of a top rabbi, in breach of Israel's coronavirus regulations. Rabbi Meshulam Dovid Soloveitchik, 99, died on Sunday following months of ill health after contracting Covid-19. The country is currently under a third national lockdown, but police did not intervene to disperse the huge crowd. The leader was revered and had been head of the influential Brisk yeshiva in Jerusalem The scenes sparked backlash from deputy prime minister Benny Gantz ahead of a vote to extend lockdown rules. ""Millions of families and children are locked in their homes and abide by the rules while thousands of Haredim crowd the funeral, most of them even without masks,""Gantz tweeted,external. ""We will not agree to the continuation of an ineffective fake lockdown. Either everyone is locked down - or everyone opens,"" he said.

Those present - 17 people from London and one from Essex - were fined Â£800 each, police said. Fines of Â£800 for anyone in England attending a house party of more than 15 people were announced earlier this monthby Home Secretary Priti Patel. The previous fines for anyone attending an illegal gathering were Â£200 - or Â£100 if paid early. Fines of up to Â£10,000 for holding large illegal gatherings of more than 30 people still only apply to the organisers. Police said the group were ""clearly having a party"" Others facing the Â£800 fine after this weekend includemore than 70 people who attended a boat partyin Ealing, west London, on Saturday night. Meanwhile, a hotel where 200 people were found partying has beenraided by police in Liverpool. Merseyside Police said they broke up a gathering at a gym in Aintree on the same evening. Officers are considering fining the business owner Â£10,000 for organising the event. Bethany BellBBC News, Vienna Several thousand people protesting against coronavirus restrictions have faced off with police in riot gear in central Vienna, after several protests were banned over concerns for public health. Vienna police announced on Saturday they were banning over a dozen demonstrations, including one arranged by the far-right Freedom Party, on the grounds that protesters generally don't observe social distancing rules or wear masks. The deputy leader of the Freedom Party, Herbert Kickl, called on supporters to go for a walk in the city instead of the party's planned protest. People waved banners, calling for Austrian leader Sebastian Kurz to go. The crowd included some extreme-right activists as well as coronavirus deniers. The atmosphere was tense and some arrests have been made, but the situation has not escalated. Austria is in its third hard lockdown, which started on 26 December.

A further 563 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths reported in hospitals to 71,789, NHS England says. Patients were aged between 24 and 99. All except 29 people, aged between 34 and 97, had known underlying health conditions. The deaths were between December 14 and January 30. There were 27 other deaths reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. We expect to hear the UK-wide coronavirus figures shortly. Israel has agreed to transfer thousands of vaccines to the
Palestinians, amid controversy over whether it should include those in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip in its vaccination programme. Its defence ministry said 5,000 doses would be made available to
immunise front-line Palestinian medical workers. The Israelis have been vaccinating their population very
rapidly, but the programme has not included Palestinians living in
the occupied territories, only Israelâs Arab citizens and Palestinians living
in annexed east Jerusalem. UN human rights experts say Israelis legally obliged to do so,external. But it says vaccinations are the responsibility of

Calls to close the site at Napier Barracks in Kent, south-east England, have come fromcampaignersandpoliticians- but the Home Office said the barracks provided safe and secure accommodation. Andy Aitchison, who documented a demonstration in which protesters threw fake blood at the gates, said he was arrested on Thursday at his home on suspicion of criminal damage, and was held for seven hours at a police station where his memory card and phone were taken. ""There are obviously bad things going on there that they don't want anyone witnessing,"" he said. ""It's the conditions there. They are cold, they have got one shower for 20 people, they are all sharing a room. They know that Covid-19 is rampant. They are worried about it and it's not fair to anyone."" The site was used to house about 400 asylum seekers until some were moved to self-isolation following a Covid outbreak. Tensions at the barracks have been attributed not just to fears about the virus spreading, but also to uncertainty over asylum applications - along with the effect of housing traumatised people in an institutional, military setting.

"This video can not be played Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the EU was ""blindsided"" by the AstraZeneca vaccine row ""There are a lot of lessons to be learnt,"" Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said after Brussels reversed its threat to put checks on the Irish border. This came as part of EU efforts to control vaccine exports, amid dose shortages in the bloc. People had been ""blindsided"" by the row but insisted the EU's move was ""not an act of hostility,"" Mr Martin said. The UK says it is confident the EU will not block vaccines entering the UK. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen had assured Prime Minister Boris Johnson that ""there will be no disruption of contracts that we have with any producer in the EU"". Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, she added that she was ""very pleased"" the EU stepped back from its plan to implement the border checks. ""What I want to do now is work with fellow trade ministers to keep these supplies open and to move away from the idea of vaccine nationalism and protectionism which we know simply harms our global health efforts and harms our global economy."" EU 'fiasco' on NI heaps pressure on Commission What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? WHO criticises EU over vaccine export controls Speaking on the same show, Taoiseach Mr Martin said he first became aware of the EU's plan to put checks on the Irish border when the commission issued a public announcement. He said he immediately contacted European Commission President Mrs von der Leyen and ""articulated the very serious implications the move would have"" - and that Mrs von der Leyen ""took on board"" his concerns and ""thankfully"" the commission pulled back from its stance. Mr Martin added that the commission should have spoken to him first and said there were ""a lot of lessons to be learnt"" from the incident and that issues with the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland needed ""fine-tuning"". Acknowledging the tension between the EU and vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca was ""terrible"", he stressed the need for all sides to ""calm down"" and ""dial down the tone"". However he also noted that there had been ""shock"" in the EU when ""it emerged the original commitment [by AstraZeneca] of delivering 100 million doses wasn't going to be realised."" Earlier this week AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said the contract with the EU obliged the company to make its ""best effort"" to meet EU demand, without compelling the company to stick to a specific timetable. This comes as the World Health Organizationsaid ""vaccine nationalism""could prolong the pandemic and further widen global inequality. Ms Truss told the BBC: ""This is a global problem that needs global solutions and what we want to do is help other countries, including the developing world get the vaccines they need to make sure the whole world is vaccinated."" The EU's threat of border controls came amid a deepening dispute over delays to the production and distribution of Covid vaccines across the continent. The bloc is introducing a so-called transparency mechanism, which gives countries in the bloc powers to deny authorisation for vaccine exports if the company making them has not honoured existing contracts with the EU. The EU's attempt to apply measures to the Irish border was widely-condemned, and the heads of the UK- and Europe-wide industry bodies have warned against export bans. Former prime minister Tony Blair said the EU's threat was ""a very foolish thing to do and fortunately they withdrew it very quickly"". ""Companies are working as fast as they can to protect everyone. Export restrictions do no one any good and we urge governments to avoid them,"" Richard Torbett, head of the UK's Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, and Nathalie Moll, head of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations,wrote in the Observer.,external The EU has insisted that its controls are a temporary scheme, and not an export ban. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? On Saturday Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the government expected vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and AstraZeneca to be supplied to the UK but said it would work with the EU to ""make sure that their own problems can be tackled"". ""Our first priority is vaccinating people in the United Kingdom, but we also want to work with our friends and neighbours in the European Union in order to help them as well,"" he said. By Naomi Grimley health correspondent Like many rich countries, the UK has bought more vaccines than it needs in order to hedge its bets in an emergency. That's led some to argue that the UK should consider donating some - either to a neighbouring EU country such as Ireland which does not have such a plentiful supply or to poorer countries which currently have none. But ministers say it's too early to make that call yet. The World Health Organization wants richer countries to commit to donating their excess once they have enough to vaccinate their most vulnerable. Norway has said it will do this and India has already given some vaccines to Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh in what's been called ""vaccine diplomacy"". The UK government said a further 587 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus as of Sunday, taking the total deaths by that measure to 106,158. There have been a further 21,088 lab-confirmed cases of the virus in the UK, while 8,977,329 have received their first dose of a vaccine and 491,053 have been given the second dose.

Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said the UK government should renegotiate the ""very damaging"" new quotas with the EU. The UK government said it would ""engage intensively"" with the sector. Tata Steel UK employs about 8,000 people in the UK, the majority of which are in Wales with about half based at Port Talbot. Stephen Kinnock's Aberavon constituency includes the Port Talbot steelworks In the year to March 2020 - before the coronavirus pandemic hit demand for steel - Tata Steel UK made a pre-tax loss of Â£654m and there have beenongoing calls for financial supportfrom the UK Government. But Welsh Labour MPs told BBC Politics Wales the latest challenge for the sector could be the changes agreed in thepost-Brexit trade dealat the end of last year. ""Boris Johnson has said that the Brexit deal is no quotas and no tariffs - that is just not true,"" said Mr Kinnock, whose constituency includes the Port Talbot steelworks. In the year to March 2020, Tata Steel UK made a pre-tax loss of Â£654m ""The steel industry is going to be subjected to 25% tariffs on every tonne of steel that we export to the European Union above a certain quota. ""What's even worse is steel going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be included in the calculation of that quota, so we really have got a very troubling situation that could have a very damaging impact on our steel industry. ""We need the government to get back to the negotiating table with the European Union. A quick guide to the Brexit deal What happens now a deal's been done? Brexit: Seven things changing on 1 January ""The big question is, does the European Union have any incentive to get back to the negotiating table now the deal is done. Have we lost all of our leverage?"" There are now separate quotas for UK steel trading with the EU for 29 different steel products. UK Steel, which represents manufacturers, said some of those quotas were likely to run out in the first quarter of this year. ""The official expiry date of the EU safeguard measure [quotas] is June 2021, but it is looking increasingly likely that they will be extended beyond this period - perhaps for another three years,"" a spokeswoman said. ""If the UK can't get an exemption, or its quotas expanded, it will cause huge problems for the UK steel sector."" She said Brexit was also impacting how much steel the UK can expect to export due to customs delays, a shortage of hauliers and concern from EU customers. Mr Kinnock has urged the UK government toprovide supportto the industry. Steel analyst Kathryn Ringwald Wildman said more state aid could have been given, even while a member of the EU, while the steel industry is among many sectors asking for help following the coronavirus pandemic. ""One is inclined to think that because [the UK government] expressed such concern over the ability to use state aid that they intend to use state aid,"" she said. ""However, in the past they haven't used it to the maximum, even within European regulations. Tata Steel 'needs permanent support' to stay in UK 'Resist speculation' over steel plant's future ""Within European regulations, some countries were able to give their steel industries much more support with relation to energy costs than the UK government chose to do."" She said the UK government would be weighing up whether steel remains a ""strategic industry"". ""Many would say yes - we have a strong manufacturing sector [so] you need a thriving steel industry [however] now we have competing voices for support. ""Industries like hospitality, leisure and tourism, retail, have all been devastated by the pandemic and seeking help to recover. The government has to decide what are their priorities, where is the economy going to be best served in the long-term."" Tata Steel runs the UK's largest steel works in Port Talbot Prof Kent Matthews, economist at Cardiff University, said any steel subsidy would need a time limit. ""The main challenges are in terms of value for money,"" he said. ""The Treasury's argument will be they don't want to keep throwing money at something that's not going to produce a return at all. ""The long-term effect for steel coming out of Brexit, if nothing changes, is that it will be absolutely destroyed by world markets. So the arguments for subsidising are ones of giving it breathing space to be able to up their game, invest in the right technologies and move up the value chain. ""There are arguments for permanent subsidies for certain industries but steel is not one of them because it's a tradable good, it's something that can be got from outside."" Tata Steel is a major employer in Port Talbot The UK government said it was in continuing discussions about increasing quotas for exports into the EU single market. A UK government spokesman said: ""We have worked successfully with the European Commission to secure tariff rate quotas for some steel products to enable UK companies to trade tariff-free into the EU. ""These tariff-free allocations came into operation on 1 January 2021. ""The government will continue to engage intensively with the sector to understand their concerns and requirements.""

"Will Ursula von der Leyen come under more pressure to resign? ""Misjudgement"", ""mismanagement"", ""blunder""... and words that were far, far stronger. That's what I've been hearing from EU insiders about the European Commission's initial decision on Friday to suspend part of the Brexit deal agreement on Northern Ireland, in its rush to impose restrictions on Covid vaccines, or components of vaccines, exported from the bloc. The EU vaccine roll-out is in very clear trouble. EU countries are openly desperate to get hold of the jabs they have been promised to put in voters' arms. But representatives of member states I've spoken to say they were blindsided by the European Commission move. ""We certainly weren't asked about it,"" one EU diplomat told me. ""If we had been, we would have shouted loudly that it was a terrible idea. The decision was taken, in a hurry, at the top or close to the top [of the Commission]."" Why is EU's vaccine rollout so slow? Even more astonishing, considering the huge sensitivity of the Northern Ireland chapter of the Brexit deal, EU member Ireland wasn't consulted, or even informed, of the Commission's intention. Nor were those in the Commission with intimate knowledge of the post-Brexit Northern Ireland arrangement: former EU lead negotiator Michel Barnier and colleagues. They tried to intervene on Friday evening, urging a swift U-turn on the policy, even as Boris Johnson and the Irish Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin held separate conversations with the European Commission president. Remember just how long and difficult the Brexit negotiations were in reaching an agreement on Northern Ireland? Think about how often the EU lectured the UK government about the importance of respecting the detail of the arrangement; how peace in Northern Ireland was at stake. Yet the impression the European Commission gave on Friday - however incorrect or unintended, which is what it insists - is that those concerns could be thrown aside in a heartbeat. What's happening to the EU vaccine scheme? EU national diplomats, whom I've spoken to over the years as part of my Brexit coverage, appeared frustrated and dismayed. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin. Ireland wasn't pre-informed of the Commission decision ""Over and again, I've repeated to the press the importance and the fragility of peace in Northern Ireland and how we in the EU appreciated and respected the importance of getting the Brexit deal right,"" a representative from a prominent EU country told me. ""And what do we look like now? This was a disaster. It plays into the hands of EU-haters and UK opponents of the Brexit deal."" Another diplomat questioned whether the team around Commission President Ursula von der Leyen actually understood the Irish protocol in the Brexit deal. ""They came in right at the end. Most of the deal was agreed under [former Commission President Jean-Claude] Juncker. Maybe they just don't get it?"" The European Commission back-tracked late on Friday (although it has reserved the right to revisit the issue, it says, if it sees EU-manufactured vaccines entering the rest of the UK via Northern Ireland). The U-turn was publicly welcomed by MicheÃ¡l Martin. But take a look at political and press reaction in Ireland, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and you'll see a lot of damage had already been done. But Friday's ""Northern Ireland fiasco"" as I've heard it referred to, doesn't feature very prominently in the media elsewhere in Europe. The focus remains on the absence of vaccines, promised by the European Commission, which agreed contracts with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of all its members. There appears to be general dismay at the EU's vaccination programme Here again EU politicians seem increasingly irritated with what is now perceived as incompetence at the highest levels of the Commission. Friday's mess-up over the Brexit Northern Ireland agreement is being described to me as ""a symptom"" of mismanagement of the wider vaccine programme. ""It's like watching a car crash in slow motion,"" one irate EU diplomat told me. ""President von der Leyen is a medical doctor. She wanted to take over the mass purchase of vaccines for all the EU - as a high-profile exercise. Normally health issues are dealt with nationally. This hasn't been a great advertisement for handing over powers to Brussels. I think that's the lesson member states will take away from this."" It should be said that smaller, less well-off EU countries are still relieved the Commission represented them on the vaccine market, otherwise, they say, they'd have found themselves ""at the back of the queue"". There is definite EU-wide anger too at pharmaceutical companies, which have delayed vaccine deliveries. Especially AstraZeneca, which is understood to have promised the EU 100 million doses before the end of March. It has now said it can supply only a fraction of that amount. But by now - when EU governments look at how far ahead the UK and the US are compared to the EU in their vaccine roll-outs - blame is also being directed at Ursula von der Leyen. Some in the EU say privately she may come under pressure to resign. The Commission stands accused of not investing enough in expanding vaccine production sites. And Bavarian leader Markus Soeder - a favourite to replace Angela Merkel as German chancellor - is far from alone when he lashed out at the Commission last week for being ""too late"" in concluding vaccine contracts. AstraZeneca's argument (rejected by the EU) as to why it's honouring its agreement with the UK first, is, it says, because the Johnson government signed on the dotted line three months before Brussels. So now what? The priority for people across the EU is protecting themselves and their families. They were promised a vaccine action-plan they're not - or not yet - getting. Which, in turn, is having an impact on domestic politics. Take the Netherlands or Germany, for example, as they head towards parliamentary elections. Vaccine appointments have been cancelled in France, Portugal, Spain and beyond because of dwindling supplies. The European Commission is under pressure to take effective action. But of late it has given the impression of firing hastily in all directions - threatening AstraZeneca with legal proceedings; demanding some of the company's vaccines be diverted to the EU from production centres in the UK; risking alienating allies in Japan, Canada and Australia with new authorisation requirements for vaccine exports from the EU; and dragging the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland into the fray. None of this, so far, has resulted in reducing the EU's vaccine shortfall. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared Of course, not all aspects of the current vaccine debacle are the fault of the Commission. Aside from pharmaceutical company delays, the EMA, the EU's medical regulator, has been slow to approve the use of individual vaccines. Some EU countries have proved more efficient than others with their national roll-out programmes. AstraZeneca and others have promised far larger vaccine supplies for the EU come the spring. Perhaps the EU mood towards the Commission may then soften, but not now, while the health threat from Covid looms large. Covid: Why is EUâs vaccine rollout so slow?
