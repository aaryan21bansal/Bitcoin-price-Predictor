"The Secretary General warned the world had been ""lucky"" to avoid global nuclear war The world is one misstep from devastating nuclear war and in peril not seen since the Cold War, the UN Secretary General has warned. ""We have been extraordinarily lucky so far,"" Antonio Guterres said. Amid rising global tensions, ""humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation"", he added. His remarks came at the opening of a conference for countries signed up to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The 1968 deal was introduced after the Cuban missile crisis, an event often portrayed as the closest the world ever came to nuclear war. The treaty was designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to more countries, and to pursue the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament. Almost every nation on Earth is signed up to the NPT, including the five biggest nuclear powers. But among the handful of states never to sign are four known or suspected to have nuclear weapons: India, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan. Secretary General Guterres said the ""luck"" the world had enjoyed so far in avoiding a nuclear catastrophe may not last - and urged the world to renew a push towards eliminating all such weapons. ""Luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict,"" he said. And he warned that those international tensions were ""reaching new highs"" - pointing specifically to the invasion of Ukraine, tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East as examples. Russia was widely accused of escalating tensions when days after his invasion of Ukraine in February, President Vladimir Putin put Russia's substantial nuclear forces on high alert. He also threatened anyone standing in Russia's way with consequences ""you have never seen in your history"". Russia's nuclear strategy includes the use of nuclear weapons if the state's existence is under threat. On Monday, Mr Putin wrote to the same non-proliferation conference Mr Guterres opened, declaring that ""there can be no winners in a nuclear war and it should never be unleashed"". But Russia still found itself criticised at the NPT conference. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned what he called Russia's sabre-rattling - and pointed out that Ukraine had handed over its Soviet-era nuclear weapons in 1994, after receiving assurances of its future security from Russia and others. ""What message does this send to any country around the world that may think that it needs to have nuclear weapons - to protect, to defend, to deter aggression against its sovereignty and independence?"" he asked. ""The worst possible message"". Today, some 13,000 nuclear weapons are thought to remain in service in the arsenals of the nine nuclear-armed states - far lower than the estimated 60,000 stockpiled during the peak of the mid-1980s.

"The street trader was not one to go looking for trouble, his wife insisted The wife of a Nigerian street trader who was killed in Italy has told the BBC she is seeking justice following his ""painful death"". Alika Ogorchukwu, 39, was reportedly selling handkerchiefs in the seaside town of Civitanova Marche on Friday when he was chased and beaten to death. A 32-year-old Italian has been arrested on suspicion of murder and robbery. A video circulating online shows a man on top of Ogorchukwu, punching him with his bare hands. None of those who witnessed the broad daylight attack appeared to intervene. ""This is a form of wickedness I don't know,"" Ogorchukwu's wife, Charity Oriachi, told the BBC's Focus on Africa. Ms Oriachi said she had received help in coming to terms with her husband's death but was tired of ""talk"". Now, she was only interested in justice, she insisted. Her family had lived in Italy for a long time, she said, stressing that her husband had never sought any trouble. Africa Today podcast: Anger in Italy over Nigerian man's killing The killing has sparked outrage in the local community, including Nigerians, who took to the streets over the weekend and are planning another demonstration soon. The Nigerian government has asked Italian authorities to quickly ""bring the perpetrator of the heinous act"" to justice. The suspect - a white man named as Filippo Claudio Giuseppe Ferlazzo - has been ordered to remain in jail as the investigation continues. His defence lawyer told the media the suspect had said he was sorry and that there was ""no racial element"" involved. A police investigator said Ogorchukwu was attacked after the trader's ""insistent"" requests to the suspect and his partner for spare change. The partner, identified as Elena D, told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Ogorchukwu had touched her arm, but that did not bother her. Ms Oriachi now wants to see the suspect ""face to face"", to understand why he killed her husband, the family's lawyer told the Associated Press.

"Catastrophic climate change outcomes, including human extinction, are not being taken seriously enough by scientists, a new study says. The authors say that the consequences of more extreme warming - still on the cards if no action is taken - are ""dangerously underexplored"". They argue that the world needs to start preparing for the possibility of what they term the ""climate endgame"". They want UN scientists to investigate the risk of catastrophic change. 40C heatwave has to be climate change - scientists Weather forecasters abused over heatwave coverage The PR and ad firms refusing fossil fuel clients Meet the people fighting climate doomism According to thisnew analysis,external, the closest attempts to directly understand or address how climate change could lead to global catastrophe have come from popular science books such asThe Uninhabitable Earthand not from mainstream science research. In recent years climate scientists have more often studied the impacts of warming of around 1.5C or 2C above the temperatures seen in 1850, before the onset of global industrialisation. These studies show that keeping temperatures close to these levels this century will place heavy burdens on global economies, but they do not envisage the end of humanity. Researchers have focussed on these lower temperature scenarios for good reasons. The Paris climate agreement saw almost every nation on Earth sign up to a deal that aims to keep the rise in global temperatures ""well below"" 2C this century, and make efforts to keep it under 1.5C. People flee from flood waters in Pakistan So it's natural that governments would want their scientists to show exactly what this type of change would mean. But this new paper says that not enough attention has been given to more extreme outcomes of climate change. ""I think it's sane risk management to think about the plausible worst-case scenarios and we do it when it comes to every other situation, we should definitely do when it comes to the fate of the planet and species,"" said lead author Dr Luke Kemp from the University of Cambridge. The researchers found that estimates of the impacts of a temperature rise of 3C are under-represented compared to their likelihood. Using climate models, the report shows that in this type of scenario, by 2070 around 2 billion people living in some of the most politically fragile areas of the world would be enduring annual average temperatures of 29C. ""Average annual temperatures of 29C currently affect around 30 million people in the Sahara and Gulf Coast,"" said co-author Chi Xu of Nanjing University. ""By 2070, these temperatures and the social and political consequences will directly affect two nuclear powers, and seven maximum containment laboratories housing the most dangerous pathogens. There is serious potential for disastrous knock-on effects,"" he said. The future impacts of extreme climate change have not been fully explored The report says that it is not just high temperatures that are the problem, it's the compound and knock-on effects such as food or financial crises, conflicts or disease outbreaks that have the potential for disaster. There should also be more focus on identifying potential tipping points, where increasing warmth triggers another natural event that drives temperatures up even more - such as methane emissions from melting permafrost or forests that start emitting carbon rather than soaking it up. To properly assess all these risks, the authors are calling on theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,externalto carry out a special report on catastrophic climate change. The researchers said that seriously studying the consequences of worst-case scenarios was vital, even though it might scare people. They said that carrying out this research would allow scientists to consider emergency options such as climate engineering which might involve pumping coolants into the atmosphere. Researchers would be able to carry out a risk analysis for these drastic interventions compared to the worst effects of climate change.  Focussing on the worst-case scenarios could also help inform the public - and might actually make the outcomes less likely. ""Understanding these plausible but grim scenarios is something that could galvanise both political and civil opinion,"" said Dr Kemp. ""We saw this when it came to the identification of the idea of a nuclear winter that helped compel a lot of the public efforts as well as the disarmament movement throughout the 1970s and '80s."" ""And I hope if we can find similar concrete and clear mechanisms when it comes to thinking about climate change, that it also has a similar effect."" The plea for serious study of more extreme scenarios will chime with many younger climate activists, who say they are often not addressed for fear of frightening people into inaction. ""It is vital that we have research into all areas of climate change, including the scary reality of catastrophic events,"" said Laura Young, a 25-year-old climate activist. ""This is because without the full truth, and all of the potential impacts, we won't make the informed choices we need, and we won't be driving climate action with enough pressure. ""For years climate change has been hidden, misinformed, and avoided and this has to stop now. Especially for the younger generations who are going to be left to deal with the consequences of years of pushing the Earth to its limits."" Thestudy,externalhas been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. BBC News Climate and Science reporter Ella Hambly contributed to this report.

"Ekin-Su and Davide, both 27, will share the Â£50,000 prize money Ekin-Su and Davide have been crowned the winners of Love Island, winning the show's Â£50,000 prize money. The pair, both 27, said they ""couldn't believe"" they'd won, describing their time on the show as a ""dream"". Ekin-Su Culculoglu is an actress and model from Essex, while business owner Davide Sanclimenti is from Rome, Italy. During an ad break, ITV2 played a trailer for Big Brother, confirming rumours that the reality show will be revived on the channel in 2023. Presenter Laura Whitmore announced Ekin-Su and Davide as the winners of the hugely successful ITV2 dating show during Monday's live final - which had an average of 2.89m viewers. The couple will share the Â£50,000 prize money. A previous show tradition, which gave one member of the couple the chance to ""steal"" the jackpot for themselves, was dropped this year. Speaking to Whitmore earlier in the episode, Davide said it was ""100% a dream to be here with her [Ekin-Su]"". Ekin-Su said: ""It feels so surreal, finding the man of your dreams and just growing, I'm lost for words."" She described her relationship with Davide as ""absolutely bonkers, crazy, romantic and fun"". Gemma and Luca were named the runners-up, while the the third-placed couple was Indiyah and Dami. Tasha,the show's first deaf contestant,and her partner Andrew, finished in fourth place. Laura Whitmore hosted the final live at the villa in Mallorca Reflecting on their journey, Ekin-Su said: ""There was an instant spark, a genuine butterfly feeling, and there was a caring and intelligent side I was really attracted to."" Davide, who was originally coupled up with Gemma, added: ""As soon as I saw her [Ekin-Su], my head turned, I was like 'wow'. There was initial attraction.""

And in an article published ahead of the final,Lucy Thackray of the Independent described,externalEkin-Su as ""the greatest Love Island contestant of all time"". Earlier in Monday's final episode, the islanders were seen taking part in a salsa lesson with professional dancers, who taught them some Latin moves ahead of the Love Island summer ball. At the ball, the couples read letters to one another about their journey throughout the series, before showing off their dance routines and finally jumping into the Mallorca villa's swimming pool. This series of the ITV2 dating show has been popular with viewers, with most episodes attracting an audience of more than three million. Also on Monday, ITV confirmed that reality show Big Brother, which has previously aired on Channel 4 and Channel 5, will be rebooted for a new series in 2023.

"The tortoise was spotted on the track heading away from Norwich A giant tortoise brought trains to a halt when it was found on a railway track. The injured animal was spotted near Harling Road, north east of Thetford, Norfolk, on the Cambridge-bound line at about 12:40 BST. Greater Anglia said three services were affected by the tortoise's presence. Swallow Aquatics in East Harling said the tortoise, Clyde, had gone missing on Sunday and had now been taken to a vets, as it was hit by a train. The pet shop said the 2.5ft (76cm) long tortoise had a hole in its shell after the collision. Diane Akers, a passenger on the 11:22 train from Ely to Norwich, photographed the tortoise on the opposite track when her train came to a halt. ""It was very large and filled a substantial area of the track,"" she said. ""I tried to tweet Greater Anglia, but I'm not sure the message got through. ""When we got to Norwich station I told staff in the office there, and the chap looked at me as if I was mad - and then a police officer came along and said he'd seen my tweet."" Staff from Network Rail rescued the tortoise and took it to a vet BBC reporter Nic Rigby was a passenger on another train, from Cambridge to Norwich, that ground to a halt. ""The train's been delayed due a giant African tortoise on the line,"" he said. ""The train inspector announced that he's having trouble believing it - but it's true."" A Greater Anglia spokeswoman said: ""We are sorry for the disruption caused to customers between Norwich and Cambridge this afternoon.

"British Airways has suspended ticket sales for short-haul flights from Heathrow Airport for a further week until 15 August. On Monday, the airline said it had stopped selling the tickets until 8 August, but now it has gone a step further. The move is due to the cap on daily passenger numbers that the UK's biggest airport has imposed over the summer. The suspension will affect BA's flights to domestic and European destinations. Thousands of air travellers have been hit by disruption in recent months, including last-minute cancellations, which have been caused largely by staff shortages. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have found it difficult to recruit enough staff as demand for holidays has returned. Heathrow Airport has struggled to cope with the rebound in air travel and problems with its baggage handling systems have also led to passengers seeing huge delays in reclaiming their luggage. Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? Don't expect great summer experience, warns airport boss Going on a summer holiday? Become a BBC Travel Watcher Last month,Heathrow told airlines to stop selling summer tickets, as it said it would limit the number of passengers departing each day to 100,000 - 4,000 fewer than previously scheduled. The cap on numbers is set to remain in place until 11 September. As BA is the largest airline at Heathrow it is affected by the limit more than other carriers. It is understood the airline was close to reaching the number of passengers it could carry under the current limit. In a statement, BA said it had taken ""pre-emptive action to reduce our schedule this summer to give customers certainty about their travel plans"". ""When Heathrow introduced its passenger cap, we took a small number of additional flights from our schedule and to continue to comply with the cap, we've been taking responsible action by limiting sales or all the available fares on some of our Heathrow services to ensure more seats are available to rebook customers,"" the company said. The company added that it would ""continue to manage bookings to be within the Heathrow imposed cap"". BA could limit or suspend sales again while Heathrow's cap is in place. The impact will be mainly on short-haul flights, though long-haul routes could sometimes be affected. Aviation consultant John Strickland said BA's short-haul flights over the next week would effectively be full, leaving ""almost no room to manoeuvre to rebook passengers"" in the case of unforeseen problems such as bad weather. ""It therefore has little choice but to take seats off sale to protect for this eventuality and sacrifice last minute high price ticket sales,"" he said. Mr Strickland added that most last-minute sales go to business travellers, for which volume is lowest in August, ""so the sacrifice is minimal"". Consumer group Which? said the move by BA would reduce customer choice and lead to ""significant price increases"". On Tuesday evening, a direct flight from Heathrow to Frankfurt this coming Saturday cost a minimum of Â£617, compared with Â£243 in two weeks time, according to flight comparison website Skyscanner. Stopping selling some tickets from Britain's biggest airport in the lucrative summer peak, when demand is strong, is not something you'd normally expect an airline to be doing. But this isn't a normal summer. The decision follows Heathrow's extraordinary decision to limit traffic to a level the system can cope with, given ongoing resourcing challenges. It's understood British Airways was close to reaching the number of passengers it could carry under that cap this week. The decision is meant to prevent last-minute bookings. And it should leave some leeway in the system for where rebooking is needed. This isn't about cancellations - existing bookings aren't affected. But it will limit passengers' last-minute options at a time when capacity has been squeezed and many prices have risen. And it might not be the end - BA has made it clear that while Heathrow's passenger cap is in place, it may have to pause sales again. BA has cut nearly 30,000 flightsfrom its April-to-October schedule in response to staffing problems. On Friday, BA owner IAG reported itsfirst profit since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, despite facing what it called a ""challenging"" environment at Heathrow Airport. The company said the problems at Heathrow had forced British Airways to limit its capacity to 69.1% of pre-pandemic levels between April and June, and this was expected to increase to about 75% between July and October. A row broke out last weekbetween Ryanair and Heathrow, after the airline said airports had not recruited enough staff to cater for the rebound in travellers, saying they ""had one job to do"". But Heathrow hit back at the criticism, describing it as ""bizarre"". ""Airports don't provide ground handling, that's provided by the airlines themselves. So this is like accusing us of not having enough pilots,"" said Heathrow's chief executive John Holland-Kaye. Virgin Atlantic also criticised the airport, claiming it was responsible for failures which were contributing to the chaos. Emirates Airlines had initially rejected Heathrow's request to cut flight capacity but lateragreed to cap salesfollowing talks between the two companies. Last month the Competition and Markets Authority and Civil Aviation Authority issued a joint letter to carriers raising concerns that some airlines may not be doing everything they could to avoid harmful practices, including selling more tickets for flights than they could reasonably expect to supply. Airports outside the UK have also faced issues. On Tuesday Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, which has faced staff shortages, said it would continue to limit passengers in September and October to ensure safety and a reliable service.

"Heathrow has seen widespread disruption due to staffing shortages, with airlines cancelling thousands of flights British Airways owner IAG has swung back to profit for the first time since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, despite facing a ""challenging"" environment at Heathrow Airport. The company said it had seen a significant increase in the number of flights and passengers it handled. Operating profit for the second quarter hit Â£245m, compared with a loss of Â£809m in the same period last year. But IAG also issued a warning about the state of the industry. Airlines and airports have faced significant disruption this year due to widespread worker shortages and industrial action. ""Our industry continues to face historic challenges due to the unprecedented scaling up in operations, especially in the UK where the operational challenges of Heathrow airport have been acute,"" said Luis Gallego, IAG's chief executive. Heathrow hits back at 'bizarre' Ryanair criticism Heathrow tells airlines not to sell summer tickets British Airways to cancel 10,300 more flights The company - which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus - said that these issues at Heathrow had forced British Airways to limit its capacity to 69.1% of pre-pandemic levels between April and June. ""We will continue working with the industry to address these issues as aviation emerges from its biggest crisis ever,"" Mr Gallego said. Between July and October, British Airways will ramp up its capacity to about 75%, IAG said. It was the company's Iberia and Vueling brands that performed most strongly over the past three months, elevated by a robust demand for domestic flights within Spain, and routes to Latin America. Last month, both were at higher levels than they were in 2019. Mr Gallego said he hoped the airline would return to annual profitability this year, with demand showing no sign of weakening. ""In the second quarter we returned to profit for the first time since the start of the pandemic following a strong recovery in demand across all our airlines,"" he said. ""This result supports our outlook for a full year operating profit."" ""Our performance reflected a significant increase in capacity, load factor and yield compared to the first quarter."" IAG's share price climbed by 3.3% in early trading on Friday morning. 'Bizarre' British Airways has been forced to cancel nearly 30,000 flights this summer as it struggles with staff shortages and rebounding demand for air travel following the lifting of Covid restrictions. This has been compounded by a lack of ground handling crew and ticketing agents at airports, many of whom were laid off during the pandemic and have not yet been replaced. A row broke out this week between Ryanair and Heathrow Airport, with the airline saying airports had not recruited enough staff to cater for the rebound in travellers, saying they ""had one job to do to"" But Heathrow hit back at the criticism, labelling it as ""bizarre"".

The trade minister was knocked out of the race after finishing third behind Ms Truss and ex-chancellor Rishi Sunak. Ms Mordaunt gave Ms Truss her support, calling her the ""hope candidate"", as she appeared at a leadership hustings. Earlier in the contest some of Ms Mordaunt's allies accused Ms Truss's team of a dirty-tricks campaign. During a second hustings event - held in Exeter - Mr Sunak once again attacked Ms Truss's tax plans and promised he would cut taxes responsibly. The pair are vying to win over Conservative Party members, whose votes will determine which of them will become the next Tory leader and British prime minister. The party's roughly 160,000 members started receiving ballot papers on Monday, with the result due on 5 September, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson will leave office. Tax policy has become the main battleground, while both have announced a string of competing policy proposals to woo Conservative members. This video can not be played Watch: I could be sipping pina coladas right now, says former leadership hopeful Penny Mordaunt Tory rivals get personal in fierce clash over tax How the new PM will be picked Truss v Sunak fact-checked Ms Mordaunt is the latest cabinet minister to back Ms Truss, joining Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi in endorsing her candidacy. Meanwhile, Mr Sunak has received the support of senior Tory MPs, including former cabinet ministers Liam Fox and Damian Green. Ms Mordaunt said at the event - along the south coast from her own Portsmouth North constituency - choosing between the two candidates was hard but it was ""too important"" to ""leave this to chance"". She said: ""At the start of this final phase of this contest, I didn't know the answer to those questions, but I've seen enough to know who the person I'm going to put my faith in is - and that is Liz Truss."" In her opening speech, Ms Truss said Ms Mordaunt was ""a great patriot and I'm proud to call her my friend"". The warm words marked a change in tone, after allies of Ms Mordaunt accused Ms Truss's team of a dirty-tricks campaign to block her from reaching the final stage of the leadership contest. Mr Sunak had his own Tory big hitter to introduce him on stage - in the form of Mr Fox, the former international trade secretary who has himself stood twice to be party leader. Mr Fox said Mr Sunak had the ability to win over swing voters and stop a Labour-SNP coalition ""tearing our nation apart"". ""We will need a leader and a prime minister, with the right policies, yes, but with character, with courage, with experience and with intellect, and the downright decency to swing those voters behind us and get them to vote Conservative,"" Mr Fox said. ""I believe that leader, that prime minister, will be Rishi Sunak."" He said character was shown by Mr Sunak's performance during the pandemic, making ""difficult but vital decisions"", including the introduction of the furlough scheme. This video can not be played Watch: I ripped up the rule book as chancellor, Rishi Sunak tells audience at second leadership hustings When Mr Sunak spoke, he said he would focus on three priorities if he became PM - ""restore trust"", ""rebuild the economy"" and ""reunite our country"". He once again attacked Ms Truss's plans to slash taxes and reiterated his belief that he had not taken the ""easy path"" in setting out his vision for the country. He said he would ""cut taxes"", outlining his plan to cut the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 16% by the end of the next parliament. But he added: ""We are going to do that responsibly. We are not going to ask our kids to pay for it. We are going to do it by being tough on public spending, reforming public services, and by growing the economy."" In a hustings covering a wide range of topics,Ms Truss: suggested she would not repeal the fox hunting ban in England and Wales, warning it could ""make the situation worse"" for country sport enthusiasts said it wasbest to ""ignore"" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, calling her an ""attention seeker"", when asked what she would do to avoid the break-up of the UK said she would be a food critic if she wasn't a politician AndMr Sunak: was applauded by Tory members after saying Ms Truss's policies on corporate taxation were ""exactly the failed Treasury orthodoxy of the last 10 years"" insisted he was loyal to Boris Johnson, but resigned as chancellor because the PM's government was on the ""wrong side"" of serious ethical questions on what he would do if not a politician, said: ""If I could run Southampton Football Club, I'd be a very happy man."" Following the hustings, Ms Truss announced a ""war on Whitehall waste"" in her campaign's latest policy offering. She claimed she would save taxpayers Â£11bn by cutting civil service time off, ending national pay deals and scrapping jobs aimed at increasing inclusion and diversity in the public sector. Her campaign said most of the savings would come from tailoring pay to living costs where civil servants work. But a source close to Mr Sunak's campaign said Ms Truss ""seems to have confused the wage bill of the civil service with front line public sector workers"". ""This means stretching the NHS to breaking point and fewer police fighting crime as we head into a general election."" Alex Thomas, from the Institute for Government think tank, said the Â£8.8bn proposed savings from regional pay bargaining would not come from Whitehall. ""The whole Civil Service pay bill is only about Â£9bn,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""You're not going to reduce the Civil Service pay bill to Â£200m unless you pretty radically reshape the state. ""I know she wants to be radical but possibly not quite that much, so it's going to come from the wider public sector, it's going to come from nurses and teachers and local authorities. ""This is not a war on Whitehall, it's more like war on Workington,"" he added. Unions and Labour also warned Ms Truss that her proposals would face resistance if she were to implement them. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, said Ms Truss's pledge to cut regional pay for civil servants was ""astounding"", calling her plans ""recycled failed policies"". Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner condemned her plans, saying: ""This wannabe prime minister is stuck in the past, fighting old battles, and promising a race to the bottom on public sector workers' pay and rights."" Ms Truss has alsobeen endorsed by West Midlands mayor Andy Street, who said she had a ""bold, optimistic vision"" for the country. A HANDBOOK TO LIFE:What wisdom would you impart to your children?

"Rishi Sunak has said he will cut the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 16% by the end of the next parliament if he becomes prime minister. This would amount to a 20% tax reduction, he said - the ""largest cut to income tax in 30 years"". But supporters of his Tory rival Liz Truss have accused the ex-chancellor of a U-turn on the issue and said that people cannot wait for tax cuts. Conservative Party members will start receiving ballot papers later. The winner of the leadership contest will be announced on 5 September, with Mr Sunak and Ms Truss competing for the No 10 job. Mr Sunak said the policy is part of his ""radical"" tax vision, but it builds on his previously-announced 1p cut to income tax in April 2024. He said he will take a further 3p off by the end of the next parliament, which could be as late as December 2029. Supporters of Ms Truss said she would ""cut taxes in seven weeks, not seven years"", as she has pledged to scrap April's National Insurance rise, cancel a planned corporation tax rise and temporarilysuspend green levies on energy bills. In announcing his latest tax policy, Mr Sunak emphasised the need to control inflation before cutting taxes, adding that doing so now would make the situation worse and ""endanger people's mortgages"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I want to make sure that we can pay for it, I want to make sure that we can do it alongside growing the economy."" He said that his income tax cut pledge was ""entirely consistent"" with his campaign so far and denied that his plan was aimed solely to boost support for his campaign. ""I don't think embarking on a spree of excessive borrowing at a time when inflation and interest rates are already on the rise would be wise,"" Mr Sunak said. Taxes have dominated the Tory leadership race, with the candidates clashing during the debates. Last week, Ms Trusssaid tax rises brought in by Mr Sunakwould lead to a recession - but Mr Sunak told the foreign secretary that her tax cut plan would ""tip millions of people into misery"" and cost the Conservatives the next election. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke, who worked closely with Mr Sunak but is now backing Ms Truss, said: ""We cannot afford to wait to help families, they need support now. Liz will cut taxes in seven weeks, not seven years."" A source in Truss' camp said: ""It's welcome that Rishi has performed another U-turn on cutting tax, it's only a shame he didn't do this as chancellor when he repeatedly raised taxes. ""He has also made it conditional on getting growth first - knowing full well that his corporation tax rises are contractionary."" In addition to taxation, the candidates' records in government have been under scrutiny. Answering claims that he was ""backstabber"", a reference to his resignation from Boris Johnson's cabinet, Mr Sunak told the Today programme that there was a risk of fellow MPs looking back at the last few months with ""rose-tinted glasses"". He said that the government had ""found itself on the wrong side of a very serious ethical issue"", adding that more than 60 MPs had resigned. ""After a lot of deliberation and months of standing by the PM, I was one of them,"" he said, also citing a difference of opinions on the economy. As ballot papers start dropping through the letterboxes of Conservative members, it's widely accepted that Liz Truss is ahead. She had some significant, high-profile endorsements at the weekend to add to her sense of momentum. But Rishi Sunak's team are adamant they are still in the race. Tory MPs I've spoken to in recent days highlight that many members are still making their minds up. Mr Sunak has been on the back foot when it comes to tax policy. His pitch for caution has been too pessimistic, his critics say. He will be hoping that his pledge today will do something to address that. He wants to be seen as an instinctive low tax Tory - who will reduce them when it's safe to do so. But he is facing criticism from some who think he is changing plans to reflect the debate. He was criticised last week for announcing cuts to VAT on fuel - which he didn't introduce when he was chancellor. Sources close to Liz Truss accuse him of ""flip-flopping"" again today on tax. More MPs have revealed who they are supporting in the leadership contest. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, who replaced Mr Sunak in No 11 when the leadership hopeful resigned from Boris Johnson's cabinet last month, is backing Ms Truss. Mr Zahawi - who put himself forward for the top job before crashing out at an early stage - said ""we need a 'booster' attitude to the economy, not a 'doomster' one"". ""We are in a national economic emergency, and we need more than words. We need delivery, and Liz will be the delivery prime minister,"" Mr Zahawiwrote in the Daily Telegraph,external. Tory rivals get personal in fierce clash over tax Sunak pledges GP fines as Truss vows school reform Truss v Sunak fact-checked In response, Mr Sunak told the Today programme that he wanted to do something ""radical and different"", adding that he ""ripped up the rule book"" on fiscal policy during the pandemic. In other pledges, Ms Truss also promised to tackle the labour shortages in farming, with a short-term expansion to the seasonal workers scheme. Meanwhile, Damian Green, chair of the One Nation Conservatives group of Tory MPs, has come out in support of Mr Sunak. ""Rishi can actually conjure up a solution which makes a real difference to the lives of millions of people and that's what I think we need in the next prime minister,"" Mr Green told Radio 4's Westminster Hour programme.

"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been taking part in a second Tory leadership hustings in Exeter as they try to win over party members Penny Mordaunt - who came third in the leadership contest - has backed Liz Truss in her bid to become the next prime minister She says she is the ""hope candidate"" and says it is ""her authenticity, her determination, her ambition for country"" that makes Truss the best candidate Earlier, former Tory leader William Hague urged party members to back the ""highly disciplined"" and ""rational"" ex-chancellor Conservative members have until the beginning of next month to cast their ballot, with the winner announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles That's it for this evening, thanks for joining us. The next hustings event will be in Cardiff on Wednesday. Our coverage was brought to you by Catherine Evans, George Wright, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage shortly, but before we go here's a round-up of the biggest talking points.  Martyn OatesBBC South West Political Editor Earlier Liz Truss was asked whether she would provide parliamentary time to vote on repealing the hunting ban. The answer was ânoâ - while she was keen to praise the country sports fraternity she said her experience in David Cameronâs government (he had promised a free vote on repealing the ban) suggested revisiting the ban âmight make things worseâ. Her answer ruling out repeal won more applause than the questioner calling for it - from an audience drawn from the rural South West. That probably wouldnât have happened a decade ago. Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC News The momentum in this part of the campaign is still with Liz Truss. That's clear now that she has the backing of Penny Mordaunt. So it's not surprising that Rishi Sunak wants to describe himself as a change candidate and brush aside the 'doomster' label. But he can't get away from it completely because he also wants to be seen as financially responsible and that might not stir conservative hearts as much as Liz Truss' promises of immediate tax cuts. While Liz Truss' disregard for the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon might play well to the conservative base, calling the First Minister of Scotland 'an attention seeker' might not be a wise move. If Liz Truss were to become Prime Minister their first meeting will likely be very frosty indeed. We also learned where the members' doubts lie with these two leaders, through some of the tricky audience questions. For Liz Truss it was a question on her tax policy 'where is all the money going to come from' for those tax cuts. While for Rishi Sunak it was again about his loyalty under Boris Johnson. We can expect variations of those doubts to come up again and again as the hustings continue. So you've heard some of the plans leadership hopefuls Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been setting out at tonight's husting in Exeter. But what do each of the candidates say they'll do if they get the keys to No 10? Find out with our handy guidehere. In his resignation letter, Rishi Sunak highlighted fundamental differences in his and the PM's views on how to fix the economy. And he's just pledged he's ""not going to stick with the failed plans of the past"". Asked about corporation tax, he said he wants to reform the system. He admits the headline rate of corporation tax is going to go up, but maintains Britain will still have the lowest rate of the G7 countries. He adds that Britain needs to attract investment, and the tax system isn't ""generous enough"", so he's going to cut taxes of business investment in R&D to build on innovation. He says low corporation tax has done ""zilch"" for economic growth. ""How important is loyalty to you? I donât feel you were loyal to Boris Johnson,"" one woman in the audience asks, to lots of clapping. ""I respectfully disagree,"" Sunak responds, to perhaps even more clapping. The pair were not on the same page on economic policy, he says. But the government was on the ""wrong sideâ of a very serious ethical question,"" he says,in apparent reference to Johnson's handling of allegations against MP Chris Pincher. ""It wasn't just me, but 60 other members of parliament,"" Sunak says. The pandemic exposed the frailties of the social care system, says Sunak, when asked about elderly care. He says it needs more funding for proper reform to happen, adding he did that as chancellor. There needs to be improvements in the quality of social care provision, he adds. ""We can't have the NHS keep gobbling up all the money and social care being the poor cousin,"" he says. ""We need to fix the funding formulas."" A member of the audience talks about waiting years for a diagnosis for his daughter's suspected autism. He says that he was able to afford private healthcare, but what about those who can't afford it? Sunak responds by paying tribute to former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who he says was the first to ""prioritise"" mental health, but the job is ""not done"". Sunak says he wants to see âmore mental health provisions in educationâ to ""stop the problem at the source"". He points to the role the internet can play in causing mental health problems in young people and backs plans for the Online Safety Bill, which aims to lay down rules in law about how platforms should deal with harmful content. Sunak's just been talking about ""being bold and reforming public services"". ""That's exactly what we need to do,"" he says, adding the first stop should be the NHS. He says there's a massive problem with backlogs in the health service, which could benefit from software automation to clear up the list. ""We can't just sit on our hands,"" he says, adding there's a need for radicalism. A woman from West Dorset asks what Sunak will do to improve local buses in her area. He replies that it's not just about transport, but schools too. ""We need to make sure the voice of rural Britain is heard loudly and clearly down in Westminster,"" he says, adding that they often get it wrong. Martyn OatesBBC South West Political Editor Rishi Sunak insists future trade deals will be done more slowly and carefully and so as not to disadvantage British farmers. The recent Australian trade deal has received fierce criticism from the farming community who fear it will lead to a flood of cheap meat which will undermines the competitiveness of British produce. The governmentâs own impact assessment predicted it would have a negative impact on British agriculture. A very sore point among the South Westâs many livestock farmers. And the Trade Secretary at the time the the Australian deal was done? Mr Sunakâs rival for the leadership Liz Truss. Rishi Sunak's just been asked whether he feels confident that he is up to the job of prime minister. He replies he wouldn't be here if he didn't think he was up to the task. ""I passionately believe I can do it,"" he says. He also says he'd ""smash Keir Starmer and the Labour Party and the liberals at the next election"". Are you a change or continuity candidate? Sunak is asked. Sunak says he's ""definitely"" the former. He speaks of making big decisions at ""crunch moments"", in particular Brexit, which he says he was advised against supporting. ""I believed in my principles then and I believe in them now,"" he says. Asked about his plans for tax cuts at some point, Rishi Sunak's sticking to his guns. He says any tax cuts must be paid for, once the government has a grip of inflation. He says income tax cuts will reward people's hard work and ""put money in their pockets"". Truss has just finished answering questions from party members, to a hearty round of applause. Up next, former chancellor Rishi Sunak. A Scottish member of the audience asks what Truss will do to ensure the United Kingdom does not break up. The best thing to do is to ""ignore"" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, she responds - to the loudest cheer of the night. She brands Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"". Would she ever back a second referendum of Scottish independence? Truss is asked. ""No, no, no."" Truss has just been asked if the Online Safety Bill should be scrapped. She says under-18s need to be protected, but so does free speech. Truss, who has two daughters, aged 13 and 16, says she is ""worried about what they see"" online. She also worries about social networking sites, which can have a negative effect on girls' mental health. At the same time, she adds, grown adults should be able to communicate freely. Truss is asked by an audience member how she will avoid plunging the country into debt. Truss has vowed to reduce taxes if she becomes prime minister. ""The money is going to come from thriving enterprises, thriving businesses and economic growth,"" she responds. Taxing people and businesses too much will ""throttle growth"", she adds. ""We believe in enterprises and people keeping more of their money."" A member of the audience asks Truss if she'd repeal the 2005 Hunting Act. She replies it would be ""opening Pandora's Box"". But she adds she is a supporter of countryside sports, adding the shooting industry does ""fantastic conservation work"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"The tortoise was spotted on the track heading away from Norwich A giant tortoise brought trains to a halt when it was found on a railway track. The injured animal was spotted near Harling Road, north east of Thetford, Norfolk, on the Cambridge-bound line at about 12:40 BST. Greater Anglia said three services were affected by the tortoise's presence. Swallow Aquatics in East Harling said the tortoise, Clyde, had gone missing on Sunday and had now been taken to a vets, as it was hit by a train. The pet shop said the 2.5ft (76cm) long tortoise had a hole in its shell after the collision. Diane Akers, a passenger on the 11:22 train from Ely to Norwich, photographed the tortoise on the opposite track when her train came to a halt. ""It was very large and filled a substantial area of the track,"" she said. ""I tried to tweet Greater Anglia, but I'm not sure the message got through. ""When we got to Norwich station I told staff in the office there, and the chap looked at me as if I was mad - and then a police officer came along and said he'd seen my tweet."" Staff from Network Rail rescued the tortoise and took it to a vet BBC reporter Nic Rigby was a passenger on another train, from Cambridge to Norwich, that ground to a halt. ""The train's been delayed due a giant African tortoise on the line,"" he said. ""The train inspector announced that he's having trouble believing it - but it's true."" A Greater Anglia spokeswoman said: ""We are sorry for the disruption caused to customers between Norwich and Cambridge this afternoon. ""This was due to a very large, injured tortoise on the line near Harling Road. ""Network Rail attended and helped the animal. Services were able to run from 13.25.""

Sunak is asked. Sunak says he's ""definitely"" the former. He speaks of making big decisions at ""crunch moments"", in particular Brexit, which he says he was advised against supporting. ""I believed in my principles then and I believe in them now,"" he says. Asked about his plans for tax cuts at some point, Rishi Sunak's sticking to his guns. He says any tax cuts must be paid for, once the government has a grip of inflation. He says income tax cuts will reward people's hard work and ""put money in their pockets"". Truss has just finished answering questions from party members, to a hearty round of applause. Up next, former chancellor Rishi Sunak. A Scottish member of the audience asks what Truss will do to ensure the United Kingdom does not break up. The best thing to do is to ""ignore"" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, she responds - to the loudest cheer of the night. She brands Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"". Would she ever back a second referendum of Scottish independence? Truss is asked. ""No, no, no."" Truss has just been asked if the Online Safety Bill should be scrapped. She says under-18s need to be protected, but so does free speech. Truss, who has two daughters, aged 13 and 16, says she is ""worried about what they see"" online. She also worries about social networking sites, which can have a negative effect on girls' mental health. At the same time, she adds, grown adults should be able to communicate freely. Truss is asked by an audience member how she will avoid plunging the country into debt. Truss has vowed to reduce taxes if she becomes prime minister. ""The money is going to come from thriving enterprises, thriving businesses and economic growth,"" she responds. Taxing people and businesses too much will ""throttle growth"", she adds. ""We believe in enterprises and people keeping more of their money."" A member of the audience asks Truss if she'd repeal the 2005 Hunting Act. She replies it would be ""opening Pandora's Box"". But she adds she is a supporter of countryside sports, adding the shooting industry does ""fantastic conservation work"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Secretary General warned the world had been ""lucky"" to avoid global nuclear war The world is one misstep from devastating nuclear war and in peril not seen since the Cold War, the UN Secretary General has warned. ""We have been extraordinarily lucky so far,"" Antonio Guterres said. Amid rising global tensions, ""humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation"", he added. His remarks came at the opening of a conference for countries signed up to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The 1968 deal was introduced after the Cuban missile crisis, an event often portrayed as the closest the world ever came to nuclear war. The treaty was designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to more countries, and to pursue the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament. Almost every nation on Earth is signed up to the NPT, including the five biggest nuclear powers. But among the handful of states never to sign are four known or suspected to have nuclear weapons: India, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan. Secretary General Guterres said the ""luck"" the world had enjoyed so far in avoiding a nuclear catastrophe may not last - and urged the world to renew a push towards eliminating all such weapons. ""Luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict,"" he said. And he warned that those international tensions were ""reaching new highs"" - pointing specifically to the invasion of Ukraine, tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East as examples. Russia was widely accused of escalating tensions when days after his invasion of Ukraine in February, President Vladimir Putin put Russia's substantial nuclear forces on high alert. He also threatened anyone standing in Russia's way with consequences ""you have never seen in your history"". Russia's nuclear strategy includes the use of nuclear weapons if the state's existence is under threat. On Monday, Mr Putin wrote to the same non-proliferation conference Mr Guterres opened, declaring that ""there can be no winners in a nuclear war and it should never be unleashed"". But Russia still found itself criticised at the NPT conference. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned what he called Russia's sabre-rattling - and pointed out that Ukraine had handed over its Soviet-era nuclear weapons in 1994, after receiving assurances of its future security from Russia and others. ""What message does this send to any country around the world that may think that it needs to have nuclear weapons - to protect, to defend, to deter aggression against its sovereignty and independence?"" he asked. ""The worst possible message"". Today, some 13,000 nuclear weapons are thought to remain in service in the arsenals of the nine nuclear-armed states - far lower than the estimated 60,000 stockpiled during the peak of the mid-1980s.

"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been taking part in a second Tory leadership hustings in Exeter as they try to win over party members Penny Mordaunt - who came third in the leadership contest - has backed Liz Truss in her bid to become the next prime minister She says she is the ""hope candidate"" and says it is ""her authenticity, her determination, her ambition for country"" that makes Truss the best candidate Earlier, former Tory leader William Hague urged party members to back the ""highly disciplined"" and ""rational"" ex-chancellor Conservative members have until the beginning of next month to cast their ballot, with the winner announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles That's it for this evening, thanks for joining us. The next hustings event will be in Cardiff on Wednesday. Our coverage was brought to you by Catherine Evans, George Wright, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage shortly, but before we go here's a round-up of the biggest talking points.  Martyn OatesBBC South West Political Editor Earlier Liz Truss was asked whether she would provide parliamentary time to vote on repealing the hunting ban. The answer was ânoâ - while she was keen to praise the country sports fraternity she said her experience in David Cameronâs government (he had promised a free vote on repealing the ban) suggested revisiting the ban âmight make things worseâ. Her answer ruling out repeal won more applause than the questioner calling for it - from an audience drawn from the rural South West. That probably wouldnât have happened a decade ago. Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC News The momentum in this part of the campaign is still with Liz Truss. That's clear now that she has the backing of Penny Mordaunt. So it's not surprising that Rishi Sunak wants to describe himself as a change candidate and brush aside the 'doomster' label. But he can't get away from it completely because he also wants to be seen as financially responsible and that might not stir conservative hearts as much as Liz Truss' promises of immediate tax cuts. While Liz Truss' disregard for the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon might play well to the conservative base, calling the First Minister of Scotland 'an attention seeker' might not be a wise move. If Liz Truss were to become Prime Minister their first meeting will likely be very frosty indeed. We also learned where the members' doubts lie with these two leaders, through some of the tricky audience questions. For Liz Truss it was a question on her tax policy 'where is all the money going to come from' for those tax cuts. While for Rishi Sunak it was again about his loyalty under Boris Johnson. We can expect variations of those doubts to come up again and again as the hustings continue. So you've heard some of the plans leadership hopefuls Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been setting out at tonight's husting in Exeter. But what do each of the candidates say they'll do if they get the keys to No 10? Find out with our handy guidehere. In his resignation letter, Rishi Sunak highlighted fundamental differences in his and the PM's views on how to fix the economy. And he's just pledged he's ""not going to stick with the failed plans of the past"". Asked about corporation tax, he said he wants to reform the system. He admits the headline rate of corporation tax is going to go up, but maintains Britain will still have the lowest rate of the G7 countries. He adds that Britain needs to attract investment, and the tax system isn't ""generous enough"", so he's going to cut taxes of business investment in R&D to build on innovation. He says low corporation tax has done ""zilch"" for economic growth. ""How important is loyalty to you? I donât feel you were loyal to Boris Johnson,"" one woman in the audience asks, to lots of clapping. ""I respectfully disagree,"" Sunak responds, to perhaps even more clapping. The pair were not on the same page on economic policy, he says. But the government was on the ""wrong sideâ of a very serious ethical question,"" he says,in apparent reference to Johnson's handling of allegations against MP Chris Pincher. ""It wasn't just me, but 60 other members of parliament,"" Sunak says. The pandemic exposed the frailties of the social care system, says Sunak, when asked about elderly care. He says it needs more funding for proper reform to happen, adding he did that as chancellor. There needs to be improvements in the quality of social care provision, he adds. ""We can't have the NHS keep gobbling up all the money and social care being the poor cousin,"" he says. ""We need to fix the funding formulas."" A member of the audience talks about waiting years for a diagnosis for his daughter's suspected autism. He says that he was able to afford private healthcare, but what about those who can't afford it? Sunak responds by paying tribute to former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who he says was the first to ""prioritise"" mental health, but the job is ""not done"". Sunak says he wants to see âmore mental health provisions in educationâ to ""stop the problem at the source"". He points to the role the internet can play in causing mental health problems in young people and backs plans for the Online Safety Bill, which aims to lay down rules in law about how platforms should deal with harmful content. Sunak's just been talking about ""being bold and reforming public services"". ""That's exactly what we need to do,"" he says, adding the first stop should be the NHS. He says there's a massive problem with backlogs in the health service, which could benefit from software automation to clear up the list. ""We can't just sit on our hands,"" he says, adding there's a need for radicalism. A woman from West Dorset asks what Sunak will do to improve local buses in her area. He replies that it's not just about transport, but schools too. ""We need to make sure the voice of rural Britain is heard loudly and clearly down in Westminster,"" he says, adding that they often get it wrong. Martyn OatesBBC South West Political Editor Rishi Sunak insists future trade deals will be done more slowly and carefully and so as not to disadvantage British farmers. The recent Australian trade deal has received fierce criticism from the farming community who fear it will lead to a flood of cheap meat which will undermines the competitiveness of British produce. The governmentâs own impact assessment predicted it would have a negative impact on British agriculture. A very sore point among the South Westâs many livestock farmers. And the Trade Secretary at the time the the Australian deal was done? Mr Sunakâs rival for the leadership Liz Truss. Rishi Sunak's just been asked whether he feels confident that he is up to the job of prime minister. He replies he wouldn't be here if he didn't think he was up to the task. ""I passionately believe I can do it,"" he says. He also says he'd ""smash Keir Starmer and the Labour Party and the liberals at the next election"". Are you a change or continuity candidate?

"The Scottish government has urged Westminster to provide additional funding for public sector pay deals. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said failure to do so would risk an inability to fund equivalent offers without cuts to public services. Mr Swinney, who has taken on the finance and economy portfolio, issued the warning in a letter to Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi. The UK government said it had provided Holyrood with a record settlement. But Mr Swinney outlined concerns that last year's UK Spending Review did not take into account the level of pay increases recently proposed by independent pay review bodies. No alternative to 'all-out' council strike - Unite Public sector pay: Police and most NHS staff get below-inflation rises Spending Review: Difficult choices bring public service change Mr Swinney, who is covering Kate Forbes' brief while she is on maternity leave, also said the Spending Review did not consider the wider effects of rising inflation. And he added that without further funding, the Scottish government may only be able to issue similar pay rises by reducing budgets elsewhere. He wrote: ""Further to the joint letter from devolved administration finance ministers to you on July 15, and in light of the UK government's subsequent announcements regarding public sector pay, I am concerned that no associated funding is being provided to meet these additional costs. ""Last year's UK Spending Review, which as you know determines the majority of the Scottish Budget, did not take account of the levels of pay uplift now proposed or indeed the wider effects of inflation. ""The associated reduction in spending power across public sector budgets is deeply worrying for our public services and our capacity to respond to the cost of living crisis, which will undoubtedly bring renewed challenges through the coming autumn and winter period."" The call for more funding comes as pay offers to a range of public sector workers in Scotland have been rejected by unions, raising the prospect of frontline services being impacted by industrial action. This includes: All of the major NHS trade unions are currentlyballoting members to see if they want to reject a 5% pay offer from the Scottish governmentand if they would consider industrial action if a new deal cannot be reached. Hundreds of schools and waste services could be affectedif strikes go ahead after council staff rejected a 2% pay offer. An improved3.4% pay rise offered to Scotland's police officers has been rejected. Scottish Police Federation members have withdrawn ""all goodwill"" as a result of the dispute which the union said would be escalated without an improved offer by 5 August. Mr Swinney warned that Holyrood's fixed budgets, restricted borrowing powers, the inability to change tax policy and the lack of additional funding for public sector pay deals via theBarnett Formulameant the Scottish government could only replicate these pay deals for public workers in Scotland with ""deep cuts to public services"". He added: ""I would urge you to consider appropriate funding for public sector pay, and would welcome early discussions with you on this matter."" A UK government spokesperson said: ""We have provided the Scottish government with a record Â£41bn per year for the next three years, the highest spending review settlement since devolution. ""As a result, the Scottish government is receiving around Â£126 per person for every Â£100 per person of equivalent UK government spending in England over the next three years. ""We're also helping to tackle the rising cost of living, protecting eight million of the most vulnerable families with direct payments of Â£1,200 this year, and providing additional payments to pensioners and disabled people."" Scottish Labour's finance spokesman Daniel Johnson said it was not acceptable for both governments to blame one another for their ""collective failures"". He added: ""It is the SNP who have, for almost 15 years, failed to value public sector workers or prioritise fair pay deals for them, all while the Tories have presided over a massive transfer of wealth to top earners.

"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been taking part in a second Tory leadership hustings in Exeter as they try to win over party members Penny Mordaunt - who came third in the leadership contest - has backed Liz Truss in her bid to become the next prime minister She says she is the ""hope candidate"" and says it is ""her authenticity, her determination, her ambition for country"" that makes Truss the best candidate Earlier, former Tory leader William Hague urged party members to back the ""highly disciplined"" and ""rational"" ex-chancellor Conservative members have until the beginning of next month to cast their ballot, with the winner announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles That's it for this evening, thanks for joining us. The next hustings event will be in Cardiff on Wednesday. Our coverage was brought to you by Catherine Evans, George Wright, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage shortly, but before we go here's a round-up of the biggest talking points.  Martyn OatesBBC South West Political Editor Earlier Liz Truss was asked whether she would provide parliamentary time to vote on repealing the hunting ban. The answer was ânoâ - while she was keen to praise the country sports fraternity she said her experience in David Cameronâs government (he had promised a free vote on repealing the ban) suggested revisiting the ban âmight make things worseâ. Her answer ruling out repeal won more applause than the questioner calling for it - from an audience drawn from the rural South West. That probably wouldnât have happened a decade ago. Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC News The momentum in this part of the campaign is still with Liz Truss. That's clear now that she has the backing of Penny Mordaunt. So it's not surprising that Rishi Sunak wants to describe himself as a change candidate and brush aside the 'doomster' label. But he can't get away from it completely because he also wants to be seen as financially responsible and that might not stir conservative hearts as much as Liz Truss' promises of immediate tax cuts. While Liz Truss' disregard for the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon might play well to the conservative base, calling the First Minister of Scotland 'an attention seeker' might not be a wise move. If Liz Truss were to become Prime Minister their first meeting will likely be very frosty indeed. We also learned where the members' doubts lie with these two leaders, through some of the tricky audience questions. For Liz Truss it was a question on her tax policy 'where is all the money going to come from' for those tax cuts. While for Rishi Sunak it was again about his loyalty under Boris Johnson. We can expect variations of those doubts to come up again and again as the hustings continue. So you've heard some of the plans leadership hopefuls Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been setting out at tonight's husting in Exeter. But what do each of the candidates say they'll do if they get the keys to No 10? Find out with our handy guidehere. In his resignation letter, Rishi Sunak highlighted fundamental differences in his and the PM's views on how to fix the economy. And he's just pledged he's ""not going to stick with the failed plans of the past"". Asked about corporation tax, he said he wants to reform the system. He admits the headline rate of corporation tax is going to go up, but maintains Britain will still have the lowest rate of the G7 countries. He adds that Britain needs to attract investment, and the tax system isn't ""generous enough"", so he's going to cut taxes of business investment in R&D to build on innovation. He says low corporation tax has done ""zilch"" for economic growth. ""How important is loyalty to you? I donât feel you were loyal to Boris Johnson,"" one woman in the audience asks, to lots of clapping. ""I respectfully disagree,"" Sunak responds, to perhaps even more clapping. The pair were not on the same page on economic policy, he says. But the government was on the ""wrong sideâ of a very serious ethical question,"" he says,in apparent reference to Johnson's handling of allegations against MP Chris Pincher. ""It wasn't just me, but 60 other members of parliament,"" Sunak says. The pandemic exposed the frailties of the social care system, says Sunak, when asked about elderly care. He says it needs more funding for proper reform to happen, adding he did that as chancellor. There needs to be improvements in the quality of social care provision, he adds. ""We can't have the NHS keep gobbling up all the money and social care being the poor cousin,"" he says. ""We need to fix the funding formulas."" A member of the audience talks about waiting years for a diagnosis for his daughter's suspected autism. He says that he was able to afford private healthcare, but what about those who can't afford it? Sunak responds by paying tribute to former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who he says was the first to ""prioritise"" mental health, but the job is ""not done"". Sunak says he wants to see âmore mental health provisions in educationâ to ""stop the problem at the source"". He points to the role the internet can play in causing mental health problems in young people and backs plans for the Online Safety Bill, which aims to lay down rules in law about how platforms should deal with harmful content. Sunak's just been talking about ""being bold and reforming public services"". ""That's exactly what we need to do,"" he says, adding the first stop should be the NHS. He says there's a massive problem with backlogs in the health service, which could benefit from software automation to clear up the list. ""We can't just sit on our hands,"" he says, adding there's a need for radicalism. A woman from West Dorset asks what Sunak will do to improve local buses in her area. He replies that it's not just about transport, but schools too. ""We need to make sure the voice of rural Britain is heard loudly and clearly down in Westminster,"" he says, adding that they often get it wrong. Martyn OatesBBC South West Political Editor Rishi Sunak insists future trade deals will be done more slowly and carefully and so as not to disadvantage British farmers. The recent Australian trade deal has received fierce criticism from the farming community who fear it will lead to a flood of cheap meat which will undermines the competitiveness of British produce. The governmentâs own impact assessment predicted it would have a negative impact on British agriculture. A very sore point among the South Westâs many livestock farmers. And the Trade Secretary at the time the the Australian deal was done? Mr Sunakâs rival for the leadership Liz Truss. Rishi Sunak's just been asked whether he feels confident that he is up to the job of prime minister. He replies he wouldn't be here if he didn't think he was up to the task. ""I passionately believe I can do it,"" he says. He also says he'd ""smash Keir Starmer and the Labour Party and the liberals at the next election"". Are you a change or continuity candidate? Sunak is asked. Sunak says he's ""definitely"" the former. He speaks of making big decisions at ""crunch moments"", in particular Brexit, which he says he was advised against supporting. ""I believed in my principles then and I believe in them now,"" he says. Asked about his plans for tax cuts at some point, Rishi Sunak's sticking to his guns. He says any tax cuts must be paid for, once the government has a grip of inflation. He says income tax cuts will reward people's hard work and ""put money in their pockets"". Truss has just finished answering questions from party members, to a hearty round of applause. Up next, former chancellor Rishi Sunak. A Scottish member of the audience asks what Truss will do to ensure the United Kingdom does not break up. The best thing to do is to ""ignore"" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, she responds - to the loudest cheer of the night. She brands Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"". Would she ever back a second referendum of Scottish independence? Truss is asked. ""No, no, no."" Truss has just been asked if the Online Safety Bill should be scrapped. She says under-18s need to be protected, but so does free speech. Truss, who has two daughters, aged 13 and 16, says she is ""worried about what they see"" online. She also worries about social networking sites, which can have a negative effect on girls' mental health. At the same time, she adds, grown adults should be able to communicate freely. Truss is asked by an audience member how she will avoid plunging the country into debt. Truss has vowed to reduce taxes if she becomes prime minister. ""The money is going to come from thriving enterprises, thriving businesses and economic growth,"" she responds. Taxing people and businesses too much will ""throttle growth"", she adds.

"Right after England's Lionesses made history on Sunday, a former star player blasted Premier League football clubs for turning down the opportunity to host matches during the European Championship they had just won. ""You weren't brave enough to see the vision,"" Alex Scott said in front of a record crowd of 87,192 at Wembley, where the England women's team beat Germany 2-1 in the final. It was watched by even more at home, with a BBC One television audience of 17.4 million making the final this year's most-watched programme so far. Much focus is now on English football to see how it will capitalise on the success of a team who have captured the nation's heart. But first - from a lack of opportunities at school to the financial barriers still in place - what has held women's and girls' football back for so long? England beat Germany to win first major women's trophy Record 17.4m peak TV audience watch Euro 2022 final 'I didn't care about women's football, now I'm hooked' In 1921, the FA - England's governing body of association football - stopped women playing at any of its affiliated grounds, finding the sport ""unsuitable for females"". Officials did not have the power to ban women from playing outright which is why in its ruling, the FA instead asked clubs ""belonging to the Association [to] refuse the use of their grounds for such matches"". This video can not be played Watch full-time scenes as England beat Germany to become Euro 2022 champions At the time, women's football was hugely popular - a trend that grew during World War One, when most men fit enough to play football were needed for the war effort and so women's matches catered for the country's desire to still see football action. Just a year before the ban was imposed, a Boxing Day match between Dick, Kerr Ladies FC, from Preston, and St Helen's Ladies was watched by 53,000 spectators at Goodison Park in Liverpool, still the home of Everton. Another 14,000 were locked outside the ground trying to get in. The ban was eventually lifted in 1971 - 50 years later - but the damage had already been done. ""Without the opportunity for the masses to watch games regularly in large-capacity venues, the interest naturally waned,"" Suzy Wrack, author of A Woman's Game,writes,external. It was only four years ago that the Women's Super League (WSL) became fully professional. Now,the latest figures show,external3.4 million women and girls play football in England, with 9,251 teams affiliated with the FA. This figure is expected to grow in light of the Lionesses' success, with the government unveiling its next phase of pitches and centres for women after it promised toinvest Â£230m in grassroots football,externalin March. A key target of the FA's four-yearInspiring Positive Change strategy,externalis to ensure every primary school-aged girl has the same access to football as boys at school and in clubs by 2024. In its plan, the FA pledges to both bolster after-school sessions and work with ""grassroots clubs and community football providers"" to ensure as many young girls as possible ""carry on playing football into and through their teenage years"". The association reported this year that 63% of schools in England offer girls' football in PE lessons and fewer than that - 40% - offer girls regular after-school football. At primary level, 72% of schools offer the sport but that drops to 44% as children progress into older year groups. Following the Lionesses 4-0 win over Sweden in the Euro semi-final last week, former England player Ian Wright, now one of the BBC's leading football pundits, asked: ""Whatever happens in the final now, if girls are not allowed to play football just like the boys can in their PE lessons after this tournament, then what are we doing?"" Female football players are known to face sexist - and at times misogynistic - abuse for their chosen profession, and that was no different during the Euros. Inresearch,externalconducted by German broadcasters ARD and NDR and the broadsheet newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, it was concluded that of 300 offensive social media posts detected by Uefa during the contest's group stages: 70% were insults without reference to a specific group of people or ethnicity 20% were classified as sexist 6% were racist 4% were homophobic Now, members of the male England squad have partnered with the Lionesses to tackle misogyny in the game. In the run-up to the Euros, EE Hope United - a campaign centred around a dream team of footballers aimed at stamping out social media abuse - unveiled a new squad made up of some of the UK's highest profile male and female players in a bid to tackle online sexist hate. Lionesses stars Ellen White and Lucy Bronze, England men's team manager Gareth Southgate and Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson were among those who lent their faces to the campaign, including TV adverts that were screened during the month of the tournament. England's top-level Women's Super League (WSL) launched more than 10 years ago but serious money is only just starting to roll into the women's game. That is thanks to sponsors - including brands such as Barclays, Visa and Nike - but also due to increased mainstream media coverage. There is still far less investment in women's football in England than there is in men's, though. Alex Scott has condemned the clubs that refused to host Euros matches in their grounds Now former England player Alex Scott says she believes the onus will be on sponsors to prove their worth to the Lionesses - not the other way around. ""I'm not standing up at corporate events in front of sponsors any more begging for them to get involved in the women's game because you know what? If you're not involved, you've missed the boat, you've missed the train."" The term ""pay to play"" has become popular during the Euros after reports surfaced suggesting parents of girls may have to pay for their daughters to get access to play at Premier League football clubs while boys train with the club's academies for free. Gary Lineker has urged the Premier League to scrap the fees following a report ininews,externaldetailing the costs, telling clubs they need to ""sort this out"". The situation has also been worsened in recent years by some big clubs moving their training centres for both young boys  girls out of cities and into suburbs, making it harder for youngsters to get to to the training ground. Parents of boys with the potential to earn millions from the sport might give up other commitments to drive their sons to the ground and keep them in with a chance - but there is less incentive for parents of young girls. As the sport gains record-breaking momentum, fans and players alike are hopeful the tide will turn forever in the way the women's game is viewed. Already, the FA has already declared it wants to get 120,000 more girls playing football in wake of the Lionesses' success, unveiling plans to boost grassroots football and inclusion over the next 18 months.

"The aim is to stop overseas criminals from using agents to create companies or buy property for them in the UK Oligarchs using UK property to launder illegal wealth are being targeted by a new register which has come into force. Any anonymous foreign company seeking to buy UK land or property will need to reveal the true owners. Foreign companies that refuse to disclose their true owner could face fines of up to Â£2,500 per day or up to five years in prison. The register comes amid economic sanctions in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Foreign organisations who already own land in the UK will have a six month period to register their beneficial owners or managing officers. Business Minister Lord Callanan said: ""We have been clear that the UK is a place for legitimate business only, and to ensure we are free of corrupt elites with suspicious wealth, we need to know who owns what. ""By getting this first of its kind register up and running at breakneck speed, we are lifting the curtain and cracking down on those criminals attempting to hide their illicitly obtained wealth."" The multi-million-pound homes of sanctioned oligarchs UK fast-tracks law to tackle Russian 'dirty money' The register was part of the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill in February 2022, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The bill proposes that anyone setting up, running, owning or controlling a company in the UK to verify their identity with Companies House, a government agency, as well as giving Companies House the power to challenge suspicious information. The register applies to property bought since January 1999 in England and Wales, and since December 2014 in Scotland. Labour MP Margaret Hodge said the government needed to go further to tackle money laundering. ""To truly stop the flows of corrupt wealth into our housing market, the government must urgently put in place an open register of the true owners of UK land and property, not just of those owned by companies,"" she said. ""Anything less would demonstrate once and for all that this government is truly soft on dirty money."" Any overseas body that has disposed of property since 28 February 2022 - when the legislation for the register was first announced - will be required to provide a statement to Companies House. Multi-million pound country manors in the south of England and luxury flats in London's most expensive areas are among the homes which have been linked to Vladimir Putin's regime and associates.

Inresearch,externalconducted by German broadcasters ARD and NDR and the broadsheet newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, it was concluded that of 300 offensive social media posts detected by Uefa during the contest's group stages: 70% were insults without reference to a specific group of people or ethnicity 20% were classified as sexist 6% were racist 4% were homophobic Now, members of the male England squad have partnered with the Lionesses to tackle misogyny in the game. In the run-up to the Euros, EE Hope United - a campaign centred around a dream team of footballers aimed at stamping out social media abuse - unveiled a new squad made up of some of the UK's highest profile male and female players in a bid to tackle online sexist hate. Lionesses stars Ellen White and Lucy Bronze, England men's team manager Gareth Southgate and Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson were among those who lent their faces to the campaign, including TV adverts that were screened during the month of the tournament. England's top-level Women's Super League (WSL) launched more than 10 years ago but serious money is only just starting to roll into the women's game. That is thanks to sponsors - including brands such as Barclays, Visa and Nike - but also due to increased mainstream media coverage. There is still far less investment in women's football in England than there is in men's, though. Alex Scott has condemned the clubs that refused to host Euros matches in their grounds Now former England player Alex Scott says she believes the onus will be on sponsors to prove their worth to the Lionesses - not the other way around. ""I'm not standing up at corporate events in front of sponsors any more begging for them to get involved in the women's game because you know what? If you're not involved, you've missed the boat, you've missed the train."" The term ""pay to play"" has become popular during the Euros after reports surfaced suggesting parents of girls may have to pay for their daughters to get access to play at Premier League football clubs while boys train with the club's academies for free. Gary Lineker has urged the Premier League to scrap the fees following a report ininews,externaldetailing the costs, telling clubs they need to ""sort this out"". The situation has also been worsened in recent years by some big clubs moving their training centres for both young boys  girls out of cities and into suburbs, making it harder for youngsters to get to to the training ground. Parents of boys with the potential to earn millions from the sport might give up other commitments to drive their sons to the ground and keep them in with a chance - but there is less incentive for parents of young girls. As the sport gains record-breaking momentum, fans and players alike are hopeful the tide will turn forever in the way the women's game is viewed. Already, the FA has already declared it wants to get 120,000 more girls playing football in wake of the Lionesses' success, unveiling plans to boost grassroots football and inclusion over the next 18 months.

"This video can not be played ""David leaves this world with the blessing of a good name here on earth."" Lord Trimble was a man who rose to ""impossible challenges with considerable strength of character and complete integrity"", mourners at his funeral were told. The funeral of the former Ulster Unionist Party leader took place in Lisburn, County Antrim, on Monday. The former Nobel Peace Prize winner died a week ago, aged 77. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin were among the mourners who gathered for the funeral. The Very Reverend Dr Charles McMullen, who delivered the eulogy at Harmony Hill Presbyterian Church, reflected on Lord Trimble's life, both as a family man and a politician committed to gaining peace in Northern Ireland. ""The reward for all of us has been a radically changed landscape here in Northern Ireland, which has saved many lives and allowed a generation to grow up in relative peace,"" he said. ""As so many have said over these past few days, history will be exceedingly kind to David, even if life brought many unrelenting pressures and demands."" This video can not be played Mourners were told that David Trimble was several steps ahead Lord Trimble, who died on 25 July at the Ulster Hospital near Belfast, after a short illness, led the UUP from 1995 to 2005. He was the first person to serve as first minister of Northern Ireland. He was instrumental in the negotiations and signing of theGood Friday Agreementin 1998, which brought to an end the worst of 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. The deal led to the setting up of a new devolved government at Stormont and ushered in a new, more peaceful era of power-sharing politics. What is the Good Friday Agreement? David Trimble funeral in pictures Lord Trimble was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, alongside the late John Hume, the then leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). However, many unionists opposed the agreement and strongly criticised him for signing up to it. Lord Trimble's wife, Daphne, smiled as Dr McMullen shared stories about his commitment as a father and husband. ""I am sure that he would have wanted this tribute to be as much about his wife Daphne, because she has been his constant companion and soulmate since their marriage in 1978 and his achievements would not have been possible without her unwavering support,"" he said. Lord Trimble's biographer Lord Godson, who also paid tribute during the service, described Lord Trimble as the ""most prestigious and substantial figure thrown up by unionism since the foundation of Northern Ireland in 1921"". ""The distinguished congregation gathered here today in this church, at short notice in August, is proof-positive that the title of David's biography Himself Alone is in some urgent need of revision for David has never been less alone,"" he said. ""In death he is finally being afforded the respect and love from all communities on this island that he deserves, and did not always receive in the height of his powers."" Lord Godson also described how Lord Trimble ""proved critics"" wrong, that he was not interested in a vision ""beyond unionism and Orangeism"". Politicians from across the political divide in Northern Ireland also gathered to pay their respects, including senior figures from the UUP and the leaders of Sinn FÃ©in and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Boris Johnson and MicheÃ¡l Martin were among those who attended the service in Lisburn The Reverend Fiona Forbes told mourners that those who came to pay their respects reflected the ""legacy"" that Lord Trimble had left. ""We have come to remember an academic, a party leader, a peacemaker, a Nobel laureate, the first to serve in the role of first minister in the new Northern Ireland Executive,"" Ms Forbes said. Lord Trimble's eldest son Richard, who read a prayer, thanked the congregation on behalf of the Trimble family for their ""kind words"" following the passing of his father. Watch: Lord Trimble's funeral Victoria Trimble, accompanied by her brother Richard, gave a reading at the funeral As well as Mr Johnson and Mr Martin, key political and state figures who attended the funeral included: Irish President Michael D Higgins Northern Ireland Secretary Shailesh Vara Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill and former leader Gerry Adams Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry SDLP leader Colum Eastwood Former Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern Shortly before he died, Lord Trimble received a letter from former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair, saying he had ""changed lives for the better"" through the Good Friday Agreement. Sir Tony told BBC News NI he wanted to tell the peer how important his role inthe 1998 peace dealwas. He said his actions during the peace process were what ""defines leadership"". Obituary: David Trimble David Trimble: Life in pictures Speaking to the BBC'sGood Morning Ulster programmeearlier on Monday, Sir Tony outlined the contents of his last letter to the dying peer, which was written because Lord Trimble was too ill to take a phone call. He praised Lord Trimble's leadership through the ""agonising negotiations"" which led to the Good Friday Agreement, saying he had set an important example for current political leaders. David Trimble and Tony Blair pictured at the 1998 Labour Party conference, shortly after the peace deal ""The toughest thing is always to say to the people who support you that 'I've got to take you in a new direction, I've got to do something different',"" the former prime minister said. ""Because the easiest thing always to do with your own supporters is, frankly, to play the tunes they want to hear. ""And to be prepared to introduce what to them, to many of them, is a discordant note, that takes a lot but it is what defines leadership in the end."" David Trimble a leader of courage says Clinton 'Trimble lived in the present, not the past' Tributes to former First Minister David Trimble Critics opposed his decision to form a ruling executive which included Sinn FÃ©in ministers in advance of the IRA agreeing to put its weapons beyond use. Unionist concern over the lack of IRA decommissioning ultimately cost him his job as UUP leader - he lost his Westminster seat to the DUP in 2005. By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI news correspondent The funeral service for David Trimble was held at a church called Harmony Hill. It seemed an appropriate place to remember a politician who faced many uphill struggles in the search for peace. If he was looking down at the funeral service at Harmony Hill Presbyterian Church, he would have seen many old friends and foes. Among them were Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams and Democratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who quit the Ulster Unionist Party when Trimble was leader. Donaldson thought Trimble was too soft as a unionist. Adams felt he was too hard. Both men were under the same roof to pay tribute to him at his funeral. Trimble may have not won their adoration, but he certainly gained their admiration, for his political courage. Readmore from Mark here. In his interview, Sir Tony said Lord Trimble was prepared to defend the Good Friday Agreement, even though he knew there would be a high personal cost. ""David said to me when we concluded it: 'Ok I'm going to go with this and once I give you my word, I'll keep it,'"" Sir Tony said. ""He did say: 'It's going to cause a lot of angst and anxiety and a lot of criticism for me in doing it.' But he said: 'Nonetheless, I think it's right and we will go for it'."" David Trimble, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair in Belfast in December 2000 Sir Tony described Lord Trimble as a very intelligent man with a very dry wit. He recalled sitting with the then UUP leader in Downing Street, awaiting the arrival of Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams, when Lord Trimble spied a biography of Oliver Cromwell on a bookshelf. Lord Trimble picked up the book and Sir Tony said: ""I think he'd got it out just to make a dig. ""I said: 'I think we'll put that away before our next guest comes in.' So you know, he actually did have a real sense of humour."" In a family death notice, he was remembered as a ""dearly loved husband of Daphne, and loving father to Richard, Victoria, Nicholas and Sarah"". The Irish Tricolour was flown at half-mast at a number of Irish government buildings on Monday as a mark of respect.

"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been taking part in a second Tory leadership hustings in Exeter as they try to win over party members Penny Mordaunt - who came third in the leadership contest - has backed Liz Truss in her bid to become the next prime minister She says she is the ""hope candidate"" and says it is ""her authenticity, her determination, her ambition for country"" that makes Truss the best candidate Earlier, former Tory leader William Hague urged party members to back the ""highly disciplined"" and ""rational"" ex-chancellor Conservative members have until the beginning of next month to cast their ballot, with the winner announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles That's it for this evening, thanks for joining us. The next hustings event will be in Cardiff on Wednesday. Our coverage was brought to you by Catherine Evans, George Wright, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage shortly, but before we go here's a round-up of the biggest talking points.  Martyn OatesBBC South West Political Editor Earlier Liz Truss was asked whether she would provide parliamentary time to vote on repealing the hunting ban. The answer was ânoâ - while she was keen to praise the country sports fraternity she said her experience in David Cameronâs government (he had promised a free vote on repealing the ban) suggested revisiting the ban âmight make things worseâ. Her answer ruling out repeal won more applause than the questioner calling for it - from an audience drawn from the rural South West. That probably wouldnât have happened a decade ago. Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC News The momentum in this part of the campaign is still with Liz Truss. That's clear now that she has the backing of Penny Mordaunt. So it's not surprising that Rishi Sunak wants to describe himself as a change candidate and brush aside the 'doomster' label. But he can't get away from it completely because he also wants to be seen as financially responsible and that might not stir conservative hearts as much as Liz Truss' promises of immediate tax cuts. While Liz Truss' disregard for the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon might play well to the conservative base, calling the First Minister of Scotland 'an attention seeker' might not be a wise move. If Liz Truss were to become Prime Minister their first meeting will likely be very frosty indeed. We also learned where the members' doubts lie with these two leaders, through some of the tricky audience questions. For Liz Truss it was a question on her tax policy 'where is all the money going to come from' for those tax cuts. While for Rishi Sunak it was again about his loyalty under Boris Johnson. We can expect variations of those doubts to come up again and again as the hustings continue. So you've heard some of the plans leadership hopefuls Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been setting out at tonight's husting in Exeter. But what do each of the candidates say they'll do if they get the keys to No 10? Find out with our handy guidehere. In his resignation letter, Rishi Sunak highlighted fundamental differences in his and the PM's views on how to fix the economy. And he's just pledged he's ""not going to stick with the failed plans of the past"". Asked about corporation tax, he said he wants to reform the system. He admits the headline rate of corporation tax is going to go up, but maintains Britain will still have the lowest rate of the G7 countries. He adds that Britain needs to attract investment, and the tax system isn't ""generous enough"", so he's going to cut taxes of business investment in R&D to build on innovation. He says low corporation tax has done ""zilch"" for economic growth. ""How important is loyalty to you? I donât feel you were loyal to Boris Johnson,"" one woman in the audience asks, to lots of clapping. ""I respectfully disagree,"" Sunak responds, to perhaps even more clapping. The pair were not on the same page on economic policy, he says. But the government was on the ""wrong sideâ of a very serious ethical question,"" he says,in apparent reference to Johnson's handling of allegations against MP Chris Pincher. ""It wasn't just me, but 60 other members of parliament,"" Sunak says. The pandemic exposed the frailties of the social care system, says Sunak, when asked about elderly care. He says it needs more funding for proper reform to happen, adding he did that as chancellor. There needs to be improvements in the quality of social care provision, he adds. ""We can't have the NHS keep gobbling up all the money and social care being the poor cousin,"" he says. ""We need to fix the funding formulas."" A member of the audience talks about waiting years for a diagnosis for his daughter's suspected autism. He says that he was able to afford private healthcare, but what about those who can't afford it? Sunak responds by paying tribute to former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who he says was the first to ""prioritise"" mental health, but the job is ""not done"". Sunak says he wants to see âmore mental health provisions in educationâ to ""stop the problem at the source"". He points to the role the internet can play in causing mental health problems in young people and backs plans for the Online Safety Bill, which aims to lay down rules in law about how platforms should deal with harmful content. Sunak's just been talking about ""being bold and reforming public services"". ""That's exactly what we need to do,"" he says, adding the first stop should be the NHS. He says there's a massive problem with backlogs in the health service, which could benefit from software automation to clear up the list. ""We can't just sit on our hands,"" he says, adding there's a need for radicalism. A woman from West Dorset asks what Sunak will do to improve local buses in her area. He replies that it's not just about transport, but schools too. ""We need to make sure the voice of rural Britain is heard loudly and clearly down in Westminster,"" he says, adding that they often get it wrong. Martyn OatesBBC South West Political Editor Rishi Sunak insists future trade deals will be done more slowly and carefully and so as not to disadvantage British farmers. The recent Australian trade deal has received fierce criticism from the farming community who fear it will lead to a flood of cheap meat which will undermines the competitiveness of British produce. The governmentâs own impact assessment predicted it would have a negative impact on British agriculture. A very sore point among the South Westâs many livestock farmers. And the Trade Secretary at the time the the Australian deal was done? Mr Sunakâs rival for the leadership Liz Truss. Rishi Sunak's just been asked whether he feels confident that he is up to the job of prime minister. He replies he wouldn't be here if he didn't think he was up to the task. ""I passionately believe I can do it,"" he says. He also says he'd ""smash Keir Starmer and the Labour Party and the liberals at the next election"". Are you a change or continuity candidate? Sunak is asked. Sunak says he's ""definitely"" the former. He speaks of making big decisions at ""crunch moments"", in particular Brexit, which he says he was advised against supporting. ""I believed in my principles then and I believe in them now,"" he says. Asked about his plans for tax cuts at some point, Rishi Sunak's sticking to his guns. He says any tax cuts must be paid for, once the government has a grip of inflation. He says income tax cuts will reward people's hard work and ""put money in their pockets"". Truss has just finished answering questions from party members, to a hearty round of applause. Up next, former chancellor Rishi Sunak. A Scottish member of the audience asks what Truss will do to ensure the United Kingdom does not break up. The best thing to do is to ""ignore"" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, she responds - to the loudest cheer of the night. She brands Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"". Would she ever back a second referendum of Scottish independence? Truss is asked. ""No, no, no."" Truss has just been asked if the Online Safety Bill should be scrapped. She says under-18s need to be protected, but so does free speech. Truss, who has two daughters, aged 13 and 16, says she is ""worried about what they see"" online.

"Rishi Sunak has said he will cut the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 16% by the end of the next parliament if he becomes prime minister. This would amount to a 20% tax reduction, he said - the ""largest cut to income tax in 30 years"". But supporters of his Tory rival Liz Truss have accused the ex-chancellor of a U-turn on the issue and said that people cannot wait for tax cuts. Conservative Party members will start receiving ballot papers later. The winner of the leadership contest will be announced on 5 September, with Mr Sunak and Ms Truss competing for the No 10 job. Mr Sunak said the policy is part of his ""radical"" tax vision, but it builds on his previously-announced 1p cut to income tax in April 2024. He said he will take a further 3p off by the end of the next parliament, which could be as late as December 2029. Supporters of Ms Truss said she would ""cut taxes in seven weeks, not seven years"", as she has pledged to scrap April's National Insurance rise, cancel a planned corporation tax rise and temporarilysuspend green levies on energy bills. In announcing his latest tax policy, Mr Sunak emphasised the need to control inflation before cutting taxes, adding that doing so now would make the situation worse and ""endanger people's mortgages"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I want to make sure that we can pay for it, I want to make sure that we can do it alongside growing the economy."" He said that his income tax cut pledge was ""entirely consistent"" with his campaign so far and denied that his plan was aimed solely to boost support for his campaign. ""I don't think embarking on a spree of excessive borrowing at a time when inflation and interest rates are already on the rise would be wise,"" Mr Sunak said. Taxes have dominated the Tory leadership race, with the candidates clashing during the debates. Last week, Ms Trusssaid tax rises brought in by Mr Sunakwould lead to a recession - but Mr Sunak told the foreign secretary that her tax cut plan would ""tip millions of people into misery"" and cost the Conservatives the next election. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke, who worked closely with Mr Sunak but is now backing Ms Truss, said: ""We cannot afford to wait to help families, they need support now. Liz will cut taxes in seven weeks, not seven years."" A source in Truss' camp said: ""It's welcome that Rishi has performed another U-turn on cutting tax, it's only a shame he didn't do this as chancellor when he repeatedly raised taxes. ""He has also made it conditional on getting growth first - knowing full well that his corporation tax rises are contractionary."" In addition to taxation, the candidates' records in government have been under scrutiny. Answering claims that he was ""backstabber"", a reference to his resignation from Boris Johnson's cabinet, Mr Sunak told the Today programme that there was a risk of fellow MPs looking back at the last few months with ""rose-tinted glasses"". He said that the government had ""found itself on the wrong side of a very serious ethical issue"", adding that more than 60 MPs had resigned. ""After a lot of deliberation and months of standing by the PM, I was one of them,"" he said, also citing a difference of opinions on the economy. As ballot papers start dropping through the letterboxes of Conservative members, it's widely accepted that Liz Truss is ahead. She had some significant, high-profile endorsements at the weekend to add to her sense of momentum. But Rishi Sunak's team are adamant they are still in the race. Tory MPs I've spoken to in recent days highlight that many members are still making their minds up. Mr Sunak has been on the back foot when it comes to tax policy. His pitch for caution has been too pessimistic, his critics say. He will be hoping that his pledge today will do something to address that. He wants to be seen as an instinctive low tax Tory - who will reduce them when it's safe to do so. But he is facing criticism from some who think he is changing plans to reflect the debate. He was criticised last week for announcing cuts to VAT on fuel - which he didn't introduce when he was chancellor. Sources close to Liz Truss accuse him of ""flip-flopping"" again today on tax. More MPs have revealed who they are supporting in the leadership contest. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, who replaced Mr Sunak in No 11 when the leadership hopeful resigned from Boris Johnson's cabinet last month, is backing Ms Truss. Mr Zahawi - who put himself forward for the top job before crashing out at an early stage - said ""we need a 'booster' attitude to the economy, not a 'doomster' one"". ""We are in a national economic emergency, and we need more than words. We need delivery, and Liz will be the delivery prime minister,"" Mr Zahawiwrote in the Daily Telegraph,external.

"Rishi Sunak has said he will cut the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 16% by the end of the next parliament if he becomes prime minister. This would amount to a 20% tax reduction, he said - the ""largest cut to income tax in 30 years"". But supporters of his Tory rival Liz Truss have accused the ex-chancellor of a U-turn on the issue and said that people cannot wait for tax cuts. Conservative Party members will start receiving ballot papers later. The winner of the leadership contest will be announced on 5 September, with Mr Sunak and Ms Truss competing for the No 10 job. Mr Sunak said the policy is part of his ""radical"" tax vision, but it builds on his previously-announced 1p cut to income tax in April 2024. He said he will take a further 3p off by the end of the next parliament, which could be as late as December 2029. Supporters of Ms Truss said she would ""cut taxes in seven weeks, not seven years"", as she has pledged to scrap April's National Insurance rise, cancel a planned corporation tax rise and temporarilysuspend green levies on energy bills. In announcing his latest tax policy, Mr Sunak emphasised the need to control inflation before cutting taxes, adding that doing so now would make the situation worse and ""endanger people's mortgages"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I want to make sure that we can pay for it, I want to make sure that we can do it alongside growing the economy."" He said that his income tax cut pledge was ""entirely consistent"" with his campaign so far and denied that his plan was aimed solely to boost support for his campaign. ""I don't think embarking on a spree of excessive borrowing at a time when inflation and interest rates are already on the rise would be wise,"" Mr Sunak said. Taxes have dominated the Tory leadership race, with the candidates clashing during the debates. Last week, Ms Trusssaid tax rises brought in by Mr Sunakwould lead to a recession - but Mr Sunak told the foreign secretary that her tax cut plan would ""tip millions of people into misery"" and cost the Conservatives the next election. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke, who worked closely with Mr Sunak but is now backing Ms Truss, said: ""We cannot afford to wait to help families, they need support now.

"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been taking part in a second Tory leadership hustings in Exeter as they try to win over party members Penny Mordaunt - who came third in the leadership contest - has backed Liz Truss in her bid to become the next prime minister She says she is the ""hope candidate"" and says it is ""her authenticity, her determination, her ambition for country"" that makes Truss the best candidate Earlier, former Tory leader William Hague urged party members to back the ""highly disciplined"" and ""rational"" ex-chancellor Conservative members have until the beginning of next month to cast their ballot, with the winner announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles That's it for this evening, thanks for joining us. The next hustings event will be in Cardiff on Wednesday. Our coverage was brought to you by Catherine Evans, George Wright, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage shortly, but before we go here's a round-up of the biggest talking points.  Martyn OatesBBC South West Political Editor Earlier Liz Truss was asked whether she would provide parliamentary time to vote on repealing the hunting ban. The answer was ânoâ - while she was keen to praise the country sports fraternity she said her experience in David Cameronâs government (he had promised a free vote on repealing the ban) suggested revisiting the ban âmight make things worseâ. Her answer ruling out repeal won more applause than the questioner calling for it - from an audience drawn from the rural South West. That probably wouldnât have happened a decade ago. Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC News The momentum in this part of the campaign is still with Liz Truss. That's clear now that she has the backing of Penny Mordaunt. So it's not surprising that Rishi Sunak wants to describe himself as a change candidate and brush aside the 'doomster' label. But he can't get away from it completely because he also wants to be seen as financially responsible and that might not stir conservative hearts as much as Liz Truss' promises of immediate tax cuts. While Liz Truss' disregard for the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon might play well to the conservative base, calling the First Minister of Scotland 'an attention seeker' might not be a wise move. If Liz Truss were to become Prime Minister their first meeting will likely be very frosty indeed. We also learned where the members' doubts lie with these two leaders, through some of the tricky audience questions. For Liz Truss it was a question on her tax policy 'where is all the money going to come from' for those tax cuts. While for Rishi Sunak it was again about his loyalty under Boris Johnson. We can expect variations of those doubts to come up again and again as the hustings continue. So you've heard some of the plans leadership hopefuls Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been setting out at tonight's husting in Exeter. But what do each of the candidates say they'll do if they get the keys to No 10? Find out with our handy guidehere. In his resignation letter, Rishi Sunak highlighted fundamental differences in his and the PM's views on how to fix the economy. And he's just pledged he's ""not going to stick with the failed plans of the past"". Asked about corporation tax, he said he wants to reform the system. He admits the headline rate of corporation tax is going to go up, but maintains Britain will still have the lowest rate of the G7 countries. He adds that Britain needs to attract investment, and the tax system isn't ""generous enough"", so he's going to cut taxes of business investment in R&D to build on innovation. He says low corporation tax has done ""zilch"" for economic growth. ""How important is loyalty to you? I donât feel you were loyal to Boris Johnson,"" one woman in the audience asks, to lots of clapping. ""I respectfully disagree,"" Sunak responds, to perhaps even more clapping. The pair were not on the same page on economic policy, he says. But the government was on the ""wrong sideâ of a very serious ethical question,"" he says,in apparent reference to Johnson's handling of allegations against MP Chris Pincher. ""It wasn't just me, but 60 other members of parliament,"" Sunak says. The pandemic exposed the frailties of the social care system, says Sunak, when asked about elderly care. He says it needs more funding for proper reform to happen, adding he did that as chancellor. There needs to be improvements in the quality of social care provision, he adds. ""We can't have the NHS keep gobbling up all the money and social care being the poor cousin,"" he says. ""We need to fix the funding formulas."" A member of the audience talks about waiting years for a diagnosis for his daughter's suspected autism. He says that he was able to afford private healthcare, but what about those who can't afford it? Sunak responds by paying tribute to former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who he says was the first to ""prioritise"" mental health, but the job is ""not done"". Sunak says he wants to see âmore mental health provisions in educationâ to ""stop the problem at the source"". He points to the role the internet can play in causing mental health problems in young people and backs plans for the Online Safety Bill, which aims to lay down rules in law about how platforms should deal with harmful content. Sunak's just been talking about ""being bold and reforming public services"". ""That's exactly what we need to do,"" he says, adding the first stop should be the NHS. He says there's a massive problem with backlogs in the health service, which could benefit from software automation to clear up the list. ""We can't just sit on our hands,"" he says, adding there's a need for radicalism. A woman from West Dorset asks what Sunak will do to improve local buses in her area. He replies that it's not just about transport, but schools too. ""We need to make sure the voice of rural Britain is heard loudly and clearly down in Westminster,"" he says, adding that they often get it wrong. Martyn OatesBBC South West Political Editor Rishi Sunak insists future trade deals will be done more slowly and carefully and so as not to disadvantage British farmers. The recent Australian trade deal has received fierce criticism from the farming community who fear it will lead to a flood of cheap meat which will undermines the competitiveness of British produce. The governmentâs own impact assessment predicted it would have a negative impact on British agriculture. A very sore point among the South Westâs many livestock farmers. And the Trade Secretary at the time the the Australian deal was done? Mr Sunakâs rival for the leadership Liz Truss. Rishi Sunak's just been asked whether he feels confident that he is up to the job of prime minister. He replies he wouldn't be here if he didn't think he was up to the task. ""I passionately believe I can do it,"" he says. He also says he'd ""smash Keir Starmer and the Labour Party and the liberals at the next election"". Are you a change or continuity candidate? Sunak is asked. Sunak says he's ""definitely"" the former. He speaks of making big decisions at ""crunch moments"", in particular Brexit, which he says he was advised against supporting. ""I believed in my principles then and I believe in them now,"" he says. Asked about his plans for tax cuts at some point, Rishi Sunak's sticking to his guns. He says any tax cuts must be paid for, once the government has a grip of inflation. He says income tax cuts will reward people's hard work and ""put money in their pockets"". Truss has just finished answering questions from party members, to a hearty round of applause. Up next, former chancellor Rishi Sunak. A Scottish member of the audience asks what Truss will do to ensure the United Kingdom does not break up. The best thing to do is to ""ignore"" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, she responds - to the loudest cheer of the night. She brands Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"". Would she ever back a second referendum of Scottish independence? Truss is asked. ""No, no, no."" Truss has just been asked if the Online Safety Bill should be scrapped. She says under-18s need to be protected, but so does free speech. Truss, who has two daughters, aged 13 and 16, says she is ""worried about what they see"" online. She also worries about social networking sites, which can have a negative effect on girls' mental health. At the same time, she adds, grown adults should be able to communicate freely. Truss is asked by an audience member how she will avoid plunging the country into debt. Truss has vowed to reduce taxes if she becomes prime minister. ""The money is going to come from thriving enterprises, thriving businesses and economic growth,"" she responds. Taxing people and businesses too much will ""throttle growth"", she adds. ""We believe in enterprises and people keeping more of their money."" A member of the audience asks Truss if she'd repeal the 2005 Hunting Act. She replies it would be ""opening Pandora's Box"". But she adds she is a supporter of countryside sports, adding the shooting industry does ""fantastic conservation work"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"The aim is to stop overseas criminals from using agents to create companies or buy property for them in the UK Oligarchs using UK property to launder illegal wealth are being targeted by a new register which has come into force. Any anonymous foreign company seeking to buy UK land or property will need to reveal the true owners. Foreign companies that refuse to disclose their true owner could face fines of up to Â£2,500 per day or up to five years in prison. The register comes amid economic sanctions in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Foreign organisations who already own land in the UK will have a six month period to register their beneficial owners or managing officers. Business Minister Lord Callanan said: ""We have been clear that the UK is a place for legitimate business only, and to ensure we are free of corrupt elites with suspicious wealth, we need to know who owns what. ""By getting this first of its kind register up and running at breakneck speed, we are lifting the curtain and cracking down on those criminals attempting to hide their illicitly obtained wealth."" The multi-million-pound homes of sanctioned oligarchs UK fast-tracks law to tackle Russian 'dirty money' The register was part of the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill in February 2022, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The bill proposes that anyone setting up, running, owning or controlling a company in the UK to verify their identity with Companies House, a government agency, as well as giving Companies House the power to challenge suspicious information. The register applies to property bought since January 1999 in England and Wales, and since December 2014 in Scotland. Labour MP Margaret Hodge said the government needed to go further to tackle money laundering. ""To truly stop the flows of corrupt wealth into our housing market, the government must urgently put in place an open register of the true owners of UK land and property, not just of those owned by companies,"" she said. ""Anything less would demonstrate once and for all that this government is truly soft on dirty money."" Any overseas body that has disposed of property since 28 February 2022 - when the legislation for the register was first announced - will be required to provide a statement to Companies House. Multi-million pound country manors in the south of England and luxury flats in London's most expensive areas are among the homes which have been linked to Vladimir Putin's regime and associates.

"Ukraine is exporting over five million tonnes of grain a month - much more than in the summer of 2023, when Russia pulled out of the Black Sea grain deal. Russia stopped giving safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine in July of that year, and as a result, the country's grain exports slumped. Ukraine exported5.2 million tonnes of grain and maize,externalin March, 5.8 million tonnes in February and 5.3 million tonnes in January. Before Russia's invasion in 2022,the country was sending about 6.5 million tonnes abroad every month,external. After Russia pulled of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (or ""grain deal""), it said it would view any vessel bound for Ukraine as a potential military target. Few cargo ships dared to go to Ukrainian ports, and monthly grain exports fell tojust over 2 million tonnes in July, August and September 2023,external. Ukraine is exporting abut five million tonnes of grain a month to 42 countries However, Ukraine has since established new export routes. Between the end of the grain deal in July 2023 and the end of February 2024, it shippedabout 20 million tonnes of grain to 42 countries,external, according to the country's vice prime minister Oleksandr Kubrakov. This is despite30 Russian attacks on Ukrainian grain ports and storage facilities,externalsince the deal ended. Ukraine reports deadly drone attack on port area Before Russia's invasion in February 2022, Ukraine was the world'sseventh largest exporter of wheat, fourth largest exporter of barley, and the biggest exporter of sunflower seeds,external(used for sunflower oil and feed). When the war started, Ukraine's exports slumped andworld prices for grain soared,external. This particularly affected people in the world's poorest countries. The more grain that Ukraine has been able to supply to global markets,the lower prices have gone,external. Foodstuffs are a major earner for Ukraine. In 2021, the year before Russia's invasion, it made$27.8bn (Â£23.8bn) from exports,external. Under the grain deal, cargo ships travelled to and from Ukrainian ports along a 357-mile (574km) corridor across the Black Sea to the Bosphorus Strait. After that deal ended, Ukraine established a new ""temporary export corridor"" in August 2023, which hugs the western coastline. This is a relatively safe route for cargo ships because the waters there aretoo shallow for Russian submarines to operate,external. It also passes through the territorial waters of Romania and Bulgaria, two Nato countries. Under the EU's""solidarity lanes"" scheme,external, Ukraine is also sending grain by land and barge to ports on the River Danube, or to the Romanian port of Constanta, to be loaded onto cargo ships which then travel through the Black Sea. More Ukrainian grain is also being exported to Europe to be sold on arrival, or to be shipped onwards from other European ports. Ukrainian armed forces have carried out repeated attacks on Russian naval ships and bases in the Black Sea, using aerial drones, sea drones and long-range missiles. Ukraine's navy claims it hashit or disabled a third of all the ships in Russia's Black Sea fleet,externalsince the war began. This has meant Russiais now putting fewer ships near the Ukrainian coast to blockade it,external. Ukraine says it hit Russian landing ships in Crimea Ukraine hits HQ of Russia's symbolic Black Sea navy To help Ukraine's economy after the Russian invasion, the EU scrapped tariffs on imports from the country. However, countries in eastern Europe complained that this meant Ukrainian grain was flooding their markets, lowering wholesale prices and hitting the incomes of their farmers. Some dealers had decided to sell the grain in these countries rather than ship it overseas from other European ports. Polish farmers have been blocking the border with Ukraine According to the EU's agriculture commissioner, Janusz Wojciechowski,4.1 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain entered Poland between April 2022 and March 2023,external, and 3.4 million tonnes of that stayed in the country. In May 2022, the European Commission introduced a ban on Ukrainian grain sales in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, only allowing grain meant for transit to enter those countries. It lifted the restrictions in September 2023, saying the problem had been solved. However, Poland has since imposed its own ban on Ukrainian grain imports, andPolish farmers have been blockading border crossings with Ukraine. In March 2024,the European Commission proposed a cap on duty-free imports of some Ukrainian produce, including oats, eggs, poultry and sugar. However it confirmed that all other Ukrainian imports into the EU - including wheat and barley - would remain free of duties until at least June 2025. It is also proposing toincrease tariffs on imports of Russian and Belorusian grain,externalto reduce surpluses in eastern European countries.

"Leah Williamson celebrates with her teammates after winning the Euro 2022 Final against Germany England Lionesses captain Leah Williamson is reported to have earned Â£200,000 last season. That may be almost eight times as high as the average UK salary, yet compared to the men's England captain, Harry Kane, it pales into insignificance. On Sunday night, Williamson led the national team to victory in the Euro 2022 tournament. But Kane earns the same amount of money Williamson earns in a year in just one week. He isn't even the highest paid Premier League footballer: that's reckoned to be Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo who's reported to be on Â£400,000 a week. But following England's historic win against Germany, which has shone a spotlight on women's football, could that gap begin to close? It is a wide gulf to bridge. According to BBC analysis, the average Women's Super League player earns Â£47,000 a year, based on available published results from seven of the 12 teams in the women's league for the salary bill for players and associated staff including managers. A comparable figure for an average Premier League male player is not easily calculated - and is skewed by the reported Â£20m-plus negotiated by Cristiano Ronaldo and Kevin De Bruyne at Manchester United and Manchester City respectively.But figures compiled for Deloitte,externalfor the wage bills at three mid-table Premier League clubs suggest Leicester pay their squad an average of Â£6.4m, Wolves an average of Â£4.7m and West Ham an average of Â£4.3m. If you accept the Wolves figure as a typical middle ground figure for all 20 Premier League clubs, it suggests men are earning 100 times what the women do. There's one consolation: England players male or female are paid the same Â£2,000 match fee per game and have been since 2020. England's Ellen White kisses the Euro 2022 championship trophy But while the Lionesses have been reported to be earning a Â£55,000 bonus per player for winning the tournament, that Â£1.3m handout is much lower than the reported Â£5m that England's men would have received if they had won last summer's Euros. You need to follow the money to find out. The amount of money clubs bring in is the key factor in governing how much they can pay players. Take the example of Manchester City. The men's team is current Premier League Champions and reported Â£571m in turnover for the 2020-21 season. The club spent 62% of that revenue on players' wages, according to Deloitte, which works out as Â£354m. Manchester City Women's Super League team is out-earned by the men's squad With a squad of 30, that equals an average Â£11.8m per player. Compare that to Manchester City's Women's Super League team. Its accounts reveal Â£2.9m in turnover for 2020-21 while its wage bill is reported at Â£3.3m. That works out across its 44-strong squad and staff as an average of around Â£75,000 per player per year. Football clubs generate funds three different ways: ticket sales, broadcast rights and commercial deals, such as sponsorship. Analysing statistics published by Deloitte, in the men's game, ticket sales roughly account for 15% of income with the remaining 85% split between TV fees and sponsorship. Average attendance for Premier League games is 39,000, while at Women's Super League matches, average audiences for the most recent season reached 1,931 according to the Football Association. So even looking at ticket income there's a huge disparity. Add to that the fact that tickets for men's matches are much more expensive than women's games. If you're an adult looking to buy a ticket to watch Chelsea in the Premier League, you'll need to be prepared to stump up at least Â£65. To watch the women's team you can buy a standing ticket for just Â£9. Even at that low price, tickets seldom sell-out while men's games are normally sold out weeks in advance. Precise details of sponsorships are harder to find out, as clubs normally do bundled deals for both men's and women's team. But it's a certainty that sponsors are mainly paying to be on the men's shirts. When it comes to TV, the Premier League attracts an estimated Â£10bn from a range of broadcasters, including substantial overseas earnings. In comparison, the Women's Super League is currently part way through a UK TV deal worth just Â£8m a year. The figures are stark but partly based on the relative youth of the professional women's game. England's Women's Super League was established in 2011 and only went fully professional in 2018. The Lionesses' success and popularity should mean the next TV and sponsorship deals are negotiated upwards. As to attendances at games, the Football Association has set a target to reach average attendances at games of 6,000 by 2024, which certainly looks achievable. More fans will mean more money and that in turn will lead to higher wages for players. It is set to make a huge difference. Euro 2022 marked the first time that sponsorship was offered just for the women's tournament, rather than simply being bundled with the men's tournament as in the past. Analysts at Nielsen Sports estimate that attracting big names such as Visa, Heineken, Lego and Pepsi helped increase organiser UEFA's revenue stream by Â£25-Â£33m per year. That should just be the beginning. The Lionesses' success should help wages to rise closer to the likes of European giants Lyon or the US National Women's Soccer League where top players are handed more than Â£420,000 per season. But there's also likely to be greater investment at grass roots level. In the last decade some Â£50m National Lottery money has been invested in women's football. During the Euros a further Â£2m was allocated for a new grassroots girls' programme this summer. England football captain Harry Kane outstrips counterpart Leah Williamson in terms of pay But there's one telling fact from Sunday's triumph: the 87,192 crowd smashed the record for attendance at a Euro match, men's or women's. That appears to tell its own story of how women's football has captured the hearts of fans. But it's worth bearing in mind that tickets for the final started at just Â£15. Tickets for last years men's Euro final started at Â£250 with the number of tickets sold limited to two-thirds of capacity by then Covid-rules. So despite the Lionesses' success the women's game is still some way off bringing in the financial rewards that the men's game attracts.

"The star is yet to comment on the track BeyoncÃ© is facing criticism for using an ableist slur in some lyrics on her new album, Renaissance. The derogatory term, often used to demean people with spastic cerebral palsy, occurs twice in the song Heated, co-written by Canadian star Drake. It comes just a couple of weeks after US pop star Lizzo apologised for using the same word in her song GRRRLS. After that incident, BeyoncÃ©'s new song ""feels like a slap in the face"", says disability advocate Hannah Diviney. ""I'm tired and frustrated that we're having this conversation again so soon after we got such a meaningful and progressive response from Lizzo,"" she tells the BBC. Disability charity Scope are asking BeyoncÃ© to re-record the song, omitting the insult. ""Words matter because they reinforce the negative attitudes disabled people face every day,"" says media manager Warren Kirwan. ""BeyoncÃ© has long been a champion of inclusivity and equality, so we'd urge her to remove this offensive lyric."" The BBC has contacted BeyoncÃ©'s team for a response. Lizzo changes derogatory lyric after backlash BBC Sounds: Access All podcast discusses Lizzo's lyrics (from 14'38"") ""It's so annoying because it's so catchy,"" says BBC disability correspondent Nikki Fox. ""But it's a horrible word. ""It's a word we would never, ever use in the UK - although we recognise it's sometimes used differently in the US."" Fox notes that the track has 11 writers, and would have been cleared by several people at BeyoncÃ©'s record label. ""If you think of how many people that song will go through and not one of them thought, 'Hang on a minute', and not one person was not aware of the hoo-hah when Lizzo used the same word. It's very disappointing."" BeyoncÃ©'s album is expected to top the charts, despite the controversy Similar comments spread across social media after Renaissance was released last Friday. ""What was the point of Lizzo changing her lyrics if BeyoncÃ© could just casually drop a song that has the same exact words in it?"" asked epilepsy campaigner @theblackgirlwarrioron TikTok,external(warning - video contains expletives). Her video also addressed BeyoncÃ© fans who claimed the insult has different connotations in the US - where it is often used to mean ""freaking out"" or ""going crazy"" (although those terms can themselves be insensitive to people with mental health conditions). ""The s-word will forever be harmful to people in the disability community... that's not going away,"" she said in her video. New BeyoncÃ© album a dance-floor hit with critics BeyoncÃ©, Drake and the revival of 90s house music ""After the outcry from Lizzo... I can't believe that nobody in BeyoncÃ©'s team was aware of how hurtful the word is to many within the disabled community,"" agreed autism advocate Callum Stephenon Twitter,external. ""Language is such a complex thing and words can validly mean different things to different people, but I don't see why any artist would use a word in their song that causes so much upset to millions worldwide."" Clarinet player Tara Allen recalled how the word had been used against her as a child, in a message directed towards BeyoncÃ©'s official Twitter account. ""As a disabled [person] who grew up being called a sp@z... to diminish my NeuroDivergent experiences, belittle me, and bully me, I am beyond words hurt you have chosen to use this word in your song,"" she wrote. ""You've hurt the community, apologise and change."" In June, Lizzo faced a similar outcry over her song, GRRRLS. Within days, she apologised and re-recorded the song, removing the offensive lyric. ""Let me make one thing clear: I never want to promote derogatory language,"" she wrote in a statement posted to social media. ""As a fat black woman in America, I've had many hurtful words used against me so I understand the power words can have (whether intentionally or in my case, unintentionally)."" Hannah Diviney acknowledged it might be harder to elicit an apology from BeyoncÃ©, ""because of how much more elevated she is, culturally-speaking. ""But equally, that makes me more determined for a response."" Kelis was angry that BeyoncÃ© hadn't sought permission to reference her song Milkshake Heated is not the only song on Beyonce's seventh studio album to attract criticism. Last week, R&B star Kelis accused the star of ""theft"" after learning her anthem Milkshake had been interpolated on a song called Energy (interpolation is when one song references another, without directly sampling it). Kelis said she had not been informed in advance, and that her ""mind is blown"" by the ""level of disrespect"". ""It's not hard. She can contact me, right?"" Kelis said on Instagram. ""It's common decency."" However, BeyoncÃ© would not have had to seek Kelis's permission to reference Milkshake, as she is not a credited writer on the song and does not own the copyright. Instead, permission would have been sought from writer/producers Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo - who duly receive a share of the royalties from Energy. It appears that the basis of Kelis's disagreement lies with them. She has previously accused the duo, professionally known as the Neptunes, of ""lying and tricking"" her into a bad deal, which gave them the rights to her music instead of splitting the royalties three ways. In anInstagram video about BeyoncÃ©'s song,external, she confirmed that they were the source of her frustration. ""Publishing was stolen, people were swindled out of rights. It happens all the time, especially back then. So it's not about me being mad about BeyoncÃ©. ""Pharrell knows better,"" she added. ""This is a direct hit at me [and] he does this stuff all the time. The reason I'm annoyed is because I know it was on purpose."" Neither Pharrell Williams nor Chad Hugo could be reached for comment. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Mortgage borrowing rules have been eased after the Bank of England scrapped an affordability test. The ""stress test"" forced lenders to calculate whether potential borrowers would be able to cope if interest rates climbed by up to 3%. Removing the test may help some potential borrowers get loans, such as the self-employed or freelance workers. But other rules such as strict loan-to-income limits will not make it easier for most people to get a mortgage. The withdrawal of the affordability test was announced in June but has come into effect on Monday. ""Scrapping the affordability test is not as reckless as it may sound,"" said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. ""The loan-to-income framework remains so there will still be some restrictions in place; it is not turning into a free-for-all on the lending front. ""Lenders will also still use some form of testing but to their own choosing according to their risk appetite."" In other words there will not be an immediate impact for borrowers as lenders will not need to change the way they assess loans. However, some may well change their own rules in the future. Mark Yallop, chairman of the Financial Markets Standards Board, said although the change would make it ""slightly easier"" for some borrowers to get a mortgage, he did not think with would have a significant impact. ""The biggest constraint on new mortgages is the ability of borrowers to afford a deposit,"" he added. The mortgage affordability test was introduced in 2014 as part of a widescale tightening up of the mortgage market to ensure there were no repeats of the mis-selling scandal that partially contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. The rule was put in place to ensure that borrowers did not become a threat to the financial stability of lenders by taking on debt they subsequently might not be able to repay. House prices defy expectations to hit record How is the risingcost of livingaffecting you? Get in touch. Lenders had to not only work out if borrowers could afford a mortgage at the rate they were being offered, but also work out how they would be affected if interest rates soared by 3%. Borrowers who could not prove they could cope with such an eventuality might have been turned down for a loan on that basis, even if they could easily afford a mortgage at the existing rate. For that reason the test was seen by some as a barrier for some borrowers. ""The rule change could have a positive effect on borrowers who have been disadvantaged when it comes to getting on the property ladder,"" said Mr Harris. For example, some potential first-time buyers who have been comfortably affording rents far higher than potential mortgage payments have failed affordability assessments. There are some key protections in place to help ensure that borrowers don't take on loans they may not be able to afford. The main one is a loan-to-income ""flow limit"" which limits the number of mortgages that lenders can grant to borrowers at ratios at or greater than 4.5 the borrowers' salary. In short, it is very rare that a lender will consider a higher loan-to-income ratio because of the restriction. After a review of the rules in 2021 the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee judged that ""the LTI flow limit is likely to play a stronger role than the affordability test in guarding against an increase in aggregate household indebtedness and the number of highly indebted households in a scenario of rapidly rising house prices"". ""The change in the affordability rules may not be as significant as it sounds as the loan-to-income 'flow limit' will not be withdrawn, which has much greater impact on people's ability to borrow,"" said Gemma Harle, managing director at Quilter Financial Planning. The FCA's Mortgage Conduct of Business responsible lending rules also require a wide assessment of affordability.

"This video can not be played ""David leaves this world with the blessing of a good name here on earth."" Lord Trimble was a man who rose to ""impossible challenges with considerable strength of character and complete integrity"", mourners at his funeral were told. The funeral of the former Ulster Unionist Party leader took place in Lisburn, County Antrim, on Monday. The former Nobel Peace Prize winner died a week ago, aged 77. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin were among the mourners who gathered for the funeral. The Very Reverend Dr Charles McMullen, who delivered the eulogy at Harmony Hill Presbyterian Church, reflected on Lord Trimble's life, both as a family man and a politician committed to gaining peace in Northern Ireland. ""The reward for all of us has been a radically changed landscape here in Northern Ireland, which has saved many lives and allowed a generation to grow up in relative peace,"" he said. ""As so many have said over these past few days, history will be exceedingly kind to David, even if life brought many unrelenting pressures and demands."" This video can not be played Mourners were told that David Trimble was several steps ahead Lord Trimble, who died on 25 July at the Ulster Hospital near Belfast, after a short illness, led the UUP from 1995 to 2005. He was the first person to serve as first minister of Northern Ireland. He was instrumental in the negotiations and signing of theGood Friday Agreementin 1998, which brought to an end the worst of 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. The deal led to the setting up of a new devolved government at Stormont and ushered in a new, more peaceful era of power-sharing politics. What is the Good Friday Agreement? David Trimble funeral in pictures Lord Trimble was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, alongside the late John Hume, the then leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). However, many unionists opposed the agreement and strongly criticised him for signing up to it. Lord Trimble's wife, Daphne, smiled as Dr McMullen shared stories about his commitment as a father and husband. ""I am sure that he would have wanted this tribute to be as much about his wife Daphne, because she has been his constant companion and soulmate since their marriage in 1978 and his achievements would not have been possible without her unwavering support,"" he said. Lord Trimble's biographer Lord Godson, who also paid tribute during the service, described Lord Trimble as the ""most prestigious and substantial figure thrown up by unionism since the foundation of Northern Ireland in 1921"". ""The distinguished congregation gathered here today in this church, at short notice in August, is proof-positive that the title of David's biography Himself Alone is in some urgent need of revision for David has never been less alone,"" he said. ""In death he is finally being afforded the respect and love from all communities on this island that he deserves, and did not always receive in the height of his powers."" Lord Godson also described how Lord Trimble ""proved critics"" wrong, that he was not interested in a vision ""beyond unionism and Orangeism"". Politicians from across the political divide in Northern Ireland also gathered to pay their respects, including senior figures from the UUP and the leaders of Sinn FÃ©in and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Boris Johnson and MicheÃ¡l Martin were among those who attended the service in Lisburn The Reverend Fiona Forbes told mourners that those who came to pay their respects reflected the ""legacy"" that Lord Trimble had left. ""We have come to remember an academic, a party leader, a peacemaker, a Nobel laureate, the first to serve in the role of first minister in the new Northern Ireland Executive,"" Ms Forbes said. Lord Trimble's eldest son Richard, who read a prayer, thanked the congregation on behalf of the Trimble family for their ""kind words"" following the passing of his father. Watch: Lord Trimble's funeral Victoria Trimble, accompanied by her brother Richard, gave a reading at the funeral As well as Mr Johnson and Mr Martin, key political and state figures who attended the funeral included: Irish President Michael D Higgins Northern Ireland Secretary Shailesh Vara Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill and former leader Gerry Adams Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry SDLP leader Colum Eastwood Former Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern Shortly before he died, Lord Trimble received a letter from former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair, saying he had ""changed lives for the better"" through the Good Friday Agreement. Sir Tony told BBC News NI he wanted to tell the peer how important his role inthe 1998 peace dealwas. He said his actions during the peace process were what ""defines leadership"". Obituary: David Trimble David Trimble: Life in pictures Speaking to the BBC'sGood Morning Ulster programmeearlier on Monday, Sir Tony outlined the contents of his last letter to the dying peer, which was written because Lord Trimble was too ill to take a phone call. He praised Lord Trimble's leadership through the ""agonising negotiations"" which led to the Good Friday Agreement, saying he had set an important example for current political leaders. David Trimble and Tony Blair pictured at the 1998 Labour Party conference, shortly after the peace deal ""The toughest thing is always to say to the people who support you that 'I've got to take you in a new direction, I've got to do something different',"" the former prime minister said. ""Because the easiest thing always to do with your own supporters is, frankly, to play the tunes they want to hear. ""And to be prepared to introduce what to them, to many of them, is a discordant note, that takes a lot but it is what defines leadership in the end."" David Trimble a leader of courage says Clinton 'Trimble lived in the present, not the past' Tributes to former First Minister David Trimble Critics opposed his decision to form a ruling executive which included Sinn FÃ©in ministers in advance of the IRA agreeing to put its weapons beyond use. Unionist concern over the lack of IRA decommissioning ultimately cost him his job as UUP leader - he lost his Westminster seat to the DUP in 2005. By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI news correspondent The funeral service for David Trimble was held at a church called Harmony Hill. It seemed an appropriate place to remember a politician who faced many uphill struggles in the search for peace. If he was looking down at the funeral service at Harmony Hill Presbyterian Church, he would have seen many old friends and foes. Among them were Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams and Democratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who quit the Ulster Unionist Party when Trimble was leader. Donaldson thought Trimble was too soft as a unionist. Adams felt he was too hard. Both men were under the same roof to pay tribute to him at his funeral. Trimble may have not won their adoration, but he certainly gained their admiration, for his political courage. Readmore from Mark here. In his interview, Sir Tony said Lord Trimble was prepared to defend the Good Friday Agreement, even though he knew there would be a high personal cost. ""David said to me when we concluded it: 'Ok I'm going to go with this and once I give you my word, I'll keep it,'"" Sir Tony said. ""He did say: 'It's going to cause a lot of angst and anxiety and a lot of criticism for me in doing it.' But he said: 'Nonetheless, I think it's right and we will go for it'."" David Trimble, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair in Belfast in December 2000 Sir Tony described Lord Trimble as a very intelligent man with a very dry wit. He recalled sitting with the then UUP leader in Downing Street, awaiting the arrival of Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams, when Lord Trimble spied a biography of Oliver Cromwell on a bookshelf. Lord Trimble picked up the book and Sir Tony said: ""I think he'd got it out just to make a dig. ""I said: 'I think we'll put that away before our next guest comes in.' So you know, he actually did have a real sense of humour."" In a family death notice, he was remembered as a ""dearly loved husband of Daphne, and loving father to Richard, Victoria, Nicholas and Sarah"". The Irish Tricolour was flown at half-mast at a number of Irish government buildings on Monday as a mark of respect.

"Spain's body-positive campaign received coverage from lots of media outlets A third woman has said she thinks her picture may have been used for a Spanish ""beach body"" advertising campaign without her permission. Cancer survivor Juliet FitzPatrick, who has had a mastectomy, thinks a woman in the advert may have been based on her. The advert by Spain's equality ministryaimed to encourage women to go to the beach, regardless of how they look. But now three British women have come forward to say their pictures were used without permission. One of the complaints came on Friday. On Saturday another woman featured on the poster said her prosthetic leg had been edited out. The campaign's creator, Arte Mapache, apologised for using those images without consent. Sixty-year-old Ms FitzPatrick, from southern England, said the face of the woman who had a mastectomy could be based on one of her pictures. But she told the BBC on Sunday that the body in the poster was not hers as the woman had one breast while she had a double mastectomy - as the picture below shows. What happened ""seems to be totally against"" the theme of the campaign, she added. ""For me it is about how my body has been used and represented without my permission."" Juliet FitzPatrick was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016 and is now cancer-free Ami Barwell, a British photographer who took the above photo, suspects the body in the poster was lifted from her picture of another woman. ""I think that the person who created the art has gone through my gallery and pieced them together,"" Barwell told the BBC. ""But without any clarification from the artist I can't say for absolutely certain,"" she added. Both Ms FitzPatrick and Barwell only found out about the poster after they received messages on social media on Saturday. Both of them have said they have contacted the artist Arte Mapache but are still waiting for a response. Over the past few days British modelsNyome Nicholas-WilliamsandSian Green-Lordsaid their pictures were used in the poster without their permission. Arte Mapache issued an apology. ""Given the - justified - controversy over the image rights in the illustration, I have decided that the best way to make amends for the damages that may have resulted from my actions is to share out the money I received for the work and give equal parts to the people in the poster,"" the artist said. ""I hope to be able to solve all this as soon as possible, I accept my mistakes and that is why I am now trying to repair the damage caused,"" she added. The BBC has reached out to both Arte Mapache and the Spanish government for comment but has received no response so far.

"This video can not be played ""David leaves this world with the blessing of a good name here on earth."" Lord Trimble was a man who rose to ""impossible challenges with considerable strength of character and complete integrity"", mourners at his funeral were told. The funeral of the former Ulster Unionist Party leader took place in Lisburn, County Antrim, on Monday. The former Nobel Peace Prize winner died a week ago, aged 77. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin were among the mourners who gathered for the funeral. The Very Reverend Dr Charles McMullen, who delivered the eulogy at Harmony Hill Presbyterian Church, reflected on Lord Trimble's life, both as a family man and a politician committed to gaining peace in Northern Ireland. ""The reward for all of us has been a radically changed landscape here in Northern Ireland, which has saved many lives and allowed a generation to grow up in relative peace,"" he said. ""As so many have said over these past few days, history will be exceedingly kind to David, even if life brought many unrelenting pressures and demands."" This video can not be played Mourners were told that David Trimble was several steps ahead Lord Trimble, who died on 25 July at the Ulster Hospital near Belfast, after a short illness, led the UUP from 1995 to 2005. He was the first person to serve as first minister of Northern Ireland. He was instrumental in the negotiations and signing of theGood Friday Agreementin 1998, which brought to an end the worst of 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. The deal led to the setting up of a new devolved government at Stormont and ushered in a new, more peaceful era of power-sharing politics. What is the Good Friday Agreement? David Trimble funeral in pictures Lord Trimble was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, alongside the late John Hume, the then leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). However, many unionists opposed the agreement and strongly criticised him for signing up to it. Lord Trimble's wife, Daphne, smiled as Dr McMullen shared stories about his commitment as a father and husband. ""I am sure that he would have wanted this tribute to be as much about his wife Daphne, because she has been his constant companion and soulmate since their marriage in 1978 and his achievements would not have been possible without her unwavering support,"" he said. Lord Trimble's biographer Lord Godson, who also paid tribute during the service, described Lord Trimble as the ""most prestigious and substantial figure thrown up by unionism since the foundation of Northern Ireland in 1921"". ""The distinguished congregation gathered here today in this church, at short notice in August, is proof-positive that the title of David's biography Himself Alone is in some urgent need of revision for David has never been less alone,"" he said. ""In death he is finally being afforded the respect and love from all communities on this island that he deserves, and did not always receive in the height of his powers."" Lord Godson also described how Lord Trimble ""proved critics"" wrong, that he was not interested in a vision ""beyond unionism and Orangeism"". Politicians from across the political divide in Northern Ireland also gathered to pay their respects, including senior figures from the UUP and the leaders of Sinn FÃ©in and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Boris Johnson and MicheÃ¡l Martin were among those who attended the service in Lisburn The Reverend Fiona Forbes told mourners that those who came to pay their respects reflected the ""legacy"" that Lord Trimble had left. ""We have come to remember an academic, a party leader, a peacemaker, a Nobel laureate, the first to serve in the role of first minister in the new Northern Ireland Executive,"" Ms Forbes said. Lord Trimble's eldest son Richard, who read a prayer, thanked the congregation on behalf of the Trimble family for their ""kind words"" following the passing of his father. Watch: Lord Trimble's funeral Victoria Trimble, accompanied by her brother Richard, gave a reading at the funeral As well as Mr Johnson and Mr Martin, key political and state figures who attended the funeral included: Irish President Michael D Higgins Northern Ireland Secretary Shailesh Vara Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill and former leader Gerry Adams Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry SDLP leader Colum Eastwood Former Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern Shortly before he died, Lord Trimble received a letter from former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair, saying he had ""changed lives for the better"" through the Good Friday Agreement. Sir Tony told BBC News NI he wanted to tell the peer how important his role inthe 1998 peace dealwas. He said his actions during the peace process were what ""defines leadership"". Obituary: David Trimble David Trimble: Life in pictures Speaking to the BBC'sGood Morning Ulster programmeearlier on Monday, Sir Tony outlined the contents of his last letter to the dying peer, which was written because Lord Trimble was too ill to take a phone call. He praised Lord Trimble's leadership through the ""agonising negotiations"" which led to the Good Friday Agreement, saying he had set an important example for current political leaders. David Trimble and Tony Blair pictured at the 1998 Labour Party conference, shortly after the peace deal ""The toughest thing is always to say to the people who support you that 'I've got to take you in a new direction, I've got to do something different',"" the former prime minister said. ""Because the easiest thing always to do with your own supporters is, frankly, to play the tunes they want to hear. ""And to be prepared to introduce what to them, to many of them, is a discordant note, that takes a lot but it is what defines leadership in the end."" David Trimble a leader of courage says Clinton 'Trimble lived in the present, not the past' Tributes to former First Minister David Trimble Critics opposed his decision to form a ruling executive which included Sinn FÃ©in ministers in advance of the IRA agreeing to put its weapons beyond use. Unionist concern over the lack of IRA decommissioning ultimately cost him his job as UUP leader - he lost his Westminster seat to the DUP in 2005. By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI news correspondent The funeral service for David Trimble was held at a church called Harmony Hill. It seemed an appropriate place to remember a politician who faced many uphill struggles in the search for peace. If he was looking down at the funeral service at Harmony Hill Presbyterian Church, he would have seen many old friends and foes. Among them were Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams and Democratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who quit the Ulster Unionist Party when Trimble was leader. Donaldson thought Trimble was too soft as a unionist. Adams felt he was too hard. Both men were under the same roof to pay tribute to him at his funeral. Trimble may have not won their adoration, but he certainly gained their admiration, for his political courage. Readmore from Mark here. In his interview, Sir Tony said Lord Trimble was prepared to defend the Good Friday Agreement, even though he knew there would be a high personal cost. ""David said to me when we concluded it: 'Ok I'm going to go with this and once I give you my word, I'll keep it,'"" Sir Tony said. ""He did say: 'It's going to cause a lot of angst and anxiety and a lot of criticism for me in doing it.' But he said: 'Nonetheless, I think it's right and we will go for it'."" David Trimble, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair in Belfast in December 2000 Sir Tony described Lord Trimble as a very intelligent man with a very dry wit. He recalled sitting with the then UUP leader in Downing Street, awaiting the arrival of Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams, when Lord Trimble spied a biography of Oliver Cromwell on a bookshelf. Lord Trimble picked up the book and Sir Tony said: ""I think he'd got it out just to make a dig. ""I said: 'I think we'll put that away before our next guest comes in.' So you know, he actually did have a real sense of humour."" In a family death notice, he was remembered as a ""dearly loved husband of Daphne, and loving father to Richard, Victoria, Nicholas and Sarah"". The Irish Tricolour was flown at half-mast at a number of Irish government buildings on Monday as a mark of respect.

"Spain's body-positive campaign received coverage from lots of media outlets A third woman has said she thinks her picture may have been used for a Spanish ""beach body"" advertising campaign without her permission. Cancer survivor Juliet FitzPatrick, who has had a mastectomy, thinks a woman in the advert may have been based on her. The advert by Spain's equality ministryaimed to encourage women to go to the beach, regardless of how they look. But now three British women have come forward to say their pictures were used without permission. One of the complaints came on Friday. On Saturday another woman featured on the poster said her prosthetic leg had been edited out. The campaign's creator, Arte Mapache, apologised for using those images without consent. Sixty-year-old Ms FitzPatrick, from southern England, said the face of the woman who had a mastectomy could be based on one of her pictures. But she told the BBC on Sunday that the body in the poster was not hers as the woman had one breast while she had a double mastectomy - as the picture below shows. What happened ""seems to be totally against"" the theme of the campaign, she added. ""For me it is about how my body has been used and represented without my permission."" Juliet FitzPatrick was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016 and is now cancer-free Ami Barwell, a British photographer who took the above photo, suspects the body in the poster was lifted from her picture of another woman. ""I think that the person who created the art has gone through my gallery and pieced them together,"" Barwell told the BBC. ""But without any clarification from the artist I can't say for absolutely certain,"" she added. Both Ms FitzPatrick and Barwell only found out about the poster after they received messages on social media on Saturday. Both of them have said they have contacted the artist Arte Mapache but are still waiting for a response. Over the past few days British modelsNyome Nicholas-WilliamsandSian Green-Lordsaid their pictures were used in the poster without their permission. Arte Mapache issued an apology. ""Given the - justified - controversy over the image rights in the illustration, I have decided that the best way to make amends for the damages that may have resulted from my actions is to share out the money I received for the work and give equal parts to the people in the poster,"" the artist said. ""I hope to be able to solve all this as soon as possible, I accept my mistakes and that is why I am now trying to repair the damage caused,"" she added. The BBC has reached out to both Arte Mapache and the Spanish government for comment but has received no response so far. In a statement earlier this week, Spain's Women's Institute said the campaign was a response to the ""fatphobia, hatred and the questioning of non-normative bodies - particularly those of women, something that's most prevalent in the summertime.""

"The Scottish government has urged Westminster to provide additional funding for public sector pay deals. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said failure to do so would risk an inability to fund equivalent offers without cuts to public services. Mr Swinney, who has taken on the finance and economy portfolio, issued the warning in a letter to Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi. The UK government said it had provided Holyrood with a record settlement. But Mr Swinney outlined concerns that last year's UK Spending Review did not take into account the level of pay increases recently proposed by independent pay review bodies. No alternative to 'all-out' council strike - Unite Public sector pay: Police and most NHS staff get below-inflation rises Spending Review: Difficult choices bring public service change Mr Swinney, who is covering Kate Forbes' brief while she is on maternity leave, also said the Spending Review did not consider the wider effects of rising inflation. And he added that without further funding, the Scottish government may only be able to issue similar pay rises by reducing budgets elsewhere. He wrote: ""Further to the joint letter from devolved administration finance ministers to you on July 15, and in light of the UK government's subsequent announcements regarding public sector pay, I am concerned that no associated funding is being provided to meet these additional costs. ""Last year's UK Spending Review, which as you know determines the majority of the Scottish Budget, did not take account of the levels of pay uplift now proposed or indeed the wider effects of inflation. ""The associated reduction in spending power across public sector budgets is deeply worrying for our public services and our capacity to respond to the cost of living crisis, which will undoubtedly bring renewed challenges through the coming autumn and winter period."" The call for more funding comes as pay offers to a range of public sector workers in Scotland have been rejected by unions, raising the prospect of frontline services being impacted by industrial action. This includes: All of the major NHS trade unions are currentlyballoting members to see if they want to reject a 5% pay offer from the Scottish governmentand if they would consider industrial action if a new deal cannot be reached. Hundreds of schools and waste services could be affectedif strikes go ahead after council staff rejected a 2% pay offer. An improved3.4% pay rise offered to Scotland's police officers has been rejected. Scottish Police Federation members have withdrawn ""all goodwill"" as a result of the dispute which the union said would be escalated without an improved offer by 5 August. Mr Swinney warned that Holyrood's fixed budgets, restricted borrowing powers, the inability to change tax policy and the lack of additional funding for public sector pay deals via theBarnett Formulameant the Scottish government could only replicate these pay deals for public workers in Scotland with ""deep cuts to public services"". He added: ""I would urge you to consider appropriate funding for public sector pay, and would welcome early discussions with you on this matter."" A UK government spokesperson said: ""We have provided the Scottish government with a record Â£41bn per year for the next three years, the highest spending review settlement since devolution. ""As a result, the Scottish government is receiving around Â£126 per person for every Â£100 per person of equivalent UK government spending in England over the next three years. ""We're also helping to tackle the rising cost of living, protecting eight million of the most vulnerable families with direct payments of Â£1,200 this year, and providing additional payments to pensioners and disabled people."" Scottish Labour's finance spokesman Daniel Johnson said it was not acceptable for both governments to blame one another for their ""collective failures"". He added: ""It is the SNP who have, for almost 15 years, failed to value public sector workers or prioritise fair pay deals for them, all while the Tories have presided over a massive transfer of wealth to top earners. ""To fix this we need an economy that is growing and relentlessly focused on giving everyone a chance to succeed. ""Neither the SNP or the Tories are willing or able to use the powers at Holyrood or Westminster to do that.""

"Edinburgh is the first part of Scotland to propose a control area Proposals aimed at limiting the number of Airbnb-style lets in Edinburgh have been approved by Scottish ministers. The city council had asked for permission to establish the country's first short-term let control area. This means that in most cases, planning permission will be needed to change the use of an entire residential home to short-term letting. It follows concern that such lettings have exacerbated housing shortages and fuelled antisocial behaviour. However, others have raised concerns about the impact the new rules could have on the availability of rented accommodation. Green light for Edinburgh short-term lets controls New rules passed for short-term lets in Scotland The City of Edinburgh Council has said the move will prevent short-term lets being set up where it is not appropriate. Housing Secretary Shona Robison said government approval was a major step forward for the council's plans. ""I recognise the important role which short-term lets play as a source of flexible and responsive accommodation for tourists and workers, which brings many benefits to hosts, visitors and our economy,"" she said. ""However, we know that in certain areas, particularly tourist hot spots, high numbers of lets can cause problems for neighbours and make it harder for people to find homes to live in. ""The Scottish government considers that the council has adequately considered and responded to concerns raised before seeking approval of the control area designation. We have concluded that the proposed designation would be reasonable."" Edinburgh is a popular destination for tourists Council leader Cammy Day said the decision paved the way for Edinburgh to become the first short-term let control area in Scotland. ""For far too long, too many homes have been lost in our city to the holiday market,"" he said. ""In fact, around a third of all short term lets in Scotland are here in the capital, so their associated issues of safety, anti-social behaviour and noise have a detrimental effect on many of our residents. ""We will now progress implementing the changes and the next step should be looking at whether we can apply a cap on numbers, too."" Under the new scheme, planning permission will always be required to change the use of a dwelling house to secondary letting, unless the exceptions set out in legislation apply. Where this happened before the introduction of the control area, the existing planning rules will apply. The Scottish government said this would require planning permission if there has been a material change in the use of the property. Renting out a room in your own home, or letting your home while on holiday, will still be allowed. The proposals were approved by the council's planning committee earlier this year, after 88% of the 5,600 people who responded to a consultation on the proposals supported the introduction of the scheme. However, the plans were described as ""restrictive and anti-business"" by the Association of Scotland's Self-Caterers, which said the city's real problem was a lack of house building.

"England's Euro 2020 success will benefit the women's game in Scotland, according to Scottish football experts. Englandwon their first major women's tournamentwith a 2-1 victory against Germany on Sunday. Scotland didn't quality for the Euro 2022 competition but former players and game administrators believe England's triumph will increase wider interest in the women's sport. The game at Wembley attracted a peak TV audience of 17.4m on BBC One. The Scottish Women's Premier League season starts on 7 August withan expanded top division and coming under the governance of the Scottish Professional Football Leaguefor the first time. SWPL top flight expanding to 12 teams England beat Germany to win first major women's trophy It is hoped the move will eventually increase the number of teams with full-time players beyond Rangers, Celtic, Glasgow City and Hibernian. The number of full-time players staying with teams in England and the level of investment by its football association and sponsors have been credited with playing a key role in the national team's progress. Former Scotland striker Julie Fleeting, the country's record top scorer, toldBBC's Good Morning Scotlandthat it was time to capitalise on the profile of the Euro 2022 tournament. Scotland's players and fans after the team's controversial exit from the 2019 Women's World Cup She said: ""What we have to look at what it can do for football here in Scotland and the legacy of what they have done down south will filter through. ""Of course we have always been a few steps behind but it gives us also something to aim for. It's not been overnight in England and we are making similar steps forward."" Ms Fleeting said that ""how can we keep our best players in Scotland"" should be the biggest priority for the game. Vivienne MacLaren, chairwoman of Scottish Women's Football, said: ""You see growth every time we have these major competitions, more people getting involved but this was just out of the stratosphere. ""I feel very proud what it is has done for women's sport and women's football in general. It just shows you the massive step the game has taken."" However, she added that some of Scotland's professional football teams ""could do a heck of a lot more in terms of investment"" when it comes to their women and girls teams. SNP MP for Livingston Hannah Bardell, added: ""Seeing the investment from the English FA in women and girls' football should make the other football associations of the UK, especially Scotland, think very carefully about how much more they can do to emulate the success of the Lionesses. ""There's a whole generation of girls and young women who can see huge success in women's football and women playing to sell-out crowds. ""That is going to have a ripple effect and we need to capitalise on it now and get more girls and women playing the beautiful game and properly invest from grassroots to professional teams."" Many people involved in women's football here in Scotland are looking at last night's game and dreaming of what might be. Last night, the TV audience was 17 million people across the UK. And Wembley stadium was full - with 87,000 people. High profile games like that do give a boost to an entire sport. We saw it here three years ago, when the Scottish women's team reached the World Cup. More people wanted to watch the game, and go to games, and play the game. But there's still a long way to go. Because women's matches here in Scotland - even involving the best teams - tend to attract on average four or five hundred people. That's still a long way short of the men's game. But there's now everything to play for. There are only 75 or 80 professional players in Scotland and their wages still lag behind the top flight players in the English league. But those involved in football have told me when you invest in a sport, anything is possible. And they'll tell you the success of England's football team has taken a long time. It comes from a decade of investment, in the players' skills and training. With good wages which allow women to focus on their game full time. And the other side of this is having a stage to perform on. TV coverage makes all the difference. Right now, there's the Women's Champions' League and there's high hopes that another European league will be set up, which Scottish teams would play in. That would boost their profile - and boost their sponsorship.

The Lionesses' triumph impressed Canadian pop star Shania Twain, who tweeted: ""You know these women will have had to fight for respect from the first moment they picked up the ball - Let's go girls!"" While fans have been sharing what the win means to them. Writing on the Match of the Day Facebook page, Nikki Plaw wrote: ""Very impressed with all the ladies throughout the whole tournament. You are a truly inspirational bunch. A massive congratulations to you all. I can't wait to see the effect this has on the young girls of our country!"" Angela Denton wrote: ""Well done Lionesses. You have made us proud and we can finally say for real: IT'S COMING HOME."" One of the top-rated comments on the BBC Sport website was from poster Mr Carlton, who wrote: ""After decades of supporting the England men's team and being let down by impudence from players, bad luck and negative tactics - this tournament has been beautiful. Thank you, ladies, superb and well deserved."" Another poster added: ""Well done Lionesses, you have made England proud and given women's football in this country a mega shot in the arm. Beating the eight-time champions is a thing of beauty and a massive, massive triumph.""ó §ó ¢ó ¥ó ®ó §ó ¿ One fan on the BBC Sport website shared a personal story: ""10 years of taking my daughter to training and matches, watching in rain and snow, consoling her when they lost, totally worth it when I saw her face when England won, and they lifted the trophy!"" Another wrote: ""This is the beginning of women's football. They are trailblazers and I am hoping it continues to grow. Go to games. Get involved. See the big picture."" One male football fan on Facebook shared his experience of how the tournament had changed his own outlook, saying: ""I've gone from, 'women's football is a joke' to 'I can't wait for the Women's World Cup' this evening. I stand well and truly corrected, not because they won, because of how much it meant for them to win and watching them comfort the German ladies - what football is about.""

"Waitrose has become the latest UK supermarket to scrap best before dates on hundreds of products in an attempt to tackle food waste. It will remove the dates from nearly 500 items of fresh food - including fruit and vegetables - from September. Tesco and Marks & Spencer have also scrapped best before dates on some of their products. Waste & Resources Action Programme (Wrap) says4.5 million tonnes of edible food is thrown away each year.,external Catherine David, director of collaboration and change at the charity, said: ""Wasting food feeds climate change and it costs people money. Best before dates on fruit and veg are unnecessary and create food waste because they get in the way of people using their judgement when food is still good to eat."" M&S scraps 'best before' dates on fruit and veg Morrisons scraps 'use by' date on milk in favour of sniff test Tesco ditches 'best before' dates on more fruit and veg Cost of living: Share your experiences Use by labels are the dates until which perishable food can be cooked and consumed safely. Best before guidance, however, is for when the product should be consumed to get the best quality, taste and texture. The Food Standards Agency says it isup to manufacturers to decide whether to apply a use by or best before date,externalon their products. It will depend on factors such as how the food is made and how risky it is. Marija Rompani, director of sustainability and ethics at the John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, said: ""By removing best before dates from our products, we want our customers to use their own judgement to decide whether a product is good to eat or not, which in turn, will increase its chances of being eaten and not becoming waste."" The products that Waitrose is dropping best before dates from include root vegetables, fruits such as grapes and apples, and indoor plants. In July, Marks & Spencer said it would be taking best before dates off more than 300 fruit and vegetable items, while Tesco scrapped best before dates on more than100 products in 2018. In January this year, Morrisons said it would remove use by dates from 90% of its own-brand milk and encouraged customers to use a ""sniff test"" instead before throwing products away. And in April, the Co-op said it announced plans to ditch use by dates on its own-brand yoghurtin favour of a best before date as guidance.

"This video can not be played ""David leaves this world with the blessing of a good name here on earth."" Lord Trimble was a man who rose to ""impossible challenges with considerable strength of character and complete integrity"", mourners at his funeral were told. The funeral of the former Ulster Unionist Party leader took place in Lisburn, County Antrim, on Monday. The former Nobel Peace Prize winner died a week ago, aged 77. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin were among the mourners who gathered for the funeral. The Very Reverend Dr Charles McMullen, who delivered the eulogy at Harmony Hill Presbyterian Church, reflected on Lord Trimble's life, both as a family man and a politician committed to gaining peace in Northern Ireland. ""The reward for all of us has been a radically changed landscape here in Northern Ireland, which has saved many lives and allowed a generation to grow up in relative peace,"" he said. ""As so many have said over these past few days, history will be exceedingly kind to David, even if life brought many unrelenting pressures and demands."" This video can not be played Mourners were told that David Trimble was several steps ahead Lord Trimble, who died on 25 July at the Ulster Hospital near Belfast, after a short illness, led the UUP from 1995 to 2005. He was the first person to serve as first minister of Northern Ireland. He was instrumental in the negotiations and signing of theGood Friday Agreementin 1998, which brought to an end the worst of 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. The deal led to the setting up of a new devolved government at Stormont and ushered in a new, more peaceful era of power-sharing politics. What is the Good Friday Agreement? David Trimble funeral in pictures Lord Trimble was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, alongside the late John Hume, the then leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). However, many unionists opposed the agreement and strongly criticised him for signing up to it. Lord Trimble's wife, Daphne, smiled as Dr McMullen shared stories about his commitment as a father and husband. ""I am sure that he would have wanted this tribute to be as much about his wife Daphne, because she has been his constant companion and soulmate since their marriage in 1978 and his achievements would not have been possible without her unwavering support,"" he said. Lord Trimble's biographer Lord Godson, who also paid tribute during the service, described Lord Trimble as the ""most prestigious and substantial figure thrown up by unionism since the foundation of Northern Ireland in 1921"". ""The distinguished congregation gathered here today in this church, at short notice in August, is proof-positive that the title of David's biography Himself Alone is in some urgent need of revision for David has never been less alone,"" he said. ""In death he is finally being afforded the respect and love from all communities on this island that he deserves, and did not always receive in the height of his powers."" Lord Godson also described how Lord Trimble ""proved critics"" wrong, that he was not interested in a vision ""beyond unionism and Orangeism"". Politicians from across the political divide in Northern Ireland also gathered to pay their respects, including senior figures from the UUP and the leaders of Sinn FÃ©in and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Boris Johnson and MicheÃ¡l Martin were among those who attended the service in Lisburn The Reverend Fiona Forbes told mourners that those who came to pay their respects reflected the ""legacy"" that Lord Trimble had left. ""We have come to remember an academic, a party leader, a peacemaker, a Nobel laureate, the first to serve in the role of first minister in the new Northern Ireland Executive,"" Ms Forbes said. Lord Trimble's eldest son Richard, who read a prayer, thanked the congregation on behalf of the Trimble family for their ""kind words"" following the passing of his father. Watch: Lord Trimble's funeral Victoria Trimble, accompanied by her brother Richard, gave a reading at the funeral As well as Mr Johnson and Mr Martin, key political and state figures who attended the funeral included: Irish President Michael D Higgins Northern Ireland Secretary Shailesh Vara Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill and former leader Gerry Adams Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry SDLP leader Colum Eastwood Former Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern Shortly before he died, Lord Trimble received a letter from former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair, saying he had ""changed lives for the better"" through the Good Friday Agreement. Sir Tony told BBC News NI he wanted to tell the peer how important his role inthe 1998 peace dealwas. He said his actions during the peace process were what ""defines leadership"". Obituary: David Trimble David Trimble: Life in pictures Speaking to the BBC'sGood Morning Ulster programmeearlier on Monday, Sir Tony outlined the contents of his last letter to the dying peer, which was written because Lord Trimble was too ill to take a phone call. He praised Lord Trimble's leadership through the ""agonising negotiations"" which led to the Good Friday Agreement, saying he had set an important example for current political leaders. David Trimble and Tony Blair pictured at the 1998 Labour Party conference, shortly after the peace deal ""The toughest thing is always to say to the people who support you that 'I've got to take you in a new direction, I've got to do something different',"" the former prime minister said. ""Because the easiest thing always to do with your own supporters is, frankly, to play the tunes they want to hear. ""And to be prepared to introduce what to them, to many of them, is a discordant note, that takes a lot but it is what defines leadership in the end."" David Trimble a leader of courage says Clinton 'Trimble lived in the present, not the past' Tributes to former First Minister David Trimble Critics opposed his decision to form a ruling executive which included Sinn FÃ©in ministers in advance of the IRA agreeing to put its weapons beyond use. Unionist concern over the lack of IRA decommissioning ultimately cost him his job as UUP leader - he lost his Westminster seat to the DUP in 2005. By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI news correspondent The funeral service for David Trimble was held at a church called Harmony Hill. It seemed an appropriate place to remember a politician who faced many uphill struggles in the search for peace. If he was looking down at the funeral service at Harmony Hill Presbyterian Church, he would have seen many old friends and foes. Among them were Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams and Democratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who quit the Ulster Unionist Party when Trimble was leader. Donaldson thought Trimble was too soft as a unionist. Adams felt he was too hard. Both men were under the same roof to pay tribute to him at his funeral. Trimble may have not won their adoration, but he certainly gained their admiration, for his political courage. Readmore from Mark here. In his interview, Sir Tony said Lord Trimble was prepared to defend the Good Friday Agreement, even though he knew there would be a high personal cost. ""David said to me when we concluded it: 'Ok I'm going to go with this and once I give you my word, I'll keep it,'"" Sir Tony said. ""He did say: 'It's going to cause a lot of angst and anxiety and a lot of criticism for me in doing it.' But he said: 'Nonetheless, I think it's right and we will go for it'."" David Trimble, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair in Belfast in December 2000 Sir Tony described Lord Trimble as a very intelligent man with a very dry wit. He recalled sitting with the then UUP leader in Downing Street, awaiting the arrival of Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams, when Lord Trimble spied a biography of Oliver Cromwell on a bookshelf. Lord Trimble picked up the book and Sir Tony said: ""I think he'd got it out just to make a dig. ""I said: 'I think we'll put that away before our next guest comes in.'

"The star is yet to comment on the track BeyoncÃ© is facing criticism for using an ableist slur in some lyrics on her new album, Renaissance. The derogatory term, often used to demean people with spastic cerebral palsy, occurs twice in the song Heated, co-written by Canadian star Drake. It comes just a couple of weeks after US pop star Lizzo apologised for using the same word in her song GRRRLS. After that incident, BeyoncÃ©'s new song ""feels like a slap in the face"", says disability advocate Hannah Diviney. ""I'm tired and frustrated that we're having this conversation again so soon after we got such a meaningful and progressive response from Lizzo,"" she tells the BBC. Disability charity Scope are asking BeyoncÃ© to re-record the song, omitting the insult. ""Words matter because they reinforce the negative attitudes disabled people face every day,"" says media manager Warren Kirwan. ""BeyoncÃ© has long been a champion of inclusivity and equality, so we'd urge her to remove this offensive lyric."" The BBC has contacted BeyoncÃ©'s team for a response. Lizzo changes derogatory lyric after backlash BBC Sounds: Access All podcast discusses Lizzo's lyrics (from 14'38"") ""It's so annoying because it's so catchy,"" says BBC disability correspondent Nikki Fox. ""But it's a horrible word. ""It's a word we would never, ever use in the UK - although we recognise it's sometimes used differently in the US."" Fox notes that the track has 11 writers, and would have been cleared by several people at BeyoncÃ©'s record label. ""If you think of how many people that song will go through and not one of them thought, 'Hang on a minute', and not one person was not aware of the hoo-hah when Lizzo used the same word. It's very disappointing."" BeyoncÃ©'s album is expected to top the charts, despite the controversy Similar comments spread across social media after Renaissance was released last Friday. ""What was the point of Lizzo changing her lyrics if BeyoncÃ© could just casually drop a song that has the same exact words in it?"" asked epilepsy campaigner @theblackgirlwarrioron TikTok,external(warning - video contains expletives). Her video also addressed BeyoncÃ© fans who claimed the insult has different connotations in the US - where it is often used to mean ""freaking out"" or ""going crazy"" (although those terms can themselves be insensitive to people with mental health conditions). ""The s-word will forever be harmful to people in the disability community... that's not going away,"" she said in her video. New BeyoncÃ© album a dance-floor hit with critics BeyoncÃ©, Drake and the revival of 90s house music ""After the outcry from Lizzo... I can't believe that nobody in BeyoncÃ©'s team was aware of how hurtful the word is to many within the disabled community,"" agreed autism advocate Callum Stephenon Twitter,external. ""Language is such a complex thing and words can validly mean different things to different people, but I don't see why any artist would use a word in their song that causes so much upset to millions worldwide."" Clarinet player Tara Allen recalled how the word had been used against her as a child, in a message directed towards BeyoncÃ©'s official Twitter account. ""As a disabled [person] who grew up being called a sp@z... to diminish my NeuroDivergent experiences, belittle me, and bully me, I am beyond words hurt you have chosen to use this word in your song,"" she wrote. ""You've hurt the community, apologise and change."" In June, Lizzo faced a similar outcry over her song, GRRRLS. Within days, she apologised and re-recorded the song, removing the offensive lyric. ""Let me make one thing clear: I never want to promote derogatory language,"" she wrote in a statement posted to social media. ""As a fat black woman in America, I've had many hurtful words used against me so I understand the power words can have (whether intentionally or in my case, unintentionally)."" Hannah Diviney acknowledged it might be harder to elicit an apology from BeyoncÃ©, ""because of how much more elevated she is, culturally-speaking. ""But equally, that makes me more determined for a response."" Kelis was angry that BeyoncÃ© hadn't sought permission to reference her song Milkshake Heated is not the only song on Beyonce's seventh studio album to attract criticism. Last week, R&B star Kelis accused the star of ""theft"" after learning her anthem Milkshake had been interpolated on a song called Energy (interpolation is when one song references another, without directly sampling it). Kelis said she had not been informed in advance, and that her ""mind is blown"" by the ""level of disrespect"". ""It's not hard. She can contact me, right?"" Kelis said on Instagram. ""It's common decency."" However, BeyoncÃ© would not have had to seek Kelis's permission to reference Milkshake, as she is not a credited writer on the song and does not own the copyright. Instead, permission would have been sought from writer/producers Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo - who duly receive a share of the royalties from Energy. It appears that the basis of Kelis's disagreement lies with them. She has previously accused the duo, professionally known as the Neptunes, of ""lying and tricking"" her into a bad deal, which gave them the rights to her music instead of splitting the royalties three ways. In anInstagram video about BeyoncÃ©'s song,external, she confirmed that they were the source of her frustration. ""Publishing was stolen, people were swindled out of rights. It happens all the time, especially back then. So it's not about me being mad about BeyoncÃ©. ""Pharrell knows better,"" she added. ""This is a direct hit at me [and] he does this stuff all the time.

"The star is yet to comment on the track BeyoncÃ© is facing criticism for using an ableist slur in some lyrics on her new album, Renaissance. The derogatory term, often used to demean people with spastic cerebral palsy, occurs twice in the song Heated, co-written by Canadian star Drake. It comes just a couple of weeks after US pop star Lizzo apologised for using the same word in her song GRRRLS. After that incident, BeyoncÃ©'s new song ""feels like a slap in the face"", says disability advocate Hannah Diviney. ""I'm tired and frustrated that we're having this conversation again so soon after we got such a meaningful and progressive response from Lizzo,"" she tells the BBC. Disability charity Scope are asking BeyoncÃ© to re-record the song, omitting the insult. ""Words matter because they reinforce the negative attitudes disabled people face every day,"" says media manager Warren Kirwan. ""BeyoncÃ© has long been a champion of inclusivity and equality, so we'd urge her to remove this offensive lyric."" The BBC has contacted BeyoncÃ©'s team for a response. Lizzo changes derogatory lyric after backlash BBC Sounds: Access All podcast discusses Lizzo's lyrics (from 14'38"") ""It's so annoying because it's so catchy,"" says BBC disability correspondent Nikki Fox. ""But it's a horrible word. ""It's a word we would never, ever use in the UK - although we recognise it's sometimes used differently in the US."" Fox notes that the track has 11 writers, and would have been cleared by several people at BeyoncÃ©'s record label. ""If you think of how many people that song will go through and not one of them thought, 'Hang on a minute', and not one person was not aware of the hoo-hah when Lizzo used the same word. It's very disappointing."" BeyoncÃ©'s album is expected to top the charts, despite the controversy Similar comments spread across social media after Renaissance was released last Friday. ""What was the point of Lizzo changing her lyrics if BeyoncÃ© could just casually drop a song that has the same exact words in it?"" asked epilepsy campaigner @theblackgirlwarrioron TikTok,external(warning - video contains expletives). Her video also addressed BeyoncÃ© fans who claimed the insult has different connotations in the US - where it is often used to mean ""freaking out"" or ""going crazy"" (although those terms can themselves be insensitive to people with mental health conditions). ""The s-word will forever be harmful to people in the disability community... that's not going away,"" she said in her video. New BeyoncÃ© album a dance-floor hit with critics BeyoncÃ©, Drake and the revival of 90s house music ""After the outcry from Lizzo... I can't believe that nobody in BeyoncÃ©'s team was aware of how hurtful the word is to many within the disabled community,"" agreed autism advocate Callum Stephenon Twitter,external. ""Language is such a complex thing and words can validly mean different things to different people, but I don't see why any artist would use a word in their song that causes so much upset to millions worldwide."" Clarinet player Tara Allen recalled how the word had been used against her as a child, in a message directed towards BeyoncÃ©'s official Twitter account. ""As a disabled [person] who grew up being called a sp@z... to diminish my NeuroDivergent experiences, belittle me, and bully me, I am beyond words hurt you have chosen to use this word in your song,"" she wrote. ""You've hurt the community, apologise and change."" In June, Lizzo faced a similar outcry over her song, GRRRLS. Within days, she apologised and re-recorded the song, removing the offensive lyric. ""Let me make one thing clear: I never want to promote derogatory language,"" she wrote in a statement posted to social media. ""As a fat black woman in America, I've had many hurtful words used against me so I understand the power words can have (whether intentionally or in my case, unintentionally)."" Hannah Diviney acknowledged it might be harder to elicit an apology from BeyoncÃ©, ""because of how much more elevated she is, culturally-speaking. ""But equally, that makes me more determined for a response.""

"This video can not be played ""David leaves this world with the blessing of a good name here on earth."" Lord Trimble was a man who rose to ""impossible challenges with considerable strength of character and complete integrity"", mourners at his funeral were told. The funeral of the former Ulster Unionist Party leader took place in Lisburn, County Antrim, on Monday. The former Nobel Peace Prize winner died a week ago, aged 77. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin were among the mourners who gathered for the funeral. The Very Reverend Dr Charles McMullen, who delivered the eulogy at Harmony Hill Presbyterian Church, reflected on Lord Trimble's life, both as a family man and a politician committed to gaining peace in Northern Ireland. ""The reward for all of us has been a radically changed landscape here in Northern Ireland, which has saved many lives and allowed a generation to grow up in relative peace,"" he said. ""As so many have said over these past few days, history will be exceedingly kind to David, even if life brought many unrelenting pressures and demands."" This video can not be played Mourners were told that David Trimble was several steps ahead Lord Trimble, who died on 25 July at the Ulster Hospital near Belfast, after a short illness, led the UUP from 1995 to 2005. He was the first person to serve as first minister of Northern Ireland. He was instrumental in the negotiations and signing of theGood Friday Agreementin 1998, which brought to an end the worst of 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. The deal led to the setting up of a new devolved government at Stormont and ushered in a new, more peaceful era of power-sharing politics. What is the Good Friday Agreement? David Trimble funeral in pictures Lord Trimble was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, alongside the late John Hume, the then leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). However, many unionists opposed the agreement and strongly criticised him for signing up to it. Lord Trimble's wife, Daphne, smiled as Dr McMullen shared stories about his commitment as a father and husband. ""I am sure that he would have wanted this tribute to be as much about his wife Daphne, because she has been his constant companion and soulmate since their marriage in 1978 and his achievements would not have been possible without her unwavering support,"" he said. Lord Trimble's biographer Lord Godson, who also paid tribute during the service, described Lord Trimble as the ""most prestigious and substantial figure thrown up by unionism since the foundation of Northern Ireland in 1921"". ""The distinguished congregation gathered here today in this church, at short notice in August, is proof-positive that the title of David's biography Himself Alone is in some urgent need of revision for David has never been less alone,"" he said. ""In death he is finally being afforded the respect and love from all communities on this island that he deserves, and did not always receive in the height of his powers."" Lord Godson also described how Lord Trimble ""proved critics"" wrong, that he was not interested in a vision ""beyond unionism and Orangeism"". Politicians from across the political divide in Northern Ireland also gathered to pay their respects, including senior figures from the UUP and the leaders of Sinn FÃ©in and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Boris Johnson and MicheÃ¡l Martin were among those who attended the service in Lisburn The Reverend Fiona Forbes told mourners that those who came to pay their respects reflected the ""legacy"" that Lord Trimble had left. ""We have come to remember an academic, a party leader, a peacemaker, a Nobel laureate, the first to serve in the role of first minister in the new Northern Ireland Executive,"" Ms Forbes said. Lord Trimble's eldest son Richard, who read a prayer, thanked the congregation on behalf of the Trimble family for their ""kind words"" following the passing of his father. Watch: Lord Trimble's funeral Victoria Trimble, accompanied by her brother Richard, gave a reading at the funeral As well as Mr Johnson and Mr Martin, key political and state figures who attended the funeral included: Irish President Michael D Higgins Northern Ireland Secretary Shailesh Vara Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill and former leader Gerry Adams Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry SDLP leader Colum Eastwood Former Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern Shortly before he died, Lord Trimble received a letter from former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair, saying he had ""changed lives for the better"" through the Good Friday Agreement. Sir Tony told BBC News NI he wanted to tell the peer how important his role inthe 1998 peace dealwas. He said his actions during the peace process were what ""defines leadership"". Obituary: David Trimble David Trimble: Life in pictures Speaking to the BBC'sGood Morning Ulster programmeearlier on Monday, Sir Tony outlined the contents of his last letter to the dying peer, which was written because Lord Trimble was too ill to take a phone call. He praised Lord Trimble's leadership through the ""agonising negotiations"" which led to the Good Friday Agreement, saying he had set an important example for current political leaders. David Trimble and Tony Blair pictured at the 1998 Labour Party conference, shortly after the peace deal ""The toughest thing is always to say to the people who support you that 'I've got to take you in a new direction, I've got to do something different',"" the former prime minister said. ""Because the easiest thing always to do with your own supporters is, frankly, to play the tunes they want to hear. ""And to be prepared to introduce what to them, to many of them, is a discordant note, that takes a lot but it is what defines leadership in the end."" David Trimble a leader of courage says Clinton 'Trimble lived in the present, not the past' Tributes to former First Minister David Trimble Critics opposed his decision to form a ruling executive which included Sinn FÃ©in ministers in advance of the IRA agreeing to put its weapons beyond use. Unionist concern over the lack of IRA decommissioning ultimately cost him his job as UUP leader - he lost his Westminster seat to the DUP in 2005. By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI news correspondent The funeral service for David Trimble was held at a church called Harmony Hill. It seemed an appropriate place to remember a politician who faced many uphill struggles in the search for peace. If he was looking down at the funeral service at Harmony Hill Presbyterian Church, he would have seen many old friends and foes. Among them were Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams and Democratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who quit the Ulster Unionist Party when Trimble was leader. Donaldson thought Trimble was too soft as a unionist. Adams felt he was too hard. Both men were under the same roof to pay tribute to him at his funeral. Trimble may have not won their adoration, but he certainly gained their admiration, for his political courage. Readmore from Mark here. In his interview, Sir Tony said Lord Trimble was prepared to defend the Good Friday Agreement, even though he knew there would be a high personal cost. ""David said to me when we concluded it: 'Ok I'm going to go with this and once I give you my word, I'll keep it,'"" Sir Tony said. ""He did say: 'It's going to cause a lot of angst and anxiety and a lot of criticism for me in doing it.' But he said: 'Nonetheless, I think it's right and we will go for it'."" David Trimble, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair in Belfast in December 2000 Sir Tony described Lord Trimble as a very intelligent man with a very dry wit. He recalled sitting with the then UUP leader in Downing Street, awaiting the arrival of Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams, when Lord Trimble spied a biography of Oliver Cromwell on a bookshelf. Lord Trimble picked up the book and Sir Tony said: ""I think he'd got it out just to make a dig. ""I said: 'I think we'll put that away before our next guest comes in.' So you know, he actually did have a real sense of humour."" In a family death notice, he was remembered as a ""dearly loved husband of Daphne, and loving father to Richard, Victoria, Nicholas and Sarah"".

"Waitrose has become the latest UK supermarket to scrap best before dates on hundreds of products in an attempt to tackle food waste. It will remove the dates from nearly 500 items of fresh food - including fruit and vegetables - from September. Tesco and Marks & Spencer have also scrapped best before dates on some of their products. Waste & Resources Action Programme (Wrap) says4.5 million tonnes of edible food is thrown away each year.,external Catherine David, director of collaboration and change at the charity, said: ""Wasting food feeds climate change and it costs people money. Best before dates on fruit and veg are unnecessary and create food waste because they get in the way of people using their judgement when food is still good to eat."" M&S scraps 'best before' dates on fruit and veg Morrisons scraps 'use by' date on milk in favour of sniff test Tesco ditches 'best before' dates on more fruit and veg Cost of living: Share your experiences Use by labels are the dates until which perishable food can be cooked and consumed safely. Best before guidance, however, is for when the product should be consumed to get the best quality, taste and texture. The Food Standards Agency says it isup to manufacturers to decide whether to apply a use by or best before date,externalon their products. It will depend on factors such as how the food is made and how risky it is. Marija Rompani, director of sustainability and ethics at the John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, said: ""By removing best before dates from our products, we want our customers to use their own judgement to decide whether a product is good to eat or not, which in turn, will increase its chances of being eaten and not becoming waste."" The products that Waitrose is dropping best before dates from include root vegetables, fruits such as grapes and apples, and indoor plants. In July, Marks & Spencer said it would be taking best before dates off more than 300 fruit and vegetable items, while Tesco scrapped best before dates on more than100 products in 2018. In January this year, Morrisons said it would remove use by dates from 90% of its own-brand milk and encouraged customers to use a ""sniff test"" instead before throwing products away. And in April, the Co-op said it announced plans to ditch use by dates on its own-brand yoghurtin favour of a best before date as guidance.

He was instrumental in the negotiations and signing of theGood Friday Agreementin 1998, which brought to an end the worst of 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. The deal led to the setting up of a new devolved government at Stormont and ushered in a new, more peaceful era of power-sharing politics. What is the Good Friday Agreement? David Trimble funeral in pictures Lord Trimble was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, alongside the late John Hume, the then leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). However, many unionists opposed the agreement and strongly criticised him for signing up to it. Lord Trimble's wife, Daphne, smiled as Dr McMullen shared stories about his commitment as a father and husband. ""I am sure that he would have wanted this tribute to be as much about his wife Daphne, because she has been his constant companion and soulmate since their marriage in 1978 and his achievements would not have been possible without her unwavering support,"" he said. Lord Trimble's biographer Lord Godson, who also paid tribute during the service, described Lord Trimble as the ""most prestigious and substantial figure thrown up by unionism since the foundation of Northern Ireland in 1921"". ""The distinguished congregation gathered here today in this church, at short notice in August, is proof-positive that the title of David's biography Himself Alone is in some urgent need of revision for David has never been less alone,"" he said. ""In death he is finally being afforded the respect and love from all communities on this island that he deserves, and did not always receive in the height of his powers."" Lord Godson also described how Lord Trimble ""proved critics"" wrong, that he was not interested in a vision ""beyond unionism and Orangeism"". Politicians from across the political divide in Northern Ireland also gathered to pay their respects, including senior figures from the UUP and the leaders of Sinn FÃ©in and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Boris Johnson and MicheÃ¡l Martin were among those who attended the service in Lisburn The Reverend Fiona Forbes told mourners that those who came to pay their respects reflected the ""legacy"" that Lord Trimble had left. ""We have come to remember an academic, a party leader, a peacemaker, a Nobel laureate, the first to serve in the role of first minister in the new Northern Ireland Executive,"" Ms Forbes said. Lord Trimble's eldest son Richard, who read a prayer, thanked the congregation on behalf of the Trimble family for their ""kind words"" following the passing of his father. Watch: Lord Trimble's funeral Victoria Trimble, accompanied by her brother Richard, gave a reading at the funeral As well as Mr Johnson and Mr Martin, key political and state figures who attended the funeral included: Irish President Michael D Higgins Northern Ireland Secretary Shailesh Vara Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill and former leader Gerry Adams Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry SDLP leader Colum Eastwood Former Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern Shortly before he died, Lord Trimble received a letter from former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair, saying he had ""changed lives for the better"" through the Good Friday Agreement. Sir Tony told BBC News NI he wanted to tell the peer how important his role inthe 1998 peace dealwas. He said his actions during the peace process were what ""defines leadership"". Obituary: David Trimble David Trimble: Life in pictures Speaking to the BBC'sGood Morning Ulster programmeearlier on Monday, Sir Tony outlined the contents of his last letter to the dying peer, which was written because Lord Trimble was too ill to take a phone call. He praised Lord Trimble's leadership through the ""agonising negotiations"" which led to the Good Friday Agreement, saying he had set an important example for current political leaders. David Trimble and Tony Blair pictured at the 1998 Labour Party conference, shortly after the peace deal ""The toughest thing is always to say to the people who support you that 'I've got to take you in a new direction, I've got to do something different',"" the former prime minister said. ""Because the easiest thing always to do with your own supporters is, frankly, to play the tunes they want to hear. ""And to be prepared to introduce what to them, to many of them, is a discordant note, that takes a lot but it is what defines leadership in the end."" David Trimble a leader of courage says Clinton 'Trimble lived in the present, not the past' Tributes to former First Minister David Trimble Critics opposed his decision to form a ruling executive which included Sinn FÃ©in ministers in advance of the IRA agreeing to put its weapons beyond use. Unionist concern over the lack of IRA decommissioning ultimately cost him his job as UUP leader - he lost his Westminster seat to the DUP in 2005. By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI news correspondent The funeral service for David Trimble was held at a church called Harmony Hill. It seemed an appropriate place to remember a politician who faced many uphill struggles in the search for peace. If he was looking down at the funeral service at Harmony Hill Presbyterian Church, he would have seen many old friends and foes. Among them were Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams and Democratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who quit the Ulster Unionist Party when Trimble was leader. Donaldson thought Trimble was too soft as a unionist. Adams felt he was too hard. Both men were under the same roof to pay tribute to him at his funeral. Trimble may have not won their adoration, but he certainly gained their admiration, for his political courage. Readmore from Mark here. In his interview, Sir Tony said Lord Trimble was prepared to defend the Good Friday Agreement, even though he knew there would be a high personal cost. ""David said to me when we concluded it: 'Ok I'm going to go with this and once I give you my word, I'll keep it,'"" Sir Tony said. ""He did say: 'It's going to cause a lot of angst and anxiety and a lot of criticism for me in doing it.' But he said: 'Nonetheless, I think it's right and we will go for it'."" David Trimble, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair in Belfast in December 2000 Sir Tony described Lord Trimble as a very intelligent man with a very dry wit. He recalled sitting with the then UUP leader in Downing Street, awaiting the arrival of Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams, when Lord Trimble spied a biography of Oliver Cromwell on a bookshelf. Lord Trimble picked up the book and Sir Tony said: ""I think he'd got it out just to make a dig. ""I said: 'I think we'll put that away before our next guest comes in.' So you know, he actually did have a real sense of humour."" In a family death notice, he was remembered as a ""dearly loved husband of Daphne, and loving father to Richard, Victoria, Nicholas and Sarah"". The Irish Tricolour was flown at half-mast at a number of Irish government buildings on Monday as a mark of respect.

"Nichelle Nichols (far right) on the set of the film Star Trek: The Final Frontier in 1989 American actress Nichelle Nichols, best known for her role in 1960s sci-fi TV series Star Trek, has died aged 89. Nichols broke barriers in her role as Lieutenant Nyota Uhura in the series, becoming one of the first black actresses in the US to play a figure in authority. She was later employed by Nasa in an effort to encourage more women and African-Americans to become astronauts. She died of natural causes on Saturday night, her son Kyle Johnson said. Nichelle Nichols at a Comic Con event in Los Angeles, California in 2021 In a statement posted on Facebook, Mr Johnson wrote: ""I regret to inform you that a great light in the firmament no longer shines for us as it has for so many years. ""Her light however, like the ancient galaxies now being seen for the first time, will remain for us and future generations to enjoy, learn from, and draw inspiration."" US President Joe Bidenpaid tribute, saying,external: ""In Nichelle Nichols, our nation has lost a trailblazer of stage and screen who redefined what is possible for Black Americans and women."" The Star Trek TV series broke down stereotypes in the 1960s by casting black and minority actors in high-profile roles. Nicholls was cast in the series as Lt Uhura, who was portrayed as a competent and level-headed communications officer - shattering stereotypes. In 1968, she and Star Trek star William Shatner, who played Captain Kirk in the series, broke new ground when they shared one of television's first interracial kisses - though it was not a romantic one. Despite her success, however, Nichols had initially considered leaving the show. But she wasÂ convinced otherwise by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who described her character as the ""first non-stereotypical role portrayed by a black woman in television history"". She wanted to leave because she had been offered a role in a show that was heading to Broadway,saying in an interview that her ""life was theatre"".,external Nichols was asked by Star Trek creator Gene Rodenberry to think about her decision for a couple of days, which she agreed to do. That weekend, she went to a fundraiser in Los Angeles where she was introduced to someone who was described by the event organiser as ""her biggest fan, he's desperate to meet you"". That man was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who said: ""Yes, Miss Nichols, I am your greatest fan. We admire you greatly."" She told him she was going to leave Star Trek and he said: ""You cannot. You cannot. For the first time on television, we are being seen as we should be seen every day, as intelligent... beautiful, people who can sing, dance and go into space, be lawyers, teachers, and yet you don't see it on television until now."" Nichols explained: ""I could say nothing, I just stood there realising that everything he said was the truth."" Nichols did not regret staying at Star Trek Dr. King continued: ""Gene Rodenberry opened a door for the world to see us. If you leave, that door can be closed because your role is not a black role and it's not a female role, he can fill it with anyone, including an alien!"" Nichols later said: ""At that moment, the world tilted for me and I knew then... that I was something else. The world was not the same. And I remember being angry - why me? Why should I have to?"" But she went back to Rodenberry the following week and told him what happened and said she would stay. Rodenberry responded: ""Thank god for Martin Luther King, somebody knows where I am coming from."" Nichols said she never looked back and had never regretted her decision. She went on to feature in the first six Star Trek movies following the series' end in 1969. As well as working as an actress, Ms Nicholls also became an ambassador for the US space agency Nasa, helping to recruit women and minorities to its Space programme. Following the news of her death, Star Trek co-star George Takei wrote in a tweet: ""My heart is heavy, my eyes shining like the stars you now rest among, my dearest friend."" Allow Twitter content?

"The UK has given some of the least generous support to help drivers with high fuel costs among countries in Europe that have taken action, the RAC has said. The motoring group said that out of 13 European nations that have cut tax on petrol, only Luxembourg has done less. The UK cut fuel duty by 5p a litre in March, but the RAC says this looks ""paltry"" when compared to elsewhere. The government says the duty cut will save the average driver Â£100 a year. UK petrol prices have hit record highs this year, although they have started to fall back in recent weeks. Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Petrol pricing is cause for concern, warns watchdog Fuel prices have increased sharply because the price for crude oil, which is used to make petrol and diesel, has gone up. Oil prices jumped following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, but they had already been rising as demand rose following the lifting of Covid restrictions. In the Spring Statement in March, the government announceda 5p-a-litre cut in fuel dutyto help motorists, but the RAC said the UK was ""languishing near the bottom of the table of the 13 countries that have actually done something to help with the price of fuel"". It said Germany had taken the equivalent of 25p a litre in tax off per litre of petrol, Italy 21p, Portugal 16p, and both Ireland and the Netherlands had cut duty by nearly 15p. Other governments have introduced fuel discounts that take effect when motorists are paying at forecourt tills, with Spain cutting prices by about 17p a litre and France 15p. The RAC said that of 15 European Union countries that have not taken action to cut fuel prices since March, all but six already charged less fuel duty than the UK, even after the 5p-a-litre cut. While petrol prices have begun to fall in recent weeks as wholesale costs decline, the RAC says UK's average price of 186p a litre makes it the joint second most expensive country behind Finland (190p) and level with Denmark (186p). ""This analysis lays bare an uncomfortable truth for the UK government - that compared to other European countries, it's pretty much done the least to support drivers through the current period of record high fuel prices,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. ""UK pump prices might be finally starting to fall, but the reductions so far are too little and too late, given the massive wholesale price drops retailers have been benefiting from for nearly two months. ""Drivers, many of whom depend heavily on their vehicles, need more help and they need it now."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Williams said that tax accounted for about 45% of the cost of a litre of petrol, through fuel duty and VAT. ""This is why we wanted the government to go further to lower the prices for drivers because it clearly has the scope and of course it's benefitting incredibly from the VAT take because the higher the wholesale price goes the more the chancellor collects."" He added that those driving in Europe on holiday this summer could be ""pleasantly surprised when they come to fill up"" as many fuel prices will ""far lower"" than in the UK. A government spokesperson said: ""We're helping households now through a Â£37bn package of support - protecting eight million of the most vulnerable families with direct payments of Â£1,200 this year, and providing additional payments to pensioners and disabled people. ""We also introduced our biggest ever cut to fuel duty, saving the average UK car driver around Â£100, van driver around Â£200 and haulier over Â£1,500. This is in addition to saving the typical employee over Â£330 a year through our National Insurance cut and allowing people on universal credit to keep Â£1,000 more of what they earn."" Earlier this year the government asked the UK's competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), to investigate the fuel market amid concerns the 5p cut in fuel duty was not being passed on to consumers. The CMA found the cut had been passed on to motorists, butit said it would investigate petrol and diesel pricingafter it found ""cause for concern in some parts"" of the industry, particularly a sharp rise in prices once fuel had been processed by oil refineries.

"Where did the stars in our night sky come from? Scientists have supercharged one of Earth's most powerful telescopes with new technology that will reveal how our galaxy formed in unprecedented detail. The William Herschel Telescope (WHT) in La Palma, Spain will be able to survey 1,000 stars per hour until it has catalogued a total of five million. A super-fast mapping device linked up to WHT will analyse the make-up of each star and the speed at which it travels. It will show how our Milky Way galaxy was built up over billions of years. Prof Gavin Dalton of Oxford University has spent more than a decade developing the instrument, known as 'Weave'. He told me that he was ""beyond excited"" that it is ready to go. ""It's a fantastic achievement from a lot of people to make this happen and it's great to have it working,"" he said. ""The next step is the new adventure, it's brilliant!"" Cosmic Hunters: Searching Space BBC Science Correspondent Pallab Ghosh meets the scientists on a mission to discover where the stars we see in the night sky came from Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Weave's nimble robotic fingers position a thousand fibre optics precisely, each one pointed at a star Weave has been installed on the WHT, which sits high on a mountain top on the Spanish Canary Island of La Palma. The name stands for WHT Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer - and that's exactly what it does. It has 80,000 separate parts and is a miracle of engineering. For each patch of sky the WHT is pointed at, astronomers identify the positions of a thousand stars. Weave's nimble robotic fingers then carefully place a fibre-optic - a light-transmitting tube - precisely on each location on a plate, pointing towards its corresponding star. These fibres are in effect tiny telescopes. Each one captures light from a single star and channels it to another instrument. This then splits it into a rainbow spectrum, which contains the secrets of the star's origin and history. All this is completed in just one hour. While this is going on, fibre optics for the next thousand stars are positioned on the reverse side of the plate, which flips over to analyse the next set of targets once the previous survey has been completed. Artwork: The Milky Way is surrounded by ""dwarf"" satellite galaxies Our galaxy is a dense spiral swirl of up to 400 billion stars. But it started out as a relatively small collection of stars. It grew from successive mergers with other small galaxies over billions of years. As well as the addition of stars from the new galaxies joining ours, each merger stirs things up enough to lead to brand new star formation. Weave is able to calculate the speed, direction, age and composition of each star it observes, essentially creating a motion picture of stars moving in the Milky Way. According to Prof Dalton, by extrapolating backwards, it will be possible to reconstruct the entire formation of the Milky Way in detail never seen before. ""We'll be able to trace the  galaxies that have been absorbed as the Milky Way has been built up over cosmic time - and see how each absorption triggers new star formation,"" he said. Dr Marc Balcells, who is in overall charge of the WHT told BBC News that he believed that Weave would lead to a big shift in our understanding of how galaxies are made. ''We have been hearing for decades that we are in a golden era of astronomy - but what the future awaits is a lot more important. ""Weave is going to be answering questions that astronomers have been trying to answer for decades such as how many pieces come together to make a big galaxy and how many galaxies were united to make the Milky Way."" Instrumentation specialist Dr Cecilia Farina says that Weave might discover completely unexpected phenomena Dr Cecilia Farina, an instrumentation specialist on the project, said she believed that Weave would make astronomical history. ""There are an enormous amount of things that we are going to discover that we had not expected to find,"" she said. ""Because the Universe is full of surprises.""

"Telecoms regulator Ofcom has been urged to do more to help broadband and mobile customers who pay a ""loyalty penalty"" for staying with their provider. Some long-standing customers pay more than new customers for the same service and Citizens Advice wants action taken. In 2021, Ofcom estimated switching could save people Â£83 a year on mobile bills and Â£61 on broadband. A Citizens Advice survey of 3,087 UK people suggested up to one-in-seven may be paying a ""loyalty penalty"". Citizens Advice told BBC News the survey suggested one-in-three broadband customers and one-in-10 mobile customers with bundled contracts - who pay for their handset and airtime together - could be affected. Stopping the penalty, it argues, will make a big difference to hard-pressed households. Ofcom said that since it had introduced new rules requiring providers to send prompts to shop around, the number of out-of-contractbroadband customers has fallen by more than one million,external. It also said overpayment among mobile customers with bundled contracts had dropped by Â£100m, after operators committed to cut prices when initial contracts end. The regulator also requires companies to give details of their best annual deals to customers who stay with them without taking a new contract. Citizens Advice analysed 165,000 budgets of people who came to it for debt help. Its findings suggested that those with the lowest incomes spent almost double the proportion of their income on telecoms, when compared to the highest earners. The charity cited the example of Tracey, who it said is reliant on disability benefits. According to Citizens Advice, she signed up to a Â£30-a-month package which included TV, landline, broadband and international calls in 2006. In January, she started going through her bills looking for potential savings, and found its cost had risen to Â£80. ""Everything is going up; gas, electric, food and I have a mortgage to pay. I shop late in the evenings to get yellow-sticker discounted food, I turned off my gas as I can't afford to repair the boiler or use the heating, and I don't go anywhere other than my hospital appointments,"" she told Citizens Advice. ""New customers pay Â£50 less than me for the same deal. I have paid nearly Â£3,000 more for being a loyal customer. How on earth can they justify me paying so much more - especially as I was with them for 16 years?"" Mike Emmett, who runs training for advisers at Citizens Advice Cardiff & Vale, said: ""Many people see their mobile and broadband as a lifeline. They need them to speak to people and do things like manage their universal credit account, and help children with their homework."" He said many were reluctant to switch out of fear of ""rocking the boat, particularly because of the prospect of credit checks"". ""It's so frustrating when we see people who are on the lowest incomes paying the loyalty penalty, as they're forced to jump through so many hoops to try and sort it."" Cost of living: Inside the 'foodbank' for data Broadband firms 'must do more on social tariffs' In January theFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA) effectively endedgradual year-on-year increases, so-called ""price walking"", for car and home insurance by requiring companies to automatically switch their customers to better deals. Citizens Advice is looking for similar action from other regulators. Ofcom said its focus was on making sure customers can get the best deal. It said switching to a new deal when an existing one ends can result in significant savings and that it had taken action to make the process simpler and quicker - a""One Touch Switch"",externalsystem is also due to be introduced in April 2023. Ofcom added: ""There is also a moral imperative on providers to support out-of-contract customers suffering financial hardship, and it is vital they do all they can to help them secure a deal that is more affordable."" In February, Ofcom found that 4.2 million households could halve broadband bills by taking up social tariffs, low-cost deals offered by broadband firms to people on low incomes, but only 55,000 homes had in fact done so. Ofcom wants firms to promote these deals more widely. The Internet Service Providers Association - a UK trade body representing many broadband firms - said industry efforts had led to ""more customers than ever"" switching. It said its members were determined to help customers through the cost of living crisis and urged those struggling with bills to contact their provider.
