"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Turkey says it has shared recordings related to the murder of the journalist and writer Jamal Khashoggi with the US, the UK, Saudi Arabia and others. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeated his assertion that Saudi Arabia knew who had killed Khashoggi. Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi rulers, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. Saudi Arabia has admitted he was murdered there, but denied suggestions its royal family was involved. It had initially maintained the writer had left the consulate unharmed. Is Saudi crown prince finished? The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Jamal Khashoggi in his own words The Saudis have also denied comments allegedly made by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman describing Khashoggi as a dangerous Islamist. The reported phone call to the White House came before Saudi Arabia admitted Khashoggi had been killed. There is still no consensus on how Khashoggi died. He entered the consulate to sort out documents for his marriage. Initially, Turkish media had quoted sources as saying Turkey had audio recordings proving that Khashoggi had been tortured before being murdered. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi's fiancee: ""We didn't say any goodbyes"" Last week, however,Turkey said he had been strangled immediately after entering the consulateand his body dismembered ""in accordance with plans made in advance"". No body has been found and a Turkish official said it had been dissolved. Saudi Arabia has changed its account of what happened to Khashoggi. When he first disappeared, it said Khashoggi had walked out of the building alive. It later admitted he had been murdered, saying the killing was premeditated and a result of a ""rogue operation"". It has arrested 18 suspectswho, it says, will be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia. Turkey wants the suspects to be extradited. Turkey has not publicly blamed Saudi Arabia for the killing. ""We gave the recordings, we gave them to Saudi Arabia, we gave them to Washington, to the Germans, to the French, to the English,"" President Erdogan said in a televised speech on Saturday. ""They listened to the conversations which took place here, they know"", he said. No other country has admitted hearing the said recording. When asked by the BBC on Saturday, the UK Foreign Office neither confirmed nor denied being given copies of the tapes. Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e,Hatice Cengiz, has called on world leaders to ""bring the perpetrators to justice"",external. For decades, he was close to the Saudi royal family and also served as an adviser to the government. Who was Jamal Khashoggi? Excerpts from some of his columns But he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US last year. From there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of the crown prince. During a phone call with President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and national security adviser John Bolton,Prince Mohammed said Khashoggi had been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood,external, a transnational Islamist organisation, according to the Washington Post. The phone call is reported to have taken place on 9 October, a week after Khashoggi disappeared. Prince Mohammed also reportedly urged the White House to preserve the US-Saudi alliance. This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? In a statement to the newspaper, Khashoggi's family denied he had been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and said the murdered writer had himself denied this repeatedly in recent years. Saudi Arabia has faced a backlash over the death, including from its allies, who have called for answers. US President Donald Trump has said he is ""not satisfied"" with the Saudi account. However, he also said he was unwilling to sacrifice lucrative arms deals with the country. This video can not be played How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen? France has said it will impose sanctions, but given no details. Also in a meeting in Paris on Saturday, Mr Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron said the Saudi authorities should shed full light on the murder, Reuters quoted French presidential sources as saying. The two leaders also warned against further destabilisation of the Middle East as a result of the affair and expressed the hope that it could create an opportunity for a resolution to the war in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has saidKhashoggi's murder had ""possibly"" given the US and the UK a chance to put new pressure on Saudi Arabiaover other issues. Is Saudi crown prince finished?

"The women cheered on their team, Persepolis, from separate stands Hundreds of Iranian women have been allowed to attend the Asia Champions League final in Tehran, Iran's semi-official Isna news agency reports. The move is being seen as a possible end to more than 35 years of exclusion of women from top matches. Most were said to be relatives of players or members of women's teams. They watched the local team Persepolis lose to Japan's Kashima Antlers. Football's world governing body Fifa is working with Iran to end the ban. Last month about 100 women were allowed to watch a friendly between Iran and Bolivia, but restrictions were quickly reinstated. In March this year35 women were detained for trying to attend a match between Persepolis and fellow Tehran team Esteqlal. Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino, was also in attendance at that match, along with Iranian Sport Minister Masoud Soltanifar. Iranian women refused entry to match despite holding tickets What happens when sport and politics collide in Iran Iranian women and girls have rarely been allowed at men's sporting events since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and have not been able to attend top football matches since 1981. Iranian women have been urged to protest about their ban from stadiums Female fans from other countries have, however, been allowed to attend some games. Open Stadiums, a group which campaigns for access to venues for women in Iran, handed a petition to Fifa this week signed by more than 200,000 people, Reuters news agency reported.

"This video can not be played Macron gave Trump a slightly awkward leg pat after defending his idea of a European army Donald Trump and France's Emmanuel Macron have both said Europe should pay more of its defence costs, a day after the US president attacked the idea of a European army. Mr Trump is in Paris ahead of events marking the end of World War One. He said the US wanted ""a strong Europe,"" but the defence bill ""has been largely on the United States."" Mr Macron said he agreed that ""we need a much better burden-sharing within Nato"" - the Euro-Atlantic alliance. ""When President Trump has to protect one of the states of the United States he doesn't ask France or Germany or another country to finance. That's why I do believe that we need more investments,"" he said.

""I want to build a real security dialogue with Russia, which is a country I respect, a European country - but we must have a Europe that can defend itself on its own without relying only on the United States."" In the interview with French radio station Europe 1 on Tuesday, Mr Macron mentioned ""re-emerging authoritarian powers"" that were well-armed on Europe's borders, ""attempted attacks in cyberspace and interference in our democratic lives"", concluding: ""We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America."" Mr Trump responded angrily in a Friday night tweet, writing: ""President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US, China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the US subsidizes greatly!""

"This video can not be played Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron shared a tender moment in a ceremony at the site where the Armistice was signed French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have left their own mark of reconciliation at the start of events to mark the centenary of the end of World War One. They signed a book of remembrance in a railway carriage identical to the one in which the 1918 Armistice was sealed. US President Donald Trump is among world leaders attending the events. But Mr Trump caused controversy by cancelling a trip to a US cemetery on Saturday because of bad weather. The day had a tense beginning amid a row between Mr Trump and Mr Macron over European defence. The French leader said the EU needed a joint army now that the US was pulling out of a key disarmament treaty with Russia. Armistice Day commemorations in France May pays respects to WW1 fallen in France and Belgium What does the US contribute to Nato? Mr Trump described the comments as insulting and said Europe should pay its share of costs within Nato, the Euro-Atlantic alliance. After a meeting at the ElysÃ©e Palace, Mr Macron said he agreed that Europe should pay more. Mrs Merkel became the first German leader since World War Two to visit the forest near the town of CompiÃ¨gne in northern France where the Armistice was signed. She and Mr Macron unveiled a plaque to Franco-German reconciliation, laid a wreath and signed a book of remembrance in a replica railway carriage. The original wagon, on which it was modelled, was used by Adolf Hitler to accept France's capitulation to Nazi Germany in June 1940. Mrs Merkel was the first post-war German leader to visit the CompiÃ¨gne site Around 70 world leaders are gathering in Paris for the events. Mr Macron will lead the main event of the centenary - a sombre commemoration on Sunday at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a memorial to France's fallen under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Sunday afternoon will see Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel attend a peace conference - the Paris Peace Forum - with leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

But he cancelled his trip to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial due to ""scheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather"". White House officials later explained that low cloud would have prevented his helicopter from landing, and cited security concerns about arranging a motorcade to the site. Gen. John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, attended on the president's behalf. The decision attracted much derision on social media, including from President George W Bush speechwriter David Frum who, like many, drew comparisons with the conditions faced by the troops who fought and died in World War One.

Mr Macron went on to mention threats to Europe, including ""re-emerging authoritarian powers"" that were well-armed on Europe's borders, and attempts to launch cyber-attacks, before concluding: ""We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America."" Mr Trump responded angrily in a Friday night tweet, writing: ""President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US, China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the US subsidizes greatly!""

"Little Mix have split from Simon Cowell's record label days before the release of their new album. The X Factor-winners, Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson and Leigh-Anne Pinnock, will no longer work with Syco. They'll move to the label RCA, which is part of the larger Sony Group, which also includes Syco. It is said to be down to problems between Simon Cowell's label and Little Mix's management company, Modest. A spokeswoman for Simon Cowell said: ""Syco Music will no longer work with Modest Management and therefore any artists signed to that management company. ""We do, of course, wish all artists affected by this decision every future success. ""Consequently, LM5, the forthcoming Little Mix album A&R'd [promoted] and released on Syco Music, is to be serviced by RCA at the request of Syco and Simon Cowell."" Little Mix perform with Nicki Minaj at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2018 in Bilbao, Spain It's believed the group have had disagreements with Simon Cowell's label over the making of their new record and their musical direction. Fuelling fans' suspicions the group may be about to leave Syco earlier this week, Jesy liked an Instagram post captioned ""they're gonna leave Syco"". And other fans appear delighted at the news of the split.

Little Mix, whose latest single, Woman Like Me is currently number three in the official UK singles charts, shot to fame after winning X Factor in 2011. They originally auditioned for series eight as solo artists and were all rejected during bootcamp. But their judge, Tulisa along with fellow mentor, Kelly Rowland, decided to give them another go and put them together as a group, called Rhythmix. They later changed their title as it became clear a charity had the same name. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

"Military funeral corteges were a common sight for communities during World War One On 11 November 1918, as news of the end of World War One spread across the world, the parents of Wilfred Owen received notice that their son had been killed in action. The second lieutenant, who would become known as one of England's greatest war poets, had died while trying to lead his men across a canal at Ors seven days earlier. He was one of thousands of servicemen killed in the last month of the war, and their deaths, coming as they did so close to the end of hostilities, seem to have a particularly heartbreaking quality. The University of Oxford'sprofessor emeritus of English Jon Stallworthy wrote in 2004,externalthat the ""socially concerned"" poets of the 1930s gave Owen ""the status of saint and martyr"", adding that he ""came to represent a generation of innocent young men sacrificed - as it seemed to a generation in unprecedented rebellion against its fathers - by guilty old men"". However, Gervase Phillips, Manchester Metropolitan University's principal lecturer in history, said the reaction at the time was quite different. ""Authors often point to the peculiar poignancy that when the Owens received the telegram informing them of Wilfred's death, all the church bells were sounding to mark the Armistice. ""Yet to those who had lived through the conflict, and experienced so much loss, I am not sure these deaths were felt any more keenly."" Wilfred Owen was killed after returning to the front following treatment for shell shock Hindsight also attributes huge significance to Owen's death, but it must be remembered that, at the time, he was not well-known and so the tragedy was felt only by his family and friends - and they were far from alone in experiencing such grief. Capt Robert Bartholomew, who was the editor of the wartime Canadian Hospital News, read about the death of his only son in a newspaper three months before the end of the war. An account of what happened next,externalstated that the news caused him to have a nervous breakdown and drop into a ""severe depression"" due to the ""mental shock"". He had previously written that the parents of those killed would feel ""sorrow and pain"", but would also ""be able to look back with a feeling of pride and say: 'They died for God, for King and Country'"". And despite his severe reaction to the loss of his son, that sentiment did not seem to change, as a few weeks after hearing the news, an editorial in the publication declared with pride that ""sons have died by thousands and will continue to die by thousands if necessary, until victory is assured"". The Armistice came into effect at 11:00 on 11 November 1918 Mr Phillips said while a modern reader might judge such a stance as bravado, and more widely see those deaths in the final months of the war as futile, it was important to remember there was no ""unconditional surrender"" at the end of the war and an Allied victory was far from assured until its very last moments. He said the Armistice ""was not certain until about 05:00 on the morning of the 11th"", though talk of it had been ""widespread throughout the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) since at least 9 November"". ""Think of the ending of the war as a process, rather than a distinct moment,"" the academic said. ""Bulgaria agreed an armistice with the Allies on 30 September, the Ottoman Empire agreed one on 30 October and the Habsburgs (the rulers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) on 3 November. ""The 'direction of travel' was clear, [but] the Germans still hoped to negotiate the best possible terms for a ceasefire right up until the end. ""So the BEF's victory at the [second] Battle of the Sambre on 4 November, where Owen was killed, the American advance to the heights overlooking Sedan and the French capture of the strategic railhead at Hirson by 9 November, were all instrumental in persuading the German delegation to agree to the Armistice."" Confirming the actual number of Allied deaths in the run-up to the Armistice is problematic. Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire, a book published in 1922, listed 6,064 deaths between 1 and 11 November 1918, with a further 2,008 men listed as missing, but the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's (CWGC) database now records 15,002 graves with death dates in those 11 days. Mr Phillips said ""recordkeeping at the front was, inevitably, suspect [as] it wasn't a great environment for bureaucracy, and trying to establish the record retrospectively, on the basis of documentation that may be incomplete or inaccurate, is no easy task"". He said thousands of soldiers ""effectively disappeared"" towards the end of the war and ""very often no-one knew exactly what had befallen them or precisely when"". ""Some subsequently turned up - in a hospital or perhaps in a POW camp - but many were simply recorded as 'missing, presumed killed' - and they still are."" This video can not be played Pte David McKie, 19, died on the last day of World War One Funerals for the fallen were held along the Western Front during the war Among those who died in those last days were three soldiers who were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Sgt Hugh Cairns was killed after capturing a machine-gun at Valenciennes on 2 November, while two days later, 2nd Lt James Kirk andActing Lt Col James Marshalldied in the same action as Owen. Lt Kirk was killed while supporting troops crossing the Oise canal, and Col Marshall died leading his men across a bridge on the waterway. Bugle marks centenary of war poet's death Danny Boyle to stage WW1 beach memorial WW1: One of the last men to die But far from being seen as needless, their deaths were recorded in the press with the same pride as any of the hundreds that had come before and were welcomed in the same way as the others by the general public, Mr Phillips said. Such a reaction was understandable, given that the end of the war came as something of a surprise to most of both those who were fighting and their families. Mr Philips said the most surprising thing was ""how suddenly the war stopped on the dot"". An account by Gen Sir Archibald Montgomery recorded that ""the firing, which had been heavy all the morning, continued until three minutes to 11:00 when it ceased for a short period and then broke out in a final crash"". He also recorded the ""final act"" of a German machine-gunner, who, at two minutes to 11:00, had ""fired off a complete belt without pause"", before standing, taking off his his helmet, bowing and walking ""slowly to the rear"". The news of the Armistice was greeted with relief and delight by troops However, Mr Phillips said the war had been a ""brutalising business"" and there were also ""some instances"" where there was ""a desire not to stop fighting"". An account of the BEF's 8th Division's actions includes details of a company coming across an occupied German post at precisely 11:00. ""The men were persuaded with difficulty to refrain from attacking it,"" the account records, adding that it was ""their earnest contention being that no-one needs know anything about it and that it seemed a pity not to kill a few more Germans while they had the chance"". It also must be remembered that the war continued to claim lives after the Armistice. News of the ceasefire took time to filter to all the areas involved, and fighting continued for some time after 11:00 in places such as Russia and Mesopotamia (an area that covers parts of modern-day Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey). A large number of soldiers also succumbed to wounds or illness in the days and weeks following the end of the war. The CWGC database lists 10,991 graves with death dates between 12 and 30 November 1918 and a further 47,510 listed between 1 December 1918 and 10 January 1920, the day the Treaty of Versailles, the formal document that officially ended the war, came into effect. And so the Armistice might have silenced the guns, but it did not entirely stop the fatalities.

"Three adults and a one-year-old boy who were travelling in the VW Touran died in the crash Three adults and a one-year-old boy have died in a crash with a car that had been tailed by police. A VW Golf collided with a VW Touran people carrier turning right on to Bannham Road towards Darnall, Sheffield, on Friday night. The Golf had been followed by police minutes before the crash. Three passengers in the Touran were also injured, including a three-year-old girl who was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries. A 22-year-old woman from the Touran is in a critical condition and a second woman from the Touran is in a serious but stable condition. Three males travelling in the Golf, aged 23, 17 and 18, suffered minor injuries in the crash, which happened shortly after 20:50 GMT. The three males travelling in the VW Golf, aged 23, 17 and 18, suffered minor injuries in the crash They have been arrested and remain in custody. From the Touran, two men aged 35 and 50, one of whom was the driver, and a 41-year-old woman, all died at the scene. A one-year-old boy who had also been in the Touran died later in hospital. Two families are believed to have been travelling in the people carrier, South Yorkshire Police said. The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), has started an investigation. Regional director Miranda Biddle said: ""As soon as we were informed, we sent investigators to the scene and we will be carrying out an independent investigation to establish what actions South Yorkshire Police took prior to the crash. ""This is standard procedure when lives are lost following an incident involving the police."" ""There is no indication that the police vehicle collided with either of the vehicles involved,"" she added. The IOPC said it had spoken to the officers involved and taken statements. Police investigating this crash have described it as horrific and have, as far as possible, kept people away from the wreckages of the two vehicles. Officers have thanked the local community for their response, bringing the emergency services tea and water, but have urged people to remain respectful and mindful of the material they share on social media. Det Ch Insp Jude Ashmore, of South Yorkshire Police, said he was thinking of the victims' families following the ""incredibly tragic accident"". ""Our priority now is to support the victims' families and those affected, and work hard to determine the exact circumstances around what happened,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Fleeing through flames: 'I'm so scared right now... so terrified' At least 11 people have died in the most destructive wildfires ripping through north and south California. More than 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes to avoid three major blazes in the state. Firefighters were powerless in stopping a wildfire destroying the northern town of Paradise, where nine people died and 35 are missing. Another fire swept into the affluent southern beach resort of Malibu on Friday and has now doubled in size. Two more people were reported to have died in that fire, known as the Woolsey, which now covers an area of 70,000 acres (28,000 hectares). Among the towns under evacuation orders is Thousand Oaks, wherea gunman killed 12 people in a rampage on Wednesday. In pictures: Wildfire rages in Malibu Watch: The long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly ""The magnitude of the destruction of the fire is unbelievable and heartbreaking,"" said Mark Ghilarducci, of the California governor's office. President Trump has responded by blaming what he called gross mismanagement of the forests and warned of funding cuts. Meteorologists have warned that dangerous conditions may continue well into next week, but firefighters are hoping to take advantage of a temporary lull in the wind fanning the flames. The blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. Another blaze, the Hill Fire, started at about the same time, also near Thousand Oaks. This video can not be played 'How much more can this town endure?' - deadly wildfire hits Thousand Oaks, where 12 people were killed in a mass shooting On Friday, the flames jumped Highway 101 and headed into coastal areas. All residents have been ordered to evacuate. Los Angeles County sheriff's Chief John Benedict said on Saturday that two people had been found dead but provided no details on the deaths. Malibu and nearby Calabasas are home to many celebrities. The actor Martin Sheen was briefly reported missing but later found on the beach. Allow Twitter content?

The 20,000-acre (8,100-hectare) fire north of Sacramento started in the Plumas National Forest on Thursday and quickly engulfed the town of Paradise. Residents fled for their lives as more than 6,700 homes and businesses were destroyed, making the fire the most destructive in the state's history.

""There's nothing left standing,"" said Scott Maclean, the state's forestry and fire protection spokesman. The fire has now been partially contained. By the BBC's James Cook, Paradise in California Paradise is hell. A smouldering, sepia world in ruins. The air is acrid. Burning chemicals leave a bitter taste in your mouth. Walking among the ashes of people's lives is eerie and awful. There is a profound sadness here. We pass a child's charred swing, a swimming pool filled with filth, and worst of all, a pet dog which did not survive. Such was the intensity of the blaze that much of the debris is hard to recognise. Wafers of ash are drifting down like enormous snowflakes, smothering sound. But it is not quite silent here. A sooty squirrel scrambles up a blackened tree in a panic. There are booms and creaks from burning trees and telegraph poles. And soon, going from ruin to ruin, there will be the sound of those with the hardest job of all, checking to see if anyone was left behind. Fire officials have also issued evacuation notices for parts of Chico, a town of 93,000 people north of Sacramento. The three blazes are among 16 currently active fires in California,external. Officials have put most of Northern California under a Red Flag Warning, which means ""extreme fire behaviour"" can occur within 24 hours. The region has grappled with serious wildfires in recent years, including the worst in the state's history - the Mendocino fire in 2018.

"This video can not be played A dad about to push his goalkeeper son to stop the ball going into the net When Phil Hatfield was watching his son, six, play football, he could not resist giving him a ""helping"" hand. Little did he know the moment would be seen by more than 18 million people. The video of the children's game between Bow Street and Llanilar, near Aberystwyth, shows under-8s goalkeeper Osian saving a shot - but only after being pushed on to the ball. Mr Hatfield told BBC Wales he would be staying on the touchline and keeping quiet during future games. ""All the action had been on the other half of the field... he hadn't had much to do,"" he said. ""So I went over to try and keep him focused, keep him going and shouting instructions... he came towards me because he hadn't heard what I said and [I was] just trying to guide him back to position, and he fell over."" Former Wales and Everton goalkeeper Neville Southall offered some advice for budding goalie Osian, tweeting: ""Keep hold of first ball"". Allow Twitter content?

News channels as far away as Australia have been showing the video. Bow Street Magpies, in their first season of existence, had scored their first ever goals to lead 2-0. Unfortunately for Osian, a Llanilar player knocked in the rebound from his save to halve the lead before a second goal saw the game finish 2-2. Coach Amlyn Ifans admitted he missed the goal because he was ""bent over"" laughing However, Magpies coach Amlyn Ifans said they were still happy to pick up their first league point. ""We were bent over laughing so much that we didn't see the lad put the ball in the net,"" he said. ""It wasn't out of the coaching manual... but it was perfect timing. ""After speaking to the parents they saw the funny side of it and knowing that Osian was quite happy, we've all had a good laugh."" But the push could get the club into trouble with football authorities. A Football Association of Wales spokesperson said: ""While we appreciate that this video has gone viral and that many find it humorous, the FAW has a code of conduct for parents, guardians and spectators.

More women than ever before won seats in Congress in the 2018 mid-terms. What does it mean for Congress - and America? But Ms Ocasio-Cortez isn't the first lawmaker coming to Congress to make waves about the high rent in the city. Washington DC regularly features in the list of top 10 most expensive cities to rent. A one-bedroom apartment costs about $2,160 (Â£1,660) per month,according to Business Insider.,external One in five children in the district live in a household that is extremely low-income and lacks an affordable home. Housing affordability is an issue nationwide. More than 38 million households struggle to afford their housing,one Harvard report found,external. A well-located, one-bedroom apartment in the capital can cost $2,160 per month Members of Congress are paid $174,000 (Â£134,000), but many cite the need to maintain a home in their congressional district in addition to Washington as a reason for their financial hardship. In 2015 Representative Kristi Noem told NPR that she sleeps on a pullout bed in her Capitol Hill office when Congress is in session. The 'couch caucus' has made headlines over the years in its criticisms of the unaffordability of Washington, including outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan, who says he slept in his office for years. Estimates have put the number of politicians snoozing where they work at between 40 and 50. In May legislation banning the practice was proposed in the House of Representatives, and suggested that lawmakers should receive tax deductions for their living expenses while in Washington. Some get around the problem by finding housemates. One famous house-share saw numerous Democrats coming and going over the years, including senators Richard Durbin and Charles Schumer, and became the topic of the 2013 TV series Alpha House about four fictional Republican politicians. Ms Ocasio-Cortez has allayed her followers' worries, tweeting ""don't worry btw - we're working it out"". House-sharing into her thirties would certainly make the politician the bona fide millennial.

"This video can not be played Macron gave Trump a slightly awkward leg pat after defending his idea of a European army Donald Trump and France's Emmanuel Macron have both said Europe should pay more of its defence costs, a day after the US president attacked the idea of a European army. Mr Trump is in Paris ahead of events marking the end of World War One. He said the US wanted ""a strong Europe,"" but the defence bill ""has been largely on the United States."" Mr Macron said he agreed that ""we need a much better burden-sharing within Nato"" - the Euro-Atlantic alliance. ""When President Trump has to protect one of the states of the United States he doesn't ask France or Germany or another country to finance. That's why I do believe that we need more investments,"" he said. Around 70 world leaders are gathering in Paris for events marking the Armistice that ended World War One, which was signed 100 years ago this Sunday. Armistice Day commemorations in France May pays respects to WW1 fallen in France and Belgium What does the US contribute to Nato? This video can not be played Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron shared a tender moment in a ceremony at the site where the Armistice was signed The Trump-Macron show of unity came despite earlier tensions, triggered when the French leader said the EU needed a joint army now that the US was pulling out of a key disarmament treaty with Russia. ""I want to build a real security dialogue with Russia, which is a country I respect, a European country - but we must have a Europe that can defend itself on its own without relying only on the United States."" In the interview with French radio station Europe 1 on Tuesday, Mr Macron mentioned ""re-emerging authoritarian powers"" that were well-armed on Europe's borders, ""attempted attacks in cyberspace and interference in our democratic lives"", concluding: ""We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America."" Mr Trump responded angrily in a Friday night tweet, writing: ""President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US, China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the US subsidizes greatly!"" This video can not be played The ups and downs of Trump and Macron Mr Macron has already raised spending considerably to meet Nato target of 2% of the GDP going to defence. He is also overseeing the formation of a European Intervention Initiative , a 10-nation endeavour, which is backed by Germany and the UK. After an hour of talks between the two leaders and lunch with their wives Melania and Brigitte, Mr Trump had been scheduled to visit two American cemeteries over the weekend, but later cancelled his trip to Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial due to ""scheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather"". The White House said that Gen John Kelly, its chief of staff, would attend on the president's behalf. The decision attracted much derision on social media, including from former George W Bush speechwriter David Frum who like many drew comparisons with the conditions faced by the troops who fought and died in World War One.

"Most plug-in hybrids in the UK are bought for company fleets Tens of thousands of plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) bought with generous government grants may be burning as much fuel as combustion-engine cars. âData compiled for the BBC suggests that such vehicles in corporate fleets averaged just 40 miles per gallon (mpg), when they could have done 130. Many drivers may never have unwrapped their charging cables, The Miles Consultancy said. Subsidies for new PHEVs were recently scrapped, after seven years. The plug-in grant was introduced in 2011, gifting buyers up to Â£4,500 off new cars. The incentive helped the UK become the biggest market for PHEVs in Europe. The majority of the tens of thousands of eligible vehicles sold were bought by company fleets, including more than 70% of the 37,000 plug-in hybrids sold so far in 2018. But data from The Miles Consultancy, a Cheshire firm which advises 300 blue-chip companies on fuel management, reveals that many businesses simply used the grant to save on buying regular cars. When regularly charged, PHEVs can achieve more than 130 miles per gallon Mileage records from 1,500 models, including Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Volvo vehicles, showed an average real-world mpg of 39.27, against an average manufacturer advertised mpg of 129.68. Figures for 2,432 hybrids - including non plug-in varieties - showed an average real-world mpg of 49.06, still vastly lower than the potential range. ""There are some examples where employees aren't even charging these vehicles up,"" said Paul Hollick, The Miles Consultancy's managing director. ""The charge cables are still in the boot, in a cellophane wrapper, while the company and the employee are going in and out of petrol stations, paying for all of this additional fuel. This practice, he added, was ""ridiculous"". The UK government subsidised plug in hybrids for seven years The British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), which represents many fleets, said higher taxes on diesel cars incentivised companies to buy plug-ins, even if they had no intention of using their electric capability. ""We unfortunately have got a situation where a poorly designed tax regime is driving some poor behaviours,"" said Toby Poston, âthe BVRLA's communications director. ""We have got some situations where company drivers are choosing the vehicle based on their tax liability, rather than having the right vehicle for the right job."" Some companies, he explained, were buying PHEVs - which are best suited to local trips - for employees who did a lot of motorway driving. When presented with The Miles Consultancy's findings, a Department for Transport spokesperson said the government believed plug-in hybrids ""bring significant environmental benefits"", but would ""now focus its support on zero emission models like pure electric and hydrogen fuel cell cars"". Plug-in hybrid vehicles continue to receive some government support, through lower car tax rates, grants for charging infrastructure and, in some local authorities, free parking. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reiterated its dismay at the scrapping of the plug-in car grant.

"This video can not be played WW1: The forgotten hero MP A forgotten hero has finally been remembered on Parliament's World War One memorial. The marble installation recognises the sacrifice of peers, MPs, MPs' sons, and senior officers of Parliament, who died in service during the Great War. But 96 years after its completion, a leading historian realised one MP had been left off. Now Lieutenant Gerald Arbuthnot, once the Conservative MP for Burnley, has had his name belatedly added. Armistice: The solider who died on the last day of WW1 Armistice Day: Forgotten letters from WW1 Wilfred Owen and the pain of the last deaths The 44-year-old was killed in action in 1916 during the Battle of the Somme. Dr Kathryn Rix, from the History of Parliament Trust, spotted his name's absence from the memorial and said it's not clear why he was forgotten. ""I think perhaps it was because he wasn't an MP for very long,"" she said. ""Perhaps people didn't remember he was an MP between January and December 1910. ""Also he was a former MP at the time and they weren't originally added to the memorial in 1921. ""But then some former MPs were added in 1922, so really, he should have been added at that time. ""They just forgot him - which is rather sad - but now he is being remembered."" Lt Arbuthnot's name was belatedly added to the memorial, 96 years after its completion The marble memorial is known as the Recording Angel The historian had been researching the stories of parliamentarians killed in action during the war when she realised a name was missing from the memorial, known as the Recording Angel, which was designed by Sir Bertram Mackennal in 1921. She had a list of 24 members and former members of Parliament who had died but noticed only 23 on the memorial in St Stephen's Porch, Westminster Hall. She said all of Parliament's official documents and guidebooks will now need to be amended, adding: ""It's really nice to have added him now. I feel very proud."" After unsuccessfully contesting the seat in 1906, Gerald Arbuthnot was elected as the Conservative MP for Burnley in January 1910. However he lost the seat in December of the same year during a second election. He chose not to stand again, but remained in politics in other ways until the outbreak of war, when he joined the Navy. But Dr Rix explained: ""He's unusual amongst the MPs who died in that he served in the Navy, He'd served in the Navy as a young man, and at the start of the war he joined the Royal Naval Reserve. ""He was initially with their press bureau, but that wasn't involved enough in the fighting for him. So he joined a minesweeping division and commanded minesweepers in the North Sea for 15 months. ""But he was very keen to go and have active engagement with the enemy. So he secured a commission in the Grenadier guards in January 1916."" By May, the former MP was fighting at Ypres before heading south to the Somme, with the 2nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards. On 25 September 1916, he was involved in a second attack on the village of Les Boeufs. Lt Arbuthnot and three other officers went forward to cut through barbed wire, because it had not been sufficiently damaged by the British artillery bombardment. Dr Rix explained: ""This was a job that they knew meant almost certain death. Arbuthnot and three other officers went forward. Three of them were killed."" The soldier is buried in the Citadel New Military Cemetery in Fricourt. Despite memorial services for him in Burnley and at St Margaret's Church in Westminster, his name was never added to Parliament's memorial. With the error noticed just weeks before the 100th anniversary of the Armistice, extended members of Lt Arbuthnot's family have welcomed his name being added. His distant cousin James - now Lord Arbuthnot - was himself an MP for 28 years. But in all that time, he never realised the memorial he routinely passed should have carried his relative's name. Long read:The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline Video:War footage brought alive in colour Interactive:,externalWhat would you have done between 1914 and 1918? Living history:Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended Lord Arbuthnot said: ""I didn't know of him, though my brother did - he's the family genealogist. ""It's an extraordinary story. He was part of a generation who truly believed in duty and serving their country. ""It feels very good - an extra bit of knowledge about what members of Parliament, what my family, did in that war has come to light and we can remember him properly now. ""We're very proud. Though I always remember my grandfather who died at Ypres in 1915, to know there was also Gerald Arbuthnot is really very nice. ""There were a number of my family members killed in the First World War. It's just good to be able to join him to the family memory."" In total, 264 MPs or former MPs served in World War One, with 23 of these making the ultimate sacrifice. In addition, 323 members of the Lords served, with 24 being killed (one of whom was also an MP - meaning some list 24 MPs as having died). Mark Collins, the Parliamentary estate's archivist and historian, said: ""With the work of the History of Parliament Trust, we're sure that we have all of the names of those peers and those MPs and the sons of MPs [who died].

"This exhibition at The Queen's Gallery in Buckingham Palace starts with a huge painting of a huge man: the aptly-named Peter the Great of Russia, the first Tsar to leave his country in over 100 years. The catalogue says it presents us with ""a tall, virile, handsome warrior"". Sir Godfrey Kneller's portrait of Tsar Peter I (1672-1725), who was the first Russian ruler to visit England The diplomat Prince Boris Kurakin (1676-1727) was similarly enamoured with the artwork. He said: ""The famed portrait of His Czarish Majesty standing in all his imperial armour and so attractive, that I have nowhere seen its equal."" I do not share their view. Godfrey Kneller's very grand and historically significant picture depicts a bug-eyed, 6ft 7in, fey-looking 26-year-old who seems to be as much at home in his suit of armour as Ann Widdecombe was on Strictly Come Dancing. The painting was Peter's gift to the English king, William III, to mark his three-month-long fact-finding visit to England in 1698. The ambitious young ruler was keen to build a Russian navy from scratch to match those of the great European powers. William III was happy to overlook Peter the Great's wayward behaviour So he rented a house in Deptford from the writer and diarist John Evelyn, a chum of Samuel Pepys, and set about learning all there was to know about shipbuilding at the local dockyard, while hoovering up tips on navigation from the nearby Royal Observatory at Greenwich. The trip was a tremendous success for Peter, who, by the end of his reign, had 28,000 men serving 49 ships and around 800 smaller boats. It wasn't so good for John Evelyn, though. His majestic tenant had a rock star's approach to renting: paintings were used for target practice, wheelbarrows as go-karts, and the furniture - that which remained - was left in more pieces than a jigsaw of St Petersburg. William III was happy to overlook the wayward behaviour of his Russian opposite number, seeing the empire-building emperor as an important strategic ally and valued trading partner. And so began a diplomatic relationship between the two monarchies that would span centuries, marriages, wars and the exchanges of many gifts and paintings. The coronation portrait of Empress Catherine II (1729-1796), by Vigilius Eriksen, was believed to have been given to King George III On the whole, it is the gifts and subsequent purchases of Russian objects made by the British Royal Family that are the stars of this show. The paintings are a mixed bag - some good, some bad, none great. Quite unlike the cabinets full of pieces by the Russian jeweller Peter Carl FabergÃ©, which are exquisite. His pair of late 19th Century decanters topped off with silver dolphins with mouths formed into spouts are wonderful. As is the gold and blue moire guilloche enamel cigarette case, which is decorated with a diamond-set snake biting its tail, a symbol of everlasting love (it was given to King Edward VII by his mistress, Alice Keppel). And then there are the three Imperial FabergÃ© Eggs, the most striking of which is the Mosaic Egg and Surprise. The lattice-like exterior is not only the most beautiful piece of craftsmanship, but is also a profoundly sad vessel encapsulating a tragic event. Inside the egg, the ""surprise"" is an enamel portrait of five children in profile, on the reverse of which is a basket of flowers and an inscription of each of their names. Tsar Nicholas II commissioned it for his wife Alexandra - Queen Victoria's granddaughter - as an Easter present. The children it depicts are theirs. Mosaic Egg and Surprise (1914) by FabergÃ©, was originally commissioned by Nicholas II, and later bought by King George V and Queen Mary It was made in the spring of 1914 shortly before Russia became embroiled in World War One. Nicholas was not a great leader, nor a popular figure. Millions of Russian soldiers died, leading to revolution and his forced abdication in 1917. The provisional government confiscated the Mosaic Egg and Surprise. The Tsar asked the British Royal Family to rescue him - after all, the families went a long way back, as this exhibition demonstrates. King George V declined. On 17 July 1918, Tsar Nicholas, his wife and all five children were executed by Bolshevik guards. Fifteen years later, George V purchased the Mosaic Egg and Surprise from Cameo Corner, London, for Â£250. This is but one of the hundreds of historical events reflected in the objects and paintings in this rigorously researched exhibition. It is a grand tale of international relations and inter-family arrangements, of cultural exchange and competing agendas. The major players line the walls in over-the-top gilt frames, while the objects that fill the exhibition spaces tell their stories. Laurits Regner Tuxen's painting of the Marriage of Nicholas II, Emperor of Russia, in 1894, to Princess Alix of Hesse, who was Queen Victoria's granddaughter There are instances when the object is not as interesting as the piece of history it represents, but that is not the case in the sideshow of Roger Fenton photographs of the Crimean War that is connected to the main exhibition, which serves as a reminder that all was not always rosy in the 300-year Anglo-Russian relationship. Fenton's intelligently composed images of the soldiers and battlegrounds are as good as those produced on any subject since the birth of the medium. When you take into account the limitations of his equipment and the hostile environment in which he was using it, you quickly recognise that his photographs are remarkable. Having been commissioned by the print publishers Thomas Agnew & Sons to take pictures of British and French soldiers as source material for a studio painting by Thomas Barker, Fenton set off for the Crimea in the spring of 1855 with a makeshift, horse-drawn photographic van and an assistant. He organised group photographs, individual portraits and desolate landscapes strewn with the debris of war. The most famous photo is Valley of the Shadow of Death - a bleak and barren dirt track littered with cannonballs: an image of Armageddon. Valley of the Shadow of Death, 1855 by Roger Fenton, who places the viewer at the bottom of the ravine filled with cannonballs It is a haunting picture of war without any blood or bodies. His portrait of the unlucky Lord Balgonie, who stares out into the middle distance in wide-eyed confusion, is thought to be the first image taken of shellshock. Roger Fenton's photograph of Lord Balgonie in 1855, is thought to be the first visual record of someone suffering from ""shell shock"" There are few occasions in the exhibition where a Fenton photograph is hung beside a picture an artist has produced from it - and the comparison is illuminating. It brings home Fenton's genius for finding the truth in his subject, and the utter hopelessness of the artist attempting to do the same. When he returned home, his Crimea photographs were much admired by Queen Victoria and her tech-savvy husband Prince Albert, who had previously commissioned the photographer to take portraits of the Royal Family. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, 1854, by Roger Fenton Being sensible people, they bought the lot.

"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Turkey says it has shared recordings related to the murder of the journalist and writer Jamal Khashoggi with the US, the UK, Saudi Arabia and others. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeated his assertion that Saudi Arabia knew who had killed Khashoggi. Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi rulers, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. Saudi Arabia has admitted he was murdered there, but denied suggestions its royal family was involved. It had initially maintained the writer had left the consulate unharmed. Is Saudi crown prince finished? The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Jamal Khashoggi in his own words The Saudis have also denied comments allegedly made by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman describing Khashoggi as a dangerous Islamist. The reported phone call to the White House came before Saudi Arabia admitted Khashoggi had been killed. There is still no consensus on how Khashoggi died. He entered the consulate to sort out documents for his marriage. Initially, Turkish media had quoted sources as saying Turkey had audio recordings proving that Khashoggi had been tortured before being murdered. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi's fiancee: ""We didn't say any goodbyes"" Last week, however,Turkey said he had been strangled immediately after entering the consulateand his body dismembered ""in accordance with plans made in advance"". No body has been found and a Turkish official said it had been dissolved. Saudi Arabia has changed its account of what happened to Khashoggi. When he first disappeared, it said Khashoggi had walked out of the building alive. It later admitted he had been murdered, saying the killing was premeditated and a result of a ""rogue operation"". It has arrested 18 suspectswho, it says, will be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia. Turkey wants the suspects to be extradited. Turkey has not publicly blamed Saudi Arabia for the killing. ""We gave the recordings, we gave them to Saudi Arabia, we gave them to Washington, to the Germans, to the French, to the English,"" President Erdogan said in a televised speech on Saturday. ""They listened to the conversations which took place here, they know"", he said. No other country has admitted hearing the said recording. When asked by the BBC on Saturday, the UK Foreign Office neither confirmed nor denied being given copies of the tapes. Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e,Hatice Cengiz, has called on world leaders to ""bring the perpetrators to justice"",external. For decades, he was close to the Saudi royal family and also served as an adviser to the government. Who was Jamal Khashoggi? Excerpts from some of his columns But he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US last year. From there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of the crown prince. During a phone call with President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and national security adviser John Bolton,Prince Mohammed said Khashoggi had been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood,external, a transnational Islamist organisation, according to the Washington Post. The phone call is reported to have taken place on 9 October, a week after Khashoggi disappeared. Prince Mohammed also reportedly urged the White House to preserve the US-Saudi alliance. This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? In a statement to the newspaper, Khashoggi's family denied he had been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and said the murdered writer had himself denied this repeatedly in recent years. Saudi Arabia has faced a backlash over the death, including from its allies, who have called for answers. US President Donald Trump has said he is ""not satisfied"" with the Saudi account. However, he also said he was unwilling to sacrifice lucrative arms deals with the country. This video can not be played How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen? France has said it will impose sanctions, but given no details. Also in a meeting in Paris on Saturday, Mr Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron said the Saudi authorities should shed full light on the murder, Reuters quoted French presidential sources as saying. The two leaders also warned against further destabilisation of the Middle East as a result of the affair and expressed the hope that it could create an opportunity for a resolution to the war in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels.

"An FGM ""cutter"" in Kenya shows the razorblade she uses to cut girls' genitals Rates of female genital mutilation (FGM) have fallen dramatically among girls in Africa in the last two decades, according to new research. The study, published in BMJ Global Health,external, cited a ""huge and significant decline"" among under-14s. The practice involves removing all or part of a girl or woman's external genitalia, including the clitoris. Some societies treat it as a rite of passage, but human rights groups say it is inhumane and physically dangerous. In the worst cases, victims can haemorrhage to death after they are cut, or die of infections. Chronic pain, infertility and menstrual problems can also follow, as well as potentially fatal childbirth complications. What does FGM actually involve? Botched FGM leaves 50 girls in hospital 'This is what it's like to pee after female genital mutilation' Unicef, the UN children's agency, estimates that 200 million women and girls have undergone FGM worldwide - mostly in parts of Africa and the Middle East. Using data from 29 countries and going back to 1990, the report's authors found that the biggest fall in cutting was in East Africa. The prevalence rate there dropped from 71% of girls under 14 in 1995, to 8% in 2016, the study said. Some countries with lower rates - including Kenya and Tanzania, where 3-10% of girls endure FGM - helped drive down the overall figure. This video can not be played Aged 8, Nice Leng'ete was destined to undergo female genital mutilation. But she fought back. This is her story. In North Africa, the rate fell from almost 60% in 1990 to 14% in 2015. West Africa also saw a significant drop, from 74% of girls in 1996, to 25% in 2017. However, campaigners have observed that while younger children are most at risk, older teenagers and young women are also affected by FGM - and the study did not include them. ""We are pleased to see that the numbers are coming down in a lot of countries,"" said Emma Lightowlers, a spokeswoman for the Africa-focused campaign group 28TooMany. ""But it doesn't tell the whole story and there are other groups where cutting takes place after the age of 14. ""It takes place in teenagers, or in fact, even in women in preparation for marriage,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. UK schoolgirls 'pressured into FGM' Kenyan girls hide in school to escape FGM My quarrel with a proud FGM cutter The team behind the report, which includes scientists based in Britain and South Africa, used data gathered for the Demographic Health Survey and Unicef, which covered almost 210,000 children. Includes ""the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons"" Practised in 30 countries in Africa, and some in Asia and the Middle East An estimated three million girls and women worldwide are at risk each year It is commonly carried out on young girls, often between infancy and the age of 15 Often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, to prepare a girl or woman for adulthood and marriage, and to ensure ""pure femininity"" Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility and increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths Source:World Health Organization,external Ngianga-Bakwin Kandala, a professor of biostatistics at the UK's Northumbria University and the study's lead author, told the BBC the team hadn't looked at the reasons why FGM rates were falling. However, he has ""a working hypothesis"" that it's down to the attitude of mothers. ""Many international organisations have invested a lot of money... the mothers have been educated,"" he said. ""If there is any change, we'll be seeing it perhaps through the decision they're going to make for their daughters."" A demonstration against female genital mutilation in Nairobi Some parents may simply fail to report having had their daughters cut, he admits - especially in countries which have made FGM illegal. ""That is possible because [in this study] we are relying on the goodwill of the mothers reporting that their daughter was circumcised. There may be fear of the law, or the stigma attached to it. ""In Senegal, for example, we know that people have made public declarations. A huge event - people will gather, and you pledge that you will not be doing this to your daughter. In terms of reporting, then you may be feeling embarrassed having to report that you have done it. This is a very valid point."" Activists hope further research will now examine changes in attitudes to FGM around the world, so the data can be considered in its full context.

"This video can not be played Jo Johnson: ""It was a fantasy set of promises that have been shown up for what they were."" The UK needs to ""pause and reflect"" before doing something ""irrevocably stupid"" over Brexit, Jo Johnson said a day after quitting as a minister. On BBC Radio 4's Today he called again for another referendum, saying what was being offered fell ""spectacularly short"" of what had been promised. The ex-transport minister said it would be a ""democratic travesty"" to not have another vote. He denied his actions amounted to a coup against the prime minister. Mr Johnson, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, stood down as Theresa May's prospective deal with Brussels was being presented to Cabinet ministers. Mr Johnson warned the UK faced a choice between ""vassalage"" under her proposals and ""chaos"" if it left the EU without a deal. The MP for Orpington in Greater London said he had ""happily taken the decision"" to end his own ministerial career and, when asked if he thought other ministers would resign, he said if they thought it was right thing for them to take a stand then ""good on them"". Brexit: All you need to know Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Laura Kuenssberg:  Will Jo Johnson's exit shift Brexit balance? Cabinet ministers have been invited this week to read the UK's draft withdrawal deal with the EU. Mrs May has said the withdrawal deal is 95% done - but there is no agreement yet on how to guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland. Downing Street has insisted there will not be another referendum ""under any circumstances"". Asked whether he agreed with Mr Johnson's call, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Not really, no. The referendum took place. The issue now has to be how we bring people together, bring people together around the principles of our economy, our rights."" He said Labour would hold the government to account over any Brexit deal put to the Commons and could still vote against it. By Ben Wright, BBC political correspondent Jo Johnson's resignation feels like a very significant moment. Here is a former Remain-supporting Conservative minister saying what others mutter privately about Brexit. His lacerating criticism of the government's negotiation and call for another referendum has opened another flank in the Tory party for Theresa May to worry about. Tory whips know many (40, 50, more?) Brexiteers are threatening to vote against any deal she gets from the EU in the Commons because they think it ties the UK too closely to the EU. But the whips must also worry about Remainer Tories determined to derail the whole thing because of the costs they fear Brexit will inflict on the country. With no majority in the Commons, No10's task could have just got harder. Mr Johnson's resignation also fires up those in all parties who say another referendum is now needed - a suggestion again slapped down by Downing Street. But right now, in the middle of this remembrance weekend, Mrs May will be relieved his resignation has not prompted others to follow him out of government. There has been no domino effect, yet. But while Westminster waits for the PM to put her final Brexit blueprint before the Cabinet for approval, these are febrile days. In a resignation statement on Friday, Mr Johnson, who is the brother of former foreign secretary and leading Brexiteer Boris Johnson, argued Britain was ""on the brink of the greatest crisis"" since World War Two, sayingwhat was on offer wasn't ""anything like what was promised"",external. Mr Johnson told Today: ""My view is that this is so different from what was billed that it would be an absolute travesty if we do not go back to the people and ask them if they actually do want to exit the EU on this extraordinarily hopeless basis."" Asked if his brother had lied to voters during the referendum, he said: ""In the campaign there were undoubtedly promises made that have shown to be undeliverable. No-one can dispute that. ""It was a false prospectus. It was a fantasy set of promises that have been shown up for what they were. We are now faced with the reality of that in the form of a deal the prime minister is about to bring back before parliament."" Please upgrade your browser He added he had become ""deeply concerned"" about the potential impact of a no-deal outcome while a minister. Conservative MP and leading Brexiteer, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and the former First Secretary of State Damian Green, both rejected another referendum. Mr Green told Today it ""would be divisive but it wouldn't be decisive"", and all the evidence showed the country was ""still, more or less, split down the middle"". Mr Rees-Mogg said Mr Johnson was ""re-heating 'Project Fear' to stop us leaving"".

"An FGM ""cutter"" in Kenya shows the razorblade she uses to cut girls' genitals Rates of female genital mutilation (FGM) have fallen dramatically among girls in Africa in the last two decades, according to new research. The study, published in BMJ Global Health,external, cited a ""huge and significant decline"" among under-14s. The practice involves removing all or part of a girl or woman's external genitalia, including the clitoris. Some societies treat it as a rite of passage, but human rights groups say it is inhumane and physically dangerous. In the worst cases, victims can haemorrhage to death after they are cut, or die of infections. Chronic pain, infertility and menstrual problems can also follow, as well as potentially fatal childbirth complications. What does FGM actually involve? Botched FGM leaves 50 girls in hospital 'This is what it's like to pee after female genital mutilation' Unicef, the UN children's agency, estimates that 200 million women and girls have undergone FGM worldwide - mostly in parts of Africa and the Middle East. Using data from 29 countries and going back to 1990, the report's authors found that the biggest fall in cutting was in East Africa. The prevalence rate there dropped from 71% of girls under 14 in 1995, to 8% in 2016, the study said. Some countries with lower rates - including Kenya and Tanzania, where 3-10% of girls endure FGM - helped drive down the overall figure. This video can not be played Aged 8, Nice Leng'ete was destined to undergo female genital mutilation. But she fought back. This is her story. In North Africa, the rate fell from almost 60% in 1990 to 14% in 2015. West Africa also saw a significant drop, from 74% of girls in 1996, to 25% in 2017. However, campaigners have observed that while younger children are most at risk, older teenagers and young women are also affected by FGM - and the study did not include them. ""We are pleased to see that the numbers are coming down in a lot of countries,"" said Emma Lightowlers, a spokeswoman for the Africa-focused campaign group 28TooMany. ""But it doesn't tell the whole story and there are other groups where cutting takes place after the age of 14. ""It takes place in teenagers, or in fact, even in women in preparation for marriage,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. UK schoolgirls 'pressured into FGM' Kenyan girls hide in school to escape FGM My quarrel with a proud FGM cutter The team behind the report, which includes scientists based in Britain and South Africa, used data gathered for the Demographic Health Survey and Unicef, which covered almost 210,000 children. Includes ""the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons"" Practised in 30 countries in Africa, and some in Asia and the Middle East An estimated three million girls and women worldwide are at risk each year It is commonly carried out on young girls, often between infancy and the age of 15 Often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, to prepare a girl or woman for adulthood and marriage, and to ensure ""pure femininity"" Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility and increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths Source:World Health Organization,external Ngianga-Bakwin Kandala, a professor of biostatistics at the UK's Northumbria University and the study's lead author, told the BBC the team hadn't looked at the reasons why FGM rates were falling. However, he has ""a working hypothesis"" that it's down to the attitude of mothers. ""Many international organisations have invested a lot of money... the mothers have been educated,"" he said. ""If there is any change, we'll be seeing it perhaps through the decision they're going to make for their daughters."" A demonstration against female genital mutilation in Nairobi Some parents may simply fail to report having had their daughters cut, he admits - especially in countries which have made FGM illegal. ""That is possible because [in this study] we are relying on the goodwill of the mothers reporting that their daughter was circumcised. There may be fear of the law, or the stigma attached to it. ""In Senegal, for example, we know that people have made public declarations. A huge event - people will gather, and you pledge that you will not be doing this to your daughter. In terms of reporting, then you may be feeling embarrassed having to report that you have done it. This is a very valid point."" Activists hope further research will now examine changes in attitudes to FGM around the world, so the data can be considered in its full context.

"This exhibition at The Queen's Gallery in Buckingham Palace starts with a huge painting of a huge man: the aptly-named Peter the Great of Russia, the first Tsar to leave his country in over 100 years. The catalogue says it presents us with ""a tall, virile, handsome warrior"". Sir Godfrey Kneller's portrait of Tsar Peter I (1672-1725), who was the first Russian ruler to visit England The diplomat Prince Boris Kurakin (1676-1727) was similarly enamoured with the artwork. He said: ""The famed portrait of His Czarish Majesty standing in all his imperial armour and so attractive, that I have nowhere seen its equal."" I do not share their view. Godfrey Kneller's very grand and historically significant picture depicts a bug-eyed, 6ft 7in, fey-looking 26-year-old who seems to be as much at home in his suit of armour as Ann Widdecombe was on Strictly Come Dancing. The painting was Peter's gift to the English king, William III, to mark his three-month-long fact-finding visit to England in 1698. The ambitious young ruler was keen to build a Russian navy from scratch to match those of the great European powers. William III was happy to overlook Peter the Great's wayward behaviour So he rented a house in Deptford from the writer and diarist John Evelyn, a chum of Samuel Pepys, and set about learning all there was to know about shipbuilding at the local dockyard, while hoovering up tips on navigation from the nearby Royal Observatory at Greenwich. The trip was a tremendous success for Peter, who, by the end of his reign, had 28,000 men serving 49 ships and around 800 smaller boats. It wasn't so good for John Evelyn, though. His majestic tenant had a rock star's approach to renting: paintings were used for target practice, wheelbarrows as go-karts, and the furniture - that which remained - was left in more pieces than a jigsaw of St Petersburg. William III was happy to overlook the wayward behaviour of his Russian opposite number, seeing the empire-building emperor as an important strategic ally and valued trading partner. And so began a diplomatic relationship between the two monarchies that would span centuries, marriages, wars and the exchanges of many gifts and paintings. The coronation portrait of Empress Catherine II (1729-1796), by Vigilius Eriksen, was believed to have been given to King George III On the whole, it is the gifts and subsequent purchases of Russian objects made by the British Royal Family that are the stars of this show. The paintings are a mixed bag - some good, some bad, none great. Quite unlike the cabinets full of pieces by the Russian jeweller Peter Carl FabergÃ©, which are exquisite. His pair of late 19th Century decanters topped off with silver dolphins with mouths formed into spouts are wonderful. As is the gold and blue moire guilloche enamel cigarette case, which is decorated with a diamond-set snake biting its tail, a symbol of everlasting love (it was given to King Edward VII by his mistress, Alice Keppel). And then there are the three Imperial FabergÃ© Eggs, the most striking of which is the Mosaic Egg and Surprise. The lattice-like exterior is not only the most beautiful piece of craftsmanship, but is also a profoundly sad vessel encapsulating a tragic event. Inside the egg, the ""surprise"" is an enamel portrait of five children in profile, on the reverse of which is a basket of flowers and an inscription of each of their names. Tsar Nicholas II commissioned it for his wife Alexandra - Queen Victoria's granddaughter - as an Easter present. The children it depicts are theirs. Mosaic Egg and Surprise (1914) by FabergÃ©, was originally commissioned by Nicholas II, and later bought by King George V and Queen Mary It was made in the spring of 1914 shortly before Russia became embroiled in World War One. Nicholas was not a great leader, nor a popular figure. Millions of Russian soldiers died, leading to revolution and his forced abdication in 1917. The provisional government confiscated the Mosaic Egg and Surprise. The Tsar asked the British Royal Family to rescue him - after all, the families went a long way back, as this exhibition demonstrates. King George V declined. On 17 July 1918, Tsar Nicholas, his wife and all five children were executed by Bolshevik guards. Fifteen years later, George V purchased the Mosaic Egg and Surprise from Cameo Corner, London, for Â£250. This is but one of the hundreds of historical events reflected in the objects and paintings in this rigorously researched exhibition. It is a grand tale of international relations and inter-family arrangements, of cultural exchange and competing agendas. The major players line the walls in over-the-top gilt frames, while the objects that fill the exhibition spaces tell their stories. Laurits Regner Tuxen's painting of the Marriage of Nicholas II, Emperor of Russia, in 1894, to Princess Alix of Hesse, who was Queen Victoria's granddaughter There are instances when the object is not as interesting as the piece of history it represents, but that is not the case in the sideshow of Roger Fenton photographs of the Crimean War that is connected to the main exhibition, which serves as a reminder that all was not always rosy in the 300-year Anglo-Russian relationship. Fenton's intelligently composed images of the soldiers and battlegrounds are as good as those produced on any subject since the birth of the medium. When you take into account the limitations of his equipment and the hostile environment in which he was using it, you quickly recognise that his photographs are remarkable. Having been commissioned by the print publishers Thomas Agnew & Sons to take pictures of British and French soldiers as source material for a studio painting by Thomas Barker, Fenton set off for the Crimea in the spring of 1855 with a makeshift, horse-drawn photographic van and an assistant. He organised group photographs, individual portraits and desolate landscapes strewn with the debris of war. The most famous photo is Valley of the Shadow of Death - a bleak and barren dirt track littered with cannonballs: an image of Armageddon. Valley of the Shadow of Death, 1855 by Roger Fenton, who places the viewer at the bottom of the ravine filled with cannonballs It is a haunting picture of war without any blood or bodies. His portrait of the unlucky Lord Balgonie, who stares out into the middle distance in wide-eyed confusion, is thought to be the first image taken of shellshock. Roger Fenton's photograph of Lord Balgonie in 1855, is thought to be the first visual record of someone suffering from ""shell shock"" There are few occasions in the exhibition where a Fenton photograph is hung beside a picture an artist has produced from it - and the comparison is illuminating. It brings home Fenton's genius for finding the truth in his subject, and the utter hopelessness of the artist attempting to do the same. When he returned home, his Crimea photographs were much admired by Queen Victoria and her tech-savvy husband Prince Albert, who had previously commissioned the photographer to take portraits of the Royal Family. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, 1854, by Roger Fenton Being sensible people, they bought the lot.

"The problems of Spice in Wrexham led to it being labelled ""Spice Town"" Residents of a town blighted by drugs problems have been urged to speak to homeless people to help tackle the stigma surrounding the issue. Wrexham was dubbed ""Spice Town"" after images emerged ofpeople under the influence of drugs at its bus station. Figures from earlier this year showedit had 44 rough sleepers- the second most in Wales after Cardiff. Project Home, started by Georgie Adams, urges residents to do their bit to help take pressure off stretched services. The launch of its ""befriending and mentoring scheme"" was attended by 100 people with 40 saying they were interested in volunteering. ""We just want everyone to remember [homeless people] are people and want to talk,"" said Fia Lancaster McGrath, who is also leading the project. ""To know it's OK to go up to them and say hello and ask how their day is."" Homeless man tells of 'nightmare' life on Wrexham streets Spice taskforce in Wrexham 'saved my life' The project wants to create a clearer understanding of the problems linked to homelessness Ms Adams believes people are so focused on the social issues around former ""legal highs"" they do not see the people who have hit rock bottom. The synthetic drug Spice - also known as Mamba - was outlawed two years ago. Its effects are highly visible and it is sometimes referred to as the ""zombie drug"" because of the state users fall into. The aims of the project include providing safe accommodation for homeless people, helping to making visitors feel safe and ensuring business owners do not have to clean up drug paraphernalia. Speaking about a relative's struggle with addiction, Ms Adams said that ""all your basic instincts leave you"" and ""all you think of is a fix, it's an illness"". She added: ""It was heartbreaking. It's really important we remember someone has hit rock bottom. ""We are so focused on the word Mamba. We don't look at all the things connected with it.""

"This video can not be played Jo Johnson: ""It was a fantasy set of promises that have been shown up for what they were."" The UK needs to ""pause and reflect"" before doing something ""irrevocably stupid"" over Brexit, Jo Johnson said a day after quitting as a minister. On BBC Radio 4's Today he called again for another referendum, saying what was being offered fell ""spectacularly short"" of what had been promised. The ex-transport minister said it would be a ""democratic travesty"" to not have another vote. He denied his actions amounted to a coup against the prime minister. Mr Johnson, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, stood down as Theresa May's prospective deal with Brussels was being presented to Cabinet ministers. Mr Johnson warned the UK faced a choice between ""vassalage"" under her proposals and ""chaos"" if it left the EU without a deal. The MP for Orpington in Greater London said he had ""happily taken the decision"" to end his own ministerial career and, when asked if he thought other ministers would resign, he said if they thought it was right thing for them to take a stand then ""good on them"". Brexit: All you need to know Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Laura Kuenssberg:  Will Jo Johnson's exit shift Brexit balance? Cabinet ministers have been invited this week to read the UK's draft withdrawal deal with the EU. Mrs May has said the withdrawal deal is 95% done - but there is no agreement yet on how to guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland. Downing Street has insisted there will not be another referendum ""under any circumstances"". Asked whether he agreed with Mr Johnson's call, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Not really, no. The referendum took place. The issue now has to be how we bring people together, bring people together around the principles of our economy, our rights."" He said Labour would hold the government to account over any Brexit deal put to the Commons and could still vote against it. By Ben Wright, BBC political correspondent Jo Johnson's resignation feels like a very significant moment. Here is a former Remain-supporting Conservative minister saying what others mutter privately about Brexit. His lacerating criticism of the government's negotiation and call for another referendum has opened another flank in the Tory party for Theresa May to worry about. Tory whips know many (40, 50, more?) Brexiteers are threatening to vote against any deal she gets from the EU in the Commons because they think it ties the UK too closely to the EU. But the whips must also worry about Remainer Tories determined to derail the whole thing because of the costs they fear Brexit will inflict on the country. With no majority in the Commons, No10's task could have just got harder. Mr Johnson's resignation also fires up those in all parties who say another referendum is now needed - a suggestion again slapped down by Downing Street. But right now, in the middle of this remembrance weekend, Mrs May will be relieved his resignation has not prompted others to follow him out of government. There has been no domino effect, yet. But while Westminster waits for the PM to put her final Brexit blueprint before the Cabinet for approval, these are febrile days. In a resignation statement on Friday, Mr Johnson, who is the brother of former foreign secretary and leading Brexiteer Boris Johnson, argued Britain was ""on the brink of the greatest crisis"" since World War Two, sayingwhat was on offer wasn't ""anything like what was promised"",external. Mr Johnson told Today: ""My view is that this is so different from what was billed that it would be an absolute travesty if we do not go back to the people and ask them if they actually do want to exit the EU on this extraordinarily hopeless basis."" Asked if his brother had lied to voters during the referendum, he said: ""In the campaign there were undoubtedly promises made that have shown to be undeliverable. No-one can dispute that. ""It was a false prospectus. It was a fantasy set of promises that have been shown up for what they were. We are now faced with the reality of that in the form of a deal the prime minister is about to bring back before parliament."" Please upgrade your browser He added he had become ""deeply concerned"" about the potential impact of a no-deal outcome while a minister. Conservative MP and leading Brexiteer, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and the former First Secretary of State Damian Green, both rejected another referendum. Mr Green told Today it ""would be divisive but it wouldn't be decisive"", and all the evidence showed the country was ""still, more or less, split down the middle"". Mr Rees-Mogg said Mr Johnson was ""re-heating 'Project Fear' to stop us leaving"". Mr Johnson is the sixth minister in Theresa May's government to resign specifically over Brexit, following David Davis, Boris Johnson, Philip Lee, Steve Baker and Guto Bebb.

"This video can not be played The Brexit deal ""will see us cede control"" - Jo Johnson Jo Johnson has quit as transport minister and called for the public to have a fresh say on Brexit. The MP, who is Boris Johnson's brother but voted Remain in the referendum, said the  deal being negotiated with the EU ""will be a terrible mistake"". Arguing Britain was ""on the brink of the greatest crisis"" since World War Two,he said what was on offer wasn't ""anything like what was promised"",external. Downing Street thanked him for his work but ruled out another referendum. Jo Johnson voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum while his brother Boris, who quit as foreign secretary in July, was a leading Brexiteer. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know DUP accuses PM of breaking promises His brother praised his decision, saying they were ""united in dismay"" at the PM's handling of the negotiations. Cabinet ministers have been invited this week to read the UK's draft withdrawal deal with the EU. Theresa May has said the withdrawal deal is 95% done - but there is no agreement yet on how to guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland. On Friday the DUP, whose support Theresa May relies on for votes in the Commons, saidthey cannot support any dealwhich included the possibility that Northern Ireland would be treated differently from the rest of the UK. Mr Johnson, the MP for Orpington in Greater London, said the choice being finalised was either: an agreement which would leave the UK ""economically weakened with no say in the EU rules it must follow"", or a ""no-deal Brexit"" which would ""inflict untold damage on our nation"". He described this as ""a failure of British statecraft unseen since the Suez crisis"" but said even a no-deal Brexit ""may well be better than the never-ending purgatory"" being put forward by the prime minister. But in a warning to his brother and fellow Brexiteers, he added: ""Inflicting such serious economic and political harm on the country will leave an indelible impression of incompetence in the minds of the public."" The ""democratic thing to do is to give the public the final say"", he argued. Mr Johnson was elected MP for Orpington in 2010 and was made transport minister in January Analysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg For some time, Jo Johnson has struggled with the unfolding reality of Brexit. A well-respected and liked member of the government, he has decided that what was promised to people during the referendum campaign is now so different to what is on the table that he has quit the government instead. He's not the first, nor the best-known minister to resign over Brexit. But to leave at this moment, right when Theresa May is trying to stitch together a final deal, could have a serious impact. Read Laura's full blog He added: ""This would not be about re-running the 2016 referendum, but about asking people whether they want to go ahead with Brexit now that we know the deal that is actually available to us, whether we should leave without any deal at all or whether people on balance would rather stick with the deal we already have inside the European Union. ""Britain stands on the brink of the greatest crisis since the Second World War. My loyalty to the party is undimmed. I have never rebelled on any issue before now. ""But my duty to my constituents and our great nation has forced me to act."" In response, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""The referendum in 2016 was the biggest democratic exercise in this country's history. We will not under any circumstances have a second referendum. ""The prime minister thanks Jo Johnson for his work in government."" Mr Johnson is the sixth minister in Theresa May's government to resign specifically over Brexit, following David Davis, Boris Johnson, Philip Lee, Steve Baker and Guto Bebb. For Labour, Shadow Brexit Minister Jenny Chapman said Mrs May had ""lost all authority and is incapable of negotiating a Brexit deal within her own party, let alone with the EU"". But asked in an interviewwith the German magazine Der Spiegel,externalwhether he would stop Brexit if he had the chance, Jeremy Corbyn replied: ""We can't stop it, the referendum took place."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, whose party supports calls for a ""People's Vote"" on the final deal, said: ""We warmly welcome Jo Johnson's support of the campaign to give the people the final say on the deal and a chance to exit from Brexit. ""This is a fascinating situation in which Jo and his sister are united in opposing their brother Boris and his Brexit plans."" Brexiteer Tory MP Andrea Jenkynstweeted,externalthat she did not agree with him about another referendum - but his intervention highlighted unease on both sides of the debate, with the PM's efforts to secure a deal. And pro-Remain Conservative Anna Soubry supported his decision and said it was time for another referendum. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Rear Admiral Hope (front right) was part of the British delegation at the Armistice talks After four years of bloody conflict, the Armistice was finally signed in November 1918. The arrival of American troops, earlier that year, saw the Germans grow progressively weaker and their officers privately conceded they had no hope of victory. A series of letters, the most reliable form of communication in an age when electronic methods were in their infancy, marked the path towards peace. The formal negotiations began on 8 November 1918 in a luxurious railway carriage in a siding in a forest near Paris. The German delegation, led by civilian Matthias Erzberger, had no choice but to accept tough terms demanded by Britain, France and America. At the end of a momentous day, Rear Admiral Sir George Hope, a member of the British delegation, wrote to his wife Arabella. ""Erzberger was very nervous at first and spoke with some difficulty, the general awfully sad, the diplomat very much on the alert, and the naval officer sullen and morose."" Rear Admiral Hope judged the accommodation ""most comfortable"". ""The British have a wagon-lit to ourselves with all possible conveniences: there are several other wagon-lits and a dining saloon,"" he wrote. The last deaths of World War One Postcards to remember Grangetown soldiers Painted postcards sent from the trenches The German delegation was in a similar train, about 100 yards away. They had hoped to make it ""principally a civilian affair"", notes Rear Admiral Hope. ""The French and we are very angry with them for only sending military and naval officers of a rather subordinate rank."" The German party approached in single file and got into the conference carriage where ""we received them stiffly but courteously"". The two sides exchanged salutes and lined up on different sides of the table, recalled Rear Admiral Hope. ""The terms were then read out to them and evidently made them squirm, but they were probably prepared for most of them as they must know the present military position and the state of mutiny in the fleet."" News of the Armistice was celebrated by Allied troops, among them the US 64th regiment Rear Admiral Hope's private letter was first published in 1979 by Leeds University historian Peter Liddle, in his book Testimony of War. ""He was perfectly placed, superbly placed. Nobody better to record it,"" Dr Liddle told the BBC. ""It's not just one man's experience, in minuscule, of events, it is a man near the very heart of important things that were happening."" Long read:The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline Video:War footage brought alive in colour Interactive:,externalWhat would you have done between 1914 and 1918? Living history:Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended It is one of five letters, written by key players at key points in the weeks before the Armistice, selected by Cambridge historian Sir Richard J Evans and the Royal Mail, to highlight the crucial role of written communication and postal services in the Great War. ""Every combatant nation had a postal service,"" says Prof Evans. ""In Britain these were post office personnel who were given military ranks and a bit of training, but basically organised a worldwide postal service across the empire. ""And you had something similar with the Germans and the Austrians and so on, because it was very important to get letters to the troops and letters back, to maintain morale, and of course at a very high level to communicate."" The US had joined the war in 1917 and the following year, the arrival of American troops bolstered France and Britain, leaving the German army unable to withstand a series of sustained attacks. Paul von Hintze said it was time to ""give up the game"" in Bulgaria Germany became increasingly isolated, as its allies dropped out of the war, among them, Bulgaria, where the government collapsed. In a telegram on 1 October, Germany's State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Paul von Hintze, wrote to representatives at Army Grand Headquarters: ""According to the most recent reports from Bulgaria, we must give up the game there. ""From a political point of view, there is no point in our keeping our troops there, let alone reinforcing them."" Within days, the Germans requested a truce. Prince Max von Baden, Imperial Chancellor in a newly formed, rather more democratic German government, wrote to US President Woodrow Wilson, offering to accept his terms. ""In order to avoid further bloodshed the German government requests to bring about the immediate conclusion of a general armistice on land, on water, and in the air,"" he wrote. According to Prof Evans, the German generals ""thought they might be able to hold off the allies on the Western Front for a bit longer, but they were under no illusion about the fact that they were not going to win by this stage and so they thought it was best to sue for peace"". He adds that the new democratic government hoped it might get fairly decent terms from the Americans, who were now calling the shots. But on 27 October, Germany was further weakened, when Austro-Hungary left the war. In a letter to Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II, Austro-Hungarian Emperor Karl wrote: ""It is my duty, heavily though it lies upon me, to inform you that my people are neither able, nor willing, to continue the war. ""I do not have the right to oppose this wish, since I no longer hope for a favourable outcome. ""The moral and technical preconditions for it are lacking, and useless blood letting would be a crime that my conscience forbids me to commit."" This allowed the British and French to push President Wilson for harsher terms, says Prof Evans. ""They thought he was a bit wishy-washy, vague and idealistic. So they toughened up the terms of the Armistice."" The Germans simply had to accept the terms offered and the Americans said they would only negotiate with a democratic government, forcing the abdication of the Kaiser on 9 November. US President Woodrow Wilson called the shots The fifth letter shows how news of the Armistice was slow to spread to the more distant parts of the war. In east Africa, the British wanted to send a telegram to the German Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, who had fought a successful guerrilla war against the British for four years. But the British could not find him and he only got to hear about the Armistice when his troops captured a motorcycle despatch rider, carrying the telegram to be delivered ""under white flag"". ""The problem was... he couldn't believe the Kaiser had abdicated, and got in touch with the British High Commissioner asking for confirmation,"" says Prof Evans. ""Eventually he was given credible evidence that this was not a ruse designed to trick him into abandoning the struggle and signed a formal cessation of hostilities on 25 November 1918. ""So that's the last gasp of the war really... and it's the GPO (General Post Office) that plays a role in bringing it about.""

Some motorists abandoned their cars and ran for their lives with children and pets in their arms. Residents are now using social media to search for missing friends and family members. In Paradise, rescuers used a bulldozer to push abandoned cars out of the way in order to reach a hospital and evacuate patients as the fire engulfed the building, Butte County Supervisor Doug Teeter said.

"This video can not be played Fleeing through flames: 'I'm so scared right now... so terrified' At least 11 people have died in the most destructive wildfires ripping through north and south California. More than 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes to avoid three major blazes in the state. Firefighters were powerless in stopping a wildfire destroying the northern town of Paradise, where nine people died and 35 are missing. Another fire swept into the affluent southern beach resort of Malibu on Friday and has now doubled in size. Two more people were reported to have died in that fire, known as the Woolsey, which now covers an area of 70,000 acres (28,000 hectares). Among the towns under evacuation orders is Thousand Oaks, wherea gunman killed 12 people in a rampage on Wednesday. In pictures: Wildfire rages in Malibu Watch: The long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly ""The magnitude of the destruction of the fire is unbelievable and heartbreaking,"" said Mark Ghilarducci, of the California governor's office. President Trump has responded by blaming what he called gross mismanagement of the forests and warned of funding cuts. Meteorologists have warned that dangerous conditions may continue well into next week, but firefighters are hoping to take advantage of a temporary lull in the wind fanning the flames. The blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. Another blaze, the Hill Fire, started at about the same time, also near Thousand Oaks.

By the BBC's James Cook, Paradise in California Paradise is hell. A smouldering, sepia world in ruins. The air is acrid. Burning chemicals leave a bitter taste in your mouth. Walking among the ashes of people's lives is eerie and awful. There is a profound sadness here. We pass a child's charred swing, a swimming pool filled with filth, and worst of all, a pet dog which did not survive. Such was the intensity of the blaze that much of the debris is hard to recognise. Wafers of ash are drifting down like enormous snowflakes, smothering sound. But it is not quite silent here. A sooty squirrel scrambles up a blackened tree in a panic. There are booms and creaks from burning trees and telegraph poles. And soon, going from ruin to ruin, there will be the sound of those with the hardest job of all, checking to see if anyone was left behind.

"Military funeral corteges were a common sight for communities during World War One On 11 November 1918, as news of the end of World War One spread across the world, the parents of Wilfred Owen received notice that their son had been killed in action. The second lieutenant, who would become known as one of England's greatest war poets, had died while trying to lead his men across a canal at Ors seven days earlier. He was one of thousands of servicemen killed in the last month of the war, and their deaths, coming as they did so close to the end of hostilities, seem to have a particularly heartbreaking quality. The University of Oxford'sprofessor emeritus of English Jon Stallworthy wrote in 2004,externalthat the ""socially concerned"" poets of the 1930s gave Owen ""the status of saint and martyr"", adding that he ""came to represent a generation of innocent young men sacrificed - as it seemed to a generation in unprecedented rebellion against its fathers - by guilty old men"". However, Gervase Phillips, Manchester Metropolitan University's principal lecturer in history, said the reaction at the time was quite different. ""Authors often point to the peculiar poignancy that when the Owens received the telegram informing them of Wilfred's death, all the church bells were sounding to mark the Armistice. ""Yet to those who had lived through the conflict, and experienced so much loss, I am not sure these deaths were felt any more keenly."" Wilfred Owen was killed after returning to the front following treatment for shell shock Hindsight also attributes huge significance to Owen's death, but it must be remembered that, at the time, he was not well-known and so the tragedy was felt only by his family and friends - and they were far from alone in experiencing such grief. Capt Robert Bartholomew, who was the editor of the wartime Canadian Hospital News, read about the death of his only son in a newspaper three months before the end of the war. An account of what happened next,externalstated that the news caused him to have a nervous breakdown and drop into a ""severe depression"" due to the ""mental shock"". He had previously written that the parents of those killed would feel ""sorrow and pain"", but would also ""be able to look back with a feeling of pride and say: 'They died for God, for King and Country'"". And despite his severe reaction to the loss of his son, that sentiment did not seem to change, as a few weeks after hearing the news, an editorial in the publication declared with pride that ""sons have died by thousands and will continue to die by thousands if necessary, until victory is assured"". The Armistice came into effect at 11:00 on 11 November 1918 Mr Phillips said while a modern reader might judge such a stance as bravado, and more widely see those deaths in the final months of the war as futile, it was important to remember there was no ""unconditional surrender"" at the end of the war and an Allied victory was far from assured until its very last moments. He said the Armistice ""was not certain until about 05:00 on the morning of the 11th"", though talk of it had been ""widespread throughout the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) since at least 9 November"". ""Think of the ending of the war as a process, rather than a distinct moment,"" the academic said. ""Bulgaria agreed an armistice with the Allies on 30 September, the Ottoman Empire agreed one on 30 October and the Habsburgs (the rulers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) on 3 November. ""The 'direction of travel' was clear, [but] the Germans still hoped to negotiate the best possible terms for a ceasefire right up until the end. ""So the BEF's victory at the [second] Battle of the Sambre on 4 November, where Owen was killed, the American advance to the heights overlooking Sedan and the French capture of the strategic railhead at Hirson by 9 November, were all instrumental in persuading the German delegation to agree to the Armistice."" Confirming the actual number of Allied deaths in the run-up to the Armistice is problematic. Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire, a book published in 1922, listed 6,064 deaths between 1 and 11 November 1918, with a further 2,008 men listed as missing, but the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's (CWGC) database now records 15,002 graves with death dates in those 11 days. Mr Phillips said ""recordkeeping at the front was, inevitably, suspect [as] it wasn't a great environment for bureaucracy, and trying to establish the record retrospectively, on the basis of documentation that may be incomplete or inaccurate, is no easy task"". He said thousands of soldiers ""effectively disappeared"" towards the end of the war and ""very often no-one knew exactly what had befallen them or precisely when"". ""Some subsequently turned up - in a hospital or perhaps in a POW camp - but many were simply recorded as 'missing, presumed killed' - and they still are."" This video can not be played Pte David McKie, 19, died on the last day of World War One Funerals for the fallen were held along the Western Front during the war Among those who died in those last days were three soldiers who were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Sgt Hugh Cairns was killed after capturing a machine-gun at Valenciennes on 2 November, while two days later, 2nd Lt James Kirk andActing Lt Col James Marshalldied in the same action as Owen. Lt Kirk was killed while supporting troops crossing the Oise canal, and Col Marshall died leading his men across a bridge on the waterway. Bugle marks centenary of war poet's death Danny Boyle to stage WW1 beach memorial WW1: One of the last men to die But far from being seen as needless, their deaths were recorded in the press with the same pride as any of the hundreds that had come before and were welcomed in the same way as the others by the general public, Mr Phillips said. Such a reaction was understandable, given that the end of the war came as something of a surprise to most of both those who were fighting and their families. Mr Philips said the most surprising thing was ""how suddenly the war stopped on the dot"". An account by Gen Sir Archibald Montgomery recorded that ""the firing, which had been heavy all the morning, continued until three minutes to 11:00 when it ceased for a short period and then broke out in a final crash"". He also recorded the ""final act"" of a German machine-gunner, who, at two minutes to 11:00, had ""fired off a complete belt without pause"", before standing, taking off his his helmet, bowing and walking ""slowly to the rear"". The news of the Armistice was greeted with relief and delight by troops However, Mr Phillips said the war had been a ""brutalising business"" and there were also ""some instances"" where there was ""a desire not to stop fighting"". An account of the BEF's 8th Division's actions includes details of a company coming across an occupied German post at precisely 11:00. ""The men were persuaded with difficulty to refrain from attacking it,"" the account records, adding that it was ""their earnest contention being that no-one needs know anything about it and that it seemed a pity not to kill a few more Germans while they had the chance"". It also must be remembered that the war continued to claim lives after the Armistice. News of the ceasefire took time to filter to all the areas involved, and fighting continued for some time after 11:00 in places such as Russia and Mesopotamia (an area that covers parts of modern-day Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey). A large number of soldiers also succumbed to wounds or illness in the days and weeks following the end of the war. The CWGC database lists 10,991 graves with death dates between 12 and 30 November 1918 and a further 47,510 listed between 1 December 1918 and 10 January 1920, the day the Treaty of Versailles, the formal document that officially ended the war, came into effect. And so the Armistice might have silenced the guns, but it did not entirely stop the fatalities.

"Rear Admiral Hope (front right) was part of the British delegation at the Armistice talks After four years of bloody conflict, the Armistice was finally signed in November 1918. The arrival of American troops, earlier that year, saw the Germans grow progressively weaker and their officers privately conceded they had no hope of victory. A series of letters, the most reliable form of communication in an age when electronic methods were in their infancy, marked the path towards peace. The formal negotiations began on 8 November 1918 in a luxurious railway carriage in a siding in a forest near Paris. The German delegation, led by civilian Matthias Erzberger, had no choice but to accept tough terms demanded by Britain, France and America. At the end of a momentous day, Rear Admiral Sir George Hope, a member of the British delegation, wrote to his wife Arabella. ""Erzberger was very nervous at first and spoke with some difficulty, the general awfully sad, the diplomat very much on the alert, and the naval officer sullen and morose."" Rear Admiral Hope judged the accommodation ""most comfortable"". ""The British have a wagon-lit to ourselves with all possible conveniences: there are several other wagon-lits and a dining saloon,"" he wrote. The last deaths of World War One Postcards to remember Grangetown soldiers Painted postcards sent from the trenches The German delegation was in a similar train, about 100 yards away. They had hoped to make it ""principally a civilian affair"", notes Rear Admiral Hope. ""The French and we are very angry with them for only sending military and naval officers of a rather subordinate rank."" The German party approached in single file and got into the conference carriage where ""we received them stiffly but courteously"". The two sides exchanged salutes and lined up on different sides of the table, recalled Rear Admiral Hope. ""The terms were then read out to them and evidently made them squirm, but they were probably prepared for most of them as they must know the present military position and the state of mutiny in the fleet."" News of the Armistice was celebrated by Allied troops, among them the US 64th regiment Rear Admiral Hope's private letter was first published in 1979 by Leeds University historian Peter Liddle, in his book Testimony of War. ""He was perfectly placed, superbly placed. Nobody better to record it,"" Dr Liddle told the BBC. ""It's not just one man's experience, in minuscule, of events, it is a man near the very heart of important things that were happening."" Long read:The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline Video:War footage brought alive in colour Interactive:,externalWhat would you have done between 1914 and 1918? Living history:Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended It is one of five letters, written by key players at key points in the weeks before the Armistice, selected by Cambridge historian Sir Richard J Evans and the Royal Mail, to highlight the crucial role of written communication and postal services in the Great War. ""Every combatant nation had a postal service,"" says Prof Evans. ""In Britain these were post office personnel who were given military ranks and a bit of training, but basically organised a worldwide postal service across the empire. ""And you had something similar with the Germans and the Austrians and so on, because it was very important to get letters to the troops and letters back, to maintain morale, and of course at a very high level to communicate."" The US had joined the war in 1917 and the following year, the arrival of American troops bolstered France and Britain, leaving the German army unable to withstand a series of sustained attacks. Paul von Hintze said it was time to ""give up the game"" in Bulgaria Germany became increasingly isolated, as its allies dropped out of the war, among them, Bulgaria, where the government collapsed. In a telegram on 1 October, Germany's State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Paul von Hintze, wrote to representatives at Army Grand Headquarters: ""According to the most recent reports from Bulgaria, we must give up the game there. ""From a political point of view, there is no point in our keeping our troops there, let alone reinforcing them."" Within days, the Germans requested a truce. Prince Max von Baden, Imperial Chancellor in a newly formed, rather more democratic German government, wrote to US President Woodrow Wilson, offering to accept his terms. ""In order to avoid further bloodshed the German government requests to bring about the immediate conclusion of a general armistice on land, on water, and in the air,"" he wrote. According to Prof Evans, the German generals ""thought they might be able to hold off the allies on the Western Front for a bit longer, but they were under no illusion about the fact that they were not going to win by this stage and so they thought it was best to sue for peace"". He adds that the new democratic government hoped it might get fairly decent terms from the Americans, who were now calling the shots. But on 27 October, Germany was further weakened, when Austro-Hungary left the war. In a letter to Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II, Austro-Hungarian Emperor Karl wrote: ""It is my duty, heavily though it lies upon me, to inform you that my people are neither able, nor willing, to continue the war. ""I do not have the right to oppose this wish, since I no longer hope for a favourable outcome. ""The moral and technical preconditions for it are lacking, and useless blood letting would be a crime that my conscience forbids me to commit."" This allowed the British and French to push President Wilson for harsher terms, says Prof Evans. ""They thought he was a bit wishy-washy, vague and idealistic. So they toughened up the terms of the Armistice."" The Germans simply had to accept the terms offered and the Americans said they would only negotiate with a democratic government, forcing the abdication of the Kaiser on 9 November. US President Woodrow Wilson called the shots The fifth letter shows how news of the Armistice was slow to spread to the more distant parts of the war. In east Africa, the British wanted to send a telegram to the German Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, who had fought a successful guerrilla war against the British for four years. But the British could not find him and he only got to hear about the Armistice when his troops captured a motorcycle despatch rider, carrying the telegram to be delivered ""under white flag"". ""The problem was... he couldn't believe the Kaiser had abdicated, and got in touch with the British High Commissioner asking for confirmation,"" says Prof Evans. ""Eventually he was given credible evidence that this was not a ruse designed to trick him into abandoning the struggle and signed a formal cessation of hostilities on 25 November 1918. ""So that's the last gasp of the war really... and it's the GPO (General Post Office) that plays a role in bringing it about.""

"This video can not be played WW1: The forgotten hero MP A forgotten hero has finally been remembered on Parliament's World War One memorial. The marble installation recognises the sacrifice of peers, MPs, MPs' sons, and senior officers of Parliament, who died in service during the Great War. But 96 years after its completion, a leading historian realised one MP had been left off. Now Lieutenant Gerald Arbuthnot, once the Conservative MP for Burnley, has had his name belatedly added. Armistice: The solider who died on the last day of WW1 Armistice Day: Forgotten letters from WW1 Wilfred Owen and the pain of the last deaths The 44-year-old was killed in action in 1916 during the Battle of the Somme. Dr Kathryn Rix, from the History of Parliament Trust, spotted his name's absence from the memorial and said it's not clear why he was forgotten. ""I think perhaps it was because he wasn't an MP for very long,"" she said. ""Perhaps people didn't remember he was an MP between January and December 1910. ""Also he was a former MP at the time and they weren't originally added to the memorial in 1921. ""But then some former MPs were added in 1922, so really, he should have been added at that time. ""They just forgot him - which is rather sad - but now he is being remembered."" Lt Arbuthnot's name was belatedly added to the memorial, 96 years after its completion The marble memorial is known as the Recording Angel The historian had been researching the stories of parliamentarians killed in action during the war when she realised a name was missing from the memorial, known as the Recording Angel, which was designed by Sir Bertram Mackennal in 1921. She had a list of 24 members and former members of Parliament who had died but noticed only 23 on the memorial in St Stephen's Porch, Westminster Hall. She said all of Parliament's official documents and guidebooks will now need to be amended, adding: ""It's really nice to have added him now. I feel very proud."" After unsuccessfully contesting the seat in 1906, Gerald Arbuthnot was elected as the Conservative MP for Burnley in January 1910. However he lost the seat in December of the same year during a second election. He chose not to stand again, but remained in politics in other ways until the outbreak of war, when he joined the Navy. But Dr Rix explained: ""He's unusual amongst the MPs who died in that he served in the Navy, He'd served in the Navy as a young man, and at the start of the war he joined the Royal Naval Reserve. ""He was initially with their press bureau, but that wasn't involved enough in the fighting for him. So he joined a minesweeping division and commanded minesweepers in the North Sea for 15 months. ""But he was very keen to go and have active engagement with the enemy. So he secured a commission in the Grenadier guards in January 1916."" By May, the former MP was fighting at Ypres before heading south to the Somme, with the 2nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards. On 25 September 1916, he was involved in a second attack on the village of Les Boeufs. Lt Arbuthnot and three other officers went forward to cut through barbed wire, because it had not been sufficiently damaged by the British artillery bombardment. Dr Rix explained: ""This was a job that they knew meant almost certain death. Arbuthnot and three other officers went forward. Three of them were killed."" The soldier is buried in the Citadel New Military Cemetery in Fricourt. Despite memorial services for him in Burnley and at St Margaret's Church in Westminster, his name was never added to Parliament's memorial. With the error noticed just weeks before the 100th anniversary of the Armistice, extended members of Lt Arbuthnot's family have welcomed his name being added. His distant cousin James - now Lord Arbuthnot - was himself an MP for 28 years. But in all that time, he never realised the memorial he routinely passed should have carried his relative's name. Long read:The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline Video:War footage brought alive in colour Interactive:,externalWhat would you have done between 1914 and 1918? Living history:Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended Lord Arbuthnot said: ""I didn't know of him, though my brother did - he's the family genealogist. ""It's an extraordinary story. He was part of a generation who truly believed in duty and serving their country. ""It feels very good - an extra bit of knowledge about what members of Parliament, what my family, did in that war has come to light and we can remember him properly now. ""We're very proud. Though I always remember my grandfather who died at Ypres in 1915, to know there was also Gerald Arbuthnot is really very nice. ""There were a number of my family members killed in the First World War. It's just good to be able to join him to the family memory."" In total, 264 MPs or former MPs served in World War One, with 23 of these making the ultimate sacrifice. In addition, 323 members of the Lords served, with 24 being killed (one of whom was also an MP - meaning some list 24 MPs as having died). Mark Collins, the Parliamentary estate's archivist and historian, said: ""With the work of the History of Parliament Trust, we're sure that we have all of the names of those peers and those MPs and the sons of MPs [who died].

"The Only Grape is Essex: TOWIE star Gemma Collins has been pictured enjoying a fine fizz Essex could rival the Champagne region as a major producer of fizz, experts have claimed. Scientists identified about 86,000 acres of countryside - with similar traits to the French plonk powerhouse - deemed ""prime"" land for vineyards. The areas, including some in Suffolk, had ideal soil, terrain and climate for grape growing, experts from the University of East Anglia (UEA) said. But they also warned budding winemakers to expect expensive set-up costs. Climate change had led to ""warmer growing seasons"" in England and Wales, researchers said. As a result, areas ""where relatively few vineyards currently exist"" could have unexplored winemaking potential. They said Essex, more commonly associated with reality star haunt the Sugar Hut, was drier, warmer and more stable than some more established vineyard locations. Prof Steve Dorling, from the UEA's School of Environmental Sciences, said the summer's heatwave had led to a ""record grape harvest"" and ""a vintage year for English and Welsh wine"". But, he said, the season had been ""quite unusual in terms of weather"" and more work was needed to find the best places to plant vineyards able to withstand the UK's ""often fickle weather"". Lead author Dr Alistair Nesbitt echoed Prof Dorling, and said there was ""definitely room for improvement"" but it was hoped the research could ""help boost future productivity"". Could we one day see these brands on our supermarket shelves? Brutlingsea Moet & Clacton Bolly-riccay Cava Island Chugwell Proseccolchester Spot of Basil-Dom Perignon, anyone? The research, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council, has been published in the Journal of Land Use Science. Charles Macaudy, manager of Wyken Wines, near Bury St Edmunds, said climate change had enabled East Anglia vineyards to grow the same varieties of grapes as vineyards in Champagne. Despite it being the ""driest area of the UK and also the sunniest"", those varieties would not previously grow successfully in East Anglia. ""Now we can make sparkling wine more like Champagne, but even better,"" he said. But Mr Macaudy said the spring frost could make or break the harvest, after 80% of their crop was wiped out in April 2017.
