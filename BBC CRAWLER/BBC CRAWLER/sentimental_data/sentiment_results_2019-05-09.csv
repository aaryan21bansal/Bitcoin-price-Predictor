"Scotland Yard said early investigations suggested that a ""blank firing handgun"" had been discharged A gun was fired outside a mosque in east London during Ramadan prayers. Police were called to reports of a ""masked"" man with a firearm entering the Seven Kings Masjid in Ilford at 22:45 BST on Thursday. Worshippers ushered him out of the building and a gunshot - thought to have come from a ""blank-firing handgun"" - was then heard. No injuries or damage were caused, the Met said, and it did not believe it was terrorism-related. Scotland Yard said it believed it stemmed from an earlier incident in a street close to the mosque off High Road. Worshipper Ibraheem Hussain, 19, described hearing the gunshot about half an hour after prayers began. ""We were upstairs in the classrooms and about 30 minutes into the night prayer a large noise went off"", he said. ""It sounded like a firework or maybe something heavy had been dropped, so no-one really thought anything of it. ""But then someone said it was a gunshot and that someone had come into the mosque and he had a firearm on him. ""The managers had seen him. He was masked and acting suspicious."" Police were called to High Road in Ilford, east London ""At this early stage, ballistic evidence recovered from the scene suggests that the weapon was a blank-firing handgun"", the Met said. ""Officers will continue to work closely with representatives from the mosque and are providing reassurance to the local community."" There have been no arrests. In astatement shared by a Muslim Council spokesman,externalon Twitter, the mosque's imam Mufti Suhail said the suspect's motives had not been established. He asked that people ""avoid speculating and circulating unconfirmed information"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""relieved nobody was injured in the incident"". Allow Twitter content?

"Uber has been valued at $82bn (Â£63bn) ahead of its share listing in what is expected to be one of the biggest stock market flotations this year. The ride-hailing app is asking investors to pay $45 a share, at the lower end of the price range expected. Uber's conservative price is an attempt to avoid the fate of rival Lyft whose shares fell by up to a third after its recent listing, said analysts. Uber is yet to make a profit and warned recently it may never do so. Since its foundation in 2009, the company has lost about $9bn. Daniel Ives, an analyst at investment company Wedbush Securities, said the lower-than-expected valuation was Uber's attempt to deflect scrutiny of its financial performance. ""They know that they are going to have a target on their back in terms of, not just investors, but regulators as well as drivers, so they need to tread carefully here in terms of how they price it. ""Their success is not going to be determined over the coming days or weeks or months, it's really over the coming years. But the last thing they want is for stock to drop through the IPO price like Lyft has,"" he said. What do drivers think of Uber? Is Uber really worth billions of dollars? Are internet unicorns really worth billions? Uber had originally suggested a price range of between $44-$50 for its share price listing, valuing the company at up to $120bn. Investors are betting on Uber's growth prospects as it diversifies into several other sectors. As well as the original ""ride-hailing"" business, Uber is developing driverless cars, and has a food delivery operation, Uber Eats. Union organiser Lydia Hughes joined Uber drivers in their strike in London on Wednesday Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has emphasised that the firm's future is not as a ride-hailing company, but as a wide technology platform shaping logistics and transportation. But Brian Hamilton, a tech entrepreneur and founder of data firm Sageworks, said its losses were hard to overlook. ""Uber is basically Lyft 2.0. Good model, growing sales. But, yet again, here comes California math once more. It is still losing a ton of money,"" he said. The firm's revenue last year surged 42% to $11.3bn, but its adjusted loss - following a tax benefit - still hit $1.8bn. In the first three months of the year, it was a similar story with the firm reporting a loss of around $1bn. The firm's flotation comesdays after drivers in the US and UK went on strikeover pay and working conditions. Unions are urging Uber to cut the rate of commission it takes, to increase the average fare rate and for better job security. What do drivers think of Uber? Is Uber really worth billions of dollars?

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says cross-party talks have been ""difficult"" and that Labour ""backs option of a public vote"" Labour can ""unite our country"" and heal the divisions caused by Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn said, as he launched his European elections campaign. Mr Corbyn said the party backed ""the option of a public vote"" if a ""sensible"" Brexit deal cannot be agreed and there is not a general election. He said cross-party talks on Brexit were ""difficult"" as the government's ""red lines remain in place"". The European elections take place in the UK on 23 May. The UK was due to leave the EU on 29 March, but as no deal was agreed by Parliament, the EU extended the deadline to 31 October. It can leave the bloc earlier, but if the UK has not left by 23 May, it is legally obliged to take part in the EU-wide poll and send MEPs to Brussels. Laura Kuenssberg: Can Corbyn heal Brexit divide? A guide to the UK's European elections How do European elections work? Cross-party talks between the government and Labour have been taking place to try to solve the Brexit impasse. However Mr Corbyn said the talks had been difficult and that ""so far there have been no big offers"". ""It is quite difficult to negotiate with a disintegrating government with cabinet ministers jockeying for the succession, rather than working for an agreement,"" he said. Mr Corbyn launched Labour's campaign in Gillingham, Kent, where he issued an appeal to both sides of the Brexit debate. He said: ""To transform our country, and tackle injustice, inequality and the climate crisis, we need to unite the overwhelming majority of people and take on the privileged and powerful. ""That's why we insist the real divide in our country is not how people voted in the EU referendum. ""The real divide is between the many and the few."" The party has selected 70 candidates across the 12 regions. They include the former cabinet minister and passionate Brexit critic Lord Adonis, who is second on the South West England list. Other stand-out names include Laura Parker, a leading figure in the Momentum campaign group, and Eloise Todd, chief executive of the Best for Britain group. Eloise Todd, chief executive of the Best for Britain group, is a Labour MEP candidate Mr Corbyn said Labour was ""the only party with a plan to unite our country"". ""Other parties appeal to just one side of the Brexit debate because they aren't really committed to taking on the tax dodgers, the big polluters, or the financial gamblers who crashed our economy a decade ago,"" he said. He promised Labour's alternative plan for Brexit ""would end the chaos caused by the Conservatives and let us focus on the other big issues facing our country"". ""But we can never accept the government's bad deal or a disastrous no deal,"" he added. ""So if we can't get a sensible deal, along the lines of our alternative plan, or a general election, Labour backs the option of a public vote."" The issue of a further referendum has proved divisive in the party - with many MPs and frontbenchers opposed to the idea. European elections: What you need to know A really simple guide to the European elections 2019 European elections: List of candidates But Labour's governing bodyagreed last month to support a further referendumon Brexit under certain circumstances. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Labour's ""great balancing act"" on Brexit continued, with Mr Corbyn ""trying to keep Labour Leave supporters on board while not alienating Labour Remain supporters"". Responding to the speech, Labour MP Mary Creagh, a Remain supporter, said that ""standing in the middle of the road means you get run over from both sides"". Cross-party talks on Brexit between the government and Labour will continue next week. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, said on Wednesday that he believed the PM would ask the Commons to vote again on the terms of the UK's exit before elections to the European Parliament take place.

"In some prisons, inmates are being forced to double up in cells designed for one The prison officers' union is to call for strike action as the number of inmates in Scotland's jails approaches record levels, BBC Scotland understands. There are now about 700 more prisoners than a year ago. Some inmates have been forced to sleep on mattresses on the floor due to a lack of beds. The union has also said violence inside prisons is increasing, along with the number of sick days taken by staff. Prison officers at a special delegate conference in Perth on Friday are likely to vote for a ballot on industrial action to highlight the problem. It would be their first strike for seven years. Phil Fairley, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association in Scotland, said that prisoner numbers ought to be decreasing as a result of current government policy and falling crime figures - but that other factors were putting pressure on the system. Short jail term restrictions impact limited Prisoners forced to double-up in cells Scotland's prisons 'bursting at seams' ""One of the factors we can point to is that we've got life sentence prisoners who are doing twice as long as they did for a life sentence 20 years ago,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""But it doesn't explain the whole growth in numbers. ""Today we've got nine out of 15 prisons (including two private prisons) that are overcrowded."" Phil Fairley said the prison service was not far away from reaching record numbers The BBC understands that prisoners at Perth - Scotland's oldest prison - have been sleeping on mattresses on the floor. And at Low Moss in East Dunbartonshire, the governor has been asked to take in another 100 prisoners, despite being at capacity. ""They have been asked to consider bunk beds for 100 prisoners in cells that are not designed for two to be in them,"" Mr Fairley said. ""We can't just sit back and watch it go in the direction it's going. ""We are not far away from reaching record high numbers."" He said the increase in prisoner numbers had an impact on staff being able to go about their daily jobs. ""The bit that matters to the public, to society, is the work that transforms individuals - challenging and tackling offending behaviour,"" he said. ""That will become the first sacrifice in terms of the time that's available to prison officers to do their jobs."" He said this would start to affect the mood in the prisons. ""There is always the potential for violence,"" he said. ""Violence is on the increase  - both prisoner on prisoner and prisoner on staff is increasing."" Mr Fairley said the prison service last year lost 17,000 days to sick leave, involving stress and mental health issues. ""This isn't just a problem for prisoner officers, it's a problem for the whole of society,"" he said, adding that it made a ""huge difference"" to the rehabilitation of prisoners. ""The fact that we're in behind closed doors and high walls shouldn't let the public get complacent or turn a blind eye to what's going on inside our prisons. It matters to them as much as it matters to us."" Wendy Sinclair-Gieben said she was worried about the pressures of overcrowding Chief Inspector of Prisons Wendy Sinclair-Gieben said the reasons for the rising prison population were complex, but included the length of life sentences. She said: ""About 12-15 years ago the average was about 10-12 years - it's now about 19-23 years."" She also said there had been considerable success in tracking down and convicting legacy sex offenders who were also given long sentences. Another factor was a review of home detention curfews which had led to reduction in such curfews being used, she added. Ms Sinclair-Gieben said the removal of automatic release at the half way point of sentences had also added to the numbers in prison. She said there were now about 700 more prisoners than a year ago - the equivalent of a large prison. ""It's quite pressured at the moment which is really concerning,"" she said, adding that inmates being forced to share cells led to increased tensions and the extra numbers put a strain on resources. ""One of the things that worries me about the pressure of overcrowding is that inevitably the whole thing degrades slightly,"" she said. Tom Fox said high prison numbers had an impact on the prison regime Tom Fox, of the Scottish Prison Service, said: ""Numbers have risen fairly steeply over the past 12 months and that does have an impact on the entirety of the prison regime. ""The more people we have, the more pressure it places on the system, and I think it's fair to say the staff are doing a remarkably good job of coping with the pressure brought about by these numbers. ""But the more people we have, the less time we have to devote to working closely with individuals to make sure they receive appropriate support in rehabilitation before re-entering society."" He added: ""We're not complacent about violence but we haven't seen high levels of violence in our prisons for many years and I think that's a tribute to the way in which staff work with prisoners and the relationships they develop. ""I would hope that we could maintain that stability and that environment going forward.""

"Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the good values at NHS Highland had not always been reflected Hundreds of health workers have potentially experienced inappropriate behaviour at NHS Highland, an independent review has suggested. The review led by John Sturrock QC said staff had described suffering ""fear, intimidation and inappropriate behaviour at work"". Concerns raised by a group of clinicians promptedthe review,external. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman apologised and said other health boards should learn lessons. 'Culture of bullying' at NHS board At Holyrood, Ms Freeman said the culture at the health board had been unacceptable, and she supported the review's recommendations. These include educating all staff on the effects of bullying and providing a ""properly functioning, clear, safe and respected wholly independent and confidential whistleblowing"" mechanism. NHS Highland runs services in Argyll and Bute, and another recommendation was that a separate review be done of the ""functioning of management"" in this area, partly because of its geography. Clinicians, including Dr Lorien Cameron-Ross and Dr Iain Kennedy, have been considering the contents of Mr Sturrock QC's report. They have thanked Ms Freeman for having the ""courage and honesty"" to commission the review. NHS Highland said it would not tolerate unacceptable behaviour under any circumstances and was committed to ensuring that lessons were learned. Amid the claims of bullying, the review said there were ""thousands of well-motivated, caring and supportive people providing excellent caring services to thousands of patients in the area served by NHS Highland, often sacrificially and well beyond the call of duty"". Bullying claims timeline A group of senior clinicians called for an inquiry of their claims 26 September 2018: A group of senior clinicians at NHS Highland speak out about what they claim to be a culture of bullying at the health board. The doctors say that for at least a decade there has been a ""practice of suppressing criticism, which emanates from the very top of the organisation"" 2 October: NHS Highland seeks a resolution to the allegations through a meeting with the clinicians, but the doctors call for the matter to go to a public inquiry 5 November: Health Secretary Jeane Freeman requests an independent external investigation to examine allegations of bullying within NHS Highland 23 November: John Sturrock QC appointed to lead an independent review of the allegations 9 May 2019: Independent review report published The review was contacted by 340 people from most departments, services and occupations at NHS Highland. More than 280 took part in face to face meetings or made written submissions. The majority - 66% - reported experiences of what they described as bullying. Staff said they had not felt valued, respected or supported in carrying out ""very stressful work"". Others told of not being listened to when raising matters regarding patient safety concerns and decisions being made ""behind closed doors"". The review also said that ""many described a culture of fear and of protecting the organisation when issues are raised"". NHS Highland's sites include Raigmore Hospital and its area includes Argyll and Bute Ms Freeman said: ""NHS Highland has very many very caring, supportive, diligent, highly skilled staff. ""But this extensive review has identified a number of significant cultural issues that have contributed to both actual and perceived behaviours in NHS Highland that have not always reflected those values."" She said the review had implications for health boards across Scotland. The health secretary said: ""I am well aware that concerns about bullying and a desire to secure a positive culture is shared across our health service."" NHS Highland's chief executive Iain Stewart said an action plan would be drawn up following careful consideration of the review's report. He said: ""I can assure you all that the response will itself be comprehensive and, over the coming weeks and months, NHS Highland will take whatever actions are required to ensure that its people are valued, respected and that their voices are heard. ""Already, it seems clear that the treatment of some staff within NHS Highland in the past has not always lived up to the high standards expected and, for that, ""I apologise on behalf of the board."" John Sturrock QC led the review of allegations of bullying at NHS Highland Lewis Morrison, chairman of BMA Scotland, said bullying was ""completely unacceptable"". He praised the doctors who raised concerns as ""brave"" and said staff had to feel able to speak out about bullying without fear about consequences for their careers, but said there was still some way to go. ""This report absolutely has to be a catalyst for change,"" he said. ""Clearly there are also lessons for the whole of Scotland. ""While there are aspects that are specific to NHS Highland, we are pleased that the Scottish government recognise this is not an isolated situation. Last year, a group of senior cliniciansclaimed there had been a culture of ""fear and intimidation"" at the board for at least a decade. NHS Highland covers large area, that includes Skye, Caithness and Badenoch and Strathspey. Its main hospitals include Lorn and Islands Rural General Hospital in Oban, Belford Hospital in Fort William and Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. Mr Sturrock QCwas appointed by the Scottish government to lead the review. His report had been expected to be published in February, but was delayed. Dr Iain Kennedy is among the senior clinicans who raised their concerns last year In April, Mr Stewart said it was right that time was taken on producing the report. In the time since the allegations were made in September last year, there have been changes to the management of the health board. Elaine Mead left the role of chief executive in December and David Alston resigned as chairman in February.

"Critics warn that children risk becoming ""collateral damage"" if benefits are withdrawn The maximum financial penalty for benefit claimants is to be cut, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has announced. Sanctions can be imposed on claimants who do not meet conditions such as attending job centre meetings. In some ""high level"" cases, such as a failure to take up paid work, people can lose benefits for three years. Ms Rudd said this maximum penalty will now be cut to six months, adding that she wanted a system which was ""fair"". The Department for Work and Pensions previously insisted its scheme was ""reasonable"". A report released by the Work and Pensions Committee in November 2018 found single parents, care leavers and people with disabilities and health conditions were ""disproportionately vulnerable"" to and affected by sanctions. As well as missing appointments, sanctions can currently be imposed for failure to show efforts to find work, and can see claimants lose all of their jobseeker's allowance or universal credit standard allowance. Benefit sanctions scheme 'pointlessly cruel', say MPs 'I was sanctioned for going to a funeral' 'Limited evidence' for benefit sanctions, NAO says Last year's report also warned that children risked becoming ""collateral damage"" as the withdrawal of parents' benefits harmed their welfare. Speaking at the Recruitment and Employment Confederation in London, Ms Rudd said: ""In the future, the longest length of sanctions will be six months. Amber Rudd said policies should be compassionate and work for everybody ""I am undertaking an evaluation of the effectiveness of universal credit sanctions to see whether other improvements can be made. ""I feel very strongly about making sure that the policies of this department are fair, compassionate and that they work for everybody."" Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said Labour had long been pressing for the government to scrap its ""punitive"" sanctions regime. ""Six months is still a very long time to leave someone without any income at all. It is not just the individual who is affected, but their family too,"" she said. ""There is clear evidence that sanctions and excessive conditionality do not help people into sustained employment. ""They also cause stress and anxiety for many and are one of the key reasons that people ask for help at food banks.""

"Christine Delcros was seriously injured in the attack and her fiance Xavier Thomas was killed The fiancee of the first victim of the London Bridge attack in 2017 has told an inquest she had ""premonitions about terror attacks"" the day he died. The body of Xavier Thomas was found in the River Thames after he was struck by a van driven by three attackers. Mr Thomas's girlfriend Christine Delcros, who was also badly hurt, wept as she gave evidence at the Old Bailey inquest into the eight victims' deaths. She told the court she was still ""madly in love"" with Mr Thomas. The couple had arrived in London from Paris on the morning of 3 June for a weekend of sightseeing, the court heard. Ms Delcros said Mr Thomas, 45, had arranged for them to have a cocktail in the Shard that evening. Ms Delcros gave evidence at the inquest into the deaths of eight victims ""I had so many premonitions about terror attacks from the day before and I could feel it,"" she said. But Mr Thomas had persuaded his girlfriend to stick to the plan. ""Not to disappoint him I said OK,"" Ms Delcros told the court. At about 21:30 BST they decided to walk across London Bridge from their hotel, the Four Seasons, Ms Delcros said. Xavier Thomas was the first fatality of the London Bridge attacks Ms Delcros said she remembered feeling something was ""not normal"" as they walked on the bridge. ""Suddenly I was under the impression there was a lot of light and a van that mounted the pavement in the exact fashion to make sure they were not going to miss us,"" she said. ""I just heard myself say to myself, 'That's how one dies, that's it.'"" Ms Delcros broke down in tears as she recounted lying on the ground thinking ""the curtain had fallen"" and she had died. As she came in and out of consciousness, she asked where Mr Thomas was, the court heard. The father-of-two had been thrown into the River Thames when the van hit him. The court heard Mr Thomas's body was found by police more than a mile and a half from London Bridge, near Shadwell Basin, on 6 June. His cause of death was given as immersion. Speaking in French, Ms Delcros said she was still ""madly in love"" with Mr Thomas and ""nothing would destroy that"" connection. As he gave the court her comments in English, the translator had tears streaming down his cheeks. Mr Thomas and Ms Delcros were seen crossing the bridge on CCTV footage A police officer in charge of a patrol boat at the scene said his team had been ""desperate"" to find anyone who might have fallen from the bridge. PC Nicholas Bultitude said his team did not use an infrared camera on their boat because it was ""more practical"" to search visually. He told the court his team covered ""every inch of that portion of the river"" and that if Mr Thomas had been on the surface he would have been seen. Dominic Adamson, representing Mr Thomas' family, questioned PC Bultitude's decision to abandon the river search after gunshots were heard so he could warn crowds on the South Bank of the danger. But PC Bultitude replied: ""When I made the decision, so far as I was concerned, if someone has gone in then tragically they are lost."" Khuram Butt hired a van to use in the attack, the inquest heard previously Witness Holly Jones said she remembered seeing the French couple looking ""very happy together"" seconds before the attack. Ms Jones said she was ""frozen in fear"" when she saw the ""demented"" driver, Youssef Zaghba, heading towards her. ""It was a feeling I described as like being punched into the chest,"" the BBC journalist told the court. ""Something in the back of my mind told me to get out of the way. I jumped to the right towards the railings,"" she said. The witness said she felt the ""wind of the van"" as it sped past her. Ms Jones said she then went to help Ms Delcros and told police to check the water for Mr Thomas. Attacker wiped knife on beard Victim's final kiss for fiance London Bridge attack: The victims Zaghba, 22, and his accomplices Khuram Butt, 27, and Rachid Redouane, 30, were shot dead by police after killing eight people and injuring 48 others around Borough Market. On Wednesday the inquest was told Mr Thomas and a second victim, Christine Archibald, 30,might still be alive if barriers had been put upfollowing the Westminster Bridge attack, which took place two months earlier. The other victims were Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Sara Zelenak, 21, Kirsty Boden, 28, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, and Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39. Hanna Yusuf, BBC reporter, at the inquest The hearing ended for the day as it had started - with emotions running high. Xavier Thomas's girlfriend, Christine Delcros, appeared distressed in the courtroom. With eyes closed and the tips of her fingers to her temples, she listened to analysis of how Mr Thomas had gasped for air upon entering the cold Thames and drowned as a result. Sitting next to Ms Delcros was Christiane Pesez, Mr Thomas's mother. She had her head lowered and tears streamed down her face as she heard of her son's last moments alive. Her husband and Mr Thomas's stepfather, Philippe Pesez, stared into space - a display of grief in one of its various forms. As the hearing drew to a close, the final witness of the day, Tanya Lunt, struggled to contain her emotions the moment she started speaking - remembering back to that day in June 2017 when she realised that a deliberate attack was happening. Mark Roberts was among a group of people who had set up tripods on London Bridge to take photographs of Tower Bridge. He told the court on Thursday he saw the van moving at about 30mph or 40mph as it hit a group of people. The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan He said: ""It looked to me it was deliberately steering and aiming at the people. At that point it started driving along the pavement towards me."" Mr Roberts said he thought he was ""next in line"", but suddenly the van veered towards a group of people running away. He told the court one woman was thrown into the air ""like a rag doll"". The inquest continues.

"ACM cladding has been widely used on high rises, including Grenfell Tower The Â£200m bill to replace Grenfell Tower-type cladding on about 150 private high-rise blocks in England is to be met by the government. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire had previously said the bill should be footed by the owners, not the taxpayer. But he said owners had been trying to offload the costs on to leaseholders and that the long wait for remedial work had caused anxiety for residents. Leaseholder groups said the news would be a ""relief"" but more was needed. Seventy-two people died when a fire destroyed Grenfell Tower, in west London, in June 2017, in one of the UK's worst modern disasters. It took minutes for the fire to race up the exterior of the building, and spread to all four sides. A public inquiry into the fire heard evidence to support the theory that the highly combustible material in the cladding was the primary cause of the fire's spread. Latest government figures show that 166 private residential buildings out of the 176 identified with aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding - the same type used on Grenfell Tower - are yet to start work on removing and replacing it. Unsafe cladding still affects thousands Stars in emotional Grenfell cladding video The terrible speed with which the Grenfell fire spread Mr Brokenshire admitted he had changed his mind on demanding that freeholders pay up for safety work. He said some building owners had tried to pass on the costs to residents by threatening them with bills running to thousands of pounds.

Pemberstone, Aberdeen Asset Management, Barratt Developments, Fraser Properties, Legal & General and Mace and Peabody were named as having fully borne the costs for their buildings. 72 people died in the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 Grenfell United, a group of survivors and the bereaved, said the news offered hope to people feeling at risk at home. ""This result is a testament to residents themselves. The truth is we should never have had to fight for it,"" the group said. It asked the government to consider financial support for residents as they continue night watches and wait for the remediation work to begin. Rachel Loudain, from the UK Cladding Action Group, said leaseholders had exhausted all other options before the government stepped in to pay for the work. ""No developer was taking responsibility, no freeholder, we didn't have any option legally or any option with insurance,"" she said.

"Joy Worrall had said she would ""throw herself off the quarry"" if she was ever in ill health or financial difficulty, the hearing was told An 82-year-old woman killed herself after an ""administrative error"" by the Department for Work and Pensions led to her pension being frozen, an inquest heard. Joy Worrall, from Rhes-y-Cae, Flintshire, was found dead in a quarry near her home in November last year. Her son Ben told the Ruthin court the family had discovered after her death her pension had been stopped. The DWP apologised ""unreservedly"" to Mrs Worrall's family for the error. Mr Worrall told the inquest his mother was reluctant to talk about her problems, but had previously stated if she was ever in ill health or in financial difficulty she would ""throw herself off the quarry"". ""My mother felt she couldn't discuss her finances with anyone,"" he said. The inquest heard that in 2014 she received an inheritance, but the DWP told her it would not affect her pension. She received a state pension, as well as a pension credit top-up. However, in 2017, ""action was taken to suspend her pension credit"". Rather than her state pension continuing while the credits were reviewed, all payments were stopped ""due to an administrative error"". The inquest heard there was no record of any correspondence from Mrs Worrall to the DWP about the matter. Her cause of death was given as multiple major traumatic injuries due to a fall from height. Coroner John Gittins recorded a conclusion of suicide and said it was ""indeed a deliberate act"". He told Mr Worrall if it was not for the information he supplied about the DWP, he may have struggled to determine if his mother had decided to take her own life. Following the hearing, Mr Worrall said: ""I feel as though there was a duty of care that was not fully carried out as it should've been, causing her to be in a situation where the only course of action was to end her life, which is a disgrace really."" He said he had taken up the case with his MP, David Hanson. A DWP spokesman said: ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Mrs Worrall. We apologise unreservedly to Mrs Worrall's family for the error that led to her pension payments being stopped and pledge to learn the lessons.""

Pemberstone, Aberdeen Asset Management, Barratt Developments, Fraser Properties, Legal & General and Mace and Peabody were named as having fully borne the costs for their buildings. 72 people died in the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 Grenfell United, a group of survivors and the bereaved, said the news offered hope to people feeling at risk at home. ""This result is a testament to residents themselves. The truth is we should never have had to fight for it,"" the group said. It asked the government to consider financial support for residents as they continue night watches and wait for the remediation work to begin. Rachel Loudain, from the UK Cladding Action Group, said leaseholders had exhausted all other options before the government stepped in to pay for the work. ""No developer was taking responsibility, no freeholder, we didn't have any option legally or any option with insurance,"" she said. The group welcomed the news but pointed out that ""many, many"" leaseholders and social housing tenants living in blocks with other forms of unsafe cladding would be excluded from this help. This video can not be played Rachel Loudain from the UK Cladding Action Group: ""Nothing we could do to ensure building owners would pay"" ""Fire does not distinguish between the different types of failed cladding out there. This inadequate response will be looked back on in shame when the next Grenfell tragedy occurs,"" the group said. Labour accused the government of being ""frozen like a rabbit in the headlights"" in its response to the Grenfell disaster. ""Too weak and too slow to act at every stage and on every front,"" the shadow housing secretary John Healey said. Grenfell cladding '14 times heat limit' Cladding fear left woman depressed Is my tower block safe? The government has already committed to funding replacement cladding in the social sector. There are currently 23 blocks still covered in it.

"Joy Worrall had said she would ""throw herself off the quarry"" if she was ever in ill health or financial difficulty, the hearing was told An 82-year-old woman killed herself after an ""administrative error"" by the Department for Work and Pensions led to her pension being frozen, an inquest heard. Joy Worrall, from Rhes-y-Cae, Flintshire, was found dead in a quarry near her home in November last year. Her son Ben told the Ruthin court the family had discovered after her death her pension had been stopped. The DWP apologised ""unreservedly"" to Mrs Worrall's family for the error. Mr Worrall told the inquest his mother was reluctant to talk about her problems, but had previously stated if she was ever in ill health or in financial difficulty she would ""throw herself off the quarry"". ""My mother felt she couldn't discuss her finances with anyone,"" he said. The inquest heard that in 2014 she received an inheritance, but the DWP told her it would not affect her pension. She received a state pension, as well as a pension credit top-up. However, in 2017, ""action was taken to suspend her pension credit"". Rather than her state pension continuing while the credits were reviewed, all payments were stopped ""due to an administrative error"". The inquest heard there was no record of any correspondence from Mrs Worrall to the DWP about the matter. Her cause of death was given as multiple major traumatic injuries due to a fall from height. Coroner John Gittins recorded a conclusion of suicide and said it was ""indeed a deliberate act"". He told Mr Worrall if it was not for the information he supplied about the DWP, he may have struggled to determine if his mother had decided to take her own life. Following the hearing, Mr Worrall said: ""I feel as though there was a duty of care that was not fully carried out as it should've been, causing her to be in a situation where the only course of action was to end her life, which is a disgrace really."" He said he had taken up the case with his MP, David Hanson. A DWP spokesman said: ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Mrs Worrall. We apologise unreservedly to Mrs Worrall's family for the error that led to her pension payments being stopped and pledge to learn the lessons.""

"Some content on pages for extremist groups was allegedly created by Facebook Facebook has been accused of ""auto-generating"" extremist content, including a celebratory jihadist video and a business page for al-Qaeda. The material was uncovered by an anonymous whistleblower who filed an official complaint to US regulators. Similar content for self-identified Nazis and white supremacist groups was also found online. Facebook said it had got better at deleting extreme content but its systems were not perfect. The whistleblower's study lasted five months and monitored pages of 3,000 people who liked or connected to organisations listed as terrorist groups by the US government. The study found that groups such as the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda were ""openly"" active on the social network. In addition, it found that Facebook's own tools were automatically creating fresh content for the proscribed groups by producing ""celebration"" and ""memories"" videos when pages racked up enough views or ""likes"", or had been active for a certain number of months.

"Critics warn that children risk becoming ""collateral damage"" if benefits are withdrawn The maximum financial penalty for benefit claimants is to be cut, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has announced. Sanctions can be imposed on claimants who do not meet conditions such as attending job centre meetings. In some ""high level"" cases, such as a failure to take up paid work, people can lose benefits for three years. Ms Rudd said this maximum penalty will now be cut to six months, adding that she wanted a system which was ""fair"". The Department for Work and Pensions previously insisted its scheme was ""reasonable"". A report released by the Work and Pensions Committee in November 2018 found single parents, care leavers and people with disabilities and health conditions were ""disproportionately vulnerable"" to and affected by sanctions. As well as missing appointments, sanctions can currently be imposed for failure to show efforts to find work, and can see claimants lose all of their jobseeker's allowance or universal credit standard allowance. Benefit sanctions scheme 'pointlessly cruel', say MPs 'I was sanctioned for going to a funeral' 'Limited evidence' for benefit sanctions, NAO says Last year's report also warned that children risked becoming ""collateral damage"" as the withdrawal of parents' benefits harmed their welfare. Speaking at the Recruitment and Employment Confederation in London, Ms Rudd said: ""In the future, the longest length of sanctions will be six months. Amber Rudd said policies should be compassionate and work for everybody ""I am undertaking an evaluation of the effectiveness of universal credit sanctions to see whether other improvements can be made. ""I feel very strongly about making sure that the policies of this department are fair, compassionate and that they work for everybody."" Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said Labour had long been pressing for the government to scrap its ""punitive"" sanctions regime. ""Six months is still a very long time to leave someone without any income at all. It is not just the individual who is affected, but their family too,"" she said. ""There is clear evidence that sanctions and excessive conditionality do not help people into sustained employment. ""They also cause stress and anxiety for many and are one of the key reasons that people ask for help at food banks.""

"Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the good values at NHS Highland had not always been reflected Hundreds of health workers have potentially experienced inappropriate behaviour at NHS Highland, an independent review has suggested. The review led by John Sturrock QC said staff had described suffering ""fear, intimidation and inappropriate behaviour at work"". Concerns raised by a group of clinicians promptedthe review,external. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman apologised and said other health boards should learn lessons. 'Culture of bullying' at NHS board At Holyrood, Ms Freeman said the culture at the health board had been unacceptable, and she supported the review's recommendations. These include educating all staff on the effects of bullying and providing a ""properly functioning, clear, safe and respected wholly independent and confidential whistleblowing"" mechanism. NHS Highland runs services in Argyll and Bute, and another recommendation was that a separate review be done of the ""functioning of management"" in this area, partly because of its geography. Clinicians, including Dr Lorien Cameron-Ross and Dr Iain Kennedy, have been considering the contents of Mr Sturrock QC's report. They have thanked Ms Freeman for having the ""courage and honesty"" to commission the review. NHS Highland said it would not tolerate unacceptable behaviour under any circumstances and was committed to ensuring that lessons were learned. Amid the claims of bullying, the review said there were ""thousands of well-motivated, caring and supportive people providing excellent caring services to thousands of patients in the area served by NHS Highland, often sacrificially and well beyond the call of duty"". Bullying claims timeline A group of senior clinicians called for an inquiry of their claims 26 September 2018: A group of senior clinicians at NHS Highland speak out about what they claim to be a culture of bullying at the health board. The doctors say that for at least a decade there has been a ""practice of suppressing criticism, which emanates from the very top of the organisation"" 2 October: NHS Highland seeks a resolution to the allegations through a meeting with the clinicians, but the doctors call for the matter to go to a public inquiry 5 November: Health Secretary Jeane Freeman requests an independent external investigation to examine allegations of bullying within NHS Highland 23 November: John Sturrock QC appointed to lead an independent review of the allegations 9 May 2019: Independent review report published The review was contacted by 340 people from most departments, services and occupations at NHS Highland. More than 280 took part in face to face meetings or made written submissions. The majority - 66% - reported experiences of what they described as bullying. Staff said they had not felt valued, respected or supported in carrying out ""very stressful work"". Others told of not being listened to when raising matters regarding patient safety concerns and decisions being made ""behind closed doors"". The review also said that ""many described a culture of fear and of protecting the organisation when issues are raised"". NHS Highland's sites include Raigmore Hospital and its area includes Argyll and Bute Ms Freeman said: ""NHS Highland has very many very caring, supportive, diligent, highly skilled staff. ""But this extensive review has identified a number of significant cultural issues that have contributed to both actual and perceived behaviours in NHS Highland that have not always reflected those values."" She said the review had implications for health boards across Scotland. The health secretary said: ""I am well aware that concerns about bullying and a desire to secure a positive culture is shared across our health service."" NHS Highland's chief executive Iain Stewart said an action plan would be drawn up following careful consideration of the review's report. He said: ""I can assure you all that the response will itself be comprehensive and, over the coming weeks and months, NHS Highland will take whatever actions are required to ensure that its people are valued, respected and that their voices are heard. ""Already, it seems clear that the treatment of some staff within NHS Highland in the past has not always lived up to the high standards expected and, for that, ""I apologise on behalf of the board."" John Sturrock QC led the review of allegations of bullying at NHS Highland Lewis Morrison, chairman of BMA Scotland, said bullying was ""completely unacceptable"". He praised the doctors who raised concerns as ""brave"" and said staff had to feel able to speak out about bullying without fear about consequences for their careers, but said there was still some way to go. ""This report absolutely has to be a catalyst for change,"" he said. ""Clearly there are also lessons for the whole of Scotland. ""While there are aspects that are specific to NHS Highland, we are pleased that the Scottish government recognise this is not an isolated situation. Last year, a group of senior cliniciansclaimed there had been a culture of ""fear and intimidation"" at the board for at least a decade. NHS Highland covers large area, that includes Skye, Caithness and Badenoch and Strathspey. Its main hospitals include Lorn and Islands Rural General Hospital in Oban, Belford Hospital in Fort William and Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. Mr Sturrock QCwas appointed by the Scottish government to lead the review. His report had been expected to be published in February, but was delayed. Dr Iain Kennedy is among the senior clinicans who raised their concerns last year In April, Mr Stewart said it was right that time was taken on producing the report. In the time since the allegations were made in September last year, there have been changes to the management of the health board. Elaine Mead left the role of chief executive in December and David Alston resigned as chairman in February.

"In some prisons, inmates are being forced to double up in cells designed for one The prison officers' union is to call for strike action as the number of inmates in Scotland's jails approaches record levels, BBC Scotland understands. There are now about 700 more prisoners than a year ago. Some inmates have been forced to sleep on mattresses on the floor due to a lack of beds. The union has also said violence inside prisons is increasing, along with the number of sick days taken by staff. Prison officers at a special delegate conference in Perth on Friday are likely to vote for a ballot on industrial action to highlight the problem. It would be their first strike for seven years. Phil Fairley, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association in Scotland, said that prisoner numbers ought to be decreasing as a result of current government policy and falling crime figures - but that other factors were putting pressure on the system. Short jail term restrictions impact limited Prisoners forced to double-up in cells Scotland's prisons 'bursting at seams' ""One of the factors we can point to is that we've got life sentence prisoners who are doing twice as long as they did for a life sentence 20 years ago,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""But it doesn't explain the whole growth in numbers. ""Today we've got nine out of 15 prisons (including two private prisons) that are overcrowded."" Phil Fairley said the prison service was not far away from reaching record numbers The BBC understands that prisoners at Perth - Scotland's oldest prison - have been sleeping on mattresses on the floor. And at Low Moss in East Dunbartonshire, the governor has been asked to take in another 100 prisoners, despite being at capacity. ""They have been asked to consider bunk beds for 100 prisoners in cells that are not designed for two to be in them,"" Mr Fairley said. ""We can't just sit back and watch it go in the direction it's going. ""We are not far away from reaching record high numbers."" He said the increase in prisoner numbers had an impact on staff being able to go about their daily jobs. ""The bit that matters to the public, to society, is the work that transforms individuals - challenging and tackling offending behaviour,"" he said. ""That will become the first sacrifice in terms of the time that's available to prison officers to do their jobs."" He said this would start to affect the mood in the prisons. ""There is always the potential for violence,"" he said. ""Violence is on the increase  - both prisoner on prisoner and prisoner on staff is increasing."" Mr Fairley said the prison service last year lost 17,000 days to sick leave, involving stress and mental health issues. ""This isn't just a problem for prisoner officers, it's a problem for the whole of society,"" he said, adding that it made a ""huge difference"" to the rehabilitation of prisoners. ""The fact that we're in behind closed doors and high walls shouldn't let the public get complacent or turn a blind eye to what's going on inside our prisons. It matters to them as much as it matters to us."" Wendy Sinclair-Gieben said she was worried about the pressures of overcrowding Chief Inspector of Prisons Wendy Sinclair-Gieben said the reasons for the rising prison population were complex, but included the length of life sentences. She said: ""About 12-15 years ago the average was about 10-12 years - it's now about 19-23 years."" She also said there had been considerable success in tracking down and convicting legacy sex offenders who were also given long sentences. Another factor was a review of home detention curfews which had led to reduction in such curfews being used, she added. Ms Sinclair-Gieben said the removal of automatic release at the half way point of sentences had also added to the numbers in prison. She said there were now about 700 more prisoners than a year ago - the equivalent of a large prison. ""It's quite pressured at the moment which is really concerning,"" she said, adding that inmates being forced to share cells led to increased tensions and the extra numbers put a strain on resources. ""One of the things that worries me about the pressure of overcrowding is that inevitably the whole thing degrades slightly,"" she said. Tom Fox said high prison numbers had an impact on the prison regime Tom Fox, of the Scottish Prison Service, said: ""Numbers have risen fairly steeply over the past 12 months and that does have an impact on the entirety of the prison regime. ""The more people we have, the more pressure it places on the system, and I think it's fair to say the staff are doing a remarkably good job of coping with the pressure brought about by these numbers. ""But the more people we have, the less time we have to devote to working closely with individuals to make sure they receive appropriate support in rehabilitation before re-entering society."" He added: ""We're not complacent about violence but we haven't seen high levels of violence in our prisons for many years and I think that's a tribute to the way in which staff work with prisoners and the relationships they develop. ""I would hope that we could maintain that stability and that environment going forward.""

China has been a frequent target of Donald Trump's anger, with the US president criticising trade imbalances between the two countries and Chinese intellectual property rules he says hobble US companies. Ahead of the discussions, he told a rally China had ""broke the deal"". On top of the new tariffs, due to come into force at 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT) on Friday, he says he is also taking steps to authorise new tariffs on another $325 billion in Chinese imports. What exactly sparked the US president's actions, which apparently took China by surprise, is unclear. US sources told Reuters news agency that last week China returned a draft agreement with changes that undermined its commitments to address key US demands. Tariffs are taxes paid by importers of foreign goods, so the tariff imposed by the US on Chinese goods would be paid by American companies. China denies backtracking on the deal and has said it ""keeps its promises"". If the US tariffs go ahead, the Chinese have said they will retaliate in kind. ""The escalation of trade friction is not in the interests of the people of the two countries and the people of the world,"" the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement. ""The Chinese side deeply regrets that if the US tariff measures are implemented, China will have to take necessary countermeasures."" Each side has hinted that the other has more to lose. At the rally Mr Trump said if no deal was struck there was ""nothing wrong with taking in more than $100bn a year"" while China's state-run Global Times said China was ""much better prepared"" than the US. The proposed US measures will see rates on a vast array of Chinese-made electrics, machinery, car parts and furniture jump from 10% to 25%. China and the US are the world's biggest economies so deterioration in their relations will inevitably have an impact beyond their borders. The two have already imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods, creating uncertainty for businesses and weighing on the global economy.

"An election official empties a ballot box at the count in Durban South Africa's African National Congress (ANC) has been returned to office after winning parliamentary election, but with a reduced majority. The ANC secured 58% of the vote, ahead of the Democratic Alliance (DA) on 21%. The radical Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), came third with 11%. A struggling economy and corruption have eroded the ANC's popularity. ANC leader, President Cyril Ramaphosa, called on the people to build a united South Africa. Five things we've learnt Can Ramaphosa call time on corruption? How South Africa has changed since apartheid - in charts In his victory speech, he said the result showed that South Africans still had faith in the ANC - in power since 1994 - to deliver. ""Let us now work together, black and white, men and women, young and old, to build a South Africa that truly belongs to all who live in it as proclaimed by our forebears,"" Mr Ramaphosa told supporters in Pretoria. He called for a South Africa ""which is united, which is non-racial, which is non-sexist, democratic and prosperous"". The BBC's Will Ross says the ANC may not be too disheartened by the reduced majority. He says that although its support has dropped, this was not a disastrous performance and some might even be tempted to call it a fairly successful exercise in damage limitation considering the ANC's corruption scandals and the slow progress in tackling poverty. Turnout was about 65% in the twin parliamentary and provincial elections - a drop compared to the 73% registered five years ago. It was the first time the ANC's share of the vote has fallen below the 60% mark and it will now have 19 fewer seats in the 400-member parliament. This has been a critical election for the man promising to defeat corruption and boost a stagnant economy. Cyril Ramaphosa will now argue that he has a mandate to create a cabinet capable of reducing unemployment that runs at 27% - more than half of it among the young.  That means sidelining allies of his scandal-plagued predecessor Jacob Zuma. They will however remain entrenched in the structures of the ANC, unless prosecutions or the reports of public inquiries into corruption force them to quit. Perceptions of honest government are critical if Mr Ramaphosa is to attract the investment South Africa needs. This is Africa's largest economy and tackling its inability to provide jobs for the young is the great challenge ahead. In a country where the youth have traditionally led rebellions - in 1976 and again in the mid-1980s against apartheid - the most striking statistic in this election is the fall-off in voting by young people. More than six million did not register to take part - roughly half of those in the 18-30 age bracket who were entitled to vote. Disenchantment over corruption and the failure to provide jobs is deep. It is a trend of alienation that Mr Ramaphosa will need to stem if the long-term health of democracy here is to be guaranteed. Young people queuing to vote spoke of their difficulties in finding jobs. One young voter said her future employment prospects were on her mind. ""I don't feel confident about getting the job I want,"" she said. ""I'm a member of the ANC, but I didn't vote for them this time,"" construction worker Thabo Makhene told Reuters news agency. ""They need to catch a wake-up. The way they run the state, mishandling state funds, they've lost their morals."" This video can not be played 'I am not voting - I'm very upset' However, many voters stayed loyal to the ANC, which led the fight against apartheid. Esau Zwane, 90, waiting to vote in Soweto, Johannesburg, lived under white-minority rule. He told the BBC he was celebrating ""that our country is now ruled by black people"".

"Debenhams' creditors have backed a turnaround plan that will see the closure of 50 stores and rent reductions for others. Landlords and others voted with a majority ""significantly above"" the required threshold of 75% on each of the board's proposals. The announcement came hours after it emerged administrators had rejected all takeover bids for the struggling firm. That means it is still owned by Celine, a consortium of the retailer's lenders. Debenhams is the biggest department store chain in the UK with 166 stores. It employs about 25,000 people. Debenhams' executive chairman Terry Duddy said: ""I am grateful to our suppliers, our pension stakeholders and our landlords who have overwhelmingly backed our store restructuring plans. ""We will continue to work to preserve as many stores and jobs as possible through this process. This is a further important step to give us the platform to deliver a turnaround."" What happens to Debenhams now? Debenhams: Three things that went wrong Celine bought the business out of administration in April after key Debenhams shareholder Sports Direct hadmade several unsuccessful approaches. Administrators subsequently invited bids for the business, but none of them matched Celine's and so they were not ""at the level required to be taken forward"". Celine's Stefaan Vansteenkiste said the investor consortium was a ""committed long-term owner"" which had pumped Â£200m in fresh funding into Debenhams ""for the financial restructuring process and to fund the company's operating turnaround"". The turnaround plan involves a store closure programme under a process known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), which also allows for rents to be renegotiated at stores that remain open. The chainhas already named 22 stores which will start closingnext year, including those in Canterbury, Wolverhampton and Kirkcaldy. Of the stores which stay open, 39 will stick to their current rental rates for the duration of their leases. For the other stores, the company is aiming to secure rental reductions of between 25% and 50%. Debenhams' fortunes have been on a downward spiral for several years. Like many other retailers, it has suffered in the face of increased online sales. In addition, it has too many stores, many of them too small, so it is shouldering substantial costs. Last year, it reported a record annual loss of Â£491.5m. Before Debenhams' lenders took control of the firm, Mike Ashley's Sports Direct had been a major shareholder in the retailer, owning about 30% of the shares. The high-profile billionaire made several takeover approaches for the chain, but all were rejected. Mr Ashley subsequently described the Debenhams takeover by its lenders as a ""national scandal"". The investors involved in Celine are Barclays and Bank of Ireland, as well as Silver Point Capital and GoldenTree Asset Management, which specialises in high-risk, high-reward investments.

"Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the good values at NHS Highland had not always been reflected Hundreds of health workers have potentially experienced inappropriate behaviour at NHS Highland, an independent review has suggested. The review led by John Sturrock QC said staff had described suffering ""fear, intimidation and inappropriate behaviour at work"". Concerns raised by a group of clinicians promptedthe review,external. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman apologised and said other health boards should learn lessons. 'Culture of bullying' at NHS board At Holyrood, Ms Freeman said the culture at the health board had been unacceptable, and she supported the review's recommendations. These include educating all staff on the effects of bullying and providing a ""properly functioning, clear, safe and respected wholly independent and confidential whistleblowing"" mechanism. NHS Highland runs services in Argyll and Bute, and another recommendation was that a separate review be done of the ""functioning of management"" in this area, partly because of its geography. Clinicians, including Dr Lorien Cameron-Ross and Dr Iain Kennedy, have been considering the contents of Mr Sturrock QC's report. They have thanked Ms Freeman for having the ""courage and honesty"" to commission the review. NHS Highland said it would not tolerate unacceptable behaviour under any circumstances and was committed to ensuring that lessons were learned. Amid the claims of bullying, the review said there were ""thousands of well-motivated, caring and supportive people providing excellent caring services to thousands of patients in the area served by NHS Highland, often sacrificially and well beyond the call of duty"". Bullying claims timeline A group of senior clinicians called for an inquiry of their claims 26 September 2018: A group of senior clinicians at NHS Highland speak out about what they claim to be a culture of bullying at the health board. The doctors say that for at least a decade there has been a ""practice of suppressing criticism, which emanates from the very top of the organisation"" 2 October: NHS Highland seeks a resolution to the allegations through a meeting with the clinicians, but the doctors call for the matter to go to a public inquiry 5 November: Health Secretary Jeane Freeman requests an independent external investigation to examine allegations of bullying within NHS Highland 23 November: John Sturrock QC appointed to lead an independent review of the allegations 9 May 2019: Independent review report published The review was contacted by 340 people from most departments, services and occupations at NHS Highland. More than 280 took part in face to face meetings or made written submissions. The majority - 66% - reported experiences of what they described as bullying. Staff said they had not felt valued, respected or supported in carrying out ""very stressful work"". Others told of not being listened to when raising matters regarding patient safety concerns and decisions being made ""behind closed doors"". The review also said that ""many described a culture of fear and of protecting the organisation when issues are raised"". NHS Highland's sites include Raigmore Hospital and its area includes Argyll and Bute Ms Freeman said: ""NHS Highland has very many very caring, supportive, diligent, highly skilled staff. ""But this extensive review has identified a number of significant cultural issues that have contributed to both actual and perceived behaviours in NHS Highland that have not always reflected those values."" She said the review had implications for health boards across Scotland. The health secretary said: ""I am well aware that concerns about bullying and a desire to secure a positive culture is shared across our health service."" NHS Highland's chief executive Iain Stewart said an action plan would be drawn up following careful consideration of the review's report. He said: ""I can assure you all that the response will itself be comprehensive and, over the coming weeks and months, NHS Highland will take whatever actions are required to ensure that its people are valued, respected and that their voices are heard. ""Already, it seems clear that the treatment of some staff within NHS Highland in the past has not always lived up to the high standards expected and, for that, ""I apologise on behalf of the board."" John Sturrock QC led the review of allegations of bullying at NHS Highland Lewis Morrison, chairman of BMA Scotland, said bullying was ""completely unacceptable"". He praised the doctors who raised concerns as ""brave"" and said staff had to feel able to speak out about bullying without fear about consequences for their careers, but said there was still some way to go. ""This report absolutely has to be a catalyst for change,"" he said. ""Clearly there are also lessons for the whole of Scotland. ""While there are aspects that are specific to NHS Highland, we are pleased that the Scottish government recognise this is not an isolated situation. Last year, a group of senior cliniciansclaimed there had been a culture of ""fear and intimidation"" at the board for at least a decade. NHS Highland covers large area, that includes Skye, Caithness and Badenoch and Strathspey. Its main hospitals include Lorn and Islands Rural General Hospital in Oban, Belford Hospital in Fort William and Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. Mr Sturrock QCwas appointed by the Scottish government to lead the review. His report had been expected to be published in February, but was delayed. Dr Iain Kennedy is among the senior clinicans who raised their concerns last year In April, Mr Stewart said it was right that time was taken on producing the report. In the time since the allegations were made in September last year, there have been changes to the management of the health board. Elaine Mead left the role of chief executive in December and David Alston resigned as chairman in February.

"Less than half of the world's major airlines are giving passengers the opportunity to offset the carbon dioxide produced from their flights, BBC research found. When airlines do offer such a scheme, generally fewer than 1% of flyers are choosing to spend more. Carbon offsetting enables passengers to balance out their carbon footprint by paying towards environmental projects. Aviation accounts for 2% of global human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. Prices vary but a return flight from London to Malaga, Spain, would cost around Â£4 to offset. Emma Thompson: 'If I could fly cleanly, I would' Which airline is best for carbon emissions? The BBC contacted the world's biggest airlines in terms of numbers of flights and numbers of passengers. Out of the 28 approached, less than half offered a carbon offset scheme and the majority declined to provide data on the number of passengers offsetting their flights during a one year period - often saying their figures were too low to report. Michael Gill, a director from the international aviation trade bodyIata,external, said: ""We strongly recommend all passengers to use high-quality projects to offset their own CO2 emissions as an individual contribution to addressing climate change."" This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly Carbon offsetting allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Passengers can pay the additional charge when they buy their ticket from participating airlines, but independent offsetting companies also exist. The price varies between airlines, but a return flight from London and Cape Town, South Africa would cost roughly Â£20 to offset, according to ClimateCare. The CO2 emissions per passenger from that flight is roughly the same as those produced from heating the average home for a year. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Advocates defend offsetting just as vociferously. British Airwaysdoes not run a carbon offsetting scheme. Instead, it gives customers the opportunity to contribute towards carbon reduction and community projects Lufthansaoffers a carbon offsetting scheme, but uptake from passengers is less than 1%. Following the BBC's enquiry, the company said it would now make the offer more visible to customers during the booking process Ryanairdoes offer a carbon offsetting scheme, but the company refused to disclose the uptake by passengers American Airlines, the world's biggest airline, does not offer an offset scheme. The company says it has taken ""many meaningful steps to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions"", including buying new, more fuel-efficient planes Emiratesdoes not offer a scheme, but will be participating in an international carbon offset scheme from 2021 Qantasbucked the trend with 10% of passengers opting to offset More people are flying than ever and over four billion passengers fly every year. All international carriers must now report their CO2 emissions on an annual basis and the sector as a whole is aiming to halve its carbon footprint by 2050. From next year, airlines will be required to offset any increase in emissions beyond their 2020 levels by reducing emissions elsewhere. The new international system, known as Corsia and established by the United Nations, is the first time a single industry sector has agreed to a global measure to tackle climate change. Prof Neil Harris, head of atmospheric informatics atCranfield University,external, UK, says carbon offsetting ""is a good idea but it's not working"". He feels airlines and governments need to do more. ""All opt in schemes tend to have low take-up,"" he explained. ""Secondly I think there's a lack of clarity on what the scheme is. You want to know the money is being well spent."" Prof Kevin Anderson, who researches energy and climate change at the University of Manchester, said the most important thing was changing consumer behaviour. ""Most people just fly occasionally but there's this small group who are very frequent fliers. And these people cannot be using offsetting to allow them to carry on business as usual,"" he said. ""If we are serious about climate change, it is not a business-as-usual world, we will have to change how it is we operate. And until we accept that we're going to continue to fail on climate change and the emissions will continue to rise."" 1.5 degrees Keeping the rise in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say. Thatâs compared with âpre-industrialâ times. The world has already warmed about 1C since then. 2 degrees The original target for limiting the rise in global average temperature. Recent research points to 1.5 degrees being a far safer limit. 3 degrees The current likely rise in average global temperature by the year 2100 if countries keep their promises to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which are driving climate change. 4 degrees A prediction of the likely rise in average temperature by 2100 if no further action is taken. This would see major sea-level rise, with many coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, as well as regular severe heatwaves and massive disruption to agriculture. Adaptation An action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought. AGW Stands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes. Arctic ice The Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Attribution Attribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely. Average temperature The average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C. BECCS Stands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy. Biofuel A fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste. Biomass Biomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations. Carbon Carbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon capture The trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity. Carbon footprint The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product. Carbon neutral A process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning. Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Carbon sink Anything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil. CCU Stands for âCarbon Capture and Utilisationâ. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics. Climate change A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans. Climate model Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes. Climate negotiations Climate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies. CO2 Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up. COP Stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. Copenhagen A UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was ""one of the greatest challenges of the present day"". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began. Coral bleaching Coral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot. Deforestation The clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned. Deniers Climate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century. Emissions Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries. Extreme weather Extreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer. Feedback loop In a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sunâs rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting. Fossil fuels Fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide. Geo-engineering Geo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences. Global temperature Usually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet. Global warming The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record. Green energy Green energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets. Greenhouse gases Natural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride. Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater. Hydrocarbon A hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change. IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts. Jetstream A jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europeâs hot summer of 2018 more common. Kyoto Protocol A set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990. Lukewarmers A term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists. Methane Methane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture â cows emit large amounts â as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming. Mitigation Action that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests. Net zero A term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'. Ocean acidification The ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the worldâs oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds. Ozone layer The ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. PPM / ppm An abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year. Pre-industrial Scientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker. Renewable energy Normally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar. Runaway climate change Describes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Sea ice Sea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average. Sea level rises Rising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm. Sustainability Sustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example. Tipping point Describes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a âtipping pointâ, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible. UNFCCC Stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change.

"Yolo lets Snapchat users request anonymous messages from specific friends or the wider public Yolo - an app that lets anonymous questions be posed to Snapchat users - has become the most-downloaded iPhone app in the UK and US just a week after its release. It is highly unusual for an app to top Apple's chart so soon after its launch without a major marketing campaign. However, the viral success of the product has raised concerns. Previous anonymous online Q&A services have been blighted by abuse and bullying. And one UK-based children's charity has said that Snapchat itself might have to intervene. ""Apps such as Yolo that allow anonymous comments could be easily misused to send abusive or upsetting messages,"" the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC)'s Andy Burrows told the BBC. ""Snapchat should justify how this app meets their duty of care to children."" Does being anonymous make it easier to be mean? A US-based child safety campaign group has also suggested that Yolo's age rating is too low. ""Anonymity... has always created a breeding ground for hate and very poor teen decision-making,""said Protect Young Eyes.,external ""The rating is too low at 12+."" Yolo is one of the first apps to have been built using Snap Kit - a software creation platform launched last year by Snapchat. The kit lets third-party developers integrate their products with the social network. Its name is an acronym for ""you only live once"". The app works by letting people post a graphic inviting others to ""send me anonymous messages"", which is superimposed over a photo. The post can be sent to a specific set of Snapchat contacts or attached to a Snapchat Story and shared more widely. Those who see the request can then send an anonymous message via Yolo itself. If the original poster decides to respond, their reply is in turn posted back to Snapchat. Another app called Piksa offers similar features and is also in the top 50 of Apple's app store chart. Yolo was created by Popshow Inc, a French start-up previously responsible for an app that let people post their reactions to funny videos. The BBC has been unable to reach the team involved. But one of the founders told Techcrunch that the team had not expected Yolo to be so popular. ""It was not supposed to be a success. It was just for us to learn,"" Gregoire Henrion told the news site. ""It went 100% viral. ""We just literally put it in the store, people typed Yolo into search, and the loop was so effective that the product caught on."" Popshow appears to have been mindful about the risks involved. When first opened, the app shows a warning that states: ""Yolo has no tolerance for objectionable content or abusive users. You'll be banned for any inappropriate usage."" Yolo users are told not to be abusive before they connect the service to their Snapchat accounts The software has mostly received positive feedback within Apple's App Store, but some users have flagged concerns about whether steps are in place to tackle problems that arise. One reviewer suggested that the app had been used to send messages wishing others dead, while another said they had been called a ""weirdo"". ""People will get bullied in this - it's not a good idea,"" wrote a third. Previous anonymous Q&A apps that have faced complaints about bullying include Ask.fm, Whisper, Yik Yak and Lipsi.

"The ""Love Northampton"" campaign was a recent attempt to promote the town A plan to save a town centre described as ""decaying"" has been unveiled. Northampton Borough Council said it hoped that Â£25m from the government'sFuture High Streets Fundcould be used to redevelop the town centre. The authority has put together a new board called Northampton Forward to tackle some of the town's long-standing issues. Council leader Jonathan Nunn said it ""promised action"" and wanted ""something better for the town"". But university lecturer Kardi Somerfield, who lives in the town centre, said the plan ""feels like deja vu"" with similar proposal in the past. She said the town would have to get government money ""otherwise who's going to pay for it"", adding: ""Businesses would only invest in a viable town."" The Market Square is one of Britain's largest and dates back to 1235 The council said footfall into Northampton had fallen by 15%, while problems such as vacant shops and homelessness are on the rise. It has produced a vision for five sectors within the town, with ideas including an indoor food hall and new parks. Can one town's 'dying' High Street be saved? Old bus site 'adds' to town's 'decline' Town centre decaying, says Strictly vicar The plan said it would ""allow the retail core to shrink"" and increase the amount of flats and homes in the town centre Recently, retailers such as BHS and Marks and Spencer have left the town, leaving large empty units on the main shopping street. That led local celebrity and broadcaster the Reverend Richard Coles to describe the town centre as ""decaying"". 'Too much good news in Northampton' Young filmmakers 'impress' comics legend University opens Â£330m riverside campus But Conservative councillor Mr Nunn warned against quickly filling empty shops and selling off land, saying he did not want ""a mediocre thing that does not actually achieve anything for the town"". He said if the council does not receive money from the fund it would attempt to secure other funding, but he admitted the plan needed ""serious public money"".

"Some millennials have unrealistic expectations of inheritance and how it may unlock the door to buying a first home, a survey suggests. One in seven young adults expect to inherit money before they are 35, although in reality the typical inheritance age is between 55 and 64. The survey, by wealth manager Charles Stanley, suggested that young people expected to receive nearly Â£130,000. However, the median average amount handed down was only Â£11,000. Advisers said that relying on an inheritance to pay a deposit for a first home was often misguided, even if older family members intended to pass on money when they died. ""People are living longer than ever, so relying on an inheritance to get on the housing ladder is a risky strategy as you may get less, and much later than planned,"" said John Porteous, from Charles Stanley. ""In reality, most people save and invest to get on the housing ladder. Starting early and planning ahead is essential to achieving the deposit you need."" How does inheritance tax work? Guildford is the inheritance tax 'capital' of the UK The research suggested that 22% of millennials expected to receive inheritance to use as a deposit, although official statistics suggest only 7% actually did so. The average expectation of when that inheritance would be received was the age of 50, yet figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that they would have to wait for at least another five years. Even when that money arrived, ONS data showed that inheritance was much less lucrative than many asked in the survey expected. Others in the industry have argued that the UK public is ""largely ignoring"" financial planning for death. Dan Garrett, founder of will writing service Farewill, said that 30 million people in the UK had not written a will, partly because it had dropped down the household ""to do"" list. He also called on the government to clarify its plans for probate fees. The government is planning to substantially increase the cost to bereaved families of settling the estates of deceased relatives. The changes were expected to start last month but have been delayed.

"Joy Worrall had said she would ""throw herself off the quarry"" if she was ever in ill health or financial difficulty, the hearing was told An 82-year-old woman killed herself after an ""administrative error"" by the Department for Work and Pensions led to her pension being frozen, an inquest heard. Joy Worrall, from Rhes-y-Cae, Flintshire, was found dead in a quarry near her home in November last year. Her son Ben told the Ruthin court the family had discovered after her death her pension had been stopped. The DWP apologised ""unreservedly"" to Mrs Worrall's family for the error. Mr Worrall told the inquest his mother was reluctant to talk about her problems, but had previously stated if she was ever in ill health or in financial difficulty she would ""throw herself off the quarry"". ""My mother felt she couldn't discuss her finances with anyone,"" he said. The inquest heard that in 2014 she received an inheritance, but the DWP told her it would not affect her pension. She received a state pension, as well as a pension credit top-up. However, in 2017, ""action was taken to suspend her pension credit"". Rather than her state pension continuing while the credits were reviewed, all payments were stopped ""due to an administrative error"". The inquest heard there was no record of any correspondence from Mrs Worrall to the DWP about the matter. Her cause of death was given as multiple major traumatic injuries due to a fall from height. Coroner John Gittins recorded a conclusion of suicide and said it was ""indeed a deliberate act"". He told Mr Worrall if it was not for the information he supplied about the DWP, he may have struggled to determine if his mother had decided to take her own life. Following the hearing, Mr Worrall said: ""I feel as though there was a duty of care that was not fully carried out as it should've been, causing her to be in a situation where the only course of action was to end her life, which is a disgrace really."" He said he had taken up the case with his MP, David Hanson. A DWP spokesman said: ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Mrs Worrall. We apologise unreservedly to Mrs Worrall's family for the error that led to her pension payments being stopped and pledge to learn the lessons.""

"When the Duke and Duchess of Sussexnamed their newborn son Archie Harrison,many people were surprised. None more so than the Archie Harrisons in the UK. Engineering geologist Archie Harrison, 20, said he was at work when a news alert about the royal baby's name popped up on his phone. ""I thought it was sort of a joke,"" he said. ""Then I must have got 50 phone calls and WhatsApps. My mum was the first person to message me."" Archie Harrison, left, said the name Archie is ""not too common, a bit out there"" He added: ""It's quite weird we share exactly the same name, no hyphen. It doesn't happen to everyone. ""Archie isn't a common name. I have always been quite fond of the name so it's nice to get some recognition."" Mr Harrison said he has found the whole thing ""quite funny"", adding that, thanks to the royal baby news, he has now also learnt the meaning of his name - ""genuine"", ""bold"" or ""brave"". ""And then I heard people on the Tube talking about it saying they didn't like the name. I was sitting there thinking should I say something,"" he joked. Harry and Meghan name son Archie The meaning behind Archie and Harrison How do you decide on a baby name? Meanwhile Jody Harrison, from Worcester, had just come home after picking her children up from school when she heard that Prince Harry and Meghan had picked the same name as her six-year-old son. ""I came in, put the telly on and it said the royal baby was called Archie Harrison,"" she said. ""My little boy said, 'have they just said my name?'"" Jody said her son Archie enjoyed finding out he has the same name as a royal Ms Harrison, 51, said she loves Prince Harry and thinks the matching name is ""amazing"", adding: ""I think it's a great name, obviously. ""He's going to go into school tomorrow and tell the teacher, 'just call me Prince Archie, miss'."" She said the name was still quite unusual when she chose it, but it has since risen in popularity and she expects it to become even more popular. Another Archie Harrison, 19, from Southam in the Midlands, said his friends and colleagues have been making jokes. ""They have been calling me your royal highness and leaving the room they do a little bow."" ""I think there's going to be a lot of people named Archie now,"" added Mr Harrison Mr Harrison, who works as a carer, said: ""I've never had anything like this happen to me before, it's quite nice actually."" He also found out while he was at work, and was bombarded with lots of messages from his family and friends. ""It's like my full name, what are the chances of that,"" he said. ""I've never been too keen on my name myself, I always thought it was a bit random."" Meanwhile, the namesakes don't end at people. One man from London tweeted a picture of his mini labradoodle. ""Our dog is literally called Archie Harrison,"" he tweeted. ""That's what they call out at the vet."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Less than half of the world's major airlines are giving passengers the opportunity to offset the carbon dioxide produced from their flights, BBC research found. When airlines do offer such a scheme, generally fewer than 1% of flyers are choosing to spend more. Carbon offsetting enables passengers to balance out their carbon footprint by paying towards environmental projects. Aviation accounts for 2% of global human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. Prices vary but a return flight from London to Malaga, Spain, would cost around Â£4 to offset. Emma Thompson: 'If I could fly cleanly, I would' Which airline is best for carbon emissions? The BBC contacted the world's biggest airlines in terms of numbers of flights and numbers of passengers. Out of the 28 approached, less than half offered a carbon offset scheme and the majority declined to provide data on the number of passengers offsetting their flights during a one year period - often saying their figures were too low to report. Michael Gill, a director from the international aviation trade bodyIata,external, said: ""We strongly recommend all passengers to use high-quality projects to offset their own CO2 emissions as an individual contribution to addressing climate change."" This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly Carbon offsetting allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Passengers can pay the additional charge when they buy their ticket from participating airlines, but independent offsetting companies also exist. The price varies between airlines, but a return flight from London and Cape Town, South Africa would cost roughly Â£20 to offset, according to ClimateCare. The CO2 emissions per passenger from that flight is roughly the same as those produced from heating the average home for a year. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Advocates defend offsetting just as vociferously. British Airwaysdoes not run a carbon offsetting scheme. Instead, it gives customers the opportunity to contribute towards carbon reduction and community projects Lufthansaoffers a carbon offsetting scheme, but uptake from passengers is less than 1%. Following the BBC's enquiry, the company said it would now make the offer more visible to customers during the booking process Ryanairdoes offer a carbon offsetting scheme, but the company refused to disclose the uptake by passengers American Airlines, the world's biggest airline, does not offer an offset scheme. The company says it has taken ""many meaningful steps to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions"", including buying new, more fuel-efficient planes Emiratesdoes not offer a scheme, but will be participating in an international carbon offset scheme from 2021 Qantasbucked the trend with 10% of passengers opting to offset More people are flying than ever and over four billion passengers fly every year. All international carriers must now report their CO2 emissions on an annual basis and the sector as a whole is aiming to halve its carbon footprint by 2050. From next year, airlines will be required to offset any increase in emissions beyond their 2020 levels by reducing emissions elsewhere. The new international system, known as Corsia and established by the United Nations, is the first time a single industry sector has agreed to a global measure to tackle climate change. Prof Neil Harris, head of atmospheric informatics atCranfield University,external, UK, says carbon offsetting ""is a good idea but it's not working"". He feels airlines and governments need to do more. ""All opt in schemes tend to have low take-up,"" he explained. ""Secondly I think there's a lack of clarity on what the scheme is. You want to know the money is being well spent."" Prof Kevin Anderson, who researches energy and climate change at the University of Manchester, said the most important thing was changing consumer behaviour. ""Most people just fly occasionally but there's this small group who are very frequent fliers. And these people cannot be using offsetting to allow them to carry on business as usual,"" he said. ""If we are serious about climate change, it is not a business-as-usual world, we will have to change how it is we operate. And until we accept that we're going to continue to fail on climate change and the emissions will continue to rise."" 1.5 degrees Keeping the rise in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say. Thatâs compared with âpre-industrialâ times. The world has already warmed about 1C since then. 2 degrees The original target for limiting the rise in global average temperature. Recent research points to 1.5 degrees being a far safer limit. 3 degrees The current likely rise in average global temperature by the year 2100 if countries keep their promises to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which are driving climate change. 4 degrees A prediction of the likely rise in average temperature by 2100 if no further action is taken. This would see major sea-level rise, with many coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, as well as regular severe heatwaves and massive disruption to agriculture. Adaptation An action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought. AGW Stands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes. Arctic ice The Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Attribution Attribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely. Average temperature The average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C. BECCS Stands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy. Biofuel A fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste. Biomass Biomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations. Carbon Carbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon capture The trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity. Carbon footprint The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product. Carbon neutral A process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning. Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Carbon sink Anything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil. CCU Stands for âCarbon Capture and Utilisationâ. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics. Climate change A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans. Climate model Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes. Climate negotiations Climate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies. CO2 Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up. COP Stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. Copenhagen A UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was ""one of the greatest challenges of the present day"". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began. Coral bleaching Coral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot. Deforestation The clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned. Deniers Climate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century. Emissions Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries. Extreme weather Extreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer. Feedback loop In a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sunâs rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting. Fossil fuels Fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide. Geo-engineering Geo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences. Global temperature Usually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet. Global warming The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record. Green energy Green energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets. Greenhouse gases Natural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride. Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater. Hydrocarbon A hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change. IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts. Jetstream A jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europeâs hot summer of 2018 more common. Kyoto Protocol A set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990. Lukewarmers A term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists. Methane Methane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture â cows emit large amounts â as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming. Mitigation Action that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests. Net zero A term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'. Ocean acidification The ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the worldâs oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds. Ozone layer The ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. PPM / ppm An abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year. Pre-industrial Scientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker. Renewable energy Normally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar. Runaway climate change Describes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Sea ice Sea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average. Sea level rises Rising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm. Sustainability Sustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example. Tipping point Describes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a âtipping pointâ, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible. UNFCCC Stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change.

"The Prittlewell burial site was discovered in 2003 A royal burial site found between a pub and Aldi supermarket has been hailed as the UK's answer to Tutankhamun's tomb. Workers unearthed the grave, which contained dozens of rare artefacts, during roadworks in Prittlewell, near Southend, Essex, in 2003. Tooth enamel fragments were the only human remains, but experts say their ""best guess"" is that they belonged to a 6th Century Anglo-Saxon prince. It is said to be the oldest example of a Christian Anglo-Saxon royal burial. Now, after 15 years of expert analysis some of the artefacts are returning to Southend to go on permanent display for the first time at the Central Museum. When a team from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola) excavated the site, they said they were ""astounded"" to find the burial chamber intact. The remains of the timber structure, which would have measured about 13ft (4m) square and 5ft (1.5m) deep, housed some 40 rare and precious artefacts. Among them was a lyre - an ancient harp - and a 1,400-year-old box thought to be the only surviving example of painted Anglo-Saxon woodwork in Britain. Gold coins, the gilded silver neck of a wooden drinking vessel, decorative glass beakers and a flagon believed to have come from Syria were also found. Each had been placed within the tomb ""as part of a carefully choreographed burial rite"", indicating the resting place of a man of princely lineage, they said. The tomb contained 40 artefacts including treasures from other kingdoms Locals nicknamed the grave's unknown occupant the Prince of Prittlewell and the King of Bling because of the riches buried alongside him. Ciara Phipps from Southend Museums Service said the first artefact uncovered - a copper alloy hanging bowl - gave experts a ""real idea of just how significant this burial might be"". ""It's thought it was probably acquired as a gift so it gives a sense of how significant this person might have been... he had friends in high places,"" she said. It had been suggested the remains were those of Saebert, Saxon king of Essex from AD604 to AD616 but carbon dating and other tests have indicated the tomb was constructed between AD575 and AD605 - at least 11 years before his death. After 15 years of research, archaeologists said their ""best guess"" was that the tomb belonged to Seaxa, Saebert's brother. Gold-foil crosses found at the head of the coffin are thought to have been placed over the eyes - making it certain he was a Christian However, other funeral customs, such as the burial mound, grave artefacts and wooden chamber, reflect pre-Christian beliefs and traditions A golden belt buckle, likely made especially for the burial, suggested a high-status individual An ""exceptionally large"" ash-wood coffin with an elaborate lid had space for a corpse and other worldly items. It alone would have weighed 160kg The size of the coffin, and placement of items within it, suggested he was about 5ft 6in (1.68m) tall A folding iron stool, thought to be a gifstol (gift seat) from which a lord dispensed rewards and judgement to his loyal followers and warriors, was found A ""skilfully crafted sword"" with collars of ribbed gold wire on the horn handle and a complex, pattern-welded blade was a clear signal of an aristocratic or royal-status burial. Source: Mola Gold decorated drinking vessels were among the treasures found in the royal burial A lyre, a stringed musical instrument, was also among the finds The burial is believed to belong to Seaxa, the brother of King Saebert Sophie Jackson, Mola's director of research and engagement, said no-one had expected the ""unpromising looking site"" found in 2003 to contain ""our equivalent of Tutankhamun's tomb"". ""It's between a bit of railway and a bit of road, essentially a verge. It's not where you'd expect to find it,"" she said. Ms Jackson said no-one could have known what was beneath the ""unpromising-looking"" site She said the grave provided a snapshot of a ""really interesting time"" when Christianity was ""just creeping in"" to the British Isles. ""They would have been just on the transition between having pagan burials with all your gear but also having these crosses,"" she said. Ms Jackson said ""the best guess"" was the tomb had housed Seaxa. She said: ""There's a lot of debate about whether he was a fully-fledged hairy beast Saxon warrior, or younger. ""Had he died before he could really prove himself?"" Tutankhamun was an Egyptian king who died about 3,000 years ago. His tomb was discovered by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922 in an area now known as the Valley of the Kings. It was one of the most well-preserved tombs that conservationists had ever seen, and close to 2,000 objects were found inside. The chamber was filled with treasure and detailed wall paintings that showed the story of King Tutankhamun's life and death. After the treasures had been catalogued and cleared, the tomb itself became a tourist destination when it was opened to the public in the 1930s. Who was Tutankhamun? Treasure status for Norfolk Anglo-Saxon finds Treasure find man unearths rare brooch in Norfolk Lenborough Anglo Saxon coin hoard valued at Â£1.35m Research was undertaken by more than 40 experts in various fields, who worked together to reconstruct the chamber. In some cases, items had been so badly eroded that only soil impressions remained. These artefacts were digitally recreated using techniques including CT scans and microscopic analysis of soil samples. Ms Phipps said the display, which begins on Saturday, was a ""real gem"" of the museum. ""It's such a significant moment for the museum service and also for the community of Southend,"" she said. ""This collection has evoked and encouraged a huge amount of local pride."" The museum has alsolaunched a website with information about its research,external, as well as an interactive diagram of the tomb.

It had been suggested the remains were those of Saebert, Saxon king of Essex from AD604 to AD616 but carbon dating and other tests have indicated the tomb was constructed between AD575 and AD605 - at least 11 years before his death. After 15 years of research, archaeologists said their ""best guess"" was that the tomb belonged to Seaxa, Saebert's brother. Gold-foil crosses found at the head of the coffin are thought to have been placed over the eyes - making it certain he was a Christian However, other funeral customs, such as the burial mound, grave artefacts and wooden chamber, reflect pre-Christian beliefs and traditions A golden belt buckle, likely made especially for the burial, suggested a high-status individual An ""exceptionally large"" ash-wood coffin with an elaborate lid had space for a corpse and other worldly items. It alone would have weighed 160kg The size of the coffin, and placement of items within it, suggested he was about 5ft 6in (1.68m) tall A folding iron stool, thought to be a gifstol (gift seat) from which a lord dispensed rewards and judgement to his loyal followers and warriors, was found A ""skilfully crafted sword"" with collars of ribbed gold wire on the horn handle and a complex, pattern-welded blade was a clear signal of an aristocratic or royal-status burial. Source: Mola Gold decorated drinking vessels were among the treasures found in the royal burial A lyre, a stringed musical instrument, was also among the finds The burial is believed to belong to Seaxa, the brother of King Saebert Sophie Jackson, Mola's director of research and engagement, said no-one had expected the ""unpromising looking site"" found in 2003 to contain ""our equivalent of Tutankhamun's tomb"". ""It's between a bit of railway and a bit of road, essentially a verge. It's not where you'd expect to find it,"" she said. Ms Jackson said no-one could have known what was beneath the ""unpromising-looking"" site She said the grave provided a snapshot of a ""really interesting time"" when Christianity was ""just creeping in"" to the British Isles. ""They would have been just on the transition between having pagan burials with all your gear but also having these crosses,"" she said. Ms Jackson said ""the best guess"" was the tomb had housed Seaxa. She said: ""There's a lot of debate about whether he was a fully-fledged hairy beast Saxon warrior, or younger. ""Had he died before he could really prove himself?"" Tutankhamun was an Egyptian king who died about 3,000 years ago. His tomb was discovered by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922 in an area now known as the Valley of the Kings. It was one of the most well-preserved tombs that conservationists had ever seen, and close to 2,000 objects were found inside. The chamber was filled with treasure and detailed wall paintings that showed the story of King Tutankhamun's life and death. After the treasures had been catalogued and cleared, the tomb itself became a tourist destination when it was opened to the public in the 1930s. Who was Tutankhamun? Treasure status for Norfolk Anglo-Saxon finds Treasure find man unearths rare brooch in Norfolk Lenborough Anglo Saxon coin hoard valued at Â£1.35m Research was undertaken by more than 40 experts in various fields, who worked together to reconstruct the chamber. In some cases, items had been so badly eroded that only soil impressions remained. These artefacts were digitally recreated using techniques including CT scans and microscopic analysis of soil samples. Ms Phipps said the display, which begins on Saturday, was a ""real gem"" of the museum. ""It's such a significant moment for the museum service and also for the community of Southend,"" she said.

"The Prittlewell burial site was discovered in 2003 A royal burial site found between a pub and Aldi supermarket has been hailed as the UK's answer to Tutankhamun's tomb. Workers unearthed the grave, which contained dozens of rare artefacts, during roadworks in Prittlewell, near Southend, Essex, in 2003. Tooth enamel fragments were the only human remains, but experts say their ""best guess"" is that they belonged to a 6th Century Anglo-Saxon prince. It is said to be the oldest example of a Christian Anglo-Saxon royal burial. Now, after 15 years of expert analysis some of the artefacts are returning to Southend to go on permanent display for the first time at the Central Museum. When a team from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola) excavated the site, they said they were ""astounded"" to find the burial chamber intact. The remains of the timber structure, which would have measured about 13ft (4m) square and 5ft (1.5m) deep, housed some 40 rare and precious artefacts. Among them was a lyre - an ancient harp - and a 1,400-year-old box thought to be the only surviving example of painted Anglo-Saxon woodwork in Britain. Gold coins, the gilded silver neck of a wooden drinking vessel, decorative glass beakers and a flagon believed to have come from Syria were also found. Each had been placed within the tomb ""as part of a carefully choreographed burial rite"", indicating the resting place of a man of princely lineage, they said. The tomb contained 40 artefacts including treasures from other kingdoms Locals nicknamed the grave's unknown occupant the Prince of Prittlewell and the King of Bling because of the riches buried alongside him. Ciara Phipps from Southend Museums Service said the first artefact uncovered - a copper alloy hanging bowl - gave experts a ""real idea of just how significant this burial might be"".

"Christine Delcros was seriously injured in the attack and her fiance Xavier Thomas was killed The fiancee of the first victim of the London Bridge attack in 2017 has told an inquest she had ""premonitions about terror attacks"" the day he died. The body of Xavier Thomas was found in the River Thames after he was struck by a van driven by three attackers. Mr Thomas's girlfriend Christine Delcros, who was also badly hurt, wept as she gave evidence at the Old Bailey inquest into the eight victims' deaths. She told the court she was still ""madly in love"" with Mr Thomas. The couple had arrived in London from Paris on the morning of 3 June for a weekend of sightseeing, the court heard. Ms Delcros said Mr Thomas, 45, had arranged for them to have a cocktail in the Shard that evening. Ms Delcros gave evidence at the inquest into the deaths of eight victims ""I had so many premonitions about terror attacks from the day before and I could feel it,"" she said. But Mr Thomas had persuaded his girlfriend to stick to the plan. ""Not to disappoint him I said OK,"" Ms Delcros told the court. At about 21:30 BST they decided to walk across London Bridge from their hotel, the Four Seasons, Ms Delcros said. Xavier Thomas was the first fatality of the London Bridge attacks Ms Delcros said she remembered feeling something was ""not normal"" as they walked on the bridge. ""Suddenly I was under the impression there was a lot of light and a van that mounted the pavement in the exact fashion to make sure they were not going to miss us,"" she said. ""I just heard myself say to myself, 'That's how one dies, that's it.'"" Ms Delcros broke down in tears as she recounted lying on the ground thinking ""the curtain had fallen"" and she had died. As she came in and out of consciousness, she asked where Mr Thomas was, the court heard. The father-of-two had been thrown into the River Thames when the van hit him. The court heard Mr Thomas's body was found by police more than a mile and a half from London Bridge, near Shadwell Basin, on 6 June. His cause of death was given as immersion. Speaking in French, Ms Delcros said she was still ""madly in love"" with Mr Thomas and ""nothing would destroy that"" connection. As he gave the court her comments in English, the translator had tears streaming down his cheeks. Mr Thomas and Ms Delcros were seen crossing the bridge on CCTV footage A police officer in charge of a patrol boat at the scene said his team had been ""desperate"" to find anyone who might have fallen from the bridge. PC Nicholas Bultitude said his team did not use an infrared camera on their boat because it was ""more practical"" to search visually. He told the court his team covered ""every inch of that portion of the river"" and that if Mr Thomas had been on the surface he would have been seen. Dominic Adamson, representing Mr Thomas' family, questioned PC Bultitude's decision to abandon the river search after gunshots were heard so he could warn crowds on the South Bank of the danger. But PC Bultitude replied: ""When I made the decision, so far as I was concerned, if someone has gone in then tragically they are lost."" Khuram Butt hired a van to use in the attack, the inquest heard previously Witness Holly Jones said she remembered seeing the French couple looking ""very happy together"" seconds before the attack. Ms Jones said she was ""frozen in fear"" when she saw the ""demented"" driver, Youssef Zaghba, heading towards her. ""It was a feeling I described as like being punched into the chest,"" the BBC journalist told the court. ""Something in the back of my mind told me to get out of the way. I jumped to the right towards the railings,"" she said. The witness said she felt the ""wind of the van"" as it sped past her. Ms Jones said she then went to help Ms Delcros and told police to check the water for Mr Thomas. Attacker wiped knife on beard Victim's final kiss for fiance London Bridge attack: The victims Zaghba, 22, and his accomplices Khuram Butt, 27, and Rachid Redouane, 30, were shot dead by police after killing eight people and injuring 48 others around Borough Market. On Wednesday the inquest was told Mr Thomas and a second victim, Christine Archibald, 30,might still be alive if barriers had been put upfollowing the Westminster Bridge attack, which took place two months earlier. The other victims were Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Sara Zelenak, 21, Kirsty Boden, 28, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, and Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39. Hanna Yusuf, BBC reporter, at the inquest The hearing ended for the day as it had started - with emotions running high. Xavier Thomas's girlfriend, Christine Delcros, appeared distressed in the courtroom. With eyes closed and the tips of her fingers to her temples, she listened to analysis of how Mr Thomas had gasped for air upon entering the cold Thames and drowned as a result. Sitting next to Ms Delcros was Christiane Pesez, Mr Thomas's mother. She had her head lowered and tears streamed down her face as she heard of her son's last moments alive. Her husband and Mr Thomas's stepfather, Philippe Pesez, stared into space - a display of grief in one of its various forms. As the hearing drew to a close, the final witness of the day, Tanya Lunt, struggled to contain her emotions the moment she started speaking - remembering back to that day in June 2017 when she realised that a deliberate attack was happening. Mark Roberts was among a group of people who had set up tripods on London Bridge to take photographs of Tower Bridge. He told the court on Thursday he saw the van moving at about 30mph or 40mph as it hit a group of people. The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan He said: ""It looked to me it was deliberately steering and aiming at the people. At that point it started driving along the pavement towards me."" Mr Roberts said he thought he was ""next in line"", but suddenly the van veered towards a group of people running away. He told the court one woman was thrown into the air ""like a rag doll"". The inquest continues.

"When the Duke and Duchess of Sussexnamed their newborn son Archie Harrison,many people were surprised. None more so than the Archie Harrisons in the UK. Engineering geologist Archie Harrison, 20, said he was at work when a news alert about the royal baby's name popped up on his phone. ""I thought it was sort of a joke,"" he said. ""Then I must have got 50 phone calls and WhatsApps. My mum was the first person to message me."" Archie Harrison, left, said the name Archie is ""not too common, a bit out there"" He added: ""It's quite weird we share exactly the same name, no hyphen. It doesn't happen to everyone. ""Archie isn't a common name. I have always been quite fond of the name so it's nice to get some recognition."" Mr Harrison said he has found the whole thing ""quite funny"", adding that, thanks to the royal baby news, he has now also learnt the meaning of his name - ""genuine"", ""bold"" or ""brave"". ""And then I heard people on the Tube talking about it saying they didn't like the name. I was sitting there thinking should I say something,"" he joked. Harry and Meghan name son Archie The meaning behind Archie and Harrison How do you decide on a baby name? Meanwhile Jody Harrison, from Worcester, had just come home after picking her children up from school when she heard that Prince Harry and Meghan had picked the same name as her six-year-old son. ""I came in, put the telly on and it said the royal baby was called Archie Harrison,"" she said. ""My little boy said, 'have they just said my name?'"" Jody said her son Archie enjoyed finding out he has the same name as a royal Ms Harrison, 51, said she loves Prince Harry and thinks the matching name is ""amazing"", adding: ""I think it's a great name, obviously. ""He's going to go into school tomorrow and tell the teacher, 'just call me Prince Archie, miss'."" She said the name was still quite unusual when she chose it, but it has since risen in popularity and she expects it to become even more popular. Another Archie Harrison, 19, from Southam in the Midlands, said his friends and colleagues have been making jokes. ""They have been calling me your royal highness and leaving the room they do a little bow."" ""I think there's going to be a lot of people named Archie now,"" added Mr Harrison Mr Harrison, who works as a carer, said: ""I've never had anything like this happen to me before, it's quite nice actually."" He also found out while he was at work, and was bombarded with lots of messages from his family and friends. ""It's like my full name, what are the chances of that,"" he said. ""I've never been too keen on my name myself, I always thought it was a bit random."" Meanwhile, the namesakes don't end at people. One man from London tweeted a picture of his mini labradoodle. ""Our dog is literally called Archie Harrison,"" he tweeted. ""That's what they call out at the vet."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Less than half of the world's major airlines are giving passengers the opportunity to offset the carbon dioxide produced from their flights, BBC research found. When airlines do offer such a scheme, generally fewer than 1% of flyers are choosing to spend more. Carbon offsetting enables passengers to balance out their carbon footprint by paying towards environmental projects. Aviation accounts for 2% of global human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. Prices vary but a return flight from London to Malaga, Spain, would cost around Â£4 to offset. Emma Thompson: 'If I could fly cleanly, I would' Which airline is best for carbon emissions? The BBC contacted the world's biggest airlines in terms of numbers of flights and numbers of passengers. Out of the 28 approached, less than half offered a carbon offset scheme and the majority declined to provide data on the number of passengers offsetting their flights during a one year period - often saying their figures were too low to report. Michael Gill, a director from the international aviation trade bodyIata,external, said: ""We strongly recommend all passengers to use high-quality projects to offset their own CO2 emissions as an individual contribution to addressing climate change."" This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly Carbon offsetting allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Passengers can pay the additional charge when they buy their ticket from participating airlines, but independent offsetting companies also exist. The price varies between airlines, but a return flight from London and Cape Town, South Africa would cost roughly Â£20 to offset, according to ClimateCare. The CO2 emissions per passenger from that flight is roughly the same as those produced from heating the average home for a year. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Advocates defend offsetting just as vociferously. British Airwaysdoes not run a carbon offsetting scheme. Instead, it gives customers the opportunity to contribute towards carbon reduction and community projects Lufthansaoffers a carbon offsetting scheme, but uptake from passengers is less than 1%. Following the BBC's enquiry, the company said it would now make the offer more visible to customers during the booking process Ryanairdoes offer a carbon offsetting scheme, but the company refused to disclose the uptake by passengers American Airlines, the world's biggest airline, does not offer an offset scheme. The company says it has taken ""many meaningful steps to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions"", including buying new, more fuel-efficient planes Emiratesdoes not offer a scheme, but will be participating in an international carbon offset scheme from 2021 Qantasbucked the trend with 10% of passengers opting to offset More people are flying than ever and over four billion passengers fly every year. All international carriers must now report their CO2 emissions on an annual basis and the sector as a whole is aiming to halve its carbon footprint by 2050. From next year, airlines will be required to offset any increase in emissions beyond their 2020 levels by reducing emissions elsewhere. The new international system, known as Corsia and established by the United Nations, is the first time a single industry sector has agreed to a global measure to tackle climate change. Prof Neil Harris, head of atmospheric informatics atCranfield University,external, UK, says carbon offsetting ""is a good idea but it's not working"". He feels airlines and governments need to do more. ""All opt in schemes tend to have low take-up,"" he explained. ""Secondly I think there's a lack of clarity on what the scheme is. You want to know the money is being well spent."" Prof Kevin Anderson, who researches energy and climate change at the University of Manchester, said the most important thing was changing consumer behaviour. ""Most people just fly occasionally but there's this small group who are very frequent fliers. And these people cannot be using offsetting to allow them to carry on business as usual,"" he said. ""If we are serious about climate change, it is not a business-as-usual world, we will have to change how it is we operate. And until we accept that we're going to continue to fail on climate change and the emissions will continue to rise."" 1.5 degrees Keeping the rise in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say. Thatâs compared with âpre-industrialâ times. The world has already warmed about 1C since then. 2 degrees The original target for limiting the rise in global average temperature. Recent research points to 1.5 degrees being a far safer limit. 3 degrees The current likely rise in average global temperature by the year 2100 if countries keep their promises to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which are driving climate change. 4 degrees A prediction of the likely rise in average temperature by 2100 if no further action is taken. This would see major sea-level rise, with many coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, as well as regular severe heatwaves and massive disruption to agriculture. Adaptation An action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought. AGW Stands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes. Arctic ice The Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Attribution Attribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely. Average temperature The average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C. BECCS Stands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy. Biofuel A fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste. Biomass Biomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations. Carbon Carbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon capture The trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity. Carbon footprint The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product. Carbon neutral A process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning. Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Carbon sink Anything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil. CCU Stands for âCarbon Capture and Utilisationâ. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics. Climate change A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans. Climate model Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes. Climate negotiations Climate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies. CO2 Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up. COP Stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. Copenhagen A UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was ""one of the greatest challenges of the present day"". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began. Coral bleaching Coral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot. Deforestation The clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned. Deniers Climate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century. Emissions Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries. Extreme weather Extreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer. Feedback loop In a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sunâs rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting. Fossil fuels Fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide. Geo-engineering Geo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences. Global temperature Usually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet. Global warming The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record. Green energy Green energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets. Greenhouse gases Natural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride. Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater. Hydrocarbon A hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change. IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts. Jetstream A jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europeâs hot summer of 2018 more common. Kyoto Protocol A set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990. Lukewarmers A term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists. Methane Methane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture â cows emit large amounts â as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming. Mitigation Action that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests. Net zero A term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'. Ocean acidification The ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the worldâs oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds. Ozone layer The ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. PPM / ppm An abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year. Pre-industrial Scientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker. Renewable energy Normally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar. Runaway climate change Describes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Sea ice Sea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average. Sea level rises Rising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm. Sustainability Sustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example. Tipping point Describes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a âtipping pointâ, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible. UNFCCC Stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says cross-party talks have been ""difficult"" and that Labour ""backs option of a public vote"" Labour can ""unite our country"" and heal the divisions caused by Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn said, as he launched his European elections campaign. Mr Corbyn said the party backed ""the option of a public vote"" if a ""sensible"" Brexit deal cannot be agreed and there is not a general election. He said cross-party talks on Brexit were ""difficult"" as the government's ""red lines remain in place"". The European elections take place in the UK on 23 May. The UK was due to leave the EU on 29 March, but as no deal was agreed by Parliament, the EU extended the deadline to 31 October. It can leave the bloc earlier, but if the UK has not left by 23 May, it is legally obliged to take part in the EU-wide poll and send MEPs to Brussels. Laura Kuenssberg: Can Corbyn heal Brexit divide? A guide to the UK's European elections How do European elections work? Cross-party talks between the government and Labour have been taking place to try to solve the Brexit impasse. However Mr Corbyn said the talks had been difficult and that ""so far there have been no big offers"". ""It is quite difficult to negotiate with a disintegrating government with cabinet ministers jockeying for the succession, rather than working for an agreement,"" he said. Mr Corbyn launched Labour's campaign in Gillingham, Kent, where he issued an appeal to both sides of the Brexit debate. He said: ""To transform our country, and tackle injustice, inequality and the climate crisis, we need to unite the overwhelming majority of people and take on the privileged and powerful. ""That's why we insist the real divide in our country is not how people voted in the EU referendum. ""The real divide is between the many and the few."" The party has selected 70 candidates across the 12 regions. They include the former cabinet minister and passionate Brexit critic Lord Adonis, who is second on the South West England list. Other stand-out names include Laura Parker, a leading figure in the Momentum campaign group, and Eloise Todd, chief executive of the Best for Britain group. Eloise Todd, chief executive of the Best for Britain group, is a Labour MEP candidate Mr Corbyn said Labour was ""the only party with a plan to unite our country"". ""Other parties appeal to just one side of the Brexit debate because they aren't really committed to taking on the tax dodgers, the big polluters, or the financial gamblers who crashed our economy a decade ago,"" he said. He promised Labour's alternative plan for Brexit ""would end the chaos caused by the Conservatives and let us focus on the other big issues facing our country"". ""But we can never accept the government's bad deal or a disastrous no deal,"" he added. ""So if we can't get a sensible deal, along the lines of our alternative plan, or a general election, Labour backs the option of a public vote."" The issue of a further referendum has proved divisive in the party - with many MPs and frontbenchers opposed to the idea. European elections: What you need to know A really simple guide to the European elections 2019 European elections: List of candidates But Labour's governing bodyagreed last month to support a further referendumon Brexit under certain circumstances. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Labour's ""great balancing act"" on Brexit continued, with Mr Corbyn ""trying to keep Labour Leave supporters on board while not alienating Labour Remain supporters"". Responding to the speech, Labour MP Mary Creagh, a Remain supporter, said that ""standing in the middle of the road means you get run over from both sides"". Cross-party talks on Brexit between the government and Labour will continue next week. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, said on Wednesday that he believed the PM would ask the Commons to vote again on the terms of the UK's exit before elections to the European Parliament take place. The withdrawal agreement has effectivelybeen rejected by MPs three times already.

"PC Lee Jackson is one of thousands of officers to have been diagnosed with the condition Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among police officers in the UK is far more common than was ever thought, a new survey suggests. One PC describes his battle with the medical condition. Lee Jackson is the kind of police officer who runs towards danger, the sort who is not afraid to break down doors or break up fights. A Taser-trained response officer at Durham Police with over 19 years' service, he's dealt with almost every crime imaginable and was once three minutes from death after becoming impaled on a broken car aerial while investigating a car crash. But PC Jackson was floored by a medical condition that affects thousands of officers without them even realising - PTSD, which causes acute anxiety, sleep problems and recurring memories of disturbing events. ""I thought I was pretty much invulnerable,"" says the 47-year-old constable. ""I didn't see things building up or the problems that were going to affect us."" PC Jackson said he let traumatic memories build up ""in a box in my brain"" It all came to a head in 2015 when he was called to a violent domestic dispute. ""It was a Friday night on my own,"" he said. ""I pulled up to stop some people arguing because it was starting to get a little bit more physical"". ""I ended up being attacked - someone tried to gouge my eye out."" His eye became infected, leaving him temporarily blinded. He took a week off work but after returning began to have flashbacks at night. Car aerial left PC 'minutes from death' Policing on my own 'left me with PTSD' ""I would wake up sort of in a sweat and physically feel like I'd been back living that moment again,"" says PC Jackson. His work suffered - he had doubts about whether he could do his job properly and felt everyone was out to get him - and he became a ""nightmare"" to live with at home. Finally, he sought help and PTSD was diagnosed - it had been caused by the dozens of traumatic incidents he had handled and witnessed. ""What I'd done is just to put them away in a box in my brain, left them, and never had a chance to go back,"" he explains. A major new survey suggests the health problems affecting PC Jackson are far more common in the police than was ever thought. The study of almost 17,000 police across the UK found that 95% of officers and 67% of operational police staff had been exposed to traumatic events, almost all of which were work-related. Of those who had experienced trauma, 20% reported symptoms in the preceding four weeks that were consistent with PTSD or the more chronic condition, Complex PTSD, which is associated with emotional numbness and disconnection. Two-thirds of those with PTSD were unaware they were suffering from it, according to the research. ""For the first time in the UK we can see behind the cultural trope of the 'burnt-out copper' who has seen too much,"" says lead researcher Dr Jess Miller from the University of Cambridge, which conducted the study. ""This is a clinical and public sector crisis,"" she says, pointing out that the rates of PTSD in the police are almost five times higher than in the general population. Among the most concerning findings, Dr Miller says, is that more than half of those surveyed said they had insufficient time to process incidents before being sent back out on the next call. ""A stiff upper lip attitude will not work in contemporary policing,"" she says. One officer told the survey he had developed night terrors after attending a series of murder scenes; another said he had a nervous breakdown and suicidal thoughts after reliving a death in custody during the formal inquiry; some spoke about the stress of spending months viewing ""horrific"" terrorism material or paedophile chatlogs online. Gill Scott-Moore, chief executive of Police Care UK, the charity which funded the research, says:  ""The service has real challenges around recognising and responding to the signs and symptoms of trauma exposure and is heavily reliant upon generic NHS provision that isn't equipped for the specialist treatment needed."" In April, a national police wellbeing service was launched to provide expertise on occupational health provision to forces across England and Wales. The service, developed with Â£7.5m investment from the Home Office, has been overseen by the College of Policing alongside Lancashire Chief Constable Andy Rhodes, who leads on the issue nationally. ""The study does not surprise me and it provides evidence to support investment in prevention as well as acute services,'' says Chief Constable Rhodes. ""With stigma around mental health slowly reducing we are seeing hidden issues emerging such as high levels of stress and trauma impact, which can contribute to escalation if they aren't addressed,"" he adds. The Police Federation of England and Wales says some officers ""are at breaking point"" PC Lee Jackson managed to address his problems - after six months of one-to-one counselling. But he says much more needs to be done to give officers and staff information about how to spot the signs of PTSD and where to go for support. He says: ""We've got a tactic for everything in the police [but] we haven't for when you are dealing with traumatic incidents or trauma in yourself and we maybe need that."" Che Donald, national vice-chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, called for more government funding to help officers who ""are at breaking point"". ""If officers are breaking, then how can we expect them to adequately serve and protect the public?"" he added.

"US President Donald Trump has said China ""broke the deal"" in trade talks, ramping up hostilities ahead of negotiations between the two sides. The comments came as Beijing said it would retaliate with ""necessary countermeasures"" if the US raises tariffs on Chinese products. Mr Trump has vowed to more than double tariffs on $200bn (Â£152bn) of Chinese goods on Friday. Despite that, the two sides are due to hold trade talks in the US on Thursday. The Chinese delegation for the Washington talks is led by Vice-Premier Liu He, who oversees the economy and is one of the most powerful officials in China. Ahead of the discussions, Mr Trump accused China's leaders of breaking the deal the US was negotiating on trade. ""They broke the deal... They can't do that. So they'll be paying,"" Mr Trump told supporters at a campaign rally in Florida. He said if the two sides do not make a deal, there was ""nothing wrong with taking in more than $100bn a year"".

"More UK homes will be at flood risk in the future Englandâs coastal communities havenât faced up to the reality of rising seas through climate change, a report says. An increase of at least 1m is almost certain at some point in the future, the governmentâs advisors predict. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) warns this huge rise may happen over the next 80 years - within the lifetimes of today's children. A government spokesman said the public would be protected from the impacts of climate change. But the CCC says current shoreline management plans are unfunded and hopelessly optimistic. It estimates that by the 2080s, up to 1.2 million homes may be at increased risk from coastal floods. Young will pick up climate change bill, advisers warn Final call to save the world from 'climate catastrophe' What is climate change? Will more people have to abandon their homes in future? The CCCâs chief executive, Chris Stark, told BBC News: âPeople know sea level is going to rise â but they havenât grasped how bad this could be for them.â His colleague Professor Julia King added: âWeâve got to wake up to the fact that weâve got some very difficult challenges ahead. âWe need local councils to have some honest discussions with people to help them prepare for the difficult choices theyâll face.â The report says many coastal communities are particularly vulnerable because populations in coastal areas are often poorer and older than the UK average. It highlights the issue of land-slips on the coast. It says 100,000 cliff-top properties could be at risk from coastal landsliding, but the public donât have clear and accurate information about the issues and thereâs no insurance or compensation for people who lose their homes. Is it just homes that are under threat? No, itâs much wider than that. Transport, energy and waste infrastructure are also exposed to coastal flooding and erosion. Approximately 7,500km of road, 520km of railway line, 205,000 hectares of good farm land, and 3,400ha of potentially toxic historic landfill sites are currently at 0.1% or greater risk of coastal flooding in any given year. Power plants, ports, gas terminals and other significant assets are also at risk. The report says the government needs to focus on protecting these assets, as well as saving peopleâs homes. Whatâs more, coastal defences are likely to be at risk of failure as sea levels rise. A rise of 0.5m is projected to make a further 20% of England's coastal defences vulnerable to failure. The risk will be even higher if the current rates of deterioration of saltmarshes, shingle beaches and sand dunes continue. Some more key facts In England, 520,000 properties (including 370,000 homes) are in areas with a 0.5% or greater annual risk from coastal flooding. By the 2080s, that figure could rise to 1.5 million properties (including 1.2 million homes). In addition, approximately 1,600km of major roads, 650km of railway line, 92 railway stations and 55 historic landfill sites are at risk of coastal flooding or erosion by the end of the century. A government spokesperson said: ""The government has already committed Â£1.2bn of investment in coastal erosion and sea flooding projects over the next six years to better protect 170,000 homes. ""We welcome the committee's report which will inform our work to tackle increasing flood and coastal erosion risks, ahead of the publication of our Government Policy Statement on flooding and coastal erosion next year.""

"The Army was called in to help protect homes against floods last year As many as 530 key infrastructure sites across England are still vulnerable to flooding, according to a government review. The report,externalcommits a total of Â£12.5m to new temporary flood defences in England. The review was commissioned after 16,000 houses across northern England were flooded during the wettest December in a century last year. Critics at the time said defences were not up to the job. The Â£12.5m means the Environment Agency would have four times as many temporary flood barriers than in 2015. Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom said the review set out ""clear actions so we are better prepared to respond quickly in the event of future flooding and can strengthen the nation's flood defences"". She added: ""Work is already underway towards Â£12.5 million of new temporary defences stationed around England, better protection for our infrastructure and new flood modelling that makes better use of data and technology."" She also said the government was investing Â£2.5bn by 2021 to protect families, homes and businesses from flooding. Other recommendations from the review include: A commitment from utility companies to increase flood protection of their key local infrastructure, such as phone networks and water treatment works. A new stress test of the risk of flooding from rivers and the sea in England. For the first time, Met Office forecasts of extreme rainfall scenarios will be linked with Environment Agency modelling to provide a new assessment of flood risk. Analysis - David Shukman, BBC Science Editor Ministers offer communities the prospect of better protection from flooding but the report lays bare the scale of the work needed to achieve that. What does not appear in the press release accompanying the report is what many would judge to be the key finding: that as many as 530 important infrastructure sites across England - water supplies, telecommunications systems and electricity networks - are still vulnerable. And a fair question is what happens in the immediate future. The Met Office concludes that even without the effects of climate change, storms like those last winter could bring even greater volumes of rainfall - nearly one-third more in some cases. So I asked the Environment Agency if a city like Carlisle, inundated badly last December, would be any safer this winter. Not really, came the answer, reluctantly. The new temporary barriers would not hold back the 2m of floodwater seen last winter. The hope for the moment is that vulnerable homes have been fitted with the latest protection systems. The uncomfortable truth is that it's impossible to defend everyone all the time. But no one in authority particularly likes to say so. The National Flood Resilience Review was set up after devastating floods last winter across parts of northern England. Its aim was to assess how the country could be better protected from future flooding and increasing extreme weather. During storms last December in parts of northern England, flood defences did not work in some places, forcing thousands of people from their homes over Christmas. Dr Stephen Gibbs, chairman of the Carlisle Flood Action Group, who lives in the Cumbrian city and has been flooded twice, was critical of the Government's approach. ""The issue is Government statutory powers to say 'we will defeat flooding',"" he explained. ""The Environment Agency [EA] have a pattern - they have a flood, they have a review, then they get out the [sticking plaster] and hope for the best until the next flood. ""Temporary flood defences are part of the filibustering that the EA are having to do. The Dutch defeated flooding because their senior politicians sat down and said 'How can we defeat this?' And they defeated flooding."" The report itself notes that just 30-40% of locally important infrastructure sites might be suitable for protection with appropriate temporary defences. Leeds City Council leader Judith Blake said: ""Leeds is barely mentioned in this report, which really does smack of the Government not taking the risk here seriously. ""Storm Eva caused absolute devastation for residents and businesses in Leeds, with many still recovering. After the floods, Ms Blake argued that there was a North-South divide in the response. ""As we know to our cost, there has been a severe lack of long-term planning when it comes to funding for flood defences and there is nothing in this report to offer comfort on that level,"" she said. Cllr Martin Tett, environment spokesman for the Local Government Association (LGA) said the Â£12.5m was a step ""in the right direction"". He added: ""Future funding for flood defences must also be devolved by the government to local areas. This will enable councils, working with communities and businesses, to ensure money is directed towards projects that best reflect local needs.""

"Bill Barr is facing a contempt vote in the House of Representatives A US House of Representatives panel has voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for not releasing an unredacted copy of the report on Russian election meddling. The judiciary committee took the rare step as tensions rose over Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings. Earlier, President Donald Trump used his executive privilege for the first time to block the report's disclosure. The White House and Congress accused each other of abusing power. Mr Mueller's report did not conclude that there was a criminal conspiracy between Moscow and the Trump campaign to influence the 2016 US presidential election. However, Mr Mueller did detail 10 instances where Mr Trump possibly attempted to impede the investigation. Five looming fights between Congress and Trump Eight new things in the Mueller report Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee has subpoenaed Donald Trump Jr, one of Mr Trump's sons, to legally force him to testify. It is the first known legal summons issued to a member of the president's family in connection with the investigation. Mr Trump Jr will be expected to answer questions about testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2017, which was later contradicted by the president's former lawyer Michael Cohen, US media report. He will also probably be quizzed on his connections in Russia. Democratic lawmakers put forward the measure after Mr Barr did not comply with a legal order to release the Mueller report without the redactions. The 448-page report was released last month with parts blacked out, including information that is classified or linked to pending investigations. After the legal order, Mr Barr formally asked the president to assert his right to executive privilege to stop the unredacted version of the report being released. The judiciary committee voted 24-16 along party lines to refer a contempt citation against the attorney general for a full House vote. It was not clear when this vote would happen. This video can not be played The Mueller report - in 60 seconds Democrats say they need to see the full report and its underlying evidence to investigate possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump. House judiciary chairman Jerrold Nadler said the vote was a ""grave and momentous step"", calling the Trump administration's refusal to provide the full report to Congress ""an attack on the essence of our democracy"". ""We have talked for a long time about approaching a constitutional crisis, we are now in it,"" the New York Democrat told reporters. Earlier, Doug Collins, a leading Republican on the committee, said Democrats were acting out of anger and fear ""without any valid legislative reason"". This is hardly the first battle between a president and his political opponents in Congress. Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton all responded to some congressional subpoenas with claims of executive privilege. The Republican-controlled House once even held Mr Obama's attorney general in contempt, setting a perhaps soon-to-be-revisited precedent. The stakes in this battle, however, are as high as they've ever been, and the tone of the conflict has reached new levels of acrimony. At issue isn't just an unredacted version of the Mueller report, which could contain damning, previously undisclosed details or amount to a big nothing. It's the entire sweep of congressional oversight of the Trump administration, including review of administration actions and Mr Trump's business empire and financial ties. The president has promised to resist all subpoenas, and Congress is contemplating legal action, further rebukes or even impeachment. Some are suggesting assessing hefty fines on intransigent administration officials or invoking the seldom-used concept of ""implicit contempt"", which in theory could culminate in the House sergeant-at-arms trying to arrest and imprison the attorney general. It seems far-fetched, but such is the current state of executive-legislative relations. And neither side appears interested in backing down. For Mr Barr to actually face the prospect of charges, the entire House - where Democrats hold a 235-197 majority over Republicans - would have to vote against him. The measure may be largely symbolic as few expect the Department of Justice to indict its own head with criminal contempt. However, it would send a powerful message to the White House that congressional Democrats will not retreat in an increasingly vitriolic showdown. Mr Barr is the first attorney general held in contempt of Congress since the Obama administration's Eric Holder in 2012. Mr Trump insists the Mueller report absolves him of any wrong-doing in his election campaign Earlier, the White House accused Democrats of a ""blatant abuse of power"" and blocked access to the full Mueller report by claiming executive privilege. It allows a president to keep certain materials private if disclosing them would disrupt the confidentiality of the Oval Office decision-making process. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president had taken such a step at the attorney general's request to reject ""unlawful and reckless demands"" by Democrats. ""They didn't like the results of the [Mueller] report, and now they want a redo,"" she said in a statement. Chairman Nadler has criticised the Trump administration's efforts to ""stonewall Congress"" The judiciary committee chairman argued the White House was misapplying the doctrine of executive privilege. Mr Nadler said: ""This decision represents a clear escalation in the Trump administration's blanket defiance of Congress's constitutionally mandated duties."" Mr Barr was greeted with a standing ovation as he entered a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The House judiciary committee has formally requested Mr Mueller testify, though a date has not been set. The special counsel is still a Department of Justice employee, which means the attorney general could prevent him from testifying. Mr Barr has previously said he would not mind Mr Mueller testifying before Congress, but Mr Trump has said the special counsel should not appear before lawmakers. When Mr Mueller handed in his report, a spokesman said he would be leaving the department ""within the coming days"". If he does quit, he will become a private citizen and able to testify regardless of the department's wishes. The panel's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in US politics has been rumbling on for the past two years.

"The man in charge of England's flood defences has called for a debate on whether communities at the highest risk should be abandoned and their residents permanently relocated. Sir James Bevan, the Environment Agency chief executive, said England could not continue to build taller, stronger and costlier concrete defences for ever. In a speech in Telford, he asked if it would be safer for people to move. The UK ""owed it to future generations"" to think the unthinkable, he suggested. Addressing the Flood and Coast Conference, he also called for homeowners to be more aware of the risks they faced and for businesses, councils and other organisations to share more of the cost of funding flood defences. Central government accounts for about 90% of all English funding on flood risk management and defence. Hundreds of key sites at risk of floods According to a 2016 government review, 12% of England's land mass, 8% of the population and 2.4 million homes and other premises are vulnerable to coastal and river flooding. In the wake of the devastating 2013-14 winter floods across southern England, the then prime minister David Cameron pledged to spend whatever it took to rebuild communities and ensure they weren't swamped again. Sir James said the UK had strengthened its capacity to deal with flooding since then and the equally devastating floods in the north of England in the winter of 2015-6. But, in the longer term, he said government would have to rethink its approach ""from first principles"", suggesting what had worked so well in the past and continued to do so ""may not be enough in the future"". Sir James Bevan said traditional lines of defence may not work in the future While vital infrastructure such as the Thames Barrier would likely have to be upgraded in the years to come, he said there was a limit to the protection ""hard"" structures could offer and ""more concrete was not the answer"". ""In the face of the rising risks and costs, it won't make sense to go on building ever taller, stronger and more expensive concrete defences as the default solution to flood risk,"" he said. ""The engineering won't work and the humans won't put up with it. You can only build a wall so high before people stop wanting to live behind it."" While he made clear he was not calling for high-risk communities to be uprooted, he said the argument that it would be safer and cheaper to do so than to continue to defend them had to be confronted. ""There are places on the coast and on some of our major rivers which are already costing millions of pounds a year to defend and those costs will only rise over time,"" he said. ""Do we want to defend every inhabited location or should we consider moving some communities? ""I am not saying we should do that. I know how important place and community are to people. I am saying we should be prepared to have the debate."" In its 2016 flood resilience review, UK ministers acknowledged alternatives to ""hard solutions"" were needed, with more emphasis on natural flood management and water planning, both down river and upstream.

"Bill Barr is facing a contempt vote in the House of Representatives A US House of Representatives panel has voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for not releasing an unredacted copy of the report on Russian election meddling. The judiciary committee took the rare step as tensions rose over Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings. Earlier, President Donald Trump used his executive privilege for the first time to block the report's disclosure. The White House and Congress accused each other of abusing power. Mr Mueller's report did not conclude that there was a criminal conspiracy between Moscow and the Trump campaign to influence the 2016 US presidential election. However, Mr Mueller did detail 10 instances where Mr Trump possibly attempted to impede the investigation. Five looming fights between Congress and Trump Eight new things in the Mueller report Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee has subpoenaed Donald Trump Jr, one of Mr Trump's sons, to legally force him to testify. It is the first known legal summons issued to a member of the president's family in connection with the investigation. Mr Trump Jr will be expected to answer questions about testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2017, which was later contradicted by the president's former lawyer Michael Cohen, US media report. He will also probably be quizzed on his connections in Russia. Democratic lawmakers put forward the measure after Mr Barr did not comply with a legal order to release the Mueller report without the redactions. The 448-page report was released last month with parts blacked out, including information that is classified or linked to pending investigations. After the legal order, Mr Barr formally asked the president to assert his right to executive privilege to stop the unredacted version of the report being released. The judiciary committee voted 24-16 along party lines to refer a contempt citation against the attorney general for a full House vote. It was not clear when this vote would happen. This video can not be played The Mueller report - in 60 seconds Democrats say they need to see the full report and its underlying evidence to investigate possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump. House judiciary chairman Jerrold Nadler said the vote was a ""grave and momentous step"", calling the Trump administration's refusal to provide the full report to Congress ""an attack on the essence of our democracy"". ""We have talked for a long time about approaching a constitutional crisis, we are now in it,"" the New York Democrat told reporters. Earlier, Doug Collins, a leading Republican on the committee, said Democrats were acting out of anger and fear ""without any valid legislative reason"". This is hardly the first battle between a president and his political opponents in Congress. Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton all responded to some congressional subpoenas with claims of executive privilege. The Republican-controlled House once even held Mr Obama's attorney general in contempt, setting a perhaps soon-to-be-revisited precedent. The stakes in this battle, however, are as high as they've ever been, and the tone of the conflict has reached new levels of acrimony. At issue isn't just an unredacted version of the Mueller report, which could contain damning, previously undisclosed details or amount to a big nothing. It's the entire sweep of congressional oversight of the Trump administration, including review of administration actions and Mr Trump's business empire and financial ties. The president has promised to resist all subpoenas, and Congress is contemplating legal action, further rebukes or even impeachment. Some are suggesting assessing hefty fines on intransigent administration officials or invoking the seldom-used concept of ""implicit contempt"", which in theory could culminate in the House sergeant-at-arms trying to arrest and imprison the attorney general. It seems far-fetched, but such is the current state of executive-legislative relations. And neither side appears interested in backing down. For Mr Barr to actually face the prospect of charges, the entire House - where Democrats hold a 235-197 majority over Republicans - would have to vote against him. The measure may be largely symbolic as few expect the Department of Justice to indict its own head with criminal contempt. However, it would send a powerful message to the White House that congressional Democrats will not retreat in an increasingly vitriolic showdown. Mr Barr is the first attorney general held in contempt of Congress since the Obama administration's Eric Holder in 2012. Mr Trump insists the Mueller report absolves him of any wrong-doing in his election campaign Earlier, the White House accused Democrats of a ""blatant abuse of power"" and blocked access to the full Mueller report by claiming executive privilege. It allows a president to keep certain materials private if disclosing them would disrupt the confidentiality of the Oval Office decision-making process. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president had taken such a step at the attorney general's request to reject ""unlawful and reckless demands"" by Democrats. ""They didn't like the results of the [Mueller] report, and now they want a redo,"" she said in a statement. Chairman Nadler has criticised the Trump administration's efforts to ""stonewall Congress"" The judiciary committee chairman argued the White House was misapplying the doctrine of executive privilege. Mr Nadler said: ""This decision represents a clear escalation in the Trump administration's blanket defiance of Congress's constitutionally mandated duties."" Mr Barr was greeted with a standing ovation as he entered a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The House judiciary committee has formally requested Mr Mueller testify, though a date has not been set. The special counsel is still a Department of Justice employee, which means the attorney general could prevent him from testifying. Mr Barr has previously said he would not mind Mr Mueller testifying before Congress, but Mr Trump has said the special counsel should not appear before lawmakers. When Mr Mueller handed in his report, a spokesman said he would be leaving the department ""within the coming days"". If he does quit, he will become a private citizen and able to testify regardless of the department's wishes. The panel's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in US politics has been rumbling on for the past two years.

"Rail passengers seeking compensation for delayed journeys are required to submit up to 24 pieces of information to make a claim. Consumer group Which? is calling for the system to be simplified after it found companies were asking for between 10 and 24 separate details. Greater Anglia, London Northwestern, ScotRail, Transport for Wales, and West Midlands Trains asked for the most. Rail bosses said the requirements guarded against fraudulent claims. Rail delays: How to get your money back Independent rail complaints service is launched 'One click plan' to speed up rail compensation The amount of compensation which can be claimed following disruption varies between train companies and depends on the length of delay and the type of ticket. Recent research from independent transport watchdog Transport Focus found that just 35% of passengers who are eligible for compensation submit a claim. Which?, which has previouslyfiled a super-complaintabout delays to compensation, argued that the system was ""fragmented and confusing"". ""This leads to people losing out on a lot of money when they have already suffered enough from unacceptable levels of delays and cancellations,"" said Alex Hayman, from Which?. The consumer group found that some of the most complex claims forms requested 13 different pieces of information about the ticket. Yet, it argued that most of this information was clearly displayed on a photo of the paper ticket - which all but one company required to be uploaded as proof of purchase. 1. Class of seat 2. Peak or non-peak 3. Single, return, or monthly 4. Date the ticket is valid 5. Ticket number, and adjacent reference number 6. Where ticket is from and to 7. End date 8. Price Other details can include the fact it is a paper ticket, any connections, proof of purchase, and how it was paid for Greater Anglia argued that by registering online, the system remembered personal details so there was no need to resubmit information into a lengthy form on subsequent occasions. Anthony Smith, chief executive of Transport Focus, said: ""It is now important that train operators actively encourage passengers to claim, making it quick, easy and automated as soon as possible. ""[We] will be campaigning to ensure more passengers affected by delays or cancellations claim. There is no better way for passengers to ensure the rail industry listens to them."" Jacqueline Starr, chief operating officer from the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, said that the questions were asked to ensure passengers ""receive what they are entitled to as quickly as possible while also guarding against fraudulent claims"". ""We are doing more to encourage claims, including sending reminders to people who booked online, making announcements on trains and handing out claim forms, which has led to an 80% increase in compensation over the last two years to Â£81m a year,"" she said. The government said it wanted to see a ""one click"" system of online financial redress for passengers by the end of current franchises, some of which are completed in 2025. Which?'s research found that Chiltern Railways and Heathrow Express asked for the fewest details, requiring 10 pieces of information.

"This video can not be played Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions On 1 May the US attorney general spent five acrimonious hours in front of a congressional committee explaining his handling of the Mueller report. The intensity of some of the exchanges suggests multiple legal and political battles lie ahead between the Democrats in Congress and President Donald Trump. A day after Attorney General William Barr traded blows with senators, the stakes ramped up considerably as he refused to testify to another committee and the Democratic leadership accused him of lying under oath. Here's a look at five areas where the fighting could be the most heated - and where they could be headed. Mr Barr's Senate testimony may have prompted as many questions as it answered, raising to a fevered pitch Democratic calls to hear from Robert Mueller himself. They want to ask him why he failed to reach a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice, and what he thinks about the attorney general's handling of his report. They'll also want to question him about the contacts between the Trump campaign team and Russians - and how close they may have come to being a criminal conspiracy. Although Republican Senate Judiciary Chair Lindsey Graham says he has no interest in calling Mr Mueller before his committee - insisting that the matter is closed - House Democrats have other ideas. This video can not be played The Mueller report - in 60 seconds The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler, said negotiations are continuing over finding a date, perhaps in May, when the special counsel can testify before his committee. Mr Barr has said he has no objection to Mr Mueller making such an appearance and Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway also said that Mr Mueller - who is still, technically, a Justice Department employee - can testify. The president, on the other hand, may have different ideas.He has tweeted,externalthat Mr Mueller ""should not"" testify and that Democratic in Congress are looking for a ""redo"" after being dissatisfied with the conclusions presented in the special counsel report. Outlook:Mueller spent most of his time as special counsel shrouded in secrecy and silence. It seems unlikely, however, that he will be able to quietly disappear from the national stage. Eight new things in the Mueller report In a press conference on Thursday morning, Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi straight-up accused William Barr of committing a crime. She was specifically referring to the attorney general's claims, during congressional testimony in early April, that he was unaware of reports of dissatisfaction with his handling of the Mueller report expressed by members of the special counsel's office. Democrats now believe this was a lie - based on a recent revealed letter from Mr Mueller to Mr Barr complaining that the attorney general's four-page summary did not ""fully capture the context, nature and substance"" of his work. Attorney General Barr wrote a summary of the Russia report before the full version was released Mr Barr countered that his communications were with Mr Muller himself, not his team, and the dissatisfaction had to do with the media coverage of his letter, not how he relayed Mr Mueller's findings. Needless to say, Democrats aren't buying it. Mueller 'frustrated' by Russia report letter Then there are other reasons Democrats are angry at Mr Barr - such as his refusal to testify before the House Judiciary Committee and his decision to ignore congressional document subpoenas. What are Democrats going to do about it? Mrs Pelosi only made vague references to a ""process"", but they have several options if they want to punish the attorney general. The House Judiciary Committee, by a straight party-line margin, has already voted to hold Mr Barr in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over the unredacted Mueller report and supporting evidence. The measure will now move to the full House of Representatives, where if a majority approves, Mr Barr would become only the second attorney general to receive such a sanction (Eric Holder, of the Obama Administration, was the first). Congress may ask the Justice Department, which Mr Barr runs, to enforce the contempt citation, which would be an unlikely prospect. There has also been talk among Democrats of exercising the seldom-used power of ""inherent contempt"", which could empower the House sergeant-at-arms to arrest the attorney general - setting off an even greater crisis. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi says Mr Barr committed a crime The House of Representatives could also vote to formally censure the attorney general, putting a black mark on his record but not much more. Finally, they could try to impeach the attorney general and have him removed from office. The process would be similar to that for removing a US president - a majority vote in the House of Representatives followed by a trial in the US Senate requiring a two-thirds vote to ""convict"". Only one White House cabinet official has ever been impeached - Ulysses S Grant's Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876 - and he was ultimately acquitted of corruption charges by the Senate. Outlook:A court fight appears inevitable, but of uncertain outcome. Censorship appears pointless. Impeachment would be an uphill fight, but it could also serve as proxy battle for the impeaching Mr Trump himself, venting frustration for Democrats who are itching for a fight but wary of taking on the president directly. While Mr Mueller's appearance before the US Congress would be a blockbuster occasion, he's not the only individual Democrats want to question in open testimony. The special counsel's report detailed how former White House Counsel Don McGahn felt the president pressured him to fire Mr Mueller and, later, write a memo saying that Mr Trump issued no such directive. When Mr Barr was questioned about the matter by Senate Democrats, he said the president only suggested Mr Mueller be ""replaced"" because of a perceived conflict of interest - and then instructed Mr McGahn to write a memo to correct inaccurate media reports. Democrats, needless to say, aren't buying this, viewing the episode as one of the most obvious instances of possible obstruction of justice. Mr Nadler has issued a subpoena calling on Mr McGahn to testify before his committee on 21 May so his committee can get the former Trump aide's account directly. Don McGahn left the White House, but Democrats still want to hear from him The White House has responded by asserting ""executive privilege"" - a legal concept that presidents are entitled to candid and confidential advice from their aides - to block Mr McGahn from providing requested documents to Congress. Mr Trump has said he plans to fight all the congressional subpoenas, and in an interview on Fox News, he said: ""I don't think I can let him [testify]."" If both sides dig in, Mr McGahn's freedom to talk to Congress could end up a matter for the courts to decide. Executive privilege is a controversial legal principle, but there are plenty of judges - and Supreme Court justices - who could be eager to see these presidential protections strengthened. Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee - chaired by Republican Richard Burr - has subpoenaed the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr for a second round of questioning, after his first appearance in 2017. The committee could be interested in further questioning Trump Jr on  his involvement in 2016 negotiations for a Trump construction project in Moscow In a statement released to the press, an unnamed source ""close to Trump Jr"" called the subpoena an ""obvious PR stunt"" and called Mr Burr a ""so-called 'Republican'"". Trump Jr could ignore the request, risking a contempt of Congress citation, or refuse to testify by invoking his constitutional protection against self-incrimination. Outlook:Mr McGahn would be a blockbuster witness, but with a legal fight brewing the Mueller report may end up being his only public account. Public testimony by Trump Jr would be equally riveting, but he seems uncooperative and even less likely to appear beneath the congressional lights. The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words Eight legal headaches for Donald Trump While most of the Mueller report was made public in mid-April, there are still roughly 36 pages that the Justice Department has redacted - because of sensitive intelligence data, grand jury information, material relevant to ongoing investigations or matters concerning ""peripheral third parties"". Democrats in Congress want to see the entire report and have issued a subpoena - again courtesy of House Judiciary Chair Nadler - to force the Justice Department to hand it over. Congressman Nadler is leading the Democratic charge in Congress The White House has said the report was produced by the special counsel for the attorney general, and Congress has no right to see it in its entirety. It has subsequently claimed ""executive privilege"" over the report in its entirety, pending further to determine if any of the currently redacted portions of the report or its supporting documents also contain protected communications between the president and his aides. There's also an unstated concern that if the report receives wider distribution, its sensitive contests will leak to the public. Attorney General Barr said in his Senate testimony, however, that there were no significant areas of disagreement between Mr Mueller and himself over what to redact. There's no guarantee that the blacked-out portions of the report contain any new, explosive information. With contempt of Congress proceedings advancing against Mr Barr for refusing to turn over the full report, this is shaping up to be another battle between two branches of government, the executive and legislative, that will have to be decided by the third, the judiciary. Outlook:This could end up being a fierce battle over a hill that doesn't matter in the larger war. There are two separate legal battles brewing over congressional requests for Donald Trump's business records and - that holy grail for many on the left - his tax returns. A month ago, Richard Neal, the Democrat in charge of the House Ways and Means Committee, formally requested that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provide him with copies of the president's tax returns for six years, citing a seldom-used 1924 law as authority. So far Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, whose department oversees the IRS, has only said he's reviewing the matter. Steven Mnuchin says the treasury department is reviewing the tax request The president and his lawyers, on the other hand, have called the request improper and insisted that the IRS not comply. ""The Democrats are demanding that the IRS turn over the documents, and that is not going to happen and they know it,"" acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said a few days after the first committee request was filed. If the Treasury Department continues to drag its feet, the Democrats could start court proceedings that eventually determine the constitutionality of that old federal law and the legality of the Democratic action. Meanwhile, Mr Trump's personal lawyers have filed a flurry of lawsuits to prevent an accounting firm and two banks used by Mr Trump's businesses - Deutsche Bank and Capital One - from complying with requests by several Democratic-controlled House committees for Trump organisation financial records. Courts have previously given Congress broad subpoena powers as part of their legislative and investigatory responsibilities, but Mr Trump's lawyers are painting the move as a partisan fishing expedition that intrudes on the privacy of the president and his family. Democrats counter that a thorough inspection of Trump businesses is the only way to ensure that he doesn't have financial involvements that are illegal or make him susceptible to foreign influence. Outlook:This appears set for another long, drawn-out legal battle. Democrats could find a way to circumvent the federal government, however, if New York state -which possesses the president's state tax returns,externaland oversees many big financial institutions - hands over what they have to Congress.

"This video can not be played The Mueller report - in 60 seconds Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation paints a decidedly mixed picture of President Donald Trump's conduct, that provides ample fodder for either side of the political divide. The 448-page report says it did not establish the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 US presidential election. The inquiry also built an extensive obstruction-of-justice case against the Republican president, though it stopped short of concluding he committed a crime. While there was no immediate ""smoking gun"" to trigger impeachment proceedings, Democrats said the report had plenty of ammunition to keep up congressional scrutiny of Mr Trump. The report details the president's expletive-filled horror as he learned that a special counsel was being appointed in May 2017. According to the Mueller report, when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions told the president about the coming inquiry, he replied: ""Oh my god. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency."" He added two expletives to describe his situation. Mr Trump added:  ""Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels, it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won't be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me."" Analysis and reaction to Mueller report Trump 'tried to get Mueller fired' The Mueller report details how in June 2017, the president called White House counsel Donald McGahn at home from Camp David and ordered him to have the special counsel removed. On a second call, Mr McGahn said the president stepped up the pressure, saying: ""Call Rod [Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein], tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can't be the Special Counsel"", and ""Mueller has to go"" and ""Call me back when you do it."" Mr McGahn was so upset by the interference that he threatened to quit rather than participate in what he predicted would be a Nixon-style ""Saturday Night Massacre"". After media reports in January 2018 revealed Mr Trump's attempts to have Mr Mueller removed, one of the president's lawyers made contact with Mr McGahn, asking him to publicly deny the reports. But McGahn, through his attorney, refused. The report found there were a number of contacts between members of Trump's circle and Russia, and the campaign ""expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts"". The Trump team also ""showed interest"" in the Wikileaks release of hacked emails and ""welcomed their potential to damage"" Hillary Clinton. Unpatriotic and immoral, Democrats say. But the Mueller team makes clear it did not amount to a criminal conspiracy. ""The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to meet in person, invitations for campaign officials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy positions seeking improved US-Russian relations. ""While the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or co-ordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" On potential obstruction of justice, the Mueller report is far from the ""total exoneration"" claimed by Mr Trump during a victory lap last month. The report ultimately concludes: ""Unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference."" But it also pointedly notes: ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we obtained about the President'sactions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred."" While the report acknowledges a sitting president cannot be indicted, it also mentions Congress' ability to investigate and potentially impeach him. It says: ""Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law."" This video can not be played Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions The report cites 10 instances that were investigated as potential obstruction by Mr Trump. Most have already been well documented, such as Mr Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey. But the findings also validate past US media reports that were denied at the time by the White House. When Mr Trump learned the media was asking questions about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr, and a Russian lawyer who was said to be promising ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton, the president crafted a misleading response, says the report: ""Before the emails became public, the President edited a press statement for Trump Jr by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was with 'an individual who [Trump Jr] was told might have information helpful to the campaign' and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions of Russian children."" Mr Trump also asked former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to announce publicly that the investigation was ""very unfair"" and Mr Trump had done nothing wrong, says the report. After Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, leaving an enraged Mr Trump feeling that he was losing control of the inquiry, the president pressed his attorney general that if he would only ""unrecuse"" himself he would be the ""hero"". The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words Eight legal headaches for Donald Trump The Mueller report found that potential obstruction of justice by the president only failed because members of his administration refused to ""carry out orders"", including former FBI Director James Comey, former White House counsel Don McGahn and former campaign manager Corey Lewandowksi. In one unflattering passage, the document says: ""The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn's prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President's order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President's message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President's direction to have the Special Counsel removed, despite the President's multiple demands that he do so. Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the President's aides and associates beyond those already filed."" Close followers of the Mueller saga may recall that in January 2018 at the White House, President Trump told reporters that he was ""looking forward"" to sitting down for an interview with Mr Mueller, that he would ""love to do that as soon as possible"", and boasted he would do so under oath. But in the event, the report notes, ""after more than a year of discussion, the President declined to be interviewed"". He agreed to submit written answers to the special counsel's questions to Russia-related matters, but declined to ""provide written answers to questions on obstruction topics or questions on events during his transition"", the report notes. The Mueller report states: ""Recognizing that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily, we considered whether to subpoena for his testimony. We viewed his written answers to be inadequate."" But the Mueller team said they ultimately decided not to subpoena Mr Trump because of the likelihood of litigation would cause a substantial delay at a late stage in the inquiry. The Mueller team did not indict then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions for perjury to Congress when he wrongly testified that he had no contact with Russians during the campaign because of the inexact wording of the questions, according to the report. ""The evidence is not sufficient to prove that Sessions gave knowingly false answers to Russia-related questions in light of the wording and context of those questions,"" the report says. It also makes clear Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and other campaign staff were on legally thin ice with their June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer. The Mueller team says they declined to prosecute the president's eldest son and son-in-law for campaign finance violations because they couldn't prove they had ""wilfully"" violated the law.

"The Prittlewell burial site was discovered in 2003 A royal burial site found between a pub and Aldi supermarket has been hailed as the UK's answer to Tutankhamun's tomb. Workers unearthed the grave, which contained dozens of rare artefacts, during roadworks in Prittlewell, near Southend, Essex, in 2003. Tooth enamel fragments were the only human remains, but experts say their ""best guess"" is that they belonged to a 6th Century Anglo-Saxon prince. It is said to be the oldest example of a Christian Anglo-Saxon royal burial. Now, after 15 years of expert analysis some of the artefacts are returning to Southend to go on permanent display for the first time at the Central Museum. When a team from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola) excavated the site, they said they were ""astounded"" to find the burial chamber intact. The remains of the timber structure, which would have measured about 13ft (4m) square and 5ft (1.5m) deep, housed some 40 rare and precious artefacts. Among them was a lyre - an ancient harp - and a 1,400-year-old box thought to be the only surviving example of painted Anglo-Saxon woodwork in Britain. Gold coins, the gilded silver neck of a wooden drinking vessel, decorative glass beakers and a flagon believed to have come from Syria were also found. Each had been placed within the tomb ""as part of a carefully choreographed burial rite"", indicating the resting place of a man of princely lineage, they said. The tomb contained 40 artefacts including treasures from other kingdoms Locals nicknamed the grave's unknown occupant the Prince of Prittlewell and the King of Bling because of the riches buried alongside him. Ciara Phipps from Southend Museums Service said the first artefact uncovered - a copper alloy hanging bowl - gave experts a ""real idea of just how significant this burial might be"". ""It's thought it was probably acquired as a gift so it gives a sense of how significant this person might have been... he had friends in high places,"" she said. It had been suggested the remains were those of Saebert, Saxon king of Essex from AD604 to AD616 but carbon dating and other tests have indicated the tomb was constructed between AD575 and AD605 - at least 11 years before his death. After 15 years of research, archaeologists said their ""best guess"" was that the tomb belonged to Seaxa, Saebert's brother. Gold-foil crosses found at the head of the coffin are thought to have been placed over the eyes - making it certain he was a Christian However, other funeral customs, such as the burial mound, grave artefacts and wooden chamber, reflect pre-Christian beliefs and traditions A golden belt buckle, likely made especially for the burial, suggested a high-status individual An ""exceptionally large"" ash-wood coffin with an elaborate lid had space for a corpse and other worldly items. It alone would have weighed 160kg The size of the coffin, and placement of items within it, suggested he was about 5ft 6in (1.68m) tall A folding iron stool, thought to be a gifstol (gift seat) from which a lord dispensed rewards and judgement to his loyal followers and warriors, was found A ""skilfully crafted sword"" with collars of ribbed gold wire on the horn handle and a complex, pattern-welded blade was a clear signal of an aristocratic or royal-status burial. Source: Mola Gold decorated drinking vessels were among the treasures found in the royal burial A lyre, a stringed musical instrument, was also among the finds The burial is believed to belong to Seaxa, the brother of King Saebert Sophie Jackson, Mola's director of research and engagement, said no-one had expected the ""unpromising looking site"" found in 2003 to contain ""our equivalent of Tutankhamun's tomb"". ""It's between a bit of railway and a bit of road, essentially a verge. It's not where you'd expect to find it,"" she said. Ms Jackson said no-one could have known what was beneath the ""unpromising-looking"" site She said the grave provided a snapshot of a ""really interesting time"" when Christianity was ""just creeping in"" to the British Isles. ""They would have been just on the transition between having pagan burials with all your gear but also having these crosses,"" she said. Ms Jackson said ""the best guess"" was the tomb had housed Seaxa. She said: ""There's a lot of debate about whether he was a fully-fledged hairy beast Saxon warrior, or younger. ""Had he died before he could really prove himself?"" Tutankhamun was an Egyptian king who died about 3,000 years ago. His tomb was discovered by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922 in an area now known as the Valley of the Kings. It was one of the most well-preserved tombs that conservationists had ever seen, and close to 2,000 objects were found inside. The chamber was filled with treasure and detailed wall paintings that showed the story of King Tutankhamun's life and death. After the treasures had been catalogued and cleared, the tomb itself became a tourist destination when it was opened to the public in the 1930s. Who was Tutankhamun?

In some cases, items had been so badly eroded that only soil impressions remained. These artefacts were digitally recreated using techniques including CT scans and microscopic analysis of soil samples. Ms Phipps said the display, which begins on Saturday, was a ""real gem"" of the museum. ""It's such a significant moment for the museum service and also for the community of Southend,"" she said. ""This collection has evoked and encouraged a huge amount of local pride."" The museum has alsolaunched a website with information about its research,external, as well as an interactive diagram of the tomb.
