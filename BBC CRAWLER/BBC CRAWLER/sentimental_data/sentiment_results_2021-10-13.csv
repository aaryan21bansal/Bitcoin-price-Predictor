"Rich Myers said he would have to stop selling his ""best-selling"" raspberry glazed donut cookies A bakery has had to stop producing its bestselling biscuit after officials found the treats were topped with illegal sprinkles. Get Baked in Leeds withdrew its raspberry glazed donut cookies, which contained a banned food colouring. Owner Rich Myers branded the decision ""ridiculous"" and said alternative sprinkles on the market were ""rubbish"". West Yorkshire Trading Standards said the imported decoration had fallen foul of UK regulations. Mr Myers said: ""I know it sounds like a small thing but it is a big deal for my business - we used them a lot. ""Our best-selling cookie, we're not going to be able to sell them any more. For a small independent business that only has a small menu, it's a problem."" More stories from across Yorkshire Trading Standards said theE127 food colouring,external, also know as Erythrosine, is only approved for use in the UK and EU in cocktail cherries and candied cherries. The ingredient has been linked to problemswith hyperactivity and behavioural issues in children,externaland a US study suggested anincreased risk of thyroid tumours,externalwhen tested on male rats. ""[The inspector] said they'd had reports of us using illegal sprinkles and I actually laughed by mistake, then realised he was being serious,"" Mr Myers said. ""To whoever reported us to Trading Standards, all I have to say is: 'Dear Lord, what a sad little life Jane'."" He said he sourced the US-made cake toppers from a UK-based wholesaler, adding that other products on the market were not as good. ""British sprinkles are rubbish,"" he said. ""They run and aren't bake-stable. The colours aren't vibrant and they just don't look very good."" The bakery uses the decorations on a number of products Mr Myers' plight was recognised by two former Great British Bake Off contestants, who sympathised with his desire to obtain suitable ingredients. Edd Kimber, 2010 winner, agreed supermarket sprinkles were ""not as good"". ""It is what he's designing his product around, so I feel his pain,"" he added. Fellow contestant Hermine Dossou, who was a semi-finalist in the 2020 show, called on sprinkle makers in the UK to ""step up their game"". ""I get where Trading Standards is coming from, but it comes back to the everything in moderation argument,"" she said. A spokesperson for West Yorkshire Trading Standards said: ""We can confirm that we have advised the business concerned the use of E127 is not permitted in this type of confectionery item. ""We stand by this advice and would urge all food business operators, when seeking to use imported foods containing additives, to check that they are permitted for use in the UK.""

"Restocking popular Barbie dolls is likely to be a problem, says The Entertainer. One of the UK's biggest toy retailers is warning delays at UK ports will result in shortages this Christmas. Gary Grant, boss of The Entertainer, said it would get harder to get stock to the right places at the right time. Barbie dolls and Paw Patrol toys are among the children's favourites he expects to run out fast. The government said that Felixstowe had reported ""improved capacity over the past few days"". A container logjam at ports, including Felixstowe, and a shortage of HGV lorry drivers has sparked widespread concern among retailers about future stocks. Mr Grant said his 170 shops are looking ""very full right now"". But he added that demand ""will outstrip availability"" because there aren't enough drivers to move the company's stock. ""There'll never be toy shops with no toys. There will be toy shops without all the toys that they would normally expect to have due to the shortages, and that is largely down to transportation and warehouse issues, rather than there being a shortage of toys."" Port delays: 'We've run out of Harry Potter stock' Biggest UK commercial port hit by container logjam Why is there an HGV driver shortage? The shortage of drivers means that shipment containers are being offloaded but left stacked on the quayside waiting for collection. The dearth of drivers also means there is a delay in returning empty containers for re-use. The problems come at the busiest time of the year for retailers, when most goods are imported from Asia to sell during Christmas trading. Thomas O'Brien, managing director of Leeds-based toy designer Boxer Gifts, which manufacturers its products in China, said there's ""plenty of stock"" but the real problem is that ""everything takes longer and is horrendously more expensive"" which means the company ""will be struggling to keep price increases to anything lower than 10%"". Items that are in short supply include a sloth soft toy and the moody cow stress ball. ""Ironically the moody cow which we're short of is almost a nice acronym for how feel at the moment,"" he added. The 'Moody Cow' stress ball is in short supply at the moment. While there are alternative toys, Mr O'Brien said the firm has lost six weeks of ""planning time"" to be able to re-stock at short notice. He said containers shipped from Qingdao, China to Felixstowe are costing him $15,000 (Â£11,003) rather than the normal rate of $2,500 in 2020. Entrepreneur Jack Griffiths, co-founder of loungewear company Snuggy, said he is expecting containers on five different ships, holdings Â£1m worth of Christmas items, to arrive over the next week but they will now be delayed by three weeks. ""We're seasonal and we have to make the most of these months, 80% of our turnover comes from October to February."" In November, the business usually takes Â£500,000 worth of sales which Mr Griffiths said he ""probably won't be able to get in if we don't get that stock in time"". The company has already run out of the SnuggyPod product which was due to arrive two weeks ago. Mr Griffiths said the product ""probably won't arrive for three weeks at Felixstowe and then it'll take three weeks to get them out of the port due to the driver issues"". He added that because the SnuggyPod is the firm's original design, there aren't any alternatives. ""As the weeks go by I can only see it getting worse which is just something we don't want to think about"". Mr Griffiths anticipates he will have to get products shipped by railway and air rather than sea. It comes after Â£400,000 worth of his stock was delayed earlier in the year when it got stuck on the Ever Given ship which blocked the Suez Canal. Mr Griffiths said that because the SnuggyPod is an original design, there aren't any alternatives. Steve Parks, director at Seaport Freight which deals with food shipments from overseas as well as other goods, says moving products from Rotterdam port to Felixstowe is delaying goods by two to three weeks. ""So things like coconut milk, frozen fish and carpets are being delayed from China."" While Mr Parks said Britain's shortfall in HGV drivers is ""largely"" to blame for the congestion at the port, other countries are experiencing problems, including the US and China. ""This is absolutely the worst period I have known, ever,"" he said. ""We can't get space on ships coming out of the Far East."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said that fluctuating capacity at ports ""has been exacerbated by the ongoing global container and HGV driver shortages"". ""All ports across the UK remain open to shipping lines with Felixstowe reporting improved capacity over the past few days and the government continues to work closely with the freight industry, to tackle the challenges faced by some ports this autumn,"" the spokesperson said. Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said there was ""no need to panic buy"" but advised customers to start their normal shopping process earlier. ""If you see something you want, now is the time to buy as retailers have most of their Christmas stock, but we can't guarantee having supplies of everything over the next few weeks"". ""It's a challenge for small retailers because they don't have the cash to stockpile,"" he added. The UK's biggest commercial port Felixstowe told the BBC that it currently had 50,000 containers which were waiting to be collected, due to a shortage of HGV lorry drivers. Officials at the port have asked the shipping lines to reduce their empty container stocks as ""quickly as possible"". ""It's not the port of Felixstowe affecting the supply chain, it's the supply chain affecting the port of Felixstowe,"" it said, adding that the problems are ""similar at all major UK ports"". Danish shipping giant Maersk has been forcedto divert some of its larger ships from Felixstowe to ports in the Netherlands and Belgium to avoid delays. Smaller ships are then transporting the goods to the UK. A spokesman for the port of Rotterdam said it has been busy over the last couple of weeks, but said: ""It's more to do with Covid than anything else because of the balance of empty and full containers being in the wrong place."" The pandemic is also being blamed in part for bottlenecks at US ports. President Joe Biden will meet with major US retailers as well as the bosses of ports on Wednesday to address the issues. Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chief executive Dubai-based DP World, the global logistics giant which operates out of Southampton and London Gateway, said ""nobody knows how long it's going to take"" to resolve the congestion and shipping container shortages. ""I think it's going to take a long time,"" he said, adding: ""The problem is complicated because you have a backlog of cargo."" The UK Ports Association trade group, said most UK ports were operating normally but that the shortage of drivers meant ""some delays"". ""This has meant that some freight is not being collected as rapidly as it would normally. The situation is impacting all types of ports, not just container terminals. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers. It has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit and a backlog of HGV driver tests. The government recently drafted in military personnel to help with the driver shortages and deliver fuel. Emergency temporary visas have also been issued to foreign drivers. Conservative Party chair Oliver Dowden told the BBC that the government was increasing the number of people having tests and that he would ""expect that number to increase as we approach Christmas"". Asked about potential Christmas shortages, he told Sky news: ""The situation is improving, I'm confident that people will be able to get their toys for Christmas.""

"Questions around the origins of Covid-19 centre on Wuhan, where the virus first emerged The World Health Organization (WHO) says a new taskforce may be the last chance to find the origins of Covid-19. It has nominated 26 experts to join the body, the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago). More than a year-and-a-half since the virus was detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the question of how it first emerged remains unclear. The team will consider if the virus jumped from animals to humans in Wuhan markets or leaked in a lab accident. China has strongly refuted the second theory. In February, a WHO team tasked with investigating Covid's origins flew to China and concluded that the virus had probably come from bats but that more work was needed. The team called the lab leak theory ""extremely unlikely"". This video can not be played Covid-19 and Wuhan: Why don't we know more? But the WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, later said the investigation had been hampered by a lack of data and transparency from China. The proposed members of the Sago group include six experts who visited China as part of the previous team. Aside from coronavirus, Sago will also look into the origins of other high-risk pathogens. ""Understanding where new pathogens come from is essential for preventing future outbreaks,"" said Dr Tedros said. In a joint editorial in the journal Science, Dr Tedros and other WHO officials said ""a lab accident cannot be ruled out"". EXPLAINER: Why the lab-leak theory is being taken seriously Michael Ryan, the WHO's emergencies director, said Sago's work may be the ""last chance to understand the origins of this virus"". The announcement of the new group comes as CNN reported that China was preparing to test tens of thousands of blood bank samples taken in the early months of the pandemic. But Chen Xu, China's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said Sago's work should not be ""politicised"". ""It is time to send teams to other places,"" he said. Tulip Mazumdar, Global Health Correspondent Almost two years since the start of the pandemic, we still don't know how or when the deadly Sars-Cov-2 virus emerged. Investigating new viruses is always extremely complex, but scientists have been able to find the source of the two previous coronavirus outbreaks - both of which have emerged from animals. It's been nine months since the last WHO-convened mission returned from Wuhan, saying a similar animal spillover was the most likely source of the pandemic. But questions continue to be raised about a potential accident at a Wuhan lab which studies coronaviruses and keeps thousands of bat samples. China has strenuously denied this. The WHO says China still hasn't shared crucial data from the earliest days of the pandemic. The UN agency - which has been caught in the firing line between China and the US's bigger geopolitical fight on this issue - has been hardening its language on investigations into a lab leak theory. The science is becoming increasingly politicised, with China so far refusing to allow international scientists back into the country. It's hoped this new Sago body with experts from 26 different countries will be able to break this impasse, and finally get some much needed answers so the world can better prepare for future outbreaks.

"Sixteen arrests were made at junction 31 of the M25 in Essex, near the Dartford Crossing and Lakeside shopping centre Angry motorists confronted Insulate Britain activists who blocked traffic on two roads in the latest in a series of protests. Essex Police arrested 35 people at two locations, including at an M25 junction to the east of London. Officers detained 16 people after being called to a slip road at junction 31 for Thurrock, just after 08:25 BST. Police then arrested 19 people after reports of a further blockade nearby at Stonehouse Lane, Purfleet. On what was a 13th day of protests by the group in the past five weeks, the M25 slip road blockage, near the Dartford Crossing, led to many HGV drivers turning around, causing clashes between protesters and angry motorists. Lorry drivers blasted their horns and multiple confrontations occurred, with one protester nearly run over after stopping in front of a blue Hyundai car, whose frustrated driver called out ""this is stupidity"". Motorists ripped banners out of the hands of demonstrators as they sat or lay down in the road while other protesters glued themselves to the carriageway. Essex Police removed the protesters and said all the affected roads had reopened by lunchtime The force said it had been working to resolve the situation ""quickly and safely"" Some members of the group were repeatedly dragged off the road by drivers who were pulling on their clothes and backpacks, but they returned to their spots and sat down again. Some HGV drivers warned that the protests could cause fuel supply problems as tankers would be unable to reach filling stations. One driver toldLBC,externalnews: ""If this protest stays here for much longer, I'm afraid the nightshift driver will not be able to deliver fuel for any garages or anyone."" Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? Essex Police removed the protesters and said all the affected roads reopened by lunchtime. The force thanked members of the public for their ""patience and understanding"". Insulate Britain said about 40 people were at junction 31 and at the nearby A1090 London Road in Purfleet. Insulate Britain admitted its latest action was in breach of an injunction obtained by the government last month The action was Insulate Britain's 13th day of road protests The protest group, which has been regularly blocking highways since13 September, has been calling for the installation of heat-saving measures in social housing by 2025, and all homes by 2030. It admitted its latest action was ""in breach"" of aninjunctionobtained by the government last month. A spokesman, Liam Norton, said: ""In 10 years' time when fuel crises are catastrophic, when the food has run out and when people are experiencing unsurvivable heatwaves, what would you be wishing you had done now?"" The protest caused many vehicles, including HGVs, to stop and turn round The government has said it is investing Â£1.3bn to support people to install energy efficiency measures. On Thursday,35 protesters were arrestedafter blocking Old Street roundabout in central London and junction 25 of M25 at Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire.

"Could attending demonstrations help you feel less anxious about climate change? ""It's a kind of hopelessness I guess. Helplessness,"" says Ross Simpson, 22, from Glasgow. He's telling me how he and his friends feel about stopping the worst effects of climate change. The warnings keep coming of more heatwaves, droughts, floods, and global temperatures going up and up and up. Seeing so many negative stories in the news only makes Ross feel worse. Like many, he worries it's already too late. ""What difference does changing your lifestyle actually make in the grand scheme of things? Why do anything, if we're all doomed anyway?"" Noor Elmasry, 22, has been having similar conversations with her friends across the Atlantic, in Chicago. ""I think a lot of the frustration manifests from seeing people in power just constantly disappoint you,"" she says. Their feelings are shared by young people around the world.In a recent survey, 10,000 young people were asked about climate change. Three quarters said the future of the world was frightening, while more than half said they thought humanity was doomed. Feelings of fear, shame, guilt, anger and frustration have been given a name: climate anxiety. And it's on the rise. So what can you do if you're worried the planet is doomed? The BBC asked a group of scientists who have been working on climate change for years about what worked for them. Repeatedly, scientists said taking action in their own lives helped to ease their anxieties. Many were proud of the scientific work they had been part of, but some also spoke about doing simpler things: recycling, eating a plant-based diet, insulating their homes, going on marches and engaging with politics. Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist who contributed to amajor report on climate change this year, said she occasionally planted mango saplings by the roadside. Would it save the world on its own? No. Did it make her feel a bit better? Yes. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Why the COP26 climate summit is important What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? Simple guide to climate change Dr Jonathan Foley has worked on climate change for three decades as a researcher, author and government advisor and now investigates climate change solutions. He says action is the antidote that works for him, and points out that it can take many forms. ""Some people might become activists because they're really angry and they want to shake things up. Great, we need that. Others could be artists and want to share how they feel and inspire others. Great, we need that too. We need everybody."" Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, found relief in being alongside like-minded people at protests, rallies and other events. ""It's an atmosphere you can't beat,"" she says. ""As soon as you meet other people who have the same concerns, you're like, 'okay, I would much rather be here'."" Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. The choice for her is often between ""doomscrolling"" - staring at a phone or computer and dwelling on negative news - or working on solutions with like-minded people. ""Everyone's in the same boat, right? So there's a huge amount of solidarity,"" she says. ""I got a lot of meaning by knowing what we're doing might really change things."" She says the pandemic has made that hard for many people, but adds: ""I really hope that people can feel like they can start that stuff again."" Almost all the scientists shared stories about coming to terms with how they felt about climate change. ""I've felt terrified,"" says Dr Jones. ""I've felt incredibly angry at fossil fuel interests who have delayed action for so long. I've felt frustration at politicians. I've gone through real helplessness."" ""We've all been there,"" Dr Jones adds. ""Everyone who works on climate has been there. For me that was like 10 years ago. You have to acknowledge these things and come to some level of acceptance."" But what does acceptance actually look like? Dr Jones says she spoke to friends and a counsellor. She continues to keep a journal to write down her feelings. ""For me, I don't know how to process thoughts and feelings without writing them down. The main thing is getting it all out of your head. If it stays there it just turns into a big unhelpful stew."" ""We need to pay attention to how we feel and to process these complex feelings"" Caroline Hickman has studied the impact on climate change on the mental health of young people and helped lead the survey of 10,000 young people. ""We need to pay attention to how we feel and to process these complex feelings and support others in dealing with how they feel, as we take action in world,"" she says. ""Otherwise, there's a high risk of burnout, because we're tired."" She says feelings of anxiety are normal. ""It's an emotionally, mentally healthy response to feel anxiety, dread, despair, depression in relation to the climate emergency."" Yet many of the scientists had a stubborn optimism that comes from working on the problem. You will have good days and bad days, Dr Foley says. ""Maybe that's how you feel some days,"" he says when I ask him about feeling down. ""But I hope you come back and maybe roll up your sleeves and see that actually maybe doom isn't guaranteed.""

"China's carbon emissions are vast and growing, dwarfing those of other countries. Experts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change. In 2020, China's President Xi Jinping said his country would aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality before 2060. His statement has now been confirmed as China's official position ahead of the COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow. But China has not said exactly how these goals will be achieved. While all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge. Per person, China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. Your device may not support this visualisation China became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions. It is expected to come under intense scrutiny at the COP26 summit over its commitments to reduce these. Along with all the other signatories to the Paris Agreement in 2015, China agreed to make changes to try to keep global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and ""well below"" 2C. China strengthened its commitments in 2020, but Climate Action Tracker, an international group of scientists and policy experts say its current actions to meet that goal are ""highly insufficient"". Getting China's emissions down is achievable, according to many experts, but will require a radical shift. Coal has been the country's main source of energy for decades. President Xi says China will ""phase down"" coal use from 2026 - and willnot build new coal-fired projects abroad- but some governments and campaignerssay the plans are not going far enough. Researchers atTsinghua University in Beijing say,externalChina will need to stop using coal entirely for generating electricity by 2050, to be replaced by nuclear and renewable energy production. And far from shutting down coal-fired power stations, China is currently building new ones at more than 60 locations across the country, with many sites having more than one plant. New stations are usually active for 30 to 40 years, so China will need to reduce the capacity of newer plants as well as close old ones if it is to bring emissions down, says researcher Philippe Ciais of the Institute of Environment and Climate Science in Paris. It may be possible to retrofit some to capture emissions, but the technology to do so at scale is still developing, and many plants will have to be written off after minimal use. China argues it has a right to do what Western countries have done in the past, releasing carbon dioxide in the process of developing its economy and reducing poverty. In the short term, Beijing has ordered coal mines toincrease productionto avoid power shortages over the coming winter. Surging demand from heavy industry in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to shortages in several regions of the country in recent weeks. Tsinghua University researchers say 90% of power should come from nuclear and renewables by 2050. In moving towards that goal, China's lead in the manufacture of green technology, such as solar panels and large-scale batteries, may be a big help. China first embraced green technologies as a means to tackle air pollution, a serious problem for many cities. But the government also believes they have enormous economic potential, providing jobs and income for millions of Chinese, as well as reducing China's dependence on foreign oil and gas. ""China is already leading the global energy transition,"" says Yue Cao of the Overseas Development Institute. ""One of the reasons we are able to deploy cheaper and cheaper green technology is China."" China generates more solar power than any other country. That might not be so impressive given China's enormous population, but it is a sign of where the country is heading. China's wind power installations were more than triple those of any other country in 2020. China says the proportion of its energy generated from non-fossil fuel sources should be 25% by 2030, and it is expected by many observers to hit the target early. China ranks seventh in the world for its percentage of car sales that are electric, but given its huge size, China makes and buys more electric cars than any other country by a considerable margin. Currently, about one in 20 cars bought in China is electric-powered. By 2035, Chinese officials and car industry representatives are predicting that almost all new vehicles sold in China will be fully electric-powered or hybrid. Working out by how much the shift to electric vehicles reduces emissions is not straightforward - particularly when taking into account manufacturing and charging sources. But studies suggest that emissions over the lifetimes of electric vehicles are typically below those of petrol and diesel equivalents. This matters because transport is responsible for around a quarter of carbon emissions from fuel combustion, withroad vehicles,externalbeing the largest emitters. China will also by 2025 be producing batteries with double the capacity of those produced by the rest of the world combined. Observers say that will enable the storage and release of energy from renewable sources on a previously impossible scale. Getting to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions doesn't mean that China will stop producing emissions. It means China will cut emissions as much as possible and absorb what's left, through a combination of different approaches. Increasing the area of land covered in vegetation will help, as plants absorb carbon dioxide. Here again, there is encouraging news. China isgetting greener,externalat a faster rate than any other country, largely as a result of its forestry programmes designed to reduce soil erosion and pollution. It is also partly a result of replanting fields to produce more than one harvest per year, which keeps land covered in vegetation for longer. The world needs China to succeed. ""Unless China decarbonises, we're not going to beat climate change,"" says prof David Tyfield of the Lancaster Environment Centre. China has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments. The Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task. What happens next could hardly be more important.

"Two more UK energy firms have ceased trading amid soaring wholesale energy prices. Pure Planet, which is backed by oil giant BP, and Colorado Energy join a number of small energy firms that have gone bust recently. Pure Planet said it had been caught between rising costs and the UK's energy price cap, which limits what companies can charge consumers. This had left its business ""unsustainable"", it said. Customers of both companies will be moved to new suppliers. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Energy firms' collapse hits 1.5 million customers Pure Planet and Colorado Energy are the latest casualties of a global spike in gas prices. Pure Planet supplies gas and electricity to around 235,000 domestic customers, while Colorado Energy has around 15,000 domestic customers. Energy regulator Ofgem will now find a new supplier for those customers, who are asked to do nothing until the transfer takes place in the coming weeks. The demise of Pure Planet and Colorado Energy takes the number of customers affected by the current wave of energy company collapses across the UK to around two million. Ofgem said,externalon Wednesday that the unprecedented increase in global gas prices in recent weeks was putting financial pressure on suppliers. ""Ofgem's number one priority is to protect customers,"" said Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem. ""I want to reassure affected customers that they do not need to worry: under our safety net we'll make sure your energy supplies continue."" Mr Lawrence added that if customers have credit, the funds are protected, so customers will not lose the money that is owed to them. Pure Planet said that the government and Ofgem expect it ""to sell energy at a price much less than it currently costs to buy"". ""This is unsustainable, and therefore, sadly we have had to make the difficult decision to cease trading,""it said,external. Pure Planet said it had lost its backing from oil giant BP ""In our case, despite being hedged until next spring, and having had the backing of BP, Pure Planet faced increasing risks and large potential losses by continuing to operate in this market,"" Pure Planet said. ""Sadly, this led to BP taking a decision to withdraw its support and we are no longer able to continue."" BP said it had worked to support Pure Planet and give financial support through wholesale supply and other funding arrangements. ""However, despite considerable work over an extended period, we concluded it is no longer commercially viable for BP to continue this relationship and took this difficult decision,"" a BP spokesperson said. Nine suppliers collapsed in September, but business and energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng has ruled out supporting struggling energy firms. Last week, he said more companies could collapse. The regulator's price cap, which covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland, protects customers on default tariffs by limiting charges including how much customers pay per unit of energy. But providers say they can't pass on rising wholesale gas prices to customers because of the cap. Suppliers that have recently gone bust include Avro Energy, People's Energy and Green Supplier Limited. Rising prices have had reverberations throughout the supply chain. BBC Newsnight reported on Wednesday evening that gas shipping firm CNG has written to its energy supplier customers saying that it will no longer supply the wholesale market. Allow Twitter content?

CNG supplies roughly 46,000 small businesses, including 10-15 small domestic energy suppliers, through their wholesale business. Newsnight economics editor Ben Chutweeted,externalthat CNG had recently had to supply gas to households without being paid by suppliers that have failed, including Utility Point and Avro Energy. This has caused a significant amount of financial damage to CNG, Mr Chu said. CNG leaving the market will put further pressure on small UK energy firms and could speed up their collapse, he added.

"An arrow could be seen sticking out of a wall after the attack Four women and a man were killed and two others wounded when a man used a bow and arrow to attack them in Norway. Police first received word of an attack in the town of Kongsberg, south-west of the capital Oslo, at 18:12 local time (16:12 GMT). A Danish man aged 37 has been arrested and questioned for hours overnight. Police said they had previously been in contact with him over fears of radicalisation after he converted to Islam. The victims were all aged between 50 and 70, regional police chief Ole Bredrup Saeverud told reporters on Thursday morning. He said they were most likely killed after the police first confronted the attacker at 18:18. Reports of the incident were ""horrifying"", said Prime Minister Erna Solberg, hours before she was due to leave office. ""I understand that many people are afraid, but it's important to emphasise that the police are now in control,"" she said. The attacker is said to have launched the assault inside a Coop Extra supermarket on Kongsberg's west side. One of those injured was an off-duty police officer who was in the shop at the time. A spokesperson for the chain later confirmed a ""serious incident"" at their store, adding that none of their staff were physically injured. Local police chief Oyvind Aas confirmed that the attacker had managed to escape an initial confrontation with police before an arrest was finally made at 18:47 local time, 35 minutes after the attack began. Norway country profile One witness told local outlet TV2 she had heard a commotion and seen a woman taking cover, then a ""man standing on the corner with arrows in a quiver on his shoulder and a bow in his hand"". ""Afterwards, I saw people running for their lives. One of them was a woman holding a child by the hand,"" she added. Police have told Norwegian news agency NTB that the attacker also used other weapons during the incident, without giving more details on what they were. The suspect moved over a large area, and authorities cordoned off several parts of the town. Residents were ordered to stay indoors so authorities could examine the scene and gather evidence. Surrounding gardens and garages were searched with the help of sniffer dogs. The attack was Norway's deadliest since far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik murdered 77 people, most of them at a children's Labour Party summer camp on the island of Utoya in July 2011. Kongsberg Mayor Kari Anne Sand said it was a shocking attack that had taken place in an area where many people lived, and that a crisis team would help anyone affected. Describing the town as ""a completely ordinary community with completely ordinary people"", Ms Sand said everyone had been deeply shaken by ""this very tragic situation."" Police have cordoned off large parts of the town The suspect was taken to a police station in the town of Drammen, where his defence lawyer, Fredrik Neumann, said he was questioned for more than three hours and was co-operating with authorities. The suspect had a Danish mother and Norwegian father, he explained. Norway's outgoing justice minister Monica Maeland told reporters the police did not yet know whether or not it was act of terrorism and could not comment on details emerging about the suspect. Police prosecutor Ann IrÃ©n Svane Mathiassen told TV2 that the man had lived in Kongsberg for several years and was known to police. The attack came on the final day of Erna Solberg's conservative government, and a new justice minister takes over the case on Thursday under a centre-left coalition led by Labour leader Jonas Gahr Store. Mr Store said it was a ""gruesome and brutal act"", hours before announcing his new cabinet. Norwegian police are not usually armed and after the attack the police directorate ordered all officers nationwide to carry firearms as an extra precaution. Police were searching the Huseby area of north-western Oslo on Thursday following reports of a man being seen carrying a bow and arrow. Police stressed no-one had been hurt and there was no threat. ""The police have no indication so far that there is a change in the national threat level,""the directorate said in a statement (in Norwegian),external.

"Sixteen arrests were made at junction 31 of the M25 in Essex, near the Dartford Crossing and Lakeside shopping centre Angry motorists confronted Insulate Britain activists who blocked traffic on two roads in the latest in a series of protests. Essex Police arrested 35 people at two locations, including at an M25 junction to the east of London. Officers detained 16 people after being called to a slip road at junction 31 for Thurrock, just after 08:25 BST. Police then arrested 19 people after reports of a further blockade nearby at Stonehouse Lane, Purfleet. On what was a 13th day of protests by the group in the past five weeks, the M25 slip road blockage, near the Dartford Crossing, led to many HGV drivers turning around, causing clashes between protesters and angry motorists. Lorry drivers blasted their horns and multiple confrontations occurred, with one protester nearly run over after stopping in front of a blue Hyundai car, whose frustrated driver called out ""this is stupidity"". Motorists ripped banners out of the hands of demonstrators as they sat or lay down in the road while other protesters glued themselves to the carriageway. Essex Police removed the protesters and said all the affected roads had reopened by lunchtime The force said it had been working to resolve the situation ""quickly and safely"" Some members of the group were repeatedly dragged off the road by drivers who were pulling on their clothes and backpacks, but they returned to their spots and sat down again. Some HGV drivers warned that the protests could cause fuel supply problems as tankers would be unable to reach filling stations. One driver toldLBC,externalnews: ""If this protest stays here for much longer, I'm afraid the nightshift driver will not be able to deliver fuel for any garages or anyone."" Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? Essex Police removed the protesters and said all the affected roads reopened by lunchtime. The force thanked members of the public for their ""patience and understanding"". Insulate Britain said about 40 people were at junction 31 and at the nearby A1090 London Road in Purfleet. Insulate Britain admitted its latest action was in breach of an injunction obtained by the government last month The action was Insulate Britain's 13th day of road protests The protest group, which has been regularly blocking highways since13 September, has been calling for the installation of heat-saving measures in social housing by 2025, and all homes by 2030. It admitted its latest action was ""in breach"" of aninjunctionobtained by the government last month. A spokesman, Liam Norton, said: ""In 10 years' time when fuel crises are catastrophic, when the food has run out and when people are experiencing unsurvivable heatwaves, what would you be wishing you had done now?"" The protest caused many vehicles, including HGVs, to stop and turn round The government has said it is investing Â£1.3bn to support people to install energy efficiency measures.

"Graffiti in the loyalist Sandy row area of Belfast. Unionists say businesses in NI are being affected by the Irish Sea trade border The European Commission will later bring forward its much-anticipated proposals for resolving problems with the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed in 2019 to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, but that creates a trade border for some products travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Unionists say this undermines their place in the UK, but also creates fundamental problems for Northern Ireland firms. EU to offer fewer NI border checks on British goods BBC News NI has spoken to a number of businesses across Northern Ireland which say they have been affected by the protocol. Andrew Lynas, of Lynas Foodservice, says scrapping the Northern Ireland Protocol is not the answer, but solutions are needed Andrew Lynas - Lynas Foodservice, County Londonderry The Coleraine-base company says it has had to employ two people to specifically deal with protocol-related paperwork as well as find alternative suppliers. It delivers to more than 5,000 catering customers across the UK and Ireland. Mr Lynas believes labour shortages, particularly with Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) drivers in Great Britain, means many businesses in England, Scotland and Wales may ""cut their losses"" and reduce trade with businesses in Northern Ireland. ""We've probably had to say goodbye to about 20 different suppliers, "" he says. ""We've been able to find some alternatives on the island, and some in Europe but for some we haven't been able to find alternatives. ""There's just a lot of hassle and complexity and when you talk to a supplier in GB, they don't fully understand all the bits of that paperwork."" Mr Lynas believes scrapping the Northern Ireland Protocol ""isn't the answer"" but says a workable solution needs to be found. Eamon McKey, chief operating officer with Deli Lites, says the protocol has produced opportunities and challenges Eamon McKey - Deli Lites, County Down Eamon McKey, chief operating officer with County Down-based Deli Lites, says 70% of its business is delivered to the Republic of Ireland, and the prospect of a hard border on the island was the company's ""greatest concern"". He says the protocol has produced new opportunities for the firm. ""We welcomed the protocol as resolving the land border issue for us,"" he says. He says he believes more people are now shopping locally, and Deli Lites has won a number of accounts that were previously serviced by competitors in Great Britain. However, challenges include a loss of some of the firm's suppliers in Great Britain. ""There are ongoing threats to our GB supply chain,"" he says. Mr McKey says that, on one occasion, one of its suppliers lost ""valuable"" produce because of delays due to temperature checks during shipping. ""This has impacted on our service to our customer and we are waiting on a replacement delivery,"" he adds. ""That type of incident is likely to further restrict GB supply into Northern Ireland. We do see opportunities, but we also have had problems."" John McGuinness, Garden Depot, County Tyrone, says he's had trouble getting Christmas tree supplies John McGuinness - Garden Depot, County Tyrone The Strabane-based garden firm is struggling to stock Christmas trees for the upcoming festive season. Mr McGuiness sells about 600 Christmas trees each December, the majority of which in previous pre-Brexit years have been sourced from suppliers in Scotland. But that's not the case this year. Mr McGuinness says trees coming from Great Britain are now subject to ""protocols, customs and paperwork"" that complicates a process that had worked well before the UK and EU parted ways. A product like Christmas trees have a limited shelf life, he says, and any process that delays their delivery is not good for business. ""You only have a certain amount of time from when you cut a tree until it gets to someone's house and before it dies, so all of that has to be taken into consideration,"" he says. Larger stores than his that also sell trees are in a similar position, he adds, and businesses are looking to get trees from local suppliers. That means ""there's less trees available and the price has gone up as well"", he says. ""I think we will get them, maybe not all the quantity, or all the different sizes that we would normally get, but we will be grateful to get what we do get."" Michael and Lesley Cairnduff of Oscar Pet Foods say they've experienced increased red tape Michael and Lesley Cairnduff - Oscar Pet Foods, County Down The Cairnduffs are the local nutritional advisers for Oscar Pet Foods in County Down, and have been providing a home delivery service for pet food and supplies for more than 25 years. The company's head office is in Lancashire. Mrs Cairnduff says their shipping costs have more than doubled in the first six months of this year compared to the same period in 2020. ""The first six months of this year were extremely worrying,"" says her husband. He says the amount of administration time that head office now spends on Northern Ireland has increased by a factor of 50. ""For us here, it's gone up, our delivery work, the paperwork and red tape, by a factor of about 10. Obviously we'd prefer to spend that on customer service and marketing, and not using it for the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" he adds. Mrs Cairnduff says food pallets coming from England are now taking 10-12 days, whereas it would have taken about four days pre-Brexit. She says the EU should repurpose thetrusted trader scheme,,externalas they can prove they don't sell any of their produce on to the EU. ""If that was put in place, it would make life a lot simpler for us. Treat us the same as our counterparts in England are being treated,"" she says.

"The protocol avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland The EU has released its plan for a reduction of post-Brexit checks on goods and medicines arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland has a special Brexit deal which keeps it in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But it means goods arriving from Britain face checks and controls. The UK government said it is studying the detail of the EU's proposals. The new plan, which seeks to calm a long-running dispute over a key part of the Brexit agreement, would remove about 80% of spot checks, the EU said. The EU said customs paperwork would also be cut by 50%. Most food products will not need to be physically checked when arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. A cut to the required administration for Northern Ireland importers. Expanded trusted trader arrangements meaning more products and companies are exempt from customs tariffs. Change to current laws to ensure no disruption to  moving medicines across the Irish Sea. Improved engagement with stakeholders in Northern Ireland including politicians and business groups. The UK says the current arrangement imposes too many barriers. At the start of the year, the new post-Brexit arrangement -known as the Northern Ireland Protocol- was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It involves keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods - but this, in turn, creates a new trade border with Great Britain. Unionists say this undermines their place in the UK. Sinn FÃ©in seeks NI Assembly recall over EU proposals Brexit Minister Lord Frost said the protocol - which the UK originally agreed to - was harming the peace process in Northern Irelandand that it undermined the Good Friday Agreement. The EU acknowledges that it has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and is now attempting to ease that burden with what it calls ""a different model"". This video can not be played Watch the lorry journey from England to NI It has produced ""bespoke arrangements"" covering food, customs and medicines. European Commission Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ said he had listened to, and engaged with, those in Northern Ireland. ""Today's proposals are a direct, genuine response to their concerns,"" he said. ""We have put a lot of hard work into them to make a tangible change on the ground."" Maros Å efÄoviÄ says he has listened to and engaged with those in Northern Ireland He said he looked forward to ""engaging earnestly and intensively"" with the UK government. Some firms in Northern Ireland affected by the protocol say supply chains are being disrupted, andwhile there may be opportunities, there are also some problems. On Wednesday, a UK government spokesman said the next step should be a ""rapidly conducted"" round of intensive talks on both the UK and EU proposals. ""Significant changes which tackle the fundamental issues at the heart of the protocol, including governance, must be made if we are to agree a durable settlement which commands support in Northern Ireland,"" he said. A solution is needed that both safeguards the Good Friday Agreement and ""puts the UK-EU relationship on a stronger footing"", he added. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley told the BBC's Newsnight programme that Prime Minister Boris Johnson told him ""personally that after agreeing to the protocol he would sign up to changing that protocol and indeed tearing it up, that this was just for the semantics"". ""I do believe that the government didn't really want this to happen to Northern Ireland and they took a short term bet. ""The trouble is this has cost the business people of Northern Ireland Â£850m which we can't afford, so it's got to be fixed and it's got to be fixed fast."" Talks between the EU and UK on the new proposals are now likely to go on for several weeks. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the proposals were a ""major effort"" to address the post-Brexit trade rules between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. ""Meats, whether they're chilled meats or other food stuffs, can come into Northern Ireland and if they're staying in Northern Ireland then the checks that are currently required will not be required,"" he said. This would be dependent on proper sharing of data and proper labelling, he added. There are also plans to give Northern Ireland politicians and other interested parties greater influence over the implementation of the protocol. However, the measures will fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from an oversight role. This video can not be played Lord Frost says the NI Protocol is ânot being implemented with the necessary sensitivity"" and it had to be ""redone"". On Tuesday, the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frostproposed plans for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing one. As part of these plans, the UK government wants to reverse its previous agreement on the oversight role of the ECJ, which is the EU's highest court. The agreement states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland - so for example, if there was a dispute around complying with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ. The movement of food products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have faced the biggest difficulties due to the EU's strict rules. The Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal:It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU). It means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules:As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland. But some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all:EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found. Read more:The Northern Ireland Protocol explained The EU says its new plan for food means that most products destined for consumers will not need to be physically checked when arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. A grace period, which means the protocol is not being fully implemented, currently means that supermarkets do not face a full range of controls. The EU says its new proposals will go beyond this and cover more businesses. It says the level of identity and physical checks will be up to 80% lower compared to other single market borders. However, it says for this to work it will need the UK to build properly equipped border posts at Northern Ireland's ports, allow access to real time trade data and implement ""only for sale in UK"" labelling. The possibility also remains that some GB food products could be banned in Northern Ireland. The EU maintains a ""prohibited and restricted"" list of food imports, which includes chilled meat products like fresh sausages. The EU is proposing that ""national identity goods"", or those which do not have a non-GB supply chain, would be exempt, but that leaves open the possibility that some goods could be banned. On customs, the EU is proposing what it calls a ""unique facilitation"" for paperwork, which it says will mean Northern Ireland importers can submit a greatly reduced amount of information. It estimates this will halve the administrative burden. It will also expand the concept of ""goods not at risk"" - this is an existing arrangement which Northern Ireland traders use so they do not have to pay EU tariffs on GB goods. Why is there a Brexit row over a European court? Katya Adler: Will talks lead to truce or trade war? 'We do see opportunities, but have had problems' The EU says the combination of the agri-food and customs proposals will effectively create an ""express lane"" to help facilitate the movements of GB goods whose end destination is Northern Ireland. Thesupply of medicinesfrom Great Britain to Northern Ireland has emerged as one of the most difficult issues. Pharmaceutical distributors have warned that if the current protocol was fully implemented they would have to withdraw hundreds of products from sale in Northern Ireland. The EU is now proposing to change its laws around the regulation of medicines to keep products flowing. Mr Å efÄoviÄ has previously said he will do ""whatever it takes"" to guarantee the supply of medicines. This is a complicated area and the pharmaceutical industry will need time to assess if the plan will work. Some unionists in Northern Ireland have held street protests against the protocol The EU originally floated a version of this idea in July but the industry was unconvinced at that time. The proposals for giving Northern Ireland politicians and other stakeholders a greater voice include the establishment of structured groups to provide a forum for discussion on key issues. It would also see interested parties invited to some meetings of the Specialised Committee, one of the joint UK/EU bodies that oversee the protocol. The EU says it also wants to create a stronger link between the Northern Ireland Assembly and the EU/UK Parliamentary Partnership Assembly. It also intends to create a website to track which EU legislation is applicable in Northern Ireland. The headline was amended on 1 December, 2021, to make clear that the EU offer of fewer checks is a proposal only.

"Political and business leaders in Northern Ireland, and further afield, have been giving their reaction to the EU'splan to reduce post-Brexit checkson goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The proposals include scrapping checks on most food products being shipped to, and remaining in, Northern Ireland from Great Britain. The EU has also said the plan will cut customs paperwork by 50%. The new plan, which seeks to calm a long-running dispute over a key part of the Brexit agreement, would remove about 80% of spot checks, the EU said. Michelle O'Neill said the EU are living up to commitments made to business and political leaders Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the proposals were ""a good mark of progress"". The party is seeking to recall the Northern Ireland Assembly to demonstrate support for the Northern Ireland Protocol. Ms O'Neill said the publication demonstrates ""both in word and deed"" that the EU are living up to commitments made to business and political leaders. However, Ms O'Neill said it is now ""up to others whether or not they engage with this process"". ""The British government and the DUP have dishonestly promoted a false narrative that the protocol does not enjoy the support or consent of the people of the north. That is untrue. ""The reality is that Brexit does not command the support or consent of the assembly,"" she said. Jeffrey Donaldson said the DUP will ""take time to study the detail of the papers produced"" The proposals are a ""starting point"", but appear to fall ""far short of the fundamental change needed"", Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said. Mr Donaldson said the party will ""take time to study the detail of the papers produced"". However, he said there was ""no escaping the reality that the Northern Ireland Protocol has harmed Northern Ireland, both in economic and constitutional terms"". ""The imposition of the protocol has harmed the balances created by the Belfast Agreement and subsequent agreements and were the situation to remain unaltered would undo the political progress of the last 20 years,"" he said. Colum Eastwood said the proposals present ""a clear landing zone"" to address challenges around the NI Protocol SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has urged political leaders to embrace the new proposals. The Foyle MP said the measures ""go further than expected"" and demonstrate that EU leaders are ""stretching themselves in the interests of people and businesses in Northern Ireland"". He said political leaders, particularly those of unionist parties, should ""reflect on the very serious efforts made by the European Commission"" in easing challenges to trade and ""addressing their concerns about democratic deficits"". ""The DUP, in particular, need to decide if they're on the side of people and businesses here or in the pocket of Boris Johnson,"" he said. ""There is now a clear landing zone that will address the protocol challenges, allow us to maximise the opportunities and most importantly, expend political energy dealing with the crisis in our health service, our crumbling schools estate and managing the pandemic. ""We need to grasp that opportunity."" Stephen Farry said he hoped the proposals could form the basis for an agreement between the UK and EU It would be an ""act of folly"" for opponents of the NI Protocol to ""squander the opportunity to provide certainty and stability given by the EU's proposals"", Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry MP has said. Dr Farry said he hoped the EU's proposals could form the basis for an agreement between the UK and EU which ""addresses practical issues around the protocol in a pragmatic way"". ""The challenges facing Northern Ireland come from Brexit,"" he said, adding that the protocol is ""the symptom of the problem, not the cause"". ""It would be an act of supreme folly to squander this chance to move on and indeed to impose even more delusional red-lines,"" he said. Doug Beattie said he was ""genuinely disappointed"" by what he heard from Maros Å efÄoviÄ It is ""a step forward but there remains a long way to go"", according to UUP leader Doug Beattie. ""We were told the protocol negotiations could not be reopened, but we have now proven otherwise. This has been achieved through negotiation, not threats; through engagement not disengagement. ""The fact that the EU recognises that the protocol isn't working and needs substantial change is a positive development. ""However, I am genuinely disappointed by what I heard from European Commission Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ and the supporting non-papers. ""Expectations were raised, but the proposals do not match them."" Jim Allister said the proposals ""can never be acceptable"" The EU's latest proposals ""utterly fail the sovereignty test"", TUV leader Jim Allister has said. Mr Allister described the protocol as ""an instrument delivering both economic dislocation and constitutional dislocation within the UK"". He said the proposals ""retain us in a foreign single market for goods, under a foreign customs code and VAT regime, ruled by foreign laws and adjudicated upon by a foreign court."" ""GB would continue to be decreed a 'third country' vis-a-vis Northern Ireland's trade,"" he said, adding that this ""can never be acceptable"". The CBI said it is now time for both sides to find a long-term solution that protects NI-GB trade The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said both the UK and EU had listened to businesses and are aware of the technical solutions needed to protect trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. ""Both sides must now grasp this opportunity to get back round the table - and agree sustainable long-term solutions that work for businesses and communities in Northern Ireland,"" CBI Europe Director Sean McGuire said. The NIRC said the proposals must provide ""stability, certainty, simplicity and affordability"" The Northern Ireland Retail Consortium (NIRC) has welcomed ""signs of movement from both sides"". However, a spokesperson said if the proposals are to work they must provide ""stability, certainty, simplicity and affordability"" to Northern Ireland's business community. They said the NIRC will ""reserve judgement"" on whether these requirements have been met ""until both legal and technical texts have been seen"". ""As an umbrella group for business, we will have meetings with both the UK Government and the European Commission to discuss these proposals in full and we look forward to understanding how they would keep NI business competitive and ensure choice and affordability for consumers,"" the spokesperson added. NI businesses would like to see new trade arrangements in place by the end of the year, the FSB says The FSB in NI's Roger Pollen said there is now an onus on both sides to negotiate a new trade solution relatively quickly. ""In terms of the timescale as to when we need to get this sorted, yesterday would have been very nice,"" he said Mr Pollen said under current arrangements many businesses in Northern Ireland are faced with ""vast amounts of bureaucracy"" when bringing goods across from GB. Should new arrangements be agreed by the UK and EU before Christmas, ""businesses would heave a fairly big sigh of relief"". Logistics UK have 18,000 members across the UK Seamus Leheny, a representative of trade body Logistics UK, said companies across the UK are not concerned about the European Court of Justice's (ECJ) role in the Northern Ireland Protocol. The UK Government has demanded that the ECJ is removed from its role in the protocol as the arbitrator of trade disputes. But Logistics UK policy manager Mr Leheny told BBC News: ""We have got 18,000 members across the UK and we haven't had any representation from any member regarding the ECJ. ""What people want is solutions to the protocol, they want the protocol to work and that is what we are interested in."" He added: ""What people are looking for, we are in solution mode here, and the logistics industry, we are solution seekers. We want to get these fixes that the EU have proposed. ""We need to see the legal text obviously to make sure the safeguards are there but people just want to build on this because they see the best way for peace in Northern Ireland is improve people's prospects and livelihoods. That's when I speak to businesses, that's what they want."" Mairead McGuinness said a deal before Christmas would be ""very desirable"" European Commissioner and former MEP Mairead McGuinness said the offer was a ""significant step forward"" by the EU and a ""huge opportunity"" for people in Northern Ireland. ""Of course there will be difficult issues and there will be a lot of debate and commentary around this,"" she told the BBC. ""However, I do believe that the idea of getting this resolved by Christmas is attainable and it would be very desirable."" Baroness Chapman said Labour would not get rid of the NI Protocol The Shadow Minister for Task Force Europe Baroness Jenny Chapman said that ""today could be a day where we take a step forward"" in the process to achieve stability to people in NI and across the UK. Speaking to the BBC, Baroness Chapman said the Labour Party would not get rid of the protocol entirely, but would instead look at the proposals ""in good faith"" and talk to businesses, leaders and elected politicians in Northern Ireland to see if they were sufficient. ""What isn't the right way is to be antagonistic and pick a fight,"" she added.

"""I suppose you've rung me to talk about the Northern Ireland Protocol..."", comes the weary voice down the phone. It's not diplomats or politicians from any particular EU country who greet me like that these days. It's the reaction I get pretty much across the board. Four years of Brexit negotiations before the UK's final departure in January last year have left the EU with no appetite for more. Member states are far more focused on struggling with post-Covid economic challenges, soaring gas prices and smouldering intra-EU strife with Poland and Hungary. The last thing EU capitals say they need or want right now is a trade war with the UK. But tensions over the Northern Ireland Protocol are real. Brussels and London agree - though to differing degrees - that the protocol isn't working well for the people of Northern Ireland. On Tuesday, the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost called for far-reaching changes to the text. Frost proposes new NI protocol in Brexit row Why are there tensions over the NI Brexit deal? Brussels views this as a demand for a rewrite, and the EU is refusing to renegotiate the protocol's framework. It was drawn up as part of the Brexit divorce deal, known as the Withdrawal Agreement. The result of an effort by EU and UK negotiators to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - dividing Northern Ireland, which is part of post-Brexit UK, from EU member state Ireland. The fear was that a customs border between them might endanger the peace process. And that's how Northern Ireland - which is legally part of the UK customs union - ended up also remaining in the EU customs union and single market for goods after Brexit, as set out in the protocol. This ""exceptional solution"" as the negotiators saw it, was an attempt to recognise the exceptional case of Northern Ireland, to avoid that hard border with the Republic of Ireland and to safeguard the peace process after Brexit. But, to protect the EU's single market from goods potentially flooding in unchecked from the UK, Brussels insisted customs checks needed to be carried out between Great Britain and Northern Ireland - if they weren't going to take place on the island of Ireland. This has angered unionists in the North, who feel they are being severed from the United Kingdom. Lord Frost and others in the UK government warn the Protocol is upsetting the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland, thereby endangering the peace process the agreement was supposed to protect. But Brussels insists this is an international treaty signed knowingly at the time by the UK government. It says it is happy to work on ironing out any day-to-day practical difficulties of the protocol, raised by businesses and civil society in Northern Ireland. But the EU wants to make clear this week that it is not bowing to ""attempts at bullying"" by London, in the words of one European diplomat I spoke to. The EU describes its new proposals as ""practical steps to solve concrete problems"". It says it wants to ensure the smooth arrival of medicines from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. Because it has heard complaints in Northern Ireland that regulations are being made concerning life there, without local involvement, Brussels will undertake this week to consult more with the authorities and businesses there. Lord Frost said on Tuesday that British people ""voted for change and that's what they expect"" And while the EU insists that waiving customs checks altogether would endanger its single market, EU insiders say new measures being suggested this week to reduce the number of checks on goods and animal products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland (and therefore potentially onwards into the EU single market) already go too far for some EU member states. However, for now, Brussels is refusing to engage with Lord Frost's demand to remove the role of the European Court of Justice in the protocol. The ECJ is a red rag to many Brexit supporters including in the governing Conservative party. David Frost said on Tuesday he wanted to see the Protocol changed to become ""like a normal treaty in the way it is governed, with international arbitration instead of a system of EU law ultimately policed in the court of one of the parties, the European Court of Justice"". But again the EU insists the protocol is no normal treaty. It says that Northern Ireland's ongoing participation in the EU customs union and single market means in those areas it is subject to EU regulations and those, in turn, are always policed by the European Court of Justice. Yet there is some wiggle room here. In its agreements with sovereignty-minded Switzerland, the EU has an additional layer of oversight - placing the ECJ very much at arm's length. But even if Brussels eventually suggested this, would the UK government go for it? On Tuesday, Baroness Chapman, shadow Brexit Minister in the Labour Party, accused senior Conservatives of being ""desperate to use a tussle with Brussels"" to distract from what she described as the government's domestic failures - whether on Covid or the current energy crisis. A number of EU diplomats I've spoken to have echoed this sentiment. They're not convinced the government wants to resolve the protocol situation with Brussels, they say. At least not right away. That is an accusation denied by the UK government. Details of the proposed changes will be given by European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic later on Wednesday In fact, Lord Frost says he's put together the legal text of a ""forward-looking"" new protocol which he has passed to the European Commission for consideration. For now, despite some barbed exchanges by individual politicians (take a look at this weekend's Twitter spat between Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and Lord Frost) both the EU and the UK insist theirs are not take-it-or-leave-it positions. Both sides say they're open to discussion over the coming weeks. Lord Frost called on Brussels to be ""ambitious"" and to work together with the UK to agree ""a better way forward"". The EU is calling for ""constructive dialogue"". Let's see. The UK government has threatened to suspend parts of the protocol if it deems that to be necessary. The EU assumption is that, even if talks go badly, the UK would be unlikely to take such action before mid-November when the international COP26 climate summit in Glasgow comes to an end. This would avoid a big UK moment on the global stage being dominated by headlines about a row with Brussels and the possible endangering of the Northern Ireland peace process. But Brussels is readying itself for every eventuality. Key EU member states say they've asked the European Commission to prepare ""targeted retaliation"" if, for example, the UK suddenly stops customs checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. One possibility you hear mentioned is that the EU could start new legal proceedings against the UK and/or suspend parts of its post-Brexit ""zero tariff zero quota"" trade agreement with the UK. The idea would be to target strategic UK markets like whisky or cars ""to send a clear message to London"", according to EU diplomats I've spoken to. As bilateral discussions start again in earnest over the Northern Ireland Protocol, there's definite potential for things to get a lot messier.

"The European Court of Justice sits in Luxembourg The UK government has said it wants to remove the European Court of Justice from its oversight role as part of the Northern Ireland Protocol, saying as long as it continues the deal will never survive. The EU, on the other hand, has said it would be very hard for the protocol to continue without the court's oversight. So what is the ECJ, what is its role in the protocol and what are the possible alternatives? The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is actually composed of two separate courts - the Court of Justice and the General Court. From 2004 to 2016 there was a third court, the Civil Service Tribunal, but its work is now done by the General Court. To avoid confusion this article will refer to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to describe the work of the entire institution. If you want to know more detail, or look up a specific case,you can do so here,external. It's not to be confused with the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which is a separate institution and is not part of the European Union. It decides whether the institutions of the EU are acting legally, and it settles disputes between them. It ensures that the member states of the EU are complying with their legal obligations as set out in the EU treaties and it allows member states to challenge EU legislation. It interprets EU law at the request of national courts. Taken all together, this means that the ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, and pretty much everything else that the EU does. Under the terms of the protocol - agreed jointly by the UK and EU as part of the Brexit deal - Northern Ireland continues to follow EU rules on product standards, which enable the free movement of goods in the EU's single market. Many goods need to be inspected when they arrive at Northern Ireland's ports and customs documents have to be filled in. Theagreement that created the protocol,externalstates that representatives from the EU have the right to oversee its implementation and application. It also states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? If there was a dispute around compliance with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ, which would rule on whether the UK was in breach of its obligations under the terms of the protocol. In any cases brought before the ECJ, the UK would participate in proceedings in the same way as an EU member state. The former Brexit Minister Lord Frost wanted the ECJ's role in overseeing the protocol to be removed. In a paper published in July 2021, the government said it had only agreed to the ECJ's role because of the ""very specific circumstances"" of the protocol negotiation. It wanted a new governance arrangement in which disputes should be ""managed collectively and ultimately through international arbitration"". This objection to the ECJ's role can be linked back to the Brexit referendum. In fact it goes right back to one of the problems that British Eurosceptics have always had with the EU - the fact that European courts were able to rule on matters of EU law in the UK. During the Brexit campaign a key slogan for the leave campaign was ""take back control"". Then at the Conservative Party conference in October 2016, the then Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We are not leaving (the EU) only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That is not going to happen."" ""Take back control"" was a key slogan of the Vote Leave campaign Vague promises to take back control of our laws suddenly became a very specific promise to end the jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK. It became a government red line. But that did not stop the government signing up to the NI Protocol, complete with ECJ oversight. It is that which Lord Frost wanted to change. Speaking  in October 2021, European Commission Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ  said: ""I find it hard to see how Northern Ireland would stay or would keep the access to the single market without oversight of the European Court of Justice."" There was also a strong response from the then Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney after Lord Frost reiterated that he wanted the ECJ removed from its oversight role. Simon Coveney, was the Irish Foreign Minister, said the UK was dismissing EU solutions Mr Coveney said the UK's demands on the protocol could ""cause a breakdown in relations"" with the EU. He added that the UK's dismissals were now ""more serious"", given the comprehensive compromise proposals the EU is bringing forward. ""Each time the EU comes forward with new ideas, new proposals to try to solve problems, they are dismissed before they are released and that is happening again this week,"" Mr Coveney said. He said dismissals were being seen across the EU as ""the same pattern, over and over again"" by the UK. One alternative that has been suggested is the model associated with dispute resolution used in the main withdrawal treaty with the EU and bilateral treaties the EU has concluded with neighbouring countries like Ukraine. Under these treaties, proceedings go to an arbitration panel before proceedings in front of the ECJ, but only for questions of interpreting EU law. David Phinnemore, professor of European politics at Queen's University Belfast, said one problem with this from the EU's point of view is that the EU is clear that the only body that can interpret EU law is the ECJ - not an intermediary such as the arbitration panel. But Anton Spisak, trade policy lead at the Tony Blair Institute, suggested it could provide a ""landing zone"" for the UK government and the EU. He said that while the ECJ is the only body that can interpret EU law, the arbitration panel acts as the ""default arbiter"". In his view the UK is ultimately prepared to accept a ""more narrow role for the ECJ not as a default, but only in those circumstances where EU rules apply"". He said: ""The arbitration panel is the one making the ultimate decision, but the panel has to take the views of the ECJ into account. ""This is the way the EU has dealt with other third countries applying EU law in the past and the reason why I think it is a realistic proposition is that the EU recently put it on the table with Switzerland."" Another possible alternative is something along the lines ofthe EFTA Court,external, which is responsible for the three countries which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA): Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Prof Phinnemore said: ""In theory that is a a possible alternative, but it would mean setting up a dedicated court for Northern Ireland."" He also pointed out that the EFTA Court rules in line with the jurisprudence of the ECJ. Mr Spisak also did not believe the EFTA Court was a practical solution. The principality of Liechtenstein is one of three members of the European Economic Area Prof Phinnemore said: ""There is no precedent that allows anything other than the ECJ to rule on EU market rules. ""If you want to be part of the single market for goods you have to follow EU rules and I cannot see the EU moving away from that"". Mr Spisak said: ""In a sensitive debate like this it is useful to start from the first principals. If there are EU rules in the protocol, whether now or in some kind of renegotiated agreement, it is simply unavoidable for the ECJ to be an arbiter of those rules. ""And because it is unlikely to have a protocol where EU rules don't feature at all, both sides have to find a way of accommodating the ECJ within that agreement."" But he believed there is a possible compromise to be struck. He said: ""There is a technical solution that looks like a more standard international treaty but involves the ECJ in specific circumstances. The real difficulty is political. ""The EU compromising on the ECJ would signal to the UK that it is ready to renegotiate a key part of the protocol, which it has said it wouldn't do.""

"Questions around the origins of Covid-19 centre on Wuhan, where the virus first emerged The World Health Organization (WHO) says a new taskforce may be the last chance to find the origins of Covid-19. It has nominated 26 experts to join the body, the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago). More than a year-and-a-half since the virus was detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the question of how it first emerged remains unclear. The team will consider if the virus jumped from animals to humans in Wuhan markets or leaked in a lab accident. China has strongly refuted the second theory. In February, a WHO team tasked with investigating Covid's origins flew to China and concluded that the virus had probably come from bats but that more work was needed. The team called the lab leak theory ""extremely unlikely"". This video can not be played Covid-19 and Wuhan: Why don't we know more? But the WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, later said the investigation had been hampered by a lack of data and transparency from China. The proposed members of the Sago group include six experts who visited China as part of the previous team. Aside from coronavirus, Sago will also look into the origins of other high-risk pathogens. ""Understanding where new pathogens come from is essential for preventing future outbreaks,"" said Dr Tedros said. In a joint editorial in the journal Science, Dr Tedros and other WHO officials said ""a lab accident cannot be ruled out"". EXPLAINER: Why the lab-leak theory is being taken seriously Michael Ryan, the WHO's emergencies director, said Sago's work may be the ""last chance to understand the origins of this virus"". The announcement of the new group comes as CNN reported that China was preparing to test tens of thousands of blood bank samples taken in the early months of the pandemic. But Chen Xu, China's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said Sago's work should not be ""politicised"". ""It is time to send teams to other places,"" he said. Tulip Mazumdar, Global Health Correspondent Almost two years since the start of the pandemic, we still don't know how or when the deadly Sars-Cov-2 virus emerged. Investigating new viruses is always extremely complex, but scientists have been able to find the source of the two previous coronavirus outbreaks - both of which have emerged from animals. It's been nine months since the last WHO-convened mission returned from Wuhan, saying a similar animal spillover was the most likely source of the pandemic. But questions continue to be raised about a potential accident at a Wuhan lab which studies coronaviruses and keeps thousands of bat samples. China has strenuously denied this. The WHO says China still hasn't shared crucial data from the earliest days of the pandemic. The UN agency - which has been caught in the firing line between China and the US's bigger geopolitical fight on this issue - has been hardening its language on investigations into a lab leak theory. The science is becoming increasingly politicised, with China so far refusing to allow international scientists back into the country.

"This video can not be played The MS Romantika arrives in Scotland to provide accommodation for the COP26 conference The first of two cruise ships that will provide accommodation for people attending the COP26 summit has arrived in Scotland. The Latvian-flagged Romantika has berthed at King George V dock, next to Braehead Shopping Centre in Renfrew. A second vessel, the MS Silja Europa, will arrive from Estonia in the coming days. Up to 25,000 government representatives, media and campaigners are expected to be in Glasgow. Concerns have been raised about the cost and availability of accommodation in the city for the climate summit, which takes place from 31 October until 12 November. Paavo NÃµgene, chief executive of the ship owner Tallink, described the decision to bring a second ship to Scotland as a ""last-minute agreement"". Scots urged to open up their homes to attendees 'Why I am giving up my home to climate activists' What is the Glasgow climate conference and why is it important? Each member of the United Nations has been invited to Glasgow, meaning nearly 120 heads of state are expected to attend along with around 20,000 accredited delegates. Last Friday, it emerged Pope Francis will not travel to Scotland but US President Joe Biden has said he is ""anxious"" to be there and the Queen has confirmed she will attend. Meanwhile, BBC Scotland has found evidence that a squeeze on available accommodation has sent prices soaring in Glasgow. One room in the city advertised as Â£42 per night on Monday is being advertised as costing Â£1,400 per night during the summit. Fiona Hooker, of the Stop Climate Chaos Scotland campaign, said the cost and availability of accommodation was ""a huge concern"" for activists attending the summit. She said: ""It's incredible that they can charge so much. ""What people are looking for is a place to stay with a local person and the chance to feel part of the event."" Delegates will take shuttle buses between the King George V dock and the summit venue at the Scottish Event Campus Restaurateur and property owner Charan Gill, who became known as Glasgow's ""Curry King"" and is one of the country's top entrepreneurs, called the practice ""opportunistic"". He told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime with John Beattie that he would not increase rents because it was damaging to the city's reputation. ""Sometimes you have to pay a premium,"" he said. ""But there has to be some sort of moral compass where we say surely this is wrong. ""You will not live off this money forever - fine, you might make an extra few hundred or thousand pounds here and there. At the end of the day you have to go back to your normal people, your normal market, your normal tenants who keep your bread buttered."" Airbnb told the BBC they would donate all revenue from stays in Glasgow during the summit to Zero Waste Scotland. A spokesperson said: ""We are offering Glaswegians an incentive to start hosting in an effort to provide more accommodation during a unique event and to address a significant accommodation shortage. ""The expected attendance for COP26 is double that of local hotel capacity and hosting helps cities like Glasgow use existing space to scale up and welcome major events."" Nearly 700 households havesigned up to the COP26 Homestay Network. Operated by the third sector, the initiative is asking people to open their doors and provide affordable or free accommodation to COP26 attendees. But Jillian Evans, the head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, told BBC Scotland she had some concerns about this plan. She said: ""People coming from different parts of the world, some where the vaccination programme is not the same as ours, there are risks associated with that. ""Then you put people in touch with one another, in folk's homes, and that increases the risk even more."" A COP26 spokesperson told the BBC: ""As hosts of COP26 it is of huge importance to the UK there are a wide range accommodation options available which suit the requirement of delegates attending from around the world. ""We have been working with our hotel provider, MCI, to make sure this is the case."" The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"An arrow could be seen sticking out of a wall after the attack Four women and a man were killed and two others wounded when a man used a bow and arrow to attack them in Norway. Police first received word of an attack in the town of Kongsberg, south-west of the capital Oslo, at 18:12 local time (16:12 GMT). A Danish man aged 37 has been arrested and questioned for hours overnight. Police said they had previously been in contact with him over fears of radicalisation after he converted to Islam. The victims were all aged between 50 and 70, regional police chief Ole Bredrup Saeverud told reporters on Thursday morning. He said they were most likely killed after the police first confronted the attacker at 18:18. Reports of the incident were ""horrifying"", said Prime Minister Erna Solberg, hours before she was due to leave office. ""I understand that many people are afraid, but it's important to emphasise that the police are now in control,"" she said. The attacker is said to have launched the assault inside a Coop Extra supermarket on Kongsberg's west side. One of those injured was an off-duty police officer who was in the shop at the time. A spokesperson for the chain later confirmed a ""serious incident"" at their store, adding that none of their staff were physically injured. Local police chief Oyvind Aas confirmed that the attacker had managed to escape an initial confrontation with police before an arrest was finally made at 18:47 local time, 35 minutes after the attack began. Norway country profile One witness told local outlet TV2 she had heard a commotion and seen a woman taking cover, then a ""man standing on the corner with arrows in a quiver on his shoulder and a bow in his hand"". ""Afterwards, I saw people running for their lives. One of them was a woman holding a child by the hand,"" she added. Police have told Norwegian news agency NTB that the attacker also used other weapons during the incident, without giving more details on what they were. The suspect moved over a large area, and authorities cordoned off several parts of the town. Residents were ordered to stay indoors so authorities could examine the scene and gather evidence. Surrounding gardens and garages were searched with the help of sniffer dogs. The attack was Norway's deadliest since far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik murdered 77 people, most of them at a children's Labour Party summer camp on the island of Utoya in July 2011. Kongsberg Mayor Kari Anne Sand said it was a shocking attack that had taken place in an area where many people lived, and that a crisis team would help anyone affected. Describing the town as ""a completely ordinary community with completely ordinary people"", Ms Sand said everyone had been deeply shaken by ""this very tragic situation."" Police have cordoned off large parts of the town The suspect was taken to a police station in the town of Drammen, where his defence lawyer, Fredrik Neumann, said he was questioned for more than three hours and was co-operating with authorities. The suspect had a Danish mother and Norwegian father, he explained. Norway's outgoing justice minister Monica Maeland told reporters the police did not yet know whether or not it was act of terrorism and could not comment on details emerging about the suspect. Police prosecutor Ann IrÃ©n Svane Mathiassen told TV2 that the man had lived in Kongsberg for several years and was known to police. The attack came on the final day of Erna Solberg's conservative government, and a new justice minister takes over the case on Thursday under a centre-left coalition led by Labour leader Jonas Gahr Store. Mr Store said it was a ""gruesome and brutal act"", hours before announcing his new cabinet. Norwegian police are not usually armed and after the attack the police directorate ordered all officers nationwide to carry firearms as an extra precaution. Police were searching the Huseby area of north-western Oslo on Thursday following reports of a man being seen carrying a bow and arrow. Police stressed no-one had been hurt and there was no threat.

"Wales midfielder David Brooks joined Bournemouth from Sheffield United for Â£11.5m in July 2018 Wales and Bournemouth midfielder David Brooks has revealed he has been diagnosed with cancer. The 24-year-old said he has Stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma but that ""the prognosis is a positive one"" and will start treatment next week. Brooks, who has won 21 Wales caps, was on international duty last week and credits the Wales medical team for helping detect the illness. ""This is a very difficult message for me to write,"" said Brooks. ""I have been diagnosed with Stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma and will begin a course of treatment next week. ""Although this has come as a shock to myself and my family, the prognosis is a positive one and I am confident that I will make a full recovery and be back playing as soon as possible."" Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, an important part of the immune system. ""I'd like to show my appreciation to the doctors, nurses, consultants and staff who have been treating me for their professionalism, warmth and understanding during this period,"" Brooks said. ""I want to thank everyone at the Football Association of Wales because without the swift attention of their medical team we may not have detected the illness. ""I'd also like to say thank you to AFC Bournemouth for all of their support and assistance this past week."" Brooks has played nine times for Championship side Bournemouth this season, scoring three goals, but his football career will now be on hold as he begins treatment. ""Although I appreciate that there will be media attention and interest, I would like to ask that my privacy is respected in the coming months and I will share updates on my progress when I am able to do so,"" Brooks added. ""In the meantime, thank you to everyone for their messages of support - it means so much and will continue to do so in the months ahead. ""I look forward to seeing you all again and playing the sport I love very soon."" Both Wales and Bournemouth have offered their support and best wishes to Brooks during his treatment. Brooks, who made three appearances for Wales at Euro 2020, last played in the Cherries' goalless draw against Peterborough on 29 September, when he came off after 69 minutes. Wales announced on 6 October that he had withdrawn from their latest squad through illness.

"Graffiti in the loyalist Sandy row area of Belfast. Unionists say businesses in NI are being affected by the Irish Sea trade border The European Commission will later bring forward its much-anticipated proposals for resolving problems with the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed in 2019 to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, but that creates a trade border for some products travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Unionists say this undermines their place in the UK, but also creates fundamental problems for Northern Ireland firms. EU to offer fewer NI border checks on British goods BBC News NI has spoken to a number of businesses across Northern Ireland which say they have been affected by the protocol. Andrew Lynas, of Lynas Foodservice, says scrapping the Northern Ireland Protocol is not the answer, but solutions are needed Andrew Lynas - Lynas Foodservice, County Londonderry The Coleraine-base company says it has had to employ two people to specifically deal with protocol-related paperwork as well as find alternative suppliers. It delivers to more than 5,000 catering customers across the UK and Ireland. Mr Lynas believes labour shortages, particularly with Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) drivers in Great Britain, means many businesses in England, Scotland and Wales may ""cut their losses"" and reduce trade with businesses in Northern Ireland. ""We've probably had to say goodbye to about 20 different suppliers, "" he says. ""We've been able to find some alternatives on the island, and some in Europe but for some we haven't been able to find alternatives. ""There's just a lot of hassle and complexity and when you talk to a supplier in GB, they don't fully understand all the bits of that paperwork."" Mr Lynas believes scrapping the Northern Ireland Protocol ""isn't the answer"" but says a workable solution needs to be found. Eamon McKey, chief operating officer with Deli Lites, says the protocol has produced opportunities and challenges Eamon McKey - Deli Lites, County Down Eamon McKey, chief operating officer with County Down-based Deli Lites, says 70% of its business is delivered to the Republic of Ireland, and the prospect of a hard border on the island was the company's ""greatest concern"". He says the protocol has produced new opportunities for the firm. ""We welcomed the protocol as resolving the land border issue for us,"" he says. He says he believes more people are now shopping locally, and Deli Lites has won a number of accounts that were previously serviced by competitors in Great Britain. However, challenges include a loss of some of the firm's suppliers in Great Britain. ""There are ongoing threats to our GB supply chain,"" he says. Mr McKey says that, on one occasion, one of its suppliers lost ""valuable"" produce because of delays due to temperature checks during shipping. ""This has impacted on our service to our customer and we are waiting on a replacement delivery,"" he adds. ""That type of incident is likely to further restrict GB supply into Northern Ireland. We do see opportunities, but we also have had problems."" John McGuinness, Garden Depot, County Tyrone, says he's had trouble getting Christmas tree supplies John McGuinness - Garden Depot, County Tyrone The Strabane-based garden firm is struggling to stock Christmas trees for the upcoming festive season. Mr McGuiness sells about 600 Christmas trees each December, the majority of which in previous pre-Brexit years have been sourced from suppliers in Scotland. But that's not the case this year. Mr McGuinness says trees coming from Great Britain are now subject to ""protocols, customs and paperwork"" that complicates a process that had worked well before the UK and EU parted ways. A product like Christmas trees have a limited shelf life, he says, and any process that delays their delivery is not good for business. ""You only have a certain amount of time from when you cut a tree until it gets to someone's house and before it dies, so all of that has to be taken into consideration,"" he says. Larger stores than his that also sell trees are in a similar position, he adds, and businesses are looking to get trees from local suppliers. That means ""there's less trees available and the price has gone up as well"", he says. ""I think we will get them, maybe not all the quantity, or all the different sizes that we would normally get, but we will be grateful to get what we do get."" Michael and Lesley Cairnduff of Oscar Pet Foods say they've experienced increased red tape Michael and Lesley Cairnduff - Oscar Pet Foods, County Down The Cairnduffs are the local nutritional advisers for Oscar Pet Foods in County Down, and have been providing a home delivery service for pet food and supplies for more than 25 years. The company's head office is in Lancashire. Mrs Cairnduff says their shipping costs have more than doubled in the first six months of this year compared to the same period in 2020. ""The first six months of this year were extremely worrying,"" says her husband. He says the amount of administration time that head office now spends on Northern Ireland has increased by a factor of 50. ""For us here, it's gone up, our delivery work, the paperwork and red tape, by a factor of about 10. Obviously we'd prefer to spend that on customer service and marketing, and not using it for the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" he adds. Mrs Cairnduff says food pallets coming from England are now taking 10-12 days, whereas it would have taken about four days pre-Brexit. She says the EU should repurpose thetrusted trader scheme,,externalas they can prove they don't sell any of their produce on to the EU. ""If that was put in place, it would make life a lot simpler for us. Treat us the same as our counterparts in England are being treated,"" she says.

"The wholesale price of gas has increased by 250% since January Russia has denied using energy as a political weapon, amid surging prices across Europe that have sent gas bills in many households skyrocketing. Russia, one of Europe's biggest natural gas providers, has been accused of intentionally withholding supplies. President Vladimir Putin said such claims were ""complete rubbish... and politically motivated tittle-tattle"". The European Commission has been outlining measures member states can take to combat rising prices. The wholesale price of gas has increased by 250% since January, triggering a knock-on spike in costs for consumers and businesses. Energy prices have hit record highs for various reasons, including high demand for natural gas as economies recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. EXPLAINED:Why are gas prices so high? ANALYSIS:Gas crisis leaves Europe searching for solutions President Putin said Russia was ready to provide more gas to Europe if requested Speaking at a Moscow energy forum on Wednesday, President Putin blamed the current crisis on Europe, saying that after a cold winter Europeans had not pumped sufficient volumes of gas into storage facilities. He said it was ""very important"" to ""suggest a long-term mechanism to stabilise the energy market"". Mr Putin stressed that Gazprom, Russia's gas giant, was supplying gas to Europe at maximum levels under existing contracts, and was ready to provide more if requested. ""We will increase by as much as our partners ask us. There is no refusal, none,"" he said. Europe's gas crisis has multiple causes: from a shortfall in renewable energy to low gas stocks after a cold winter. Plus, a surge in demand as countries emerge from the pandemic. But could another factor be Russia? In recent weeks Moscow has faced accusations that it has contributed to the crisis and forced gas prices higher by declining to supply additional gas to Europe. ""Politically motivated tittle-tattle,"" says President Putin. But the International Energy Agency believes Russia could do more to increase gas availability to Europe. Kremlin critics suspect it is using the crisis to fast track European approval for Russia's controversial new pipeline. When European regulators sign the paperwork, Nord Stream 2 will carry natural gas from Russia to Germany, bypassing Ukraine. Opponents of the pipeline believe it is a political project designed to increase Europe's dependency on Russian energy. Supporters insist it will provide Europe with a cheaper and more efficient supply of gas. On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin insisted Nord Stream 2 was ""a commercial project"". That was followed by a not so subtle hint. The president said he was ""100% certain"" that if the pipeline was functioning, that would ease Europe's energy problems. Earlier on Wednesday, the European Commission's energy chief, Kadri Simson, said the EU's executive was responding to calls for urgent action by unveiling an ""energy price toolbox"". The toolbox outlines steps member states can take to reduce energy bills in their countries without breaching EU law. It mostly confirms the measures national governments can already use, but considers what more the Commission can do. Ms Simson said member states were best placed to ease the burden of rising energy prices as winter approaches. She urged them to consider emergency income support for vulnerable households, state aid for companies, and targeted tax reductions. She also advised member states to temporarily pause bill payments where necessary, and put in place safeguards to avoid disconnections from the grid. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... the UK's rising energy bills ""Rising global energy prices are a serious concern for the EU,"" Ms Simson said. ""As we emerge from the pandemic and begin our economic recovery, it is important to protect vulnerable consumers and support European companies."" On top of those measures, Ms Simson said the Commission would look into the possible benefits of EU countries jointly buying natural gas.

"Wales midfielder David Brooks joined Bournemouth from Sheffield United for Â£11.5m in July 2018 Wales and Bournemouth midfielder David Brooks has revealed he has been diagnosed with cancer. The 24-year-old said he has Stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma but that ""the prognosis is a positive one"" and will start treatment next week. Brooks, who has won 21 Wales caps, was on international duty last week and credits the Wales medical team for helping detect the illness. ""This is a very difficult message for me to write,"" said Brooks. ""I have been diagnosed with Stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma and will begin a course of treatment next week. ""Although this has come as a shock to myself and my family, the prognosis is a positive one and I am confident that I will make a full recovery and be back playing as soon as possible."" Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, an important part of the immune system. ""I'd like to show my appreciation to the doctors, nurses, consultants and staff who have been treating me for their professionalism, warmth and understanding during this period,"" Brooks said. ""I want to thank everyone at the Football Association of Wales because without the swift attention of their medical team we may not have detected the illness. ""I'd also like to say thank you to AFC Bournemouth for all of their support and assistance this past week."" Brooks has played nine times for Championship side Bournemouth this season, scoring three goals, but his football career will now be on hold as he begins treatment. ""Although I appreciate that there will be media attention and interest, I would like to ask that my privacy is respected in the coming months and I will share updates on my progress when I am able to do so,"" Brooks added. ""In the meantime, thank you to everyone for their messages of support - it means so much and will continue to do so in the months ahead. ""I look forward to seeing you all again and playing the sport I love very soon."" Both Wales and Bournemouth have offered their support and best wishes to Brooks during his treatment. Brooks, who made three appearances for Wales at Euro 2020, last played in the Cherries' goalless draw against Peterborough on 29 September, when he came off after 69 minutes.

"This video can not be played Kerry Roberts and Tammy Kirkwood shared their experiences at an emotional meeting A mum whose daughter died after taking ecstasy has struck up an ""unlikely"" friendship with the mother of the teenager who supplied the fatal drug. Kerry Roberts' daughter Leah Heyes, 15, collapsed after taking MDMA supplied by Connor Kirkwood. After agreeing to meet his mother, Tammy, Ms Roberts said she realised both had ""lost something"" as a result of the drug. They are campaigning together to raise drugs awareness among young people. Leah died in May 2019 after she took the Class A drug with a group of friends in a car park in Northallerton, North Yorkshire. The drugs were brought into the town by Connor, then 17, with another boy, Mitchell Southern, handing them over to Leah. Connor, from Dishforth, was jailed for 21 months last yearbut was released after serving six months of his sentence. The mothers were introduced to each other through restorative justice - a process in which victims of crime can meet those who committed the offence against them. Although Ms Roberts did not want to meet Connor, it was suggested that by meeting his mother they would be able to share and understand each other's stories. Kerry Roberts said she and daughter Leah had the ""best relationship"" It gave Ms Kirkwood the opportunity to explain how she had been struggling for years to get help for Connor. He had become involved in county lines gangs, which target vulnerable teenagers and use them to supply drugs. Ms Roberts said: ""People will look at us and think it's an unlikely friendship. ""People will see us as two separate things but we are both grieving. They are both our children."" Connor Kirkwood and Mitchell Southern both admitted supplying ecstasy and were jailed last year Ms Kirkwood described how, from the age of 15, Connor went from being a ""presentable young man"" to ""wearing trackies and not speaking to anyone"". She knew he was involved in drugs and had reported him to police, but when questioned he would refuse to give any information about the gangs. UK warning over different drugs in identical pills How social media is being used to sell drugs Despite police involvement and her constant requests for help, Ms Kirkwood said they were never offered a drug referral or other support. She said she had struggled with ""guilt and shame"" over whether she could have prevented Leah's death. ""I thought where have I gone wrong? How did this happen? What did I do?"" she said. ""And there's the guilt of my child being involved in someone else's child losing their life. ""I lost the child that had a passion for sport, was always smiling. I don't see a smile anymore. ""I have this 19-year-old man. I don't know who he is. I get to see him in bed and why do I get that? ""That's my guilt because that's not fair."" Leah's mum said they had spoken about drugs together but neither of them had heard of MDMA Leah's mum, who described her daughter as her ""best friend"" said she had felt ""a lot of hatred"" and was initially against the meeting. ""There was hatred for Connor, for the situation. I thought how is it going to do me any good? I have nothing to say to her,"" she said. But she said hearing the other side of the story had helped ease those emotions. ""I've read about county lines and there's more of an understanding and I'm thinking he was a child, he was 15. He wasn't a 21-year-old dodgy drug dealer. ""I get how my friends and my family were like: 'why are you meeting her?', but I think it's done us both some good."" She added: ""People who didn't know Leah would probably think she came from a rough family, that her mum didn't care. ""People have their own thoughts and I had those thoughts about Connor's mum. I didn't realise the story."" The two mothers said they had both been affected by the devastating impact of the drug Both women are working together on a campaign called Do You Know MDMA? to get the message out that drugs kill. Ms Roberts has also launched a petition urging the government to make supplying drugs to under-16s a specific criminal offence. She said: ""I feel like if we've told our story and tried to educate people then we can't do much more. ""Leah died and I can't let that be for no reason.""

"The Conservative Party chairman says both he and the prime minister are sorry for ""the losses"" resulting from Covid in the UK Oliver Dowden's comments come a day after a report by MPs criticised the government's early handling of the pandemic The NHS Covid Pass, used to show a person's vaccine status for travel and events, stopped working for some users on Wednesday Some 42,776 new Covid cases - the highest daily total since 21 July - and a further 136 deaths have been recorded in the UK From November, the US will reopen its borders with Mexico and Canada to fully vaccinated travellers The UK economy grew by 0.4% in August after Covid restrictions were lifted The care sector in England is struggling to recruit staff, with more jobs unfilled than pre-pandemic, an industry body says Edited by Hamish Mackay We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic now, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's Covid news:  Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization's director general The World Health Organization (WHO) has put forward a list of 26 experts to advise on high-threat pathogens that could jump from animals to humans, sparking the next pandemic. Several of those named served on the WHO mission to Wuhan, China, to try to find out how coronavirus started. The WHO made a public call for experts to join the new Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago) last August. There will now be a two-week period of public consultation before the members are confirmed. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, says that while Covid-19 is ""the latest such virus, it will not be the lastâ. âUnderstanding where new pathogens come from is essential for preventing future outbreaks with epidemic and pandemic potential, and requires a broad range of expertise,"" he adds. Selected from over 700 applications, the 26 proposed Sago members have expertise in areas ranging from epidemiology to biosecurity and public health. They reflect âgeographic and gender diversityâ, says the WHO. With the highest number of daily cases since mid-July, the seven-day average for Covid cases in the UK now stands at 39,073 per day. The seven-day average for deaths, meanwhile, is 113 per day. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst There are reports today in Taiwanese media that mask wearing may be âphased outâ once 70% of the population has been fully vaccinated. According to the Taiwan News website, one mayor on the island has said they will ask Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre to relax existing restrictions once more than 70% of Taiwanâs population have received one vaccine dose. There are expectations that Taiwan will reach this milestone by the end of the month. Currently, Taiwan is following Level 2 restrictions in a four-tier system, where Level 1 is the least severe. Mask-wearing is largely enforced, but there are exceptions, such as in restaurants. Even in Level 1 restrictions, masks must still be worn at all times on public transport and in crowded public venues,according to Taiwanâs Central News Agency.,external This has led to some discussion recently about when people in Taiwan might be able to stop wearing masks altogether. The broadcaster SETN has quoted one toxicologist, Chao Ming-wei, as saying this will potentially by the spring. By this time, Taiwan will have hoped to fully vaccinate 70% of its 23.5m population. However, at present, only around 30% of the population have received two vaccine doses. Taiwan is currently somewhat free of Covid-19. Since the beginning of September, it has consistently only recorded single digit daily cases of the virus. No cases have been confirmed in the last 24 hours. The NHS Covid Pass app is working again, but it has come too late for one man who says it made him miss his flight because he was not able to prove his vaccination status. Chuck Adolphy, who's 24 and from Surrey, arrived at London's Gatwick Airport this morning, looking forward to a holiday in Slovenia. But when he attempted to show his Covid Pass on his phone to EasyJet staff, the app showed an error message. He tried showing his paper vaccination card but says the staff were ""having none of it"" - although he wasn't sure whether they were aware of the issues with the app at the time. Describing the situation as a ""shambles"", he tells the BBC he was turned away and missed his flight as a result. Chuck says the airline have refused to give him a refund so he's hoping to book a new flight tomorrow instead. In response, EasyJet said: âIf any passengers
were unable to board we will provide a free transfer to an alternative flight.
Whilst this is outside of our control we would like to apologise for any
inconvenience caused.â Here's what happened when the app went down. The NHS Covid Pass, used to prove vaccine status for travel and events, is up and running again after it stopped working earlier. At least one person says they missed their flight because of the problem,while others reported being ""stranded"" at an airport unable to fly. Today's figures show the number of new coronavirus infections in the UK are at their highest since July. There were42,776new casesrecorded in the last 24 hour,external. The last time the figure was higher than this was on 21 July when there were44,104new infections. Thedaily coronavirus data,externalfrom the government is out and it shows a further 42,776 new cases have been recorded in the UK. There have also been another 136 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Care homes in Wales are facing their worst crisis ""in living memory"", a leading industry figure says - with the sector left in a ""fragile state"" by the pandemic. Staffing levels are so low that homes could fill 20,000 vacancies within a week if people were available to work, says Mario Kreft, chairman of Care Forum Wales. He adds: ""We've got to find a mechanism to ensure that people are properly rewarded. ""Social care is a vital part of the foundation economy. It's worth over Â£50bn in the UK each year so we shouldn't be looking at cost, we should be looking at value."" One care worker in north Wales says she is dreading the winter as the sector reaches a ""critical point"". Emma Murray, manager of At Home - Vale Senior Care, a domiciliary care service in Denbigh, Denbighshire, says: ""You don't want to deliver care that's unsafe. We're desperate at the moment.""

Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers to get goods to the ports. It has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic. A spokesman for the port of Rotterdam says: ""It's more to do with Covid than anything else because of the balance of empty and full containers being in the wrong place."" Which items are in short supply? Gary Grant, boss of one of the biggest toy sellers in the UK, The Entertainer, says Paw Patrol toys and Barbie dolls are ""prime candidates for being short in the Christmas season."" Steve Parks, director at Seaport Freight which deals with food shipments from overseas says: ""Things like coconut milk, frozen fish and carpets are being delayed from China."" What should you do? Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, says there is ""no need to panic buy"" but advises customers to start their normal shopping process earlier. ""If you see something you want, now is the time to buy as retailers have most of their Christmas stock, but we can't guarantee having supplies of everything over the next few weeks.""

person in Scotland has died as a result of an adverse effect of the Covid-19
jab, according to the National Records of Scotland (NRS). It brings the total number of deaths related to the Covid-19 vaccine up
to five, the NRS says. More than 4.2 million people in Scotland have been given at
least one dose of the vaccine. The five reported deaths are significantly fewer than the 11,262 people that have died because of Covid-19 in Scotland.
Last week, 126 fatalities in Scotland mentioned Covid-19 on the death
certificate. Vaccinations remain the best protection against Covid-19 and
the Department of Health and Social Care continues to urge the population to
get vaccinated. The UK Health Security
AgencyCoronavirus Dashboard,externalreports that more than 94 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been given in the
UK so far. Public Health Scotland advises that side effects to the
jab can be reported on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agencyâs (MHRA)Coronavirus Yellow Card website,external. You can read more about vaccine safetyhere. Coronavirus travel restrictions are affecting tourism in the UK more than most other countries across the world, according to new figures. The London-based World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) - which describes itself as a forum for the industry - is forecasting that spending by tourists visiting the UK will drop by nearly 50% this year compared to 2020. It makes the UK ""one of the worst performing countries in the world"", the organisation says. The WTTC says the travel and tourism sector's contribution to the UK's economy could rise year-on-year by about 32% in 2021 - roughly in line with the global average. But that's being driven in part by the increase in domestic holidays, and it is not enough for a full economic recovery - or to save millions of jobs - says the WTTC. Users trying to access their NHS Covid pass are receiving error messages The NHS Covid Pass, which is used to show a person's vaccination status for travel and events, has stopped working. The feature, contained in the NHS smartphone app, usually allows users to access a barcode or text records about which vaccine doses they have had. Instead, users are receiving error messages or a notice saying that high traffic volumes are ""limiting access to the service"". In a post on Twitter,external, NHS Digital says there are currently issues with accessing the Covid Pass on the NHS App and website and it is investigating. The digital pass can be used by those over 16 years old who were vaccinated in England, Wales or the Isle of Man. Read more. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has recorded no new domestic Covid-19 cases for the seventh consecutive day. State media are lauding this, because in recent weeks, there have been outbreaks in multiple provincial-level regions, including northwest Xinjiang, northeast Heilongjiang and southeast Fujian. These have been suppressed with swift lockdowns, and mass testing drives have helped identify asymptomatic carriers. There is currently only one area of China that has lockdowns in place: the northeast city of Harbin. However, vigilance is high in the country, as last week hundreds of millions of journeys were made for the annual Golden Week holiday (1-7 October). In two weeks time, tens of thousands of people are set to travel again - to Wuhan, the original epicentre of the coronavirus. The city will host the Wuhan Marathon on 24 October and is expected to see 26,000 runners. Organisers say free tickets for the event will be given to medical workers who helped on the front line during the early stages of the pandemic. Robert Gibbon (centre) died with Covid in December 2020 Yesterday, Wales' health minister apologised for her government's handling of the early stages of the pandemic, after a critical report from MPs. But some bereaved families say an apology is not enough and have called for a separate inquiry into the Welsh response to Covid. Rhianna Gibbon, from Merthyr Tydfil, lost her father Robert, 63, to Covid in December 2020, after he was sent home from hospital due to ""overrun"" corridors. She says lessons should have been learned for the second wave after the delay in introducing the first national lockdown. ""An apology is just not enough. My dad was just one of thousands of people who lost their lives unnecessarily,"" she tells BBC Radio Wales. ""I accept the apology, they've taken responsibility, but this is one of the biggest health issues ever. They [the government] should be held accountable."" You can read more reaction from families and health workers to yesterday's report here. BBC Monitoring Russia is threatening to include British newspaper articles about itsSputnik V coronavirus vaccineon the âfake news"" section of its Foreign Ministry website unless they apologise. It wants papers to retract claims that Russian developers copied the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to create Sputnik V. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says: ""They still have a chance to save a semblance of dignity and respect for the reader and offer their apologies to the Russian developers of the vaccine."" The Russian Foreign Ministry's press office collects what it describes as âarticles circulating untrue information about Russia"". They include articles in the Western media about World War Two that Russia says amount to a ""falsification of history"", stories about the nerve agent poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, and what Russia calls the West's propaganda war on Russian vaccines. Earlier this week, UK Home Office minister Damian Hinds would not be drawn on allegations that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's design was used to create Russia's Sputnik V jab, instead saying more generally that ""state activity"" was involved in ""industrial espionage"". The number of people who died in Scotland last week was 30% higher than the average before the pandemic began.. There were 1,353 deaths - from all causes - registered in the week to 10 October, the National Records of Scotland said. It's 315 more than the average for that week from 2015 to 2019. It's also the highest rate of ""excess"" deaths since the first week of January. They include deaths caused by things like cancer, heart disease or dementia. The number of deaths where Covid was mentioned in registration has fallen for a second week, to 126. The number of deaths linked to the pandemic had been rising since mid-August, but appears to have peaked in the week ending 27 September at 167 - far below previous peaks during the initial outbreak of the virus and at the start of 2021.

Suranjana TewariBBC News Singapore's borders have effectively been closed for 21 months, so news that rules will finally be relaxed has sent residents rushing for a ticket out. From 19 October, vaccinated people can travel freely from Singapore to a dozen countries around the world - without quarantine and with fewer swab tests. By 15 November, another nine countries will be added to the list. ""The cabin fever was just driving us crazy. There's no demarcation between leisure and work here,"" Low Ka Wei, a corporate communications executive told the BBC. The demand for tickets was so great that travel websites crashed. The Singapore Airlines website went down over the weekend, causing a frenzy among eager travellers and leading to one Reddit thread asking: ""Did we just collectively break SIA's website?"" So, having no luck online, Mr Low and many others went the old-fashioned way, spending hours queueing outside a downtown airline office to book. Hospitals across the UK remain under pressure with long waiting lists, Covid infections on the rise and winter looming. We meet staff at one of England's flagship hospitals, Addenbrooke's in Cambridge, as it gears up for what it expects to be its busiest winter ever. James Wheeler, divisional director of surgery and theatres, says the hospital is fortunate in being able to ring-fence beds in order to keep ""elective surgical patients safe"". He says: ""Any wait is painful to watch. All I can really reassure is that we are doing everything in our powers to get through the backlog patients."" Dr Joseph Newman, a respiratory registrar with Cambridge University Hospitals, tell us this hospital is vaccinating staff against flu and Covid to keep them both safe and in work. ""Staff shortages this time last year were a real issue, adding to the pressure even more, so I think trying to keep everyone fit and healthy is really important,"" he says. Roland Sinker, chief executive of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, says he is ""desperately sorry"" that people are having to wait at all. ""If we can get the hospital teams, the population and partners outside the hospital playing together in a way that we did during Covid, I think we can get through this six to nine-month period,"" he says.

"Wales midfielder David Brooks joined Bournemouth from Sheffield United for Â£11.5m in July 2018 Wales and Bournemouth midfielder David Brooks has revealed he has been diagnosed with cancer. The 24-year-old said he has Stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma but that ""the prognosis is a positive one"" and will start treatment next week. Brooks, who has won 21 Wales caps, was on international duty last week and credits the Wales medical team for helping detect the illness. ""This is a very difficult message for me to write,"" said Brooks. ""I have been diagnosed with Stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma and will begin a course of treatment next week. ""Although this has come as a shock to myself and my family, the prognosis is a positive one and I am confident that I will make a full recovery and be back playing as soon as possible."" Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, an important part of the immune system. ""I'd like to show my appreciation to the doctors, nurses, consultants and staff who have been treating me for their professionalism, warmth and understanding during this period,"" Brooks said. ""I want to thank everyone at the Football Association of Wales because without the swift attention of their medical team we may not have detected the illness. ""I'd also like to say thank you to AFC Bournemouth for all of their support and assistance this past week."" Brooks has played nine times for Championship side Bournemouth this season, scoring three goals, but his football career will now be on hold as he begins treatment. ""Although I appreciate that there will be media attention and interest, I would like to ask that my privacy is respected in the coming months and I will share updates on my progress when I am able to do so,"" Brooks added. ""In the meantime, thank you to everyone for their messages of support - it means so much and will continue to do so in the months ahead. ""I look forward to seeing you all again and playing the sport I love very soon."" Both Wales and Bournemouth have offered their support and best wishes to Brooks during his treatment. Brooks, who made three appearances for Wales at Euro 2020, last played in the Cherries' goalless draw against Peterborough on 29 September, when he came off after 69 minutes. Wales announced on 6 October that he had withdrawn from their latest squad through illness.

"Boris Johnson fought the 2019 election on a promise to get a deal with Brussels Ireland's deputy PM has warned governments doing trade deals with the UK that it is a nation that ""doesn't necessarily keep its word"". Leo Varadkar made the comment after Dominic Cummings suggested the UK had always intended to tear up the Brexit deal it signed with the EU in 2019. Boris Johnson's ex-adviser said the plan had been to ""ditch the bits we didn't like"" after winning power. The government said the deal had not worked as intended and must be changed. And it accused the EU of failing to protect the Good Friday peace agreement in its implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol. EU to offer fewer NI border checks on British goods EU to table new proposals for NI Protocol Will NI protocol talks lead to truce or trade war? Mr Johnson fought the 2019 election on a ""Get Brexit done"" platform. During the campaign, he repeatedly claimed the withdrawal agreement he had negotiated with Brussels - including the Northern Ireland Protocol - was a ""great"" deal that was ""oven ready"". The UK now wants to change the deal to allow goods to circulate more freely between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. EU officials are travelling to London later to present their proposals for the border - but they are unwilling to rewrite the protocol and their proposals are unlikely to satisfy Brexit minister Lord Frost, wholaid out the UK's plans for an entirely new protocol on Tuesday. Mr Cummings - who has turned against Mr Johnson since being removed from Downing Street at the end of 2020 - claims the prime minister never understood what the withdrawal agreement really meant. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar casts doubt on the trustworthiness of the British government. He tweeted: ""What I've said does NOT mean 'the PM was lying in General Election 2019', he never had a scoobydoo [a clue] what the deal he signed meant. ""He never understood what leaving Customs Union meant until November 2020."" When the prime minister did finally comprehend, said Mr Cummings, ""he was babbling 'I'd never have signed it if I'd understood it' (but that WAS a lie)"". Asked if Mr Cummings was correct in his assessment, Lord Frost said: ""We all understood extremely well what the deal meant, it delivered on democracy, took the UK out of the EU whole and entire, and it was a very good deal."" But he said it now had to be changed because it was ""undermining the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, not supporting it"". ""The problem with the protocol at the moment is that EU law, with the European Court of Justice as the enforcer, is applied in Northern Ireland without any democratic process. That has to change if we are to find governance arrangements people can live with,"" he said. This video can not be played Lord Frost says the NI Protocol is ânot being implemented with the necessary sensitivity"" and it has to be ""redone"". In a statement, the UK government said the protocol needed ""significant change"" to avoid further severe ""economic, political and societal"" disruption in Northern Ireland and to make it ""sustainable for the future"". Mr Cummings - the former Vote Leave campaign chief - said that when Boris Johnson entered Downing Street in 2019, the country was facing the ""worst constitutional crisis in a century"" with much of what he called the ""deep state"" angling for ""Brino"" [Brexit in name only] or a second referendum. ""So we wriggled through with best option we could and intended to get the trolley [his nickname for Boris Johnson] to ditch bits we didn't like after whacking [Labour leader Jeremy] Corbyn. We prioritised,"" he said. In July this year, Mr Cummings told the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg the Irish government had also wanted to ""fudge things"" and ""it suited both sides to sign up to something that was not what either side had really wanted and which punted difficult questions into the future"". This video can not be played The Brexit divorce deal was ""inherently self-contradictory in various ways"" says the PM's former chief adviser. In his latest tweets, Mr Cummings dismissed suggestions that abandoning elements of the deal would mean breaking international law. ""Our priorities meant e.g. getting Brexit done is 10,000 times more important than lawyers yapping re international law in negotiations with people who break international law all the time,"" he said. Mr Varadkar told RTE television: ""I hope Dominic Cummings is speaking for himself and not for the British government. ""But those comments are very alarming because that would indicate that this is a government, an administration, that acted in bad faith and that message needs to be heard around the world. ""If the British government doesn't honour its agreements, it doesn't adhere to treaties it signs, that must apply to everyone else too. ""At the moment they're going around the world, they're trying to negotiate new trade agreements... ""Surely the message must go out to all countries around the world that this is a British government that doesn't necessarily keep its word and doesn't necessarily honour the agreements it makes. ""And you shouldn't make any agreements with them until such time as you're confident that they keep their promises, and honour things, for example, like the protocol."" The Taoiseach (Ireland's PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has given his backing to EU proposals for changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol, but he urged both sides to work ""in good faith"" and focus on ""addressing disruption in trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain"". Theresa May's former chief of staff, Lord Gavin Barwell, has, meanwhile, warned the UK's proposal for changing the Northern Ireland protocol has ""no chance of success and is going to do even further damage to our relationship with our nearest neighbours"". ""My problem is if you agree something and fight an election saying what a fantastic deal this is - and then almost immediately afterwards you start to try and unpick the thing - the danger is the people you negotiating with think you didn't agree it in good faith in first place, and that makes it much more challenging when you try to renegotiate it,"" he told an Institute for Government event. He said he did not like the current Northern Ireland Protocol - but argued that the UK government had to meet the EU ""half way"".

"Robert Gibbon's family's lives have changed ""unimaginably"" since his death with Covid, his daughter says An apology over Wales' initial handling of the Covid pandemic is ""not enough"", some affected by the virus have said. Health MinisterEluned Morgan said sorryafter a report by MPs labelled the UK's early response as one of the worst-ever public health failures. Some of those impacted, including a woman who lost her father, backed calls for a Wales-specific Covid inquiry. The Welsh government said a UK-wide inquiry should fully encompass all decisions taken in Wales. Almost 6,000 people have died with coronavirus in Wales, according to Public Health Wales figures. AUK-wide Covid inquiry is expected to begin in 2022, with Scotland planning to start its own investigation later this year. NHS in Wales facing its most challenging period UK's early Covid response was a failure - inquiry What are the symptoms of long Covid? Rhianna Gibbon, from Merthyr Tydfil, lost her father Robert, 63, to Covid in December 2020. She said lessons should have been learned in the second wave after the slow first lockdown, after her father was sent home from hospital a week before he died due to ""overrun"" corridors. She toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""An apology is just not enough. My dad was just one of thousands of people who lost their lives unnecessarily. ""I accept the apology, they've taken responsibility, but this is one of the biggest health issues ever. They [the government] should be held accountable, there should be a separate investigation into the Wales Covid situation. Robert Gibbon died with Covid in December 2020 She added the lives of her and her mother and sister have changed ""unimaginably"" since Robert's death. ""We're not living any more we're just getting through one day at a time. ""I hope lessons have been learned from it but it doesn't take away the fact that we're not going to see my Dad again and it could've been avoided. ""He died in the second wave, so by then, things should've been better, they should've improved and they hadn't by the second wave."" Helen Whyley, director of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales, also said an apology was unlikely to be enough for healthcare staff. ""I'm sure for some families that [the apology] will bring them a degree of comfort, but for my members and for nurses who lost colleagues during this pandemic, I'm not sure an apology is going to be enough,"" she said. ""I think we really do need to understand the lessons that we need to learn from what happened."" Anna-Louise Marsh-Rees has led a campaign for a Wales-specific Covid inquiry Meanwhile, Anna-Louise Marsh-Rees, co-founded Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru after the death of her father, Ian, toldBBC Wales Todaythe MPs' report highlighted the need for a Wales-specific Covid inquiry. She said: ""It [the report] almost had to be just England because there are so many differences in the way the four nations made decisions handled the situation, so it would be almost impossible to cover that easily. ""Even more so it highlights the reason each nation needs to look at the way they handled the pandemic in isolation."" The Welsh government said: ""The first minister has made it clear that the UK-wide inquiry should fully encompass all decisions made in Wales. ""Some actions and decisions in the pandemic response were taken at a UK level on a four-nations basis - we have always been open to working together where there are shared decisions and shared responses."" Dr Ian Frayling said he caught Covid more than three weeks before the first lockdown - and is still suffering Dr Ian Frayling, a senior cancer pathologist from Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, said he contracted Covid-19 at the end of February 2020. He said he was ill with the virus initially, before he started to feel fatigued with long Covid a few weeks later. He said the report highlighted a need for specialist long Covid clinics in Wales, as there are in England. ""This is a thing that's specific for Wales. For me I am approaching my day 600 and I'm still affected. ""I've had to go for England for MRI scans, I've got damage in at least six organs."" Dr Frayling said the Welsh government's decision not to set up long Covid clinics was ""perverse"" and ""absolutely dangerously stupid"". The Welsh government said it was providing an ""individual tailored approach"" to long Covid so they can access services as close to home as possible. A spokesperson added: ""People who require more specialist support, which is only available from hospital-based services will be referred via their GP or healthcare professional. ""As we are learning more about long Covid, the programme will be reviewed on a six-monthly basis."" What is the UK Covid inquiry and how does it work?

"Restocking popular Barbie dolls is likely to be a problem, says The Entertainer. One of the UK's biggest toy retailers is warning delays at UK ports will result in shortages this Christmas. Gary Grant, boss of The Entertainer, said it would get harder to get stock to the right places at the right time. Barbie dolls and Paw Patrol toys are among the children's favourites he expects to run out fast. The government said that Felixstowe had reported ""improved capacity over the past few days"". A container logjam at ports, including Felixstowe, and a shortage of HGV lorry drivers has sparked widespread concern among retailers about future stocks. Mr Grant said his 170 shops are looking ""very full right now"". But he added that demand ""will outstrip availability"" because there aren't enough drivers to move the company's stock. ""There'll never be toy shops with no toys. There will be toy shops without all the toys that they would normally expect to have due to the shortages, and that is largely down to transportation and warehouse issues, rather than there being a shortage of toys."" Port delays: 'We've run out of Harry Potter stock' Biggest UK commercial port hit by container logjam Why is there an HGV driver shortage? The shortage of drivers means that shipment containers are being offloaded but left stacked on the quayside waiting for collection. The dearth of drivers also means there is a delay in returning empty containers for re-use. The problems come at the busiest time of the year for retailers, when most goods are imported from Asia to sell during Christmas trading. Thomas O'Brien, managing director of Leeds-based toy designer Boxer Gifts, which manufacturers its products in China, said there's ""plenty of stock"" but the real problem is that ""everything takes longer and is horrendously more expensive"" which means the company ""will be struggling to keep price increases to anything lower than 10%"". Items that are in short supply include a sloth soft toy and the moody cow stress ball. ""Ironically the moody cow which we're short of is almost a nice acronym for how feel at the moment,"" he added. The 'Moody Cow' stress ball is in short supply at the moment. While there are alternative toys, Mr O'Brien said the firm has lost six weeks of ""planning time"" to be able to re-stock at short notice. He said containers shipped from Qingdao, China to Felixstowe are costing him $15,000 (Â£11,003) rather than the normal rate of $2,500 in 2020. Entrepreneur Jack Griffiths, co-founder of loungewear company Snuggy, said he is expecting containers on five different ships, holdings Â£1m worth of Christmas items, to arrive over the next week but they will now be delayed by three weeks. ""We're seasonal and we have to make the most of these months, 80% of our turnover comes from October to February."" In November, the business usually takes Â£500,000 worth of sales which Mr Griffiths said he ""probably won't be able to get in if we don't get that stock in time"". The company has already run out of the SnuggyPod product which was due to arrive two weeks ago. Mr Griffiths said the product ""probably won't arrive for three weeks at Felixstowe and then it'll take three weeks to get them out of the port due to the driver issues"". He added that because the SnuggyPod is the firm's original design, there aren't any alternatives. ""As the weeks go by I can only see it getting worse which is just something we don't want to think about"". Mr Griffiths anticipates he will have to get products shipped by railway and air rather than sea. It comes after Â£400,000 worth of his stock was delayed earlier in the year when it got stuck on the Ever Given ship which blocked the Suez Canal. Mr Griffiths said that because the SnuggyPod is an original design, there aren't any alternatives. Steve Parks, director at Seaport Freight which deals with food shipments from overseas as well as other goods, says moving products from Rotterdam port to Felixstowe is delaying goods by two to three weeks. ""So things like coconut milk, frozen fish and carpets are being delayed from China."" While Mr Parks said Britain's shortfall in HGV drivers is ""largely"" to blame for the congestion at the port, other countries are experiencing problems, including the US and China. ""This is absolutely the worst period I have known, ever,"" he said. ""We can't get space on ships coming out of the Far East."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said that fluctuating capacity at ports ""has been exacerbated by the ongoing global container and HGV driver shortages"". ""All ports across the UK remain open to shipping lines with Felixstowe reporting improved capacity over the past few days and the government continues to work closely with the freight industry, to tackle the challenges faced by some ports this autumn,"" the spokesperson said. Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said there was ""no need to panic buy"" but advised customers to start their normal shopping process earlier. ""If you see something you want, now is the time to buy as retailers have most of their Christmas stock, but we can't guarantee having supplies of everything over the next few weeks"". ""It's a challenge for small retailers because they don't have the cash to stockpile,"" he added. The UK's biggest commercial port Felixstowe told the BBC that it currently had 50,000 containers which were waiting to be collected, due to a shortage of HGV lorry drivers. Officials at the port have asked the shipping lines to reduce their empty container stocks as ""quickly as possible"". ""It's not the port of Felixstowe affecting the supply chain, it's the supply chain affecting the port of Felixstowe,"" it said, adding that the problems are ""similar at all major UK ports"". Danish shipping giant Maersk has been forcedto divert some of its larger ships from Felixstowe to ports in the Netherlands and Belgium to avoid delays. Smaller ships are then transporting the goods to the UK. A spokesman for the port of Rotterdam said it has been busy over the last couple of weeks, but said: ""It's more to do with Covid than anything else because of the balance of empty and full containers being in the wrong place."" The pandemic is also being blamed in part for bottlenecks at US ports. President Joe Biden will meet with major US retailers as well as the bosses of ports on Wednesday to address the issues. Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chief executive Dubai-based DP World, the global logistics giant which operates out of Southampton and London Gateway, said ""nobody knows how long it's going to take"" to resolve the congestion and shipping container shortages. ""I think it's going to take a long time,"" he said, adding: ""The problem is complicated because you have a backlog of cargo."" The UK Ports Association trade group, said most UK ports were operating normally but that the shortage of drivers meant ""some delays"". ""This has meant that some freight is not being collected as rapidly as it would normally. The situation is impacting all types of ports, not just container terminals. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers. It has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit and a backlog of HGV driver tests. The government recently drafted in military personnel to help with the driver shortages and deliver fuel. Emergency temporary visas have also been issued to foreign drivers. Conservative Party chair Oliver Dowden told the BBC that the government was increasing the number of people having tests and that he would ""expect that number to increase as we approach Christmas"". Asked about potential Christmas shortages, he told Sky news: ""The situation is improving, I'm confident that people will be able to get their toys for Christmas.""

"The Conservative Party chairman says both he and the prime minister are sorry for ""the losses"" resulting from Covid in the UK Oliver Dowden's comments come a day after a report by MPs criticised the government's early handling of the pandemic The NHS Covid Pass, used to show a person's vaccine status for travel and events, stopped working for some users on Wednesday Some 42,776 new Covid cases - the highest daily total since 21 July - and a further 136 deaths have been recorded in the UK From November, the US will reopen its borders with Mexico and Canada to fully vaccinated travellers The UK economy grew by 0.4% in August after Covid restrictions were lifted The care sector in England is struggling to recruit staff, with more jobs unfilled than pre-pandemic, an industry body says Edited by Hamish Mackay We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic now, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's Covid news:  Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization's director general The World Health Organization (WHO) has put forward a list of 26 experts to advise on high-threat pathogens that could jump from animals to humans, sparking the next pandemic. Several of those named served on the WHO mission to Wuhan, China, to try to find out how coronavirus started. The WHO made a public call for experts to join the new Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago) last August. There will now be a two-week period of public consultation before the members are confirmed. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, says that while Covid-19 is ""the latest such virus, it will not be the lastâ. âUnderstanding where new pathogens come from is essential for preventing future outbreaks with epidemic and pandemic potential, and requires a broad range of expertise,"" he adds. Selected from over 700 applications, the 26 proposed Sago members have expertise in areas ranging from epidemiology to biosecurity and public health. They reflect âgeographic and gender diversityâ, says the WHO. With the highest number of daily cases since mid-July, the seven-day average for Covid cases in the UK now stands at 39,073 per day. The seven-day average for deaths, meanwhile, is 113 per day. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst There are reports today in Taiwanese media that mask wearing may be âphased outâ once 70% of the population has been fully vaccinated. According to the Taiwan News website, one mayor on the island has said they will ask Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre to relax existing restrictions once more than 70% of Taiwanâs population have received one vaccine dose. There are expectations that Taiwan will reach this milestone by the end of the month. Currently, Taiwan is following Level 2 restrictions in a four-tier system, where Level 1 is the least severe. Mask-wearing is largely enforced, but there are exceptions, such as in restaurants. Even in Level 1 restrictions, masks must still be worn at all times on public transport and in crowded public venues,according to Taiwanâs Central News Agency.,external This has led to some discussion recently about when people in Taiwan might be able to stop wearing masks altogether. The broadcaster SETN has quoted one toxicologist, Chao Ming-wei, as saying this will potentially by the spring. By this time, Taiwan will have hoped to fully vaccinate 70% of its 23.5m population. However, at present, only around 30% of the population have received two vaccine doses. Taiwan is currently somewhat free of Covid-19. Since the beginning of September, it has consistently only recorded single digit daily cases of the virus. No cases have been confirmed in the last 24 hours. The NHS Covid Pass app is working again, but it has come too late for one man who says it made him miss his flight because he was not able to prove his vaccination status. Chuck Adolphy, who's 24 and from Surrey, arrived at London's Gatwick Airport this morning, looking forward to a holiday in Slovenia. But when he attempted to show his Covid Pass on his phone to EasyJet staff, the app showed an error message. He tried showing his paper vaccination card but says the staff were ""having none of it"" - although he wasn't sure whether they were aware of the issues with the app at the time. Describing the situation as a ""shambles"", he tells the BBC he was turned away and missed his flight as a result. Chuck says the airline have refused to give him a refund so he's hoping to book a new flight tomorrow instead. In response, EasyJet said: âIf any passengers
were unable to board we will provide a free transfer to an alternative flight.
Whilst this is outside of our control we would like to apologise for any
inconvenience caused.â Here's what happened when the app went down. The NHS Covid Pass, used to prove vaccine status for travel and events, is up and running again after it stopped working earlier. At least one person says they missed their flight because of the problem,while others reported being ""stranded"" at an airport unable to fly. Today's figures show the number of new coronavirus infections in the UK are at their highest since July. There were42,776new casesrecorded in the last 24 hour,external. The last time the figure was higher than this was on 21 July when there were44,104new infections. Thedaily coronavirus data,externalfrom the government is out and it shows a further 42,776 new cases have been recorded in the UK. There have also been another 136 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Care homes in Wales are facing their worst crisis ""in living memory"", a leading industry figure says - with the sector left in a ""fragile state"" by the pandemic. Staffing levels are so low that homes could fill 20,000 vacancies within a week if people were available to work, says Mario Kreft, chairman of Care Forum Wales. He adds: ""We've got to find a mechanism to ensure that people are properly rewarded. ""Social care is a vital part of the foundation economy.

Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers to get goods to the ports. It has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic. A spokesman for the port of Rotterdam says: ""It's more to do with Covid than anything else because of the balance of empty and full containers being in the wrong place."" Which items are in short supply? Gary Grant, boss of one of the biggest toy sellers in the UK, The Entertainer, says Paw Patrol toys and Barbie dolls are ""prime candidates for being short in the Christmas season."" Steve Parks, director at Seaport Freight which deals with food shipments from overseas says: ""Things like coconut milk, frozen fish and carpets are being delayed from China."" What should you do? Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, says there is ""no need to panic buy"" but advises customers to start their normal shopping process earlier. ""If you see something you want, now is the time to buy as retailers have most of their Christmas stock, but we can't guarantee having supplies of everything over the next few weeks.""

person in Scotland has died as a result of an adverse effect of the Covid-19
jab, according to the National Records of Scotland (NRS). It brings the total number of deaths related to the Covid-19 vaccine up
to five, the NRS says. More than 4.2 million people in Scotland have been given at
least one dose of the vaccine. The five reported deaths are significantly fewer than the 11,262 people that have died because of Covid-19 in Scotland.
Last week, 126 fatalities in Scotland mentioned Covid-19 on the death
certificate. Vaccinations remain the best protection against Covid-19 and
the Department of Health and Social Care continues to urge the population to
get vaccinated. The UK Health Security
AgencyCoronavirus Dashboard,externalreports that more than 94 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been given in the
UK so far. Public Health Scotland advises that side effects to the
jab can be reported on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory

Coronavirus travel restrictions are affecting tourism in the UK more than most other countries across the world, according to new figures. The London-based World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) - which describes itself as a forum for the industry - is forecasting that spending by tourists visiting the UK will drop by nearly 50% this year compared to 2020. It makes the UK ""one of the worst performing countries in the world"", the organisation says. The WTTC says the travel and tourism sector's contribution to the UK's economy could rise year-on-year by about 32% in 2021 - roughly in line with the global average. But that's being driven in part by the increase in domestic holidays, and it is not enough for a full economic recovery - or to save millions of jobs - says the WTTC. Users trying to access their NHS Covid pass are receiving error messages The NHS Covid Pass, which is used to show a person's vaccination status for travel and events, has stopped working. The feature, contained in the NHS smartphone app, usually allows users to access a barcode or text records about which vaccine doses they have had. Instead, users are receiving error messages or a notice saying that high traffic volumes are ""limiting access to the service"". In a post on Twitter,external, NHS Digital says there are currently issues with accessing the Covid Pass on the NHS App and website and it is investigating. The digital pass can be used by those over 16 years old who were vaccinated in England, Wales or the Isle of Man. Read more. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has recorded no new domestic Covid-19 cases for the seventh consecutive day. State media are lauding this, because in recent weeks, there have been outbreaks in multiple provincial-level regions, including northwest Xinjiang, northeast Heilongjiang and southeast Fujian. These have been suppressed with swift lockdowns, and mass testing drives have helped identify asymptomatic carriers. There is currently only one area of China that has lockdowns in place: the northeast city of Harbin. However, vigilance is high in the country, as last week hundreds of millions of journeys were made for the annual Golden Week holiday (1-7 October). In two weeks time, tens of thousands of people are set to travel again - to Wuhan, the original epicentre of the coronavirus. The city will host the Wuhan Marathon on 24 October and is expected to see 26,000 runners. Organisers say free tickets for the event will be given to medical workers who helped on the front line during the early stages of the pandemic. Robert Gibbon (centre) died with Covid in December 2020 Yesterday, Wales' health minister apologised for her government's handling of the early stages of the pandemic, after a critical report from MPs. But some bereaved families say an apology is not enough and have called for a separate inquiry into the Welsh response to Covid. Rhianna Gibbon, from Merthyr Tydfil, lost her father Robert, 63, to Covid in December 2020, after he was sent home from hospital due to ""overrun"" corridors. She says lessons should have been learned for the second wave after the delay in introducing the first national lockdown. ""An apology is just not enough. My dad was just one of thousands of people who lost their lives unnecessarily,"" she tells BBC Radio Wales. ""I accept the apology, they've taken responsibility, but this is one of the biggest health issues ever. They [the government] should be held accountable.""

BBC Monitoring Russia is threatening to include British newspaper articles about itsSputnik V coronavirus vaccineon the âfake news"" section of its Foreign Ministry website unless they apologise. It wants papers to retract claims that Russian developers copied the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to create Sputnik V. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says: ""They still have a chance to save a semblance of dignity and respect for the reader and offer their apologies to the Russian developers of the vaccine."" The Russian Foreign Ministry's press office collects what it describes as âarticles circulating untrue information about Russia"". They include articles in the Western media about World War Two that Russia says amount to a ""falsification of history"", stories about the nerve agent poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, and what Russia calls the West's propaganda war on Russian vaccines. Earlier this week, UK Home Office minister Damian Hinds would not be drawn on allegations that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's design was used to create Russia's Sputnik V jab, instead saying more generally that ""state activity"" was involved in ""industrial espionage"". The number of people who died in Scotland last week was 30% higher than the average before the pandemic began.. There were 1,353 deaths - from all causes - registered in the week to 10 October, the National Records of Scotland said. It's 315 more than the average for that week from 2015 to 2019. It's also the highest rate of ""excess"" deaths since the first week of January. They include deaths caused by things like cancer, heart disease or dementia. The number of deaths where Covid was mentioned in registration has fallen for a second week, to 126. The number of deaths linked to the pandemic had been rising since mid-August, but appears to have peaked in the week ending 27 September at 167 - far below previous peaks during the initial outbreak of the virus and at the start of 2021.

Suranjana TewariBBC News Singapore's borders have effectively been closed for 21 months, so news that rules will finally be relaxed has sent residents rushing for a ticket out. From 19 October, vaccinated people can travel freely from Singapore to a dozen countries around the world - without quarantine and with fewer swab tests. By 15 November, another nine countries will be added to the list. ""The cabin fever was just driving us crazy. There's no demarcation between leisure and work here,"" Low Ka Wei, a corporate communications executive told the BBC. The demand for tickets was so great that travel websites crashed. The Singapore Airlines website went down over the weekend, causing a frenzy among eager travellers and leading to one Reddit thread asking: ""Did we just collectively break SIA's website?""

We meet staff at one of England's flagship hospitals, Addenbrooke's in Cambridge, as it gears up for what it expects to be its busiest winter ever. James Wheeler, divisional director of surgery and theatres, says the hospital is fortunate in being able to ring-fence beds in order to keep ""elective surgical patients safe"". He says: ""Any wait is painful to watch. All I can really reassure is that we are doing everything in our powers to get through the backlog patients."" Dr Joseph Newman, a respiratory registrar with Cambridge University Hospitals, tell us this hospital is vaccinating staff against flu and Covid to keep them both safe and in work. ""Staff shortages this time last year were a real issue, adding to the pressure even more, so I think trying to keep everyone fit and healthy is really important,"" he says. Roland Sinker, chief executive of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, says he is ""desperately sorry"" that people are having to wait at all.

"The wholesale price of gas has increased by 250% since January Russia has denied using energy as a political weapon, amid surging prices across Europe that have sent gas bills in many households skyrocketing. Russia, one of Europe's biggest natural gas providers, has been accused of intentionally withholding supplies. President Vladimir Putin said such claims were ""complete rubbish... and politically motivated tittle-tattle"". The European Commission has been outlining measures member states can take to combat rising prices. The wholesale price of gas has increased by 250% since January, triggering a knock-on spike in costs for consumers and businesses. Energy prices have hit record highs for various reasons, including high demand for natural gas as economies recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. EXPLAINED:Why are gas prices so high? ANALYSIS:Gas crisis leaves Europe searching for solutions President Putin said Russia was ready to provide more gas to Europe if requested Speaking at a Moscow energy forum on Wednesday, President Putin blamed the current crisis on Europe, saying that after a cold winter Europeans had not pumped sufficient volumes of gas into storage facilities. He said it was ""very important"" to ""suggest a long-term mechanism to stabilise the energy market"". Mr Putin stressed that Gazprom, Russia's gas giant, was supplying gas to Europe at maximum levels under existing contracts, and was ready to provide more if requested. ""We will increase by as much as our partners ask us. There is no refusal, none,"" he said. Europe's gas crisis has multiple causes: from a shortfall in renewable energy to low gas stocks after a cold winter. Plus, a surge in demand as countries emerge from the pandemic. But could another factor be Russia? In recent weeks Moscow has faced accusations that it has contributed to the crisis and forced gas prices higher by declining to supply additional gas to Europe. ""Politically motivated tittle-tattle,"" says President Putin. But the International Energy Agency believes Russia could do more to increase gas availability to Europe. Kremlin critics suspect it is using the crisis to fast track European approval for Russia's controversial new pipeline. When European regulators sign the paperwork, Nord Stream 2 will carry natural gas from Russia to Germany, bypassing Ukraine. Opponents of the pipeline believe it is a political project designed to increase Europe's dependency on Russian energy. Supporters insist it will provide Europe with a cheaper and more efficient supply of gas. On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin insisted Nord Stream 2 was ""a commercial project"". That was followed by a not so subtle hint. The president said he was ""100% certain"" that if the pipeline was functioning, that would ease Europe's energy problems. Earlier on Wednesday, the European Commission's energy chief, Kadri Simson, said the EU's executive was responding to calls for urgent action by unveiling an ""energy price toolbox"". The toolbox outlines steps member states can take to reduce energy bills in their countries without breaching EU law. It mostly confirms the measures national governments can already use, but considers what more the Commission can do. Ms Simson said member states were best placed to ease the burden of rising energy prices as winter approaches. She urged them to consider emergency income support for vulnerable households, state aid for companies, and targeted tax reductions. She also advised member states to temporarily pause bill payments where necessary, and put in place safeguards to avoid disconnections from the grid. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... the UK's rising energy bills ""Rising global energy prices are a serious concern for the EU,"" Ms Simson said. ""As we emerge from the pandemic and begin our economic recovery, it is important to protect vulnerable consumers and support European companies."" On top of those measures, Ms Simson said the Commission would look into the possible benefits of EU countries jointly buying natural gas. She said countries could collectively buy gas to form a strategic reserve. But, like the joint scheme to buy Covid vaccines, participation would be voluntary. The idea was proposed recently by governments that want more EU intervention, such as Spain. All member states were encouraged to use the EU's â¬750bn (Â£636bn; $867bn) Covid-19 recovery fund to invest in clean energy to meet the bloc's climate targets. ""We are not facing a surge because of our climate policy,"" Ms Simson said. ""Fossil fuel prices are spiking. We need to speed up the green transition, not slow it down.""

"The UK economy grew by 0.4% in August as more people dined out, went on holiday and attended music festivals. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the services sector made the biggest contribution to economic growth in the first full month after all Covid restrictions were lifted in England. It said arts, entertainment and recreation grew 9%, boosted by sports clubs, amusement parks and festivals. There was also more demand for hotels and campsites. Restrictions on social distancing were eased from 19 July. The ONS said the economy is now 0.8% smaller than it was before the pandemic. ""The economy picked up in August as bars, restaurants and festivals benefited from the first full month without Covid-19 restrictions in England,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""However, later and slightly weaker data from a number of industries now mean we estimate the economy fell a little overall in July."" The ONS said economic growth fell by 0.1% in July compared with initial estimates of 0.1% growth. Activity in accommodation and food services rose by 10.3% in August, within which hotels and campsites recorded 22.9% growth. In travel, air transport and rail both grew in August as Covid-related measures eased, however both industry are still trading far below pre-pandemic levels. Emma-Lou Montgomery associate director at Fidelity International, said that while August's growth ""marks a small rebound"" on July, ""the worry remains that economic growth won't even be in touching distance of pre-pandemic levels until well into next year"". She said supply chain disruption risks dampening consumer confidence. ""This all comes in the crucial lead up to Christmas, when suppliers and retailers should be firing on all cylinders,"" Ms Montgomery said.""But with households facing steep price rises for everyday items, from the food shop through to the gas bill, there will be little desire - or capacity - to spend, spend, spend."" Growth in the economy - everything produced, from new cars to haircuts to restaurant meals - isn't at all slow by normal standards at 0.4% in a month. But we're supposed to be bouncing back with growth of 7% this year. What's becoming increasingly clear, is that it's not a lack of demand for goods and services that's holding the recovery back but the inability of firms to supply that demand. A big part of the reason? Shortages. In construction, for example, where business is not growing but shrinking, firms reported to the ONS that they've got healthy order books. But they can't meet more orders, partly because of a shortage of materials in August (for example, wood and steel) and partly because of a shortage of skilled staff. The ONS reports evidence that the shortage of haulage drivers is slowing down industries from pharmaceuticals to electric lighting. Exports of goods, too, are down by 13% compared with 2018. Some of these shortages may be due to supply bottlenecks related to the post-pandemic global surge in activity. But without doubt some, notably the ongoing shortage of lorry drivers, are in large part related to Brexit. Elsewhere, economic growth was uneven with some sectors hit by shortages of materials. Output in construction fell by 0.2% in August and the sector remains 1.5% below pre-pandemic levels. The ONS said: ""This reflects recent challenges faced by the construction industry from rising input prices and delays to the availability of construction products - notably steel, concrete, timber and glass."" The manufacturing sector expanded by 0.5% in August following a 0.6% in July. The ONS said growth was led by an increase in vehicle production ""as it continues to recover following supply side challenges predominantly caused by the global microchip shortage disrupting car production"". But it said the output in the manufacture of motor vehicles remains 14.5% below a peak in February this year. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""Such drags may have become more widespread and significant in September and October, with the fuel crisis preventing some people from getting to work."" He said Capital Economics' activity indicator ""suggests that GDP may not have increased at all in September"". Martin Beck, economist at professional services firm, EY,said: ""The recovery is certainly facing more headwinds. ""Rising inflation, driven by significant increases in energy prices, and the recent cut in Universal Credit are squeezing consumers' spending power.""

"Fu Jiayuan said she would quit the entertainment industry A young girl in China has apologised for ""deceiving fans"" after trying to join a boy band. Fu Jiayuan, 13, said she lied about her gender to a popular management company because she was ""young and ignorant"". Even though she was only part of YGN Youth Club's boot camp and not an official band member, fans could watch her training videos on social media. Many YGN Youth Club fans were amused by the revelation, and said it was ""not a big deal."" But Ms Fu, who was forced to admit the deception after an internet user pointed out that she is a girl, said she would now quit the entertainment industry. ""I'm sorry to everyone who put their trust in me,"" she wrote in a statement earlier this week. ""I promise I will not show up in the entertainment industry or on any video platforms in the future."" YGN Youth Club only recruits young boys, most aged between 11 and 13. A challenging programme trains them in song and dance techniques and moulds them into future idols. The company said the mistake happened because auditions had been held online due to the pandemic. ""Our staff were negligent in the work process... In the future, we will adhere strictly to the company's rules and regulations,"" it said in a statement. Many fans have come to Ms Fu's defence, however, and jokingly compared her to the Chinese folk heroine Mulan. According to legend, Mulan was a young woman who disguised herself as a man so that she could fight to save her family and country. The story is known globally after it was turned into a Disney film. ""The look of idol groups is so androgynous these days, so it's hard to tell. Just let her join,"" read a popular comment on the microblogging platform Weibo. Boy bands are a massive industry in China (pictured: popular group TFBoys, who made their debuts aged 12 and 13) Boot camps like YGN Youth Club's are widely sought-after because families see it as a chance for their children to become rich and famous. A study titled the ""White paper on idol industry and fan economy in 2019,external"" estimated that China's idol market would reach 100 billion Yuan ($15b; Â£11b) by 2020. The group TFBoys, for example, who made their showbiz debut in 2013 when the members were 12 and 13, have since become household names. But the management companies behind young bands have sometimes been criticised for taking advantage of young children for commercial gain. In recent months,China has intensified its crackdown on the entertainment industryand said it will ban what the national broadcaster described as ""effeminate"" styles and ""vulgar influencers"" in programmes.

"We all knew it was coming, but now it's official: Squid Game has become Netflix's biggest ever series launch. The Korean drama was watched by 111 million users in its first 28 days, knocking Bridgerton (82 million) off the top spot. Netflix counts a view as anyone who's watched two minutes of an episode. Netflix's vice president for content in Korea, South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand says the show's success is ""beyond our wildest dreams"". Minyoung Kim told CNN: ""When we first started investing in Korean series and films in 2015, we knew we wanted to make world-class stories for the core K-content fans across Asia and the world. ""Today, Squid Game has broken through beyond our wildest dreams."" The nine-part series, which debuted in September, tells the story of a group of misfits taking part in a series of children's playground games. There's a prize of 45.6bn Korean won (Â£28m) up for grabs, which doesn't sound too bad until you realise if you lose, you get killed. Squid Game subtitles 'change meaning of the show' Why 26 Korean words have been added to the dictionary From celebrities to sports stars, everyone's been talking about Squid Game. The show's actors have shot to international fame - Jung Ho-yeon, who plays Sae-byeok, has gained 14 million Instagram followers since it launched on 17 September,Forbes says,external. So what's the secret to the drama's success? Warning - the rest of this article contains some mild spoilers... Similar in some ways to The Hunger Games, or the 2000 movie Battle Royale, the show focuses on a group of people in South Korea desperately in debt. They're first tricked (then volunteer) into playing a deadly tournament of children's games, realising this may be their only chance to win the money they need to survive. Chloe Henry is a fan of Korean shows and says Squid Game stands out from the others. ""It's not something that's been done before,"" the 26-year-old from Sheffield tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""With other shows, you can guess what's going to happen whereas this one is more 'wow' - a shock that you weren't expecting."" Chloe feels the actors did a great job in keeping the audience hooked She feels the characters and intense acting keep you connected to the show. ""The actor who plays Seong Gi-hun, his emotion was so raw and it was so interesting to watch."" Seong Gi-hun is a loveable gambling addict with huge debts and facing the loss of his daughter. He's the show's main character. Chloe says the drama also gives viewers a different perception of South Korea. ""People in general think of South Korea as a big flash country with a lot of rich people, so it's nice to see the other side that is not really spoken about, like the struggle and poverty.""

As in the Oscar-winning Korean film, Parasite, the hardship seen in Squid Game is what makes it appealing to an international audience, says Dr Hye-Kyung Lee - who's researching the rise of K-drama and K-pop at King's College London. ""These dramas or films are entertaining, and they have something unique which can strike a chord with people around the world.

Squid Game: How one Netflix show gripped the world 'This sign will not lead you to Squid Game' Dr Lee says other Korean dramas do touch on issues of society, economy and politics, but Squid Game has been far more direct in its approach. ""It's serious, the message is extreme and I think that reflects what's happening right now."" The violence, which means the show's not recommended for anyone under the age of 15, is part of Squid Game's appeal for Chloe.

"Luna has scored a victory for oat milk drinkers after convincing Lidl to recall a batch of the drink A Scottish TikToker has won a victory against one of the UK's biggest food retailers after using her platform to campaign for a batch of ""lumpy"" oat milk to be removed. Luna, known as @lunahtic, wanted Lidl to act on her concerns about its oat milk, and after a one-woman campaign, succeeded in having it recalled. Her videos highlighting the problem won millions of views. Lidl has now recalled all its oat milk with a use-by date in the next year. It said fresh batches would be available in stores soon. The 23-year-old student started monitoring the Lidl Just Free oat milk situation in August when she noticed a carton she had purchased was ""lumpy"" and ""smelly"". In one video, Luna put the Lidl milk through a blender after comments from followers which suggested the milk just needed ""a good shake"" ""It's good milk and I've used it for years,"" she said. ""I use four cartons every week and I had bought a big batch of it with the sell by date of 2022. But I noticed when I opened it it was full of lumps and really smelly. ""I thought it was just the one carton but tried a few more and they were all like that. On 15 August I contacted Lidl HQ and asked for a refund for the Â£11.20 I had spent on the milk. ""They never gave me a refund, but said their quality assurance team were looking into it. This went on for ages and I eventually got a refund for one carton."" By this point, Luna was concerned that the milk was still on sale. She took toher TikTok account,externalto vent her frustration. ""Lots of people agreed with me and it got lots of views. But some people said I was storing it wrong, or it was lumps of oat, or I just needed to shake the carton, so I kept going back to buy the milk to show that it was off."" One of her videos went viral, racking up more than three million views in just a few days. To illustrate her concern, she dashes into the store, buys the milk and then pours out the carton outside to show the lumps. She filmed herself cleaning up the mess afterwards. Luna recorded an uncut video to illustrate her point Luna said: ""I did it to hopefully prove to people who were sceptical. Across the country people were tagging me in their videos of this milk and I thought they shouldn't be selling that."" The oat milk mission continued, with Luna contacting Lidl again. She was sent Â£50 in vouchers for the store as a gesture to say the company was taking her concerns seriously, which she spent on items for afood bank,external. More TikTok videos followed and more calls to Lidl HQ. Luna said she was told that the product would not be recalled because it was ""not a health hazard"". The next step was to refer the issue to her local environmental health department. They agreed to investigate. However, Monday brought a breakthrough - Luna revealed to her 57,000 followers that she had been sent paperwork which suggested the milk was finally being removed from stores. An employee sent Luna a recall notice dated 6 October One Lidl employee sent her a recall notice and gave her permission to share it. She said: ""This document shows that all Lidl oat milk in the UK up to the date stated on the letter has to be recalled. ""I spoke to my local Lidl store manager who did tell me the oat milk had been recalled. I was told that new batches of the same oat milk will be back on the shelves really soon and you can guarantee I'll be first in line."" Then, on Tuesday, her report to her local authority environmental health team brought results. The reply said that they had spoken to colleagues at the London Borough of Bexley, which is the primary authority for Lidl UK stores, and they would look into the complaints. Luna compared different brands Lidl told the local authority: ""Our latest oat milk withdrawal was last Wednesday which was sent to all regions. This was due to a number of complaints we had relating to the product being lumpy/white floating bits. Was confirmed not to be a health and safety risk."" A spokesman for Lidl told the BBC on Tuesday: ""At Lidl, it is never our intention for a customer to be dissatisfied in any way and we work very closely with our suppliers to ensure that the products in our stores are of the highest possible quality. ""Following customer feedback we have recalled the affected batch and the product will be back in stores very soon."" Luna said she was delighted her efforts had paid off. ""It's not very often you can get the attention of big company to do things and it might seem like a small thing but a lot of people had experienced the same issue.""

"This video can not be played Kerry Roberts and Tammy Kirkwood shared their experiences at an emotional meeting A mum whose daughter died after taking ecstasy has struck up an ""unlikely"" friendship with the mother of the teenager who supplied the fatal drug. Kerry Roberts' daughter Leah Heyes, 15, collapsed after taking MDMA supplied by Connor Kirkwood. After agreeing to meet his mother, Tammy, Ms Roberts said she realised both had ""lost something"" as a result of the drug. They are campaigning together to raise drugs awareness among young people. Leah died in May 2019 after she took the Class A drug with a group of friends in a car park in Northallerton, North Yorkshire. The drugs were brought into the town by Connor, then 17, with another boy, Mitchell Southern, handing them over to Leah. Connor, from Dishforth, was jailed for 21 months last yearbut was released after serving six months of his sentence. The mothers were introduced to each other through restorative justice - a process in which victims of crime can meet those who committed the offence against them. Although Ms Roberts did not want to meet Connor, it was suggested that by meeting his mother they would be able to share and understand each other's stories. Kerry Roberts said she and daughter Leah had the ""best relationship"" It gave Ms Kirkwood the opportunity to explain how she had been struggling for years to get help for Connor. He had become involved in county lines gangs, which target vulnerable teenagers and use them to supply drugs. Ms Roberts said: ""People will look at us and think it's an unlikely friendship. ""People will see us as two separate things but we are both grieving. They are both our children."" Connor Kirkwood and Mitchell Southern both admitted supplying ecstasy and were jailed last year Ms Kirkwood described how, from the age of 15, Connor went from being a ""presentable young man"" to ""wearing trackies and not speaking to anyone"". She knew he was involved in drugs and had reported him to police, but when questioned he would refuse to give any information about the gangs. UK warning over different drugs in identical pills How social media is being used to sell drugs Despite police involvement and her constant requests for help, Ms Kirkwood said they were never offered a drug referral or other support. She said she had struggled with ""guilt and shame"" over whether she could have prevented Leah's death. ""I thought where have I gone wrong? How did this happen? What did I do?"" she said. ""And there's the guilt of my child being involved in someone else's child losing their life. ""I lost the child that had a passion for sport, was always smiling. I don't see a smile anymore. ""I have this 19-year-old man. I don't know who he is. I get to see him in bed and why do I get that? ""That's my guilt because that's not fair."" Leah's mum said they had spoken about drugs together but neither of them had heard of MDMA Leah's mum, who described her daughter as her ""best friend"" said she had felt ""a lot of hatred"" and was initially against the meeting. ""There was hatred for Connor, for the situation. I thought how is it going to do me any good? I have nothing to say to her,"" she said. But she said hearing the other side of the story had helped ease those emotions. ""I've read about county lines and there's more of an understanding and I'm thinking he was a child, he was 15. He wasn't a 21-year-old dodgy drug dealer. ""I get how my friends and my family were like: 'why are you meeting her?', but I think it's done us both some good."" She added: ""People who didn't know Leah would probably think she came from a rough family, that her mum didn't care. ""People have their own thoughts and I had those thoughts about Connor's mum. I didn't realise the story."" The two mothers said they had both been affected by the devastating impact of the drug Both women are working together on a campaign called Do You Know MDMA? to get the message out that drugs kill. Ms Roberts has also launched a petition urging the government to make supplying drugs to under-16s a specific criminal offence. She said: ""I feel like if we've told our story and tried to educate people then we can't do much more. ""Leah died and I can't let that be for no reason.""

"This video can not be played The MS Romantika arrives in Scotland to provide accommodation for the COP26 conference The first of two cruise ships that will provide accommodation for people attending the COP26 summit has arrived in Scotland. The Latvian-flagged Romantika has berthed at King George V dock, next to Braehead Shopping Centre in Renfrew. A second vessel, the MS Silja Europa, will arrive from Estonia in the coming days. Up to 25,000 government representatives, media and campaigners are expected to be in Glasgow. Concerns have been raised about the cost and availability of accommodation in the city for the climate summit, which takes place from 31 October until 12 November. Paavo NÃµgene, chief executive of the ship owner Tallink, described the decision to bring a second ship to Scotland as a ""last-minute agreement"". Scots urged to open up their homes to attendees 'Why I am giving up my home to climate activists' What is the Glasgow climate conference and why is it important? Each member of the United Nations has been invited to Glasgow, meaning nearly 120 heads of state are expected to attend along with around 20,000 accredited delegates. Last Friday, it emerged Pope Francis will not travel to Scotland but US President Joe Biden has said he is ""anxious"" to be there and the Queen has confirmed she will attend. Meanwhile, BBC Scotland has found evidence that a squeeze on available accommodation has sent prices soaring in Glasgow. One room in the city advertised as Â£42 per night on Monday is being advertised as costing Â£1,400 per night during the summit. Fiona Hooker, of the Stop Climate Chaos Scotland campaign, said the cost and availability of accommodation was ""a huge concern"" for activists attending the summit. She said: ""It's incredible that they can charge so much. ""What people are looking for is a place to stay with a local person and the chance to feel part of the event."" Delegates will take shuttle buses between the King George V dock and the summit venue at the Scottish Event Campus Restaurateur and property owner Charan Gill, who became known as Glasgow's ""Curry King"" and is one of the country's top entrepreneurs, called the practice ""opportunistic"". He told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime with John Beattie that he would not increase rents because it was damaging to the city's reputation. ""Sometimes you have to pay a premium,"" he said. ""But there has to be some sort of moral compass where we say surely this is wrong. ""You will not live off this money forever - fine, you might make an extra few hundred or thousand pounds here and there. At the end of the day you have to go back to your normal people, your normal market, your normal tenants who keep your bread buttered."" Airbnb told the BBC they would donate all revenue from stays in Glasgow during the summit to Zero Waste Scotland. A spokesperson said: ""We are offering Glaswegians an incentive to start hosting in an effort to provide more accommodation during a unique event and to address a significant accommodation shortage. ""The expected attendance for COP26 is double that of local hotel capacity and hosting helps cities like Glasgow use existing space to scale up and welcome major events."" Nearly 700 households havesigned up to the COP26 Homestay Network. Operated by the third sector, the initiative is asking people to open their doors and provide affordable or free accommodation to COP26 attendees. But Jillian Evans, the head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, told BBC Scotland she had some concerns about this plan. She said: ""People coming from different parts of the world, some where the vaccination programme is not the same as ours, there are risks associated with that. ""Then you put people in touch with one another, in folk's homes, and that increases the risk even more."" A COP26 spokesperson told the BBC: ""As hosts of COP26 it is of huge importance to the UK there are a wide range accommodation options available which suit the requirement of delegates attending from around the world. ""We have been working with our hotel provider, MCI, to make sure this is the case."" The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"The UK economy grew by 0.4% in August as more people dined out, went on holiday and attended music festivals. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the services sector made the biggest contribution to economic growth in the first full month after all Covid restrictions were lifted in England. It said arts, entertainment and recreation grew 9%, boosted by sports clubs, amusement parks and festivals. There was also more demand for hotels and campsites. Restrictions on social distancing were eased from 19 July. The ONS said the economy is now 0.8% smaller than it was before the pandemic. ""The economy picked up in August as bars, restaurants and festivals benefited from the first full month without Covid-19 restrictions in England,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""However, later and slightly weaker data from a number of industries now mean we estimate the economy fell a little overall in July."" The ONS said economic growth fell by 0.1% in July compared with initial estimates of 0.1% growth. Activity in accommodation and food services rose by 10.3% in August, within which hotels and campsites recorded 22.9% growth. In travel, air transport and rail both grew in August as Covid-related measures eased, however both industry are still trading far below pre-pandemic levels. Emma-Lou Montgomery associate director at Fidelity International, said that while August's growth ""marks a small rebound"" on July, ""the worry remains that economic growth won't even be in touching distance of pre-pandemic levels until well into next year"". She said supply chain disruption risks dampening consumer confidence. ""This all comes in the crucial lead up to Christmas, when suppliers and retailers should be firing on all cylinders,"" Ms Montgomery said.""But with households facing steep price rises for everyday items, from the food shop through to the gas bill, there will be little desire - or capacity - to spend, spend, spend."" Growth in the economy - everything produced, from new cars to haircuts to restaurant meals - isn't at all slow by normal standards at 0.4% in a month. But we're supposed to be bouncing back with growth of 7% this year. What's becoming increasingly clear, is that it's not a lack of demand for goods and services that's holding the recovery back but the inability of firms to supply that demand. A big part of the reason? Shortages. In construction, for example, where business is not growing but shrinking, firms reported to the ONS that they've got healthy order books. But they can't meet more orders, partly because of a shortage of materials in August (for example, wood and steel) and partly because of a shortage of skilled staff. The ONS reports evidence that the shortage of haulage drivers is slowing down industries from pharmaceuticals to electric lighting. Exports of goods, too, are down by 13% compared with 2018. Some of these shortages may be due to supply bottlenecks related to the post-pandemic global surge in activity. But without doubt some, notably the ongoing shortage of lorry drivers, are in large part related to Brexit. Elsewhere, economic growth was uneven with some sectors hit by shortages of materials. Output in construction fell by 0.2% in August and the sector remains 1.5% below pre-pandemic levels. The ONS said: ""This reflects recent challenges faced by the construction industry from rising input prices and delays to the availability of construction products - notably steel, concrete, timber and glass."" The manufacturing sector expanded by 0.5% in August following a 0.6% in July. The ONS said growth was led by an increase in vehicle production ""as it continues to recover following supply side challenges predominantly caused by the global microchip shortage disrupting car production"". But it said the output in the manufacture of motor vehicles remains 14.5% below a peak in February this year. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""Such drags may have become more widespread and significant in September and October, with the fuel crisis preventing some people from getting to work."" He said Capital Economics' activity indicator ""suggests that GDP may not have increased at all in September"". Martin Beck, economist at professional services firm, EY,said: ""The recovery is certainly facing more headwinds. ""Rising inflation, driven by significant increases in energy prices, and the recent cut in Universal Credit are squeezing consumers' spending power.""

"Restocking popular Barbie dolls is likely to be a problem, says The Entertainer. One of the UK's biggest toy retailers is warning delays at UK ports will result in shortages this Christmas. Gary Grant, boss of The Entertainer, said it would get harder to get stock to the right places at the right time. Barbie dolls and Paw Patrol toys are among the children's favourites he expects to run out fast. The government said that Felixstowe had reported ""improved capacity over the past few days"". A container logjam at ports, including Felixstowe, and a shortage of HGV lorry drivers has sparked widespread concern among retailers about future stocks. Mr Grant said his 170 shops are looking ""very full right now"". But he added that demand ""will outstrip availability"" because there aren't enough drivers to move the company's stock. ""There'll never be toy shops with no toys. There will be toy shops without all the toys that they would normally expect to have due to the shortages, and that is largely down to transportation and warehouse issues, rather than there being a shortage of toys."" Port delays: 'We've run out of Harry Potter stock' Biggest UK commercial port hit by container logjam Why is there an HGV driver shortage? The shortage of drivers means that shipment containers are being offloaded but left stacked on the quayside waiting for collection. The dearth of drivers also means there is a delay in returning empty containers for re-use. The problems come at the busiest time of the year for retailers, when most goods are imported from Asia to sell during Christmas trading. Thomas O'Brien, managing director of Leeds-based toy designer Boxer Gifts, which manufacturers its products in China, said there's ""plenty of stock"" but the real problem is that ""everything takes longer and is horrendously more expensive"" which means the company ""will be struggling to keep price increases to anything lower than 10%"". Items that are in short supply include a sloth soft toy and the moody cow stress ball. ""Ironically the moody cow which we're short of is almost a nice acronym for how feel at the moment,"" he added. The 'Moody Cow' stress ball is in short supply at the moment. While there are alternative toys, Mr O'Brien said the firm has lost six weeks of ""planning time"" to be able to re-stock at short notice. He said containers shipped from Qingdao, China to Felixstowe are costing him $15,000 (Â£11,003) rather than the normal rate of $2,500 in 2020. Entrepreneur Jack Griffiths, co-founder of loungewear company Snuggy, said he is expecting containers on five different ships, holdings Â£1m worth of Christmas items, to arrive over the next week but they will now be delayed by three weeks. ""We're seasonal and we have to make the most of these months, 80% of our turnover comes from October to February."" In November, the business usually takes Â£500,000 worth of sales which Mr Griffiths said he ""probably won't be able to get in if we don't get that stock in time"". The company has already run out of the SnuggyPod product which was due to arrive two weeks ago. Mr Griffiths said the product ""probably won't arrive for three weeks at Felixstowe and then it'll take three weeks to get them out of the port due to the driver issues"". He added that because the SnuggyPod is the firm's original design, there aren't any alternatives. ""As the weeks go by I can only see it getting worse which is just something we don't want to think about"". Mr Griffiths anticipates he will have to get products shipped by railway and air rather than sea. It comes after Â£400,000 worth of his stock was delayed earlier in the year when it got stuck on the Ever Given ship which blocked the Suez Canal. Mr Griffiths said that because the SnuggyPod is an original design, there aren't any alternatives. Steve Parks, director at Seaport Freight which deals with food shipments from overseas as well as other goods, says moving products from Rotterdam port to Felixstowe is delaying goods by two to three weeks. ""So things like coconut milk, frozen fish and carpets are being delayed from China."" While Mr Parks said Britain's shortfall in HGV drivers is ""largely"" to blame for the congestion at the port, other countries are experiencing problems, including the US and China. ""This is absolutely the worst period I have known, ever,"" he said. ""We can't get space on ships coming out of the Far East."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said that fluctuating capacity at ports ""has been exacerbated by the ongoing global container and HGV driver shortages"". ""All ports across the UK remain open to shipping lines with Felixstowe reporting improved capacity over the past few days and the government continues to work closely with the freight industry, to tackle the challenges faced by some ports this autumn,"" the spokesperson said. Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said there was ""no need to panic buy"" but advised customers to start their normal shopping process earlier. ""If you see something you want, now is the time to buy as retailers have most of their Christmas stock, but we can't guarantee having supplies of everything over the next few weeks"". ""It's a challenge for small retailers because they don't have the cash to stockpile,"" he added. The UK's biggest commercial port Felixstowe told the BBC that it currently had 50,000 containers which were waiting to be collected, due to a shortage of HGV lorry drivers. Officials at the port have asked the shipping lines to reduce their empty container stocks as ""quickly as possible"". ""It's not the port of Felixstowe affecting the supply chain, it's the supply chain affecting the port of Felixstowe,"" it said, adding that the problems are ""similar at all major UK ports"". Danish shipping giant Maersk has been forcedto divert some of its larger ships from Felixstowe to ports in the Netherlands and Belgium to avoid delays. Smaller ships are then transporting the goods to the UK. A spokesman for the port of Rotterdam said it has been busy over the last couple of weeks, but said: ""It's more to do with Covid than anything else because of the balance of empty and full containers being in the wrong place."" The pandemic is also being blamed in part for bottlenecks at US ports. President Joe Biden will meet with major US retailers as well as the bosses of ports on Wednesday to address the issues. Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chief executive Dubai-based DP World, the global logistics giant which operates out of Southampton and London Gateway, said ""nobody knows how long it's going to take"" to resolve the congestion and shipping container shortages. ""I think it's going to take a long time,"" he said, adding: ""The problem is complicated because you have a backlog of cargo."" The UK Ports Association trade group, said most UK ports were operating normally but that the shortage of drivers meant ""some delays"". ""This has meant that some freight is not being collected as rapidly as it would normally. The situation is impacting all types of ports, not just container terminals. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers. It has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit and a backlog of HGV driver tests. The government recently drafted in military personnel to help with the driver shortages and deliver fuel. Emergency temporary visas have also been issued to foreign drivers. Conservative Party chair Oliver Dowden told the BBC that the government was increasing the number of people having tests and that he would ""expect that number to increase as we approach Christmas"". Asked about potential Christmas shortages, he told Sky news: ""The situation is improving, I'm confident that people will be able to get their toys for Christmas.""

"Sixteen arrests were made at junction 31 of the M25 in Essex, near the Dartford Crossing and Lakeside shopping centre Angry motorists confronted Insulate Britain activists who blocked traffic on two roads in the latest in a series of protests. Essex Police arrested 35 people at two locations, including at an M25 junction to the east of London. Officers detained 16 people after being called to a slip road at junction 31 for Thurrock, just after 08:25 BST. Police then arrested 19 people after reports of a further blockade nearby at Stonehouse Lane, Purfleet. On what was a 13th day of protests by the group in the past five weeks, the M25 slip road blockage, near the Dartford Crossing, led to many HGV drivers turning around, causing clashes between protesters and angry motorists. Lorry drivers blasted their horns and multiple confrontations occurred, with one protester nearly run over after stopping in front of a blue Hyundai car, whose frustrated driver called out ""this is stupidity"". Motorists ripped banners out of the hands of demonstrators as they sat or lay down in the road while other protesters glued themselves to the carriageway. Essex Police removed the protesters and said all the affected roads had reopened by lunchtime The force said it had been working to resolve the situation ""quickly and safely"" Some members of the group were repeatedly dragged off the road by drivers who were pulling on their clothes and backpacks, but they returned to their spots and sat down again. Some HGV drivers warned that the protests could cause fuel supply problems as tankers would be unable to reach filling stations.

"Graffiti in the loyalist Sandy row area of Belfast. Unionists say businesses in NI are being affected by the Irish Sea trade border The European Commission will later bring forward its much-anticipated proposals for resolving problems with the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed in 2019 to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, but that creates a trade border for some products travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Unionists say this undermines their place in the UK, but also creates fundamental problems for Northern Ireland firms. EU to offer fewer NI border checks on British goods BBC News NI has spoken to a number of businesses across Northern Ireland which say they have been affected by the protocol. Andrew Lynas, of Lynas Foodservice, says scrapping the Northern Ireland Protocol is not the answer, but solutions are needed Andrew Lynas - Lynas Foodservice, County Londonderry The Coleraine-base company says it has had to employ two people to specifically deal with protocol-related paperwork as well as find alternative suppliers. It delivers to more than 5,000 catering customers across the UK and Ireland. Mr Lynas believes labour shortages, particularly with Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) drivers in Great Britain, means many businesses in England, Scotland and Wales may ""cut their losses"" and reduce trade with businesses in Northern Ireland. ""We've probably had to say goodbye to about 20 different suppliers, "" he says. ""We've been able to find some alternatives on the island, and some in Europe but for some we haven't been able to find alternatives. ""There's just a lot of hassle and complexity and when you talk to a supplier in GB, they don't fully understand all the bits of that paperwork."" Mr Lynas believes scrapping the Northern Ireland Protocol ""isn't the answer"" but says a workable solution needs to be found. Eamon McKey, chief operating officer with Deli Lites, says the protocol has produced opportunities and challenges Eamon McKey - Deli Lites, County Down Eamon McKey, chief operating officer with County Down-based Deli Lites, says 70% of its business is delivered to the Republic of Ireland, and the prospect of a hard border on the island was the company's ""greatest concern"". He says the protocol has produced new opportunities for the firm. ""We welcomed the protocol as resolving the land border issue for us,"" he says. He says he believes more people are now shopping locally, and Deli Lites has won a number of accounts that were previously serviced by competitors in Great Britain. However, challenges include a loss of some of the firm's suppliers in Great Britain. ""There are ongoing threats to our GB supply chain,"" he says. Mr McKey says that, on one occasion, one of its suppliers lost ""valuable"" produce because of delays due to temperature checks during shipping. ""This has impacted on our service to our customer and we are waiting on a replacement delivery,"" he adds. ""That type of incident is likely to further restrict GB supply into Northern Ireland. We do see opportunities, but we also have had problems."" John McGuinness, Garden Depot, County Tyrone, says he's had trouble getting Christmas tree supplies John McGuinness - Garden Depot, County Tyrone The Strabane-based garden firm is struggling to stock Christmas trees for the upcoming festive season. Mr McGuiness sells about 600 Christmas trees each December, the majority of which in previous pre-Brexit years have been sourced from suppliers in Scotland. But that's not the case this year. Mr McGuinness says trees coming from Great Britain are now subject to ""protocols, customs and paperwork"" that complicates a process that had worked well before the UK and EU parted ways. A product like Christmas trees have a limited shelf life, he says, and any process that delays their delivery is not good for business. ""You only have a certain amount of time from when you cut a tree until it gets to someone's house and before it dies, so all of that has to be taken into consideration,"" he says. Larger stores than his that also sell trees are in a similar position, he adds, and businesses are looking to get trees from local suppliers. That means ""there's less trees available and the price has gone up as well"", he says. ""I think we will get them, maybe not all the quantity, or all the different sizes that we would normally get, but we will be grateful to get what we do get."" Michael and Lesley Cairnduff of Oscar Pet Foods say they've experienced increased red tape Michael and Lesley Cairnduff - Oscar Pet Foods, County Down The Cairnduffs are the local nutritional advisers for Oscar Pet Foods in County Down, and have been providing a home delivery service for pet food and supplies for more than 25 years. The company's head office is in Lancashire. Mrs Cairnduff says their shipping costs have more than doubled in the first six months of this year compared to the same period in 2020. ""The first six months of this year were extremely worrying,"" says her husband. He says the amount of administration time that head office now spends on Northern Ireland has increased by a factor of 50. ""For us here, it's gone up, our delivery work, the paperwork and red tape, by a factor of about 10. Obviously we'd prefer to spend that on customer service and marketing, and not using it for the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" he adds. Mrs Cairnduff says food pallets coming from England are now taking 10-12 days, whereas it would have taken about four days pre-Brexit. She says the EU should repurpose thetrusted trader scheme,,externalas they can prove they don't sell any of their produce on to the EU. ""If that was put in place, it would make life a lot simpler for us. Treat us the same as our counterparts in England are being treated,"" she says.

"Restocking popular Barbie dolls is likely to be a problem, says The Entertainer. One of the UK's biggest toy retailers is warning delays at UK ports will result in shortages this Christmas. Gary Grant, boss of The Entertainer, said it would get harder to get stock to the right places at the right time. Barbie dolls and Paw Patrol toys are among the children's favourites he expects to run out fast. The government said that Felixstowe had reported ""improved capacity over the past few days"". A container logjam at ports, including Felixstowe, and a shortage of HGV lorry drivers has sparked widespread concern among retailers about future stocks. Mr Grant said his 170 shops are looking ""very full right now"". But he added that demand ""will outstrip availability"" because there aren't enough drivers to move the company's stock. ""There'll never be toy shops with no toys. There will be toy shops without all the toys that they would normally expect to have due to the shortages, and that is largely down to transportation and warehouse issues, rather than there being a shortage of toys."" Port delays: 'We've run out of Harry Potter stock' Biggest UK commercial port hit by container logjam Why is there an HGV driver shortage? The shortage of drivers means that shipment containers are being offloaded but left stacked on the quayside waiting for collection. The dearth of drivers also means there is a delay in returning empty containers for re-use. The problems come at the busiest time of the year for retailers, when most goods are imported from Asia to sell during Christmas trading. Thomas O'Brien, managing director of Leeds-based toy designer Boxer Gifts, which manufacturers its products in China, said there's ""plenty of stock"" but the real problem is that ""everything takes longer and is horrendously more expensive"" which means the company ""will be struggling to keep price increases to anything lower than 10%"". Items that are in short supply include a sloth soft toy and the moody cow stress ball. ""Ironically the moody cow which we're short of is almost a nice acronym for how feel at the moment,"" he added. The 'Moody Cow' stress ball is in short supply at the moment. While there are alternative toys, Mr O'Brien said the firm has lost six weeks of ""planning time"" to be able to re-stock at short notice. He said containers shipped from Qingdao, China to Felixstowe are costing him $15,000 (Â£11,003) rather than the normal rate of $2,500 in 2020. Entrepreneur Jack Griffiths, co-founder of loungewear company Snuggy, said he is expecting containers on five different ships, holdings Â£1m worth of Christmas items, to arrive over the next week but they will now be delayed by three weeks. ""We're seasonal and we have to make the most of these months, 80% of our turnover comes from October to February."" In November, the business usually takes Â£500,000 worth of sales which Mr Griffiths said he ""probably won't be able to get in if we don't get that stock in time"". The company has already run out of the SnuggyPod product which was due to arrive two weeks ago. Mr Griffiths said the product ""probably won't arrive for three weeks at Felixstowe and then it'll take three weeks to get them out of the port due to the driver issues"". He added that because the SnuggyPod is the firm's original design, there aren't any alternatives. ""As the weeks go by I can only see it getting worse which is just something we don't want to think about"". Mr Griffiths anticipates he will have to get products shipped by railway and air rather than sea. It comes after Â£400,000 worth of his stock was delayed earlier in the year when it got stuck on the Ever Given ship which blocked the Suez Canal. Mr Griffiths said that because the SnuggyPod is an original design, there aren't any alternatives. Steve Parks, director at Seaport Freight which deals with food shipments from overseas as well as other goods, says moving products from Rotterdam port to Felixstowe is delaying goods by two to three weeks. ""So things like coconut milk, frozen fish and carpets are being delayed from China."" While Mr Parks said Britain's shortfall in HGV drivers is ""largely"" to blame for the congestion at the port, other countries are experiencing problems, including the US and China. ""This is absolutely the worst period I have known, ever,"" he said. ""We can't get space on ships coming out of the Far East."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said that fluctuating capacity at ports ""has been exacerbated by the ongoing global container and HGV driver shortages"". ""All ports across the UK remain open to shipping lines with Felixstowe reporting improved capacity over the past few days and the government continues to work closely with the freight industry, to tackle the challenges faced by some ports this autumn,"" the spokesperson said. Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said there was ""no need to panic buy"" but advised customers to start their normal shopping process earlier. ""If you see something you want, now is the time to buy as retailers have most of their Christmas stock, but we can't guarantee having supplies of everything over the next few weeks"". ""It's a challenge for small retailers because they don't have the cash to stockpile,"" he added. The UK's biggest commercial port Felixstowe told the BBC that it currently had 50,000 containers which were waiting to be collected, due to a shortage of HGV lorry drivers. Officials at the port have asked the shipping lines to reduce their empty container stocks as ""quickly as possible"". ""It's not the port of Felixstowe affecting the supply chain, it's the supply chain affecting the port of Felixstowe,"" it said, adding that the problems are ""similar at all major UK ports"". Danish shipping giant Maersk has been forcedto divert some of its larger ships from Felixstowe to ports in the Netherlands and Belgium to avoid delays. Smaller ships are then transporting the goods to the UK. A spokesman for the port of Rotterdam said it has been busy over the last couple of weeks, but said: ""It's more to do with Covid than anything else because of the balance of empty and full containers being in the wrong place."" The pandemic is also being blamed in part for bottlenecks at US ports. President Joe Biden will meet with major US retailers as well as the bosses of ports on Wednesday to address the issues. Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chief executive Dubai-based DP World, the global logistics giant which operates out of Southampton and London Gateway, said ""nobody knows how long it's going to take"" to resolve the congestion and shipping container shortages. ""I think it's going to take a long time,"" he said, adding: ""The problem is complicated because you have a backlog of cargo."" The UK Ports Association trade group, said most UK ports were operating normally but that the shortage of drivers meant ""some delays"". ""This has meant that some freight is not being collected as rapidly as it would normally. The situation is impacting all types of ports, not just container terminals. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers. It has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit and a backlog of HGV driver tests. The government recently drafted in military personnel to help with the driver shortages and deliver fuel. Emergency temporary visas have also been issued to foreign drivers. Conservative Party chair Oliver Dowden told the BBC that the government was increasing the number of people having tests and that he would ""expect that number to increase as we approach Christmas"". Asked about potential Christmas shortages, he told Sky news: ""The situation is improving, I'm confident that people will be able to get their toys for Christmas.""

"Life expectancy has increased in some parts of London, but has fallen elsewhere Many areas in the north of England have seen life expectancy fall within the last decade, a new study suggests. Differences across England have now become stark, say researchers - such as a 27-year gap in life expectancy for a man living in Kensington and Chelsea, compared with Blackpool. Although Covid caused life expectancy to drop, this research suggests it was already in decline in many areas. Researchers described the trend as ""alarming"". ""There has always been an impression in the UK that everyone's health is improving, even if not at the same pace,"" said Prof Majid Ezzatifrom Imperial College London which carried out the study.,external ""These data show that longevity has been getting worse for years in large parts of England."" The study, whichhas been published in The Lancet Public Health journal,,externalanalysed all deaths in England between 2002 and 2019. It then worked out the life expectancy for different communities, based on the death records in those places. It found that while life expectancy rose in most places during the first decade of the millennium, from 2010 it began to decline in some places. Areas in London and the home counties still continued on the path of living longer - but life expectancy fell in some urban parts of Leeds, Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool and Blackpool where life expectancy was below 70 for men and 75 for women. By 2019, the researchers say there was a 20-year gap in life expectancy between a woman living in Camden (95.4 years) versus a woman living in one area of Leeds (74.7 years). And for men, there was a 27-year gap in life expectancy between areas in Kensington and Chelsea (95.3 years) and parts of Blackpool (68.3 years) Average life expectancy in the UK is 79 years for men and just below 83 years for women,according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics. Covid causes life expectancy in UK to fall Covid deaths in Scotland drive fall in life expectancy Glasgow life expectancy gap widens between rich and poor ""Declines in life expectancy used to be rare in wealthy countries like the UK, and happened when there were major adversities like wars and pandemics,"" said Prof Ezzati. ""For such declines to be seen in 'normal times' before the pandemic is alarming,"" he said - and he called for action to be taken. The researchers say the differences are down to poverty, insecure employment as well as reductions in welfare support and healthcare. They are calling on the government to increase investments in public health in areas with lower life expectancy. The government has previously pledged to tackle regional inequalities in health as part of its ""levelling-up"" agenda. In a speech earlier this year,,externalBoris Johnson addressed the differences in life expectancy, and called it an ""an outrage"".

"The Conservative Party chairman says both he and the prime minister are sorry for ""the losses"" resulting from Covid in the UK Oliver Dowden's comments come a day after a report by MPs criticised the government's early handling of the pandemic The NHS Covid Pass, used to show a person's vaccine status for travel and events, stopped working for some users on Wednesday Some 42,776 new Covid cases - the highest daily total since 21 July - and a further 136 deaths have been recorded in the UK From November, the US will reopen its borders with Mexico and Canada to fully vaccinated travellers The UK economy grew by 0.4% in August after Covid restrictions were lifted The care sector in England is struggling to recruit staff, with more jobs unfilled than pre-pandemic, an industry body says Edited by Hamish Mackay We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic now, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's Covid news:  Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization's director general The World Health Organization (WHO) has put forward a list of 26 experts to advise on high-threat pathogens that could jump from animals to humans, sparking the next pandemic. Several of those named served on the WHO mission to Wuhan, China, to try to find out how coronavirus started. The WHO made a public call for experts to join the new Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago) last August. There will now be a two-week period of public consultation before the members are confirmed. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, says that while Covid-19 is ""the latest such virus, it will not be the lastâ. âUnderstanding where new pathogens come from is essential for preventing future outbreaks with epidemic and pandemic potential, and requires a broad range of expertise,"" he adds. Selected from over 700 applications, the 26 proposed Sago members have expertise in areas ranging from epidemiology to biosecurity and public health. They reflect âgeographic and gender diversityâ, says the WHO. With the highest number of daily cases since mid-July, the seven-day average for Covid cases in the UK now stands at 39,073 per day. The seven-day average for deaths, meanwhile, is 113 per day. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst There are reports today in Taiwanese media that mask wearing may be âphased outâ once 70% of the population has been fully vaccinated. According to the Taiwan News website, one mayor on the island has said they will ask Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre to relax existing restrictions once more than 70% of Taiwanâs population have received one vaccine dose. There are expectations that Taiwan will reach this milestone by the end of the month. Currently, Taiwan is following Level 2 restrictions in a four-tier system, where Level 1 is the least severe. Mask-wearing is largely enforced, but there are exceptions, such as in restaurants. Even in Level 1 restrictions, masks must still be worn at all times on public transport and in crowded public venues,according to Taiwanâs Central News Agency.,external This has led to some discussion recently about when people in Taiwan might be able to stop wearing masks altogether. The broadcaster SETN has quoted one toxicologist, Chao Ming-wei, as saying this will potentially by the spring. By this time, Taiwan will have hoped to fully vaccinate 70% of its 23.5m population. However, at present, only around 30% of the population have received two vaccine doses. Taiwan is currently somewhat free of Covid-19. Since the beginning of September, it has consistently only recorded single digit daily cases of the virus. No cases have been confirmed in the last 24 hours. The NHS Covid Pass app is working again, but it has come too late for one man who says it made him miss his flight because he was not able to prove his vaccination status. Chuck Adolphy, who's 24 and from Surrey, arrived at London's Gatwick Airport this morning, looking forward to a holiday in Slovenia. But when he attempted to show his Covid Pass on his phone to EasyJet staff, the app showed an error message. He tried showing his paper vaccination card but says the staff were ""having none of it"" - although he wasn't sure whether they were aware of the issues with the app at the time. Describing the situation as a ""shambles"", he tells the BBC he was turned away and missed his flight as a result. Chuck says the airline have refused to give him a refund so he's hoping to book a new flight tomorrow instead. In response, EasyJet said: âIf any passengers
were unable to board we will provide a free transfer to an alternative flight.
Whilst this is outside of our control we would like to apologise for any
inconvenience caused.â Here's what happened when the app went down. The NHS Covid Pass, used to prove vaccine status for travel and events, is up and running again after it stopped working earlier. At least one person says they missed their flight because of the problem,while others reported being ""stranded"" at an airport unable to fly. Today's figures show the number of new coronavirus infections in the UK are at their highest since July. There were42,776new casesrecorded in the last 24 hour,external. The last time the figure was higher than this was on 21 July when there were44,104new infections. Thedaily coronavirus data,externalfrom the government is out and it shows a further 42,776 new cases have been recorded in the UK. There have also been another 136 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Care homes in Wales are facing their worst crisis ""in living memory"", a leading industry figure says - with the sector left in a ""fragile state"" by the pandemic. Staffing levels are so low that homes could fill 20,000 vacancies within a week if people were available to work, says Mario Kreft, chairman of Care Forum Wales. He adds: ""We've got to find a mechanism to ensure that people are properly rewarded. ""Social care is a vital part of the foundation economy. It's worth over Â£50bn in the UK each year so we shouldn't be looking at cost, we should be looking at value."" One care worker in north Wales says she is dreading the winter as the sector reaches a ""critical point"". Emma Murray, manager of At Home - Vale Senior Care, a domiciliary care service in Denbigh, Denbighshire, says: ""You don't want to deliver care that's unsafe. We're desperate at the moment.""

person in Scotland has died as a result of an adverse effect of the Covid-19
jab, according to the National Records of Scotland (NRS). It brings the total number of deaths related to the Covid-19 vaccine up
to five, the NRS says. More than 4.2 million people in Scotland have been given at
least one dose of the vaccine. The five reported deaths are significantly fewer than the 11,262 people that have died because of Covid-19 in Scotland.
Last week, 126 fatalities in Scotland mentioned Covid-19 on the death
certificate. Vaccinations remain the best protection against Covid-19 and
the Department of Health and Social Care continues to urge the population to
get vaccinated. The UK Health Security
AgencyCoronavirus Dashboard,externalreports that more than 94 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been given in the
UK so far. Public Health Scotland advises that side effects to the
jab can be reported on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agencyâs (MHRA)Coronavirus Yellow Card website,external. You can read more about vaccine safetyhere. Coronavirus travel restrictions are affecting tourism in the UK more than most other countries across the world, according to new figures. The London-based World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) - which describes itself as a forum for the industry - is forecasting that spending by tourists visiting the UK will drop by nearly 50% this year compared to 2020. It makes the UK ""one of the worst performing countries in the world"", the organisation says. The WTTC says the travel and tourism sector's contribution to the UK's economy could rise year-on-year by about 32% in 2021 - roughly in line with the global average. But that's being driven in part by the increase in domestic holidays, and it is not enough for a full economic recovery - or to save millions of jobs - says the WTTC. Users trying to access their NHS Covid pass are receiving error messages The NHS Covid Pass, which is used to show a person's vaccination status for travel and events, has stopped working.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has recorded no new domestic Covid-19 cases for the seventh consecutive day. State media are lauding this, because in recent weeks, there have been outbreaks in multiple provincial-level regions, including northwest Xinjiang, northeast Heilongjiang and southeast Fujian. These have been suppressed with swift lockdowns, and mass testing drives have helped identify asymptomatic carriers. There is currently only one area of China that has lockdowns in place: the northeast city of Harbin. However, vigilance is high in the country, as last week hundreds of millions of journeys were made for the annual Golden Week holiday (1-7 October). In two weeks time, tens of thousands of people are set to travel again - to Wuhan, the original epicentre of the coronavirus. The city will host the Wuhan Marathon on 24 October and is expected to see 26,000 runners. Organisers say free tickets for the event will be given to medical workers who helped on the front line during the early stages of the pandemic. Robert Gibbon (centre) died with Covid in December 2020 Yesterday, Wales' health minister apologised for her government's handling of the early stages of the pandemic, after a critical report from MPs. But some bereaved families say an apology is not enough and have called for a separate inquiry into the Welsh response to Covid. Rhianna Gibbon, from Merthyr Tydfil, lost her father Robert, 63, to Covid in December 2020, after he was sent home from hospital due to ""overrun"" corridors. She says lessons should have been learned for the second wave after the delay in introducing the first national lockdown. ""An apology is just not enough. My dad was just one of thousands of people who lost their lives unnecessarily,"" she tells BBC Radio Wales. ""I accept the apology, they've taken responsibility, but this is one of the biggest health issues ever. They [the government] should be held accountable.""

BBC Monitoring Russia is threatening to include British newspaper articles about itsSputnik V coronavirus vaccineon the âfake news"" section of its Foreign Ministry website unless they apologise. It wants papers to retract claims that Russian developers copied the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to create Sputnik V. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says: ""They still have a chance to save a semblance of dignity and respect for the reader and offer their apologies to the Russian developers of the vaccine."" The Russian Foreign Ministry's press office collects what it describes as âarticles circulating untrue information about Russia"". They include articles in the Western media about World War Two that Russia says amount to a ""falsification of history"", stories about the nerve agent poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, and what Russia calls the West's propaganda war on Russian vaccines. Earlier this week, UK Home Office minister Damian Hinds would not be drawn on allegations that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's design was used to create Russia's Sputnik V jab, instead saying more generally that ""state activity"" was involved in ""industrial espionage"". The number of people who died in Scotland last week was 30% higher than the average before the pandemic began.. There were 1,353 deaths - from all causes - registered in the week to 10 October, the National Records of Scotland said. It's 315 more than the average for that week from 2015 to 2019. It's also the highest rate of ""excess"" deaths since the first week of January. They include deaths caused by things like cancer, heart disease or dementia. The number of deaths where Covid was mentioned in registration has fallen for a second week, to 126. The number of deaths linked to the pandemic had been rising since mid-August, but appears to have peaked in the week ending 27 September at 167 - far below previous peaks during the initial outbreak of the virus and at the start of 2021.

Suranjana TewariBBC News Singapore's borders have effectively been closed for 21 months, so news that rules will finally be relaxed has sent residents rushing for a ticket out. From 19 October, vaccinated people can travel freely from Singapore to a dozen countries around the world - without quarantine and with fewer swab tests. By 15 November, another nine countries will be added to the list. ""The cabin fever was just driving us crazy. There's no demarcation between leisure and work here,"" Low Ka Wei, a corporate communications executive told the BBC. The demand for tickets was so great that travel websites crashed. The Singapore Airlines website went down over the weekend, causing a frenzy among eager travellers and leading to one Reddit thread asking: ""Did we just collectively break SIA's website?"" So, having no luck online, Mr Low and many others went the old-fashioned way, spending hours queueing outside a downtown airline office to book. Hospitals across the UK remain under pressure with long waiting lists, Covid infections on the rise and winter looming. We meet staff at one of England's flagship hospitals, Addenbrooke's in Cambridge, as it gears up for what it expects to be its busiest winter ever. James Wheeler, divisional director of surgery and theatres, says the hospital is fortunate in being able to ring-fence beds in order to keep ""elective surgical patients safe"". He says: ""Any wait is painful to watch. All I can really reassure is that we are doing everything in our powers to get through the backlog patients."" Dr Joseph Newman, a respiratory registrar with Cambridge University Hospitals, tell us this hospital is vaccinating staff against flu and Covid to keep them both safe and in work. ""Staff shortages this time last year were a real issue, adding to the pressure even more, so I think trying to keep everyone fit and healthy is really important,"" he says. Roland Sinker, chief executive of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, says he is ""desperately sorry"" that people are having to wait at all. ""If we can get the hospital teams, the population and partners outside the hospital playing together in a way that we did during Covid, I think we can get through this six to nine-month period,"" he says.

"This video can not be played Kerry Roberts and Tammy Kirkwood shared their experiences at an emotional meeting A mum whose daughter died after taking ecstasy has struck up an ""unlikely"" friendship with the mother of the teenager who supplied the fatal drug. Kerry Roberts' daughter Leah Heyes, 15, collapsed after taking MDMA supplied by Connor Kirkwood. After agreeing to meet his mother, Tammy, Ms Roberts said she realised both had ""lost something"" as a result of the drug. They are campaigning together to raise drugs awareness among young people. Leah died in May 2019 after she took the Class A drug with a group of friends in a car park in Northallerton, North Yorkshire. The drugs were brought into the town by Connor, then 17, with another boy, Mitchell Southern, handing them over to Leah.

Although Ms Roberts did not want to meet Connor, it was suggested that by meeting his mother they would be able to share and understand each other's stories. Kerry Roberts said she and daughter Leah had the ""best relationship"" It gave Ms Kirkwood the opportunity to explain how she had been struggling for years to get help for Connor. He had become involved in county lines gangs, which target vulnerable teenagers and use them to supply drugs. Ms Roberts said: ""People will look at us and think it's an unlikely friendship. ""People will see us as two separate things but we are both grieving. They are both our children.""

"The Conservative Party chairman says both he and the prime minister are sorry for ""the losses"" resulting from Covid in the UK Oliver Dowden's comments come a day after a report by MPs criticised the government's early handling of the pandemic The NHS Covid Pass, used to show a person's vaccine status for travel and events, stopped working for some users on Wednesday Some 42,776 new Covid cases - the highest daily total since 21 July - and a further 136 deaths have been recorded in the UK From November, the US will reopen its borders with Mexico and Canada to fully vaccinated travellers The UK economy grew by 0.4% in August after Covid restrictions were lifted The care sector in England is struggling to recruit staff, with more jobs unfilled than pre-pandemic, an industry body says Edited by Hamish Mackay We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic now, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's Covid news:  Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization's director general The World Health Organization (WHO) has put forward a list of 26 experts to advise on high-threat pathogens that could jump from animals to humans, sparking the next pandemic. Several of those named served on the WHO mission to Wuhan, China, to try to find out how coronavirus started. The WHO made a public call for experts to join the new Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago) last August. There will now be a two-week period of public consultation before the members are confirmed. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, says that while Covid-19 is ""the latest such virus, it will not be the lastâ. âUnderstanding where new pathogens come from is essential for preventing future outbreaks with epidemic and pandemic potential, and requires a broad range of expertise,"" he adds. Selected from over 700 applications, the 26 proposed Sago members have expertise in areas ranging from epidemiology to biosecurity and public health. They reflect âgeographic and gender diversityâ, says the WHO. With the highest number of daily cases since mid-July, the seven-day average for Covid cases in the UK now stands at 39,073 per day. The seven-day average for deaths, meanwhile, is 113 per day. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst There are reports today in Taiwanese media that mask wearing may be âphased outâ once 70% of the population has been fully vaccinated. According to the Taiwan News website, one mayor on the island has said they will ask Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre to relax existing restrictions once more than 70% of Taiwanâs population have received one vaccine dose. There are expectations that Taiwan will reach this milestone by the end of the month. Currently, Taiwan is following Level 2 restrictions in a four-tier system, where Level 1 is the least severe. Mask-wearing is largely enforced, but there are exceptions, such as in restaurants. Even in Level 1 restrictions, masks must still be worn at all times on public transport and in crowded public venues,according to Taiwanâs Central News Agency.,external This has led to some discussion recently about when people in Taiwan might be able to stop wearing masks altogether. The broadcaster SETN has quoted one toxicologist, Chao Ming-wei, as saying this will potentially by the spring. By this time, Taiwan will have hoped to fully vaccinate 70% of its 23.5m population. However, at present, only around 30% of the population have received two vaccine doses. Taiwan is currently somewhat free of Covid-19. Since the beginning of September, it has consistently only recorded single digit daily cases of the virus. No cases have been confirmed in the last 24 hours. The NHS Covid Pass app is working again, but it has come too late for one man who says it made him miss his flight because he was not able to prove his vaccination status. Chuck Adolphy, who's 24 and from Surrey, arrived at London's Gatwick Airport this morning, looking forward to a holiday in Slovenia. But when he attempted to show his Covid Pass on his phone to EasyJet staff, the app showed an error message. He tried showing his paper vaccination card but says the staff were ""having none of it"" - although he wasn't sure whether they were aware of the issues with the app at the time. Describing the situation as a ""shambles"", he tells the BBC he was turned away and missed his flight as a result. Chuck says the airline have refused to give him a refund so he's hoping to book a new flight tomorrow instead. In response, EasyJet said: âIf any passengers
were unable to board we will provide a free transfer to an alternative flight.
Whilst this is outside of our control we would like to apologise for any
inconvenience caused.â Here's what happened when the app went down. The NHS Covid Pass, used to prove vaccine status for travel and events, is up and running again after it stopped working earlier. At least one person says they missed their flight because of the problem,while others reported being ""stranded"" at an airport unable to fly. Today's figures show the number of new coronavirus infections in the UK are at their highest since July. There were42,776new casesrecorded in the last 24 hour,external.

There have also been another 136 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Care homes in Wales are facing their worst crisis ""in living memory"", a leading industry figure says - with the sector left in a ""fragile state"" by the pandemic. Staffing levels are so low that homes could fill 20,000 vacancies within a week if people were available to work, says Mario Kreft, chairman of Care Forum Wales. He adds: ""We've got to find a mechanism to ensure that people are properly rewarded. ""Social care is a vital part of the foundation economy. It's worth over Â£50bn in the UK each year so we shouldn't be looking at cost, we should be looking at value."" One care worker in north Wales says she is dreading the winter as the sector reaches a ""critical point"".

Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers to get goods to the ports. It has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic. A spokesman for the port of Rotterdam says: ""It's more to do with Covid than anything else because of the balance of empty and full containers being in the wrong place."" Which items are in short supply? Gary Grant, boss of one of the biggest toy sellers in the UK, The Entertainer, says Paw Patrol toys and Barbie dolls are ""prime candidates for being short in the Christmas season."" Steve Parks, director at Seaport Freight which deals with food shipments from overseas says: ""Things like coconut milk, frozen fish and carpets are being delayed from China."" What should you do? Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, says there is ""no need to panic buy"" but advises customers to start their normal shopping process earlier.

person in Scotland has died as a result of an adverse effect of the Covid-19
jab, according to the National Records of Scotland (NRS). It brings the total number of deaths related to the Covid-19 vaccine up

least one dose of the vaccine. The five reported deaths are significantly fewer than the 11,262 people that have died because of Covid-19 in Scotland.
Last week, 126 fatalities in Scotland mentioned Covid-19 on the death
certificate. Vaccinations remain the best protection against Covid-19 and

Coronavirus travel restrictions are affecting tourism in the UK more than most other countries across the world, according to new figures. The London-based World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) - which describes itself as a forum for the industry - is forecasting that spending by tourists visiting the UK will drop by nearly 50% this year compared to 2020. It makes the UK ""one of the worst performing countries in the world"", the organisation says. The WTTC says the travel and tourism sector's contribution to the UK's economy could rise year-on-year by about 32% in 2021 - roughly in line with the global average. But that's being driven in part by the increase in domestic holidays, and it is not enough for a full economic recovery - or to save millions of jobs - says the WTTC.

"We all knew it was coming, but now it's official: Squid Game has become Netflix's biggest ever series launch. The Korean drama was watched by 111 million users in its first 28 days, knocking Bridgerton (82 million) off the top spot. Netflix counts a view as anyone who's watched two minutes of an episode. Netflix's vice president for content in Korea, South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand says the show's success is ""beyond our wildest dreams"". Minyoung Kim told CNN: ""When we first started investing in Korean series and films in 2015, we knew we wanted to make world-class stories for the core K-content fans across Asia and the world. ""Today, Squid Game has broken through beyond our wildest dreams."" The nine-part series, which debuted in September, tells the story of a group of misfits taking part in a series of children's playground games. There's a prize of 45.6bn Korean won (Â£28m) up for grabs, which doesn't sound too bad until you realise if you lose, you get killed. Squid Game subtitles 'change meaning of the show' Why 26 Korean words have been added to the dictionary From celebrities to sports stars, everyone's been talking about Squid Game. The show's actors have shot to international fame - Jung Ho-yeon, who plays Sae-byeok, has gained 14 million Instagram followers since it launched on 17 September,Forbes says,external. So what's the secret to the drama's success? Warning - the rest of this article contains some mild spoilers... Similar in some ways to The Hunger Games, or the 2000 movie Battle Royale, the show focuses on a group of people in South Korea desperately in debt. They're first tricked (then volunteer) into playing a deadly tournament of children's games, realising this may be their only chance to win the money they need to survive. Chloe Henry is a fan of Korean shows and says Squid Game stands out from the others. ""It's not something that's been done before,"" the 26-year-old from Sheffield tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""With other shows, you can guess what's going to happen whereas this one is more 'wow' - a shock that you weren't expecting."" Chloe feels the actors did a great job in keeping the audience hooked She feels the characters and intense acting keep you connected to the show. ""The actor who plays Seong Gi-hun, his emotion was so raw and it was so interesting to watch."" Seong Gi-hun is a loveable gambling addict with huge debts and facing the loss of his daughter. He's the show's main character. Chloe says the drama also gives viewers a different perception of South Korea. ""People in general think of South Korea as a big flash country with a lot of rich people, so it's nice to see the other side that is not really spoken about, like the struggle and poverty.""

People here Googled Korea-related topics in October more than ever before,according to Google Trends data,external, and last month theOxford English Dictionary added 26 new wordsof Korean origin to its latest edition to ride ""the crest of the Korean wave"". As in the Oscar-winning Korean film, Parasite, the hardship seen in Squid Game is what makes it appealing to an international audience, says Dr Hye-Kyung Lee - who's researching the rise of K-drama and K-pop at King's College London. ""These dramas or films are entertaining, and they have something unique which can strike a chord with people around the world. ""They present a critique of society and social economic conditions, which people can relate to through the characters."" Squid Game: How one Netflix show gripped the world 'This sign will not lead you to Squid Game' Dr Lee says other Korean dramas do touch on issues of society, economy and politics, but Squid Game has been far more direct in its approach. ""It's serious, the message is extreme and I think that reflects what's happening right now."" The violence, which means the show's not recommended for anyone under the age of 15, is part of Squid Game's appeal for Chloe. ""Other Korean shows can be quite modest, they don't show blood, nudity and they blur out weapons. ""It's nice to be able see things and be unexpected.""

"The Conservative Party chairman says both he and the prime minister are sorry for ""the losses"" resulting from Covid in the UK Oliver Dowden's comments come a day after a report by MPs criticised the government's early handling of the pandemic The NHS Covid Pass, used to show a person's vaccine status for travel and events, stopped working for some users on Wednesday Some 42,776 new Covid cases - the highest daily total since 21 July - and a further 136 deaths have been recorded in the UK From November, the US will reopen its borders with Mexico and Canada to fully vaccinated travellers The UK economy grew by 0.4% in August after Covid restrictions were lifted The care sector in England is struggling to recruit staff, with more jobs unfilled than pre-pandemic, an industry body says Edited by Hamish Mackay We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic now, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's Covid news:  Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization's director general The World Health Organization (WHO) has put forward a list of 26 experts to advise on high-threat pathogens that could jump from animals to humans, sparking the next pandemic. Several of those named served on the WHO mission to Wuhan, China, to try to find out how coronavirus started. The WHO made a public call for experts to join the new Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago) last August. There will now be a two-week period of public consultation before the members are confirmed. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, says that while Covid-19 is ""the latest such virus, it will not be the lastâ. âUnderstanding where new pathogens come from is essential for preventing future outbreaks with epidemic and pandemic potential, and requires a broad range of expertise,"" he adds. Selected from over 700 applications, the 26 proposed Sago members have expertise in areas ranging from epidemiology to biosecurity and public health. They reflect âgeographic and gender diversityâ, says the WHO. With the highest number of daily cases since mid-July, the seven-day average for Covid cases in the UK now stands at 39,073 per day. The seven-day average for deaths, meanwhile, is 113 per day. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst There are reports today in Taiwanese media that mask wearing may be âphased outâ once 70% of the population has been fully vaccinated. According to the Taiwan News website, one mayor on the island has said they will ask Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre to relax existing restrictions once more than 70% of Taiwanâs population have received one vaccine dose. There are expectations that Taiwan will reach this milestone by the end of the month. Currently, Taiwan is following Level 2 restrictions in a four-tier system, where Level 1 is the least severe. Mask-wearing is largely enforced, but there are exceptions, such as in restaurants. Even in Level 1 restrictions, masks must still be worn at all times on public transport and in crowded public venues,according to Taiwanâs Central News Agency.,external This has led to some discussion recently about when people in Taiwan might be able to stop wearing masks altogether. The broadcaster SETN has quoted one toxicologist, Chao Ming-wei, as saying this will potentially by the spring. By this time, Taiwan will have hoped to fully vaccinate 70% of its 23.5m population. However, at present, only around 30% of the population have received two vaccine doses. Taiwan is currently somewhat free of Covid-19. Since the beginning of September, it has consistently only recorded single digit daily cases of the virus. No cases have been confirmed in the last 24 hours. The NHS Covid Pass app is working again, but it has come too late for one man who says it made him miss his flight because he was not able to prove his vaccination status. Chuck Adolphy, who's 24 and from Surrey, arrived at London's Gatwick Airport this morning, looking forward to a holiday in Slovenia. But when he attempted to show his Covid Pass on his phone to EasyJet staff, the app showed an error message. He tried showing his paper vaccination card but says the staff were ""having none of it"" - although he wasn't sure whether they were aware of the issues with the app at the time. Describing the situation as a ""shambles"", he tells the BBC he was turned away and missed his flight as a result. Chuck says the airline have refused to give him a refund so he's hoping to book a new flight tomorrow instead. In response, EasyJet said: âIf any passengers
were unable to board we will provide a free transfer to an alternative flight.
Whilst this is outside of our control we would like to apologise for any
inconvenience caused.â Here's what happened when the app went down. The NHS Covid Pass, used to prove vaccine status for travel and events, is up and running again after it stopped working earlier. At least one person says they missed their flight because of the problem,while others reported being ""stranded"" at an airport unable to fly. Today's figures show the number of new coronavirus infections in the UK are at their highest since July. There were42,776new casesrecorded in the last 24 hour,external. The last time the figure was higher than this was on 21 July when there were44,104new infections. Thedaily coronavirus data,externalfrom the government is out and it shows a further 42,776 new cases have been recorded in the UK. There have also been another 136 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Care homes in Wales are facing their worst crisis ""in living memory"", a leading industry figure says - with the sector left in a ""fragile state"" by the pandemic. Staffing levels are so low that homes could fill 20,000 vacancies within a week if people were available to work, says Mario Kreft, chairman of Care Forum Wales. He adds: ""We've got to find a mechanism to ensure that people are properly rewarded. ""Social care is a vital part of the foundation economy.

Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers to get goods to the ports. It has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic. A spokesman for the port of Rotterdam says: ""It's more to do with Covid than anything else because of the balance of empty and full containers being in the wrong place."" Which items are in short supply? Gary Grant, boss of one of the biggest toy sellers in the UK, The Entertainer, says Paw Patrol toys and Barbie dolls are ""prime candidates for being short in the Christmas season."" Steve Parks, director at Seaport Freight which deals with food shipments from overseas says: ""Things like coconut milk, frozen fish and carpets are being delayed from China."" What should you do? Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, says there is ""no need to panic buy"" but advises customers to start their normal shopping process earlier. ""If you see something you want, now is the time to buy as retailers have most of their Christmas stock, but we can't guarantee having supplies of everything over the next few weeks.""

person in Scotland has died as a result of an adverse effect of the Covid-19
jab, according to the National Records of Scotland (NRS). It brings the total number of deaths related to the Covid-19 vaccine up
to five, the NRS says. More than 4.2 million people in Scotland have been given at
least one dose of the vaccine. The five reported deaths are significantly fewer than the 11,262 people that have died because of Covid-19 in Scotland.
Last week, 126 fatalities in Scotland mentioned Covid-19 on the death
certificate. Vaccinations remain the best protection against Covid-19 and
the Department of Health and Social Care continues to urge the population to
get vaccinated. The UK Health Security
AgencyCoronavirus Dashboard,externalreports that more than 94 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been given in the
UK so far. Public Health Scotland advises that side effects to the
jab can be reported on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agencyâs (MHRA)Coronavirus Yellow Card website,external. You can read more about vaccine safetyhere. Coronavirus travel restrictions are affecting tourism in the UK more than most other countries across the world, according to new figures. The London-based World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) - which describes itself as a forum for the industry - is forecasting that spending by tourists visiting the UK will drop by nearly 50% this year compared to 2020. It makes the UK ""one of the worst performing countries in the world"", the organisation says. The WTTC says the travel and tourism sector's contribution to the UK's economy could rise year-on-year by about 32% in 2021 - roughly in line with the global average. But that's being driven in part by the increase in domestic holidays, and it is not enough for a full economic recovery - or to save millions of jobs - says the WTTC. Users trying to access their NHS Covid pass are receiving error messages The NHS Covid Pass, which is used to show a person's vaccination status for travel and events, has stopped working. The feature, contained in the NHS smartphone app, usually allows users to access a barcode or text records about which vaccine doses they have had. Instead, users are receiving error messages or a notice saying that high traffic volumes are ""limiting access to the service"". In a post on Twitter,external, NHS Digital says there are currently issues with accessing the Covid Pass on the NHS App and website and it is investigating. The digital pass can be used by those over 16 years old who were vaccinated in England, Wales or the Isle of Man. Read more. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has recorded no new domestic Covid-19 cases for the seventh consecutive day. State media are lauding this, because in recent weeks, there have been outbreaks in multiple provincial-level regions, including northwest Xinjiang, northeast Heilongjiang and southeast Fujian. These have been suppressed with swift lockdowns, and mass testing drives have helped identify asymptomatic carriers. There is currently only one area of China that has lockdowns in place: the northeast city of Harbin. However, vigilance is high in the country, as last week hundreds of millions of journeys were made for the annual Golden Week holiday (1-7 October). In two weeks time, tens of thousands of people are set to travel again - to Wuhan, the original epicentre of the coronavirus. The city will host the Wuhan Marathon on 24 October and is expected to see 26,000 runners. Organisers say free tickets for the event will be given to medical workers who helped on the front line during the early stages of the pandemic. Robert Gibbon (centre) died with Covid in December 2020 Yesterday, Wales' health minister apologised for her government's handling of the early stages of the pandemic, after a critical report from MPs. But some bereaved families say an apology is not enough and have called for a separate inquiry into the Welsh response to Covid. Rhianna Gibbon, from Merthyr Tydfil, lost her father Robert, 63, to Covid in December 2020, after he was sent home from hospital due to ""overrun"" corridors. She says lessons should have been learned for the second wave after the delay in introducing the first national lockdown. ""An apology is just not enough. My dad was just one of thousands of people who lost their lives unnecessarily,"" she tells BBC Radio Wales. ""I accept the apology, they've taken responsibility, but this is one of the biggest health issues ever. They [the government] should be held accountable.""

BBC Monitoring Russia is threatening to include British newspaper articles about itsSputnik V coronavirus vaccineon the âfake news"" section of its Foreign Ministry website unless they apologise. It wants papers to retract claims that Russian developers copied the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to create Sputnik V. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says: ""They still have a chance to save a semblance of dignity and respect for the reader and offer their apologies to the Russian developers of the vaccine."" The Russian Foreign Ministry's press office collects what it describes as âarticles circulating untrue information about Russia"". They include articles in the Western media about World War Two that Russia says amount to a ""falsification of history"", stories about the nerve agent poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, and what Russia calls the West's propaganda war on Russian vaccines. Earlier this week, UK Home Office minister Damian Hinds would not be drawn on allegations that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's design was used to create Russia's Sputnik V jab, instead saying more generally that ""state activity"" was involved in ""industrial espionage"". The number of people who died in Scotland last week was 30% higher than the average before the pandemic began.. There were 1,353 deaths - from all causes - registered in the week to 10 October, the National Records of Scotland said. It's 315 more than the average for that week from 2015 to 2019. It's also the highest rate of ""excess"" deaths since the first week of January. They include deaths caused by things like cancer, heart disease or dementia. The number of deaths where Covid was mentioned in registration has fallen for a second week, to 126. The number of deaths linked to the pandemic had been rising since mid-August, but appears to have peaked in the week ending 27 September at 167 - far below previous peaks during the initial outbreak of the virus and at the start of 2021.

to five, the NRS says. More than 4.2 million people in Scotland have been given at
least one dose of the vaccine. The five reported deaths are significantly fewer than the 11,262 people that have died because of Covid-19 in Scotland.
Last week, 126 fatalities in Scotland mentioned Covid-19 on the death
certificate. Vaccinations remain the best protection against Covid-19 and
the Department of Health and Social Care continues to urge the population to
get vaccinated. The UK Health Security
AgencyCoronavirus Dashboard,externalreports that more than 94 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been given in the
UK so far. Public Health Scotland advises that side effects to the
jab can be reported on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agencyâs (MHRA)Coronavirus Yellow Card website,external. You can read more about vaccine safetyhere. Coronavirus travel restrictions are affecting tourism in the UK more than most other countries across the world, according to new figures. The London-based World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) - which describes itself as a forum for the industry - is forecasting that spending by tourists visiting the UK will drop by nearly 50% this year compared to 2020. It makes the UK ""one of the worst performing countries in the world"", the organisation says. The WTTC says the travel and tourism sector's contribution to the UK's economy could rise year-on-year by about 32% in 2021 - roughly in line with the global average. But that's being driven in part by the increase in domestic holidays, and it is not enough for a full economic recovery - or to save millions of jobs - says the WTTC. Users trying to access their NHS Covid pass are receiving error messages The NHS Covid Pass, which is used to show a person's vaccination status for travel and events, has stopped working. The feature, contained in the NHS smartphone app, usually allows users to access a barcode or text records about which vaccine doses they have had. Instead, users are receiving error messages or a notice saying that high traffic volumes are ""limiting access to the service"". In a post on Twitter,external, NHS Digital says there are currently issues with accessing the Covid Pass on the NHS App and website and it is investigating. The digital pass can be used by those over 16 years old who were vaccinated in England, Wales or the Isle of Man. Read more. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has recorded no new domestic Covid-19 cases for the seventh consecutive day. State media are lauding this, because in recent weeks, there have been outbreaks in multiple provincial-level regions, including northwest Xinjiang, northeast Heilongjiang and southeast Fujian. These have been suppressed with swift lockdowns, and mass testing drives have helped identify asymptomatic carriers. There is currently only one area of China that has lockdowns in place: the northeast city of Harbin. However, vigilance is high in the country, as last week hundreds of millions of journeys were made for the annual Golden Week holiday (1-7 October). In two weeks time, tens of thousands of people are set to travel again - to Wuhan, the original epicentre of the coronavirus. The city will host the Wuhan Marathon on 24 October and is expected to see 26,000 runners. Organisers say free tickets for the event will be given to medical workers who helped on the front line during the early stages of the pandemic. Robert Gibbon (centre) died with Covid in December 2020 Yesterday, Wales' health minister apologised for her government's handling of the early stages of the pandemic, after a critical report from MPs. But some bereaved families say an apology is not enough and have called for a separate inquiry into the Welsh response to Covid. Rhianna Gibbon, from Merthyr Tydfil, lost her father Robert, 63, to Covid in December 2020, after he was sent home from hospital due to ""overrun"" corridors. She says lessons should have been learned for the second wave after the delay in introducing the first national lockdown. ""An apology is just not enough. My dad was just one of thousands of people who lost their lives unnecessarily,"" she tells BBC Radio Wales. ""I accept the apology, they've taken responsibility, but this is one of the biggest health issues ever. They [the government] should be held accountable.""

BBC Monitoring Russia is threatening to include British newspaper articles about itsSputnik V coronavirus vaccineon the âfake news"" section of its Foreign Ministry website unless they apologise. It wants papers to retract claims that Russian developers copied the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to create Sputnik V. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says: ""They still have a chance to save a semblance of dignity and respect for the reader and offer their apologies to the Russian developers of the vaccine."" The Russian Foreign Ministry's press office collects what it describes as âarticles circulating untrue information about Russia"". They include articles in the Western media about World War Two that Russia says amount to a ""falsification of history"", stories about the nerve agent poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, and what Russia calls the West's propaganda war on Russian vaccines. Earlier this week, UK Home Office minister Damian Hinds would not be drawn on allegations that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's design was used to create Russia's Sputnik V jab, instead saying more generally that ""state activity"" was involved in ""industrial espionage"". The number of people who died in Scotland last week was 30% higher than the average before the pandemic began.. There were 1,353 deaths - from all causes - registered in the week to 10 October, the National Records of Scotland said. It's 315 more than the average for that week from 2015 to 2019. It's also the highest rate of ""excess"" deaths since the first week of January. They include deaths caused by things like cancer, heart disease or dementia. The number of deaths where Covid was mentioned in registration has fallen for a second week, to 126. The number of deaths linked to the pandemic had been rising since mid-August, but appears to have peaked in the week ending 27 September at 167 - far below previous peaks during the initial outbreak of the virus and at the start of 2021.

Suranjana TewariBBC News Singapore's borders have effectively been closed for 21 months, so news that rules will finally be relaxed has sent residents rushing for a ticket out. From 19 October, vaccinated people can travel freely from Singapore to a dozen countries around the world - without quarantine and with fewer swab tests. By 15 November, another nine countries will be added to the list. ""The cabin fever was just driving us crazy. There's no demarcation between leisure and work here,"" Low Ka Wei, a corporate communications executive told the BBC. The demand for tickets was so great that travel websites crashed. The Singapore Airlines website went down over the weekend, causing a frenzy among eager travellers and leading to one Reddit thread asking: ""Did we just collectively break SIA's website?"" So, having no luck online, Mr Low and many others went the old-fashioned way, spending hours queueing outside a downtown airline office to book. Hospitals across the UK remain under pressure with long waiting lists, Covid infections on the rise and winter looming. We meet staff at one of England's flagship hospitals, Addenbrooke's in Cambridge, as it gears up for what it expects to be its busiest winter ever. James Wheeler, divisional director of surgery and theatres, says the hospital is fortunate in being able to ring-fence beds in order to keep ""elective surgical patients safe"". He says: ""Any wait is painful to watch. All I can really reassure is that we are doing everything in our powers to get through the backlog patients."" Dr Joseph Newman, a respiratory registrar with Cambridge University Hospitals, tell us this hospital is vaccinating staff against flu and Covid to keep them both safe and in work. ""Staff shortages this time last year were a real issue, adding to the pressure even more, so I think trying to keep everyone fit and healthy is really important,"" he says. Roland Sinker, chief executive of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, says he is ""desperately sorry"" that people are having to wait at all. ""If we can get the hospital teams, the population and partners outside the hospital playing together in a way that we did during Covid, I think we can get through this six to nine-month period,"" he says.

"A law firm is seeking to launch a group action against Amazon over employee rights for delivery drivers. Leigh Day is claiming drivers hired via third party delivery companies to make deliveries for the online giant should be given rights enjoyed by employees. The drivers are classed as being self-employed, meaning they are not entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay. Amazon said it was committed to ensuring drivers were fairly paid by the delivery companies they work with. Drivers making deliveries on behalf of Amazon for its ""Delivery Service Partners"" are not entitled to National Minimum Wage or an employment contract, Leigh Day said. The law firm says it has already begun legal action on behalf of two drivers and is seeking others to join a group action. Leigh Day, which brought, and won,a landmark case on behalf of Uber drivers for workers' rights in February, claims at least three thousand drivers could potentially be owed more than a hundred million pounds in compensation. It believes that because Amazon tells drivers how they should work, and how they fit into the business, they should have more rights. Amazon pays Â£492m in UK tax as sales surge to Â£20.6bn Amazon opens first UK non-food store The law firm claims drivers are given estimated timings between deliveries via an app which they have to meet. However, according to Amazon, the routing app provides guidance  and it is up to drivers whether to follow the suggested route. Kate Robinson, a Leigh Day employment solicitor, said: ""It appears that Amazon is short-changing drivers making deliveries on their behalf. ""Drivers delivering for Amazon have to work set shifts and book time off, yet Amazon claim they are self-employed."" She added that that millions of pounds of compensation would be ""a drop in the ocean"" to Amazon. ""For drivers on the other hand, earning at least National Minimum Wage, getting holiday pay and being under a proper employment contract could be life-changing,"" she added. Ms Robinson stressed that it was ""time for Amazon to stop putting profit above people"". Leigh Day is bringing similar claims against Uber, Addison Lee, delivery company Stuart and used vehicle marketplace BCA. The law firm has beenpursuing an equal pay claim on behalf of thousands of Asda staff. It is also representing clients from Sainsbury's, Tesco, Morrisons and the Co-op. Amazon capitalised on a surge in demand for online shopping during the Covid pandemic, withsales rising 50% to Â£20.63bnin 2020.

"The European Court of Justice sits in Luxembourg The UK government has said it wants to remove the European Court of Justice from its oversight role as part of the Northern Ireland Protocol, saying as long as it continues the deal will never survive. The EU, on the other hand, has said it would be very hard for the protocol to continue without the court's oversight. So what is the ECJ, what is its role in the protocol and what are the possible alternatives? The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is actually composed of two separate courts - the Court of Justice and the General Court. From 2004 to 2016 there was a third court, the Civil Service Tribunal, but its work is now done by the General Court. To avoid confusion this article will refer to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to describe the work of the entire institution. If you want to know more detail, or look up a specific case,you can do so here,external. It's not to be confused with the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which is a separate institution and is not part of the European Union. It decides whether the institutions of the EU are acting legally, and it settles disputes between them. It ensures that the member states of the EU are complying with their legal obligations as set out in the EU treaties and it allows member states to challenge EU legislation. It interprets EU law at the request of national courts. Taken all together, this means that the ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, and pretty much everything else that the EU does. Under the terms of the protocol - agreed jointly by the UK and EU as part of the Brexit deal - Northern Ireland continues to follow EU rules on product standards, which enable the free movement of goods in the EU's single market. Many goods need to be inspected when they arrive at Northern Ireland's ports and customs documents have to be filled in. Theagreement that created the protocol,externalstates that representatives from the EU have the right to oversee its implementation and application. It also states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? If there was a dispute around compliance with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ, which would rule on whether the UK was in breach of its obligations under the terms of the protocol. In any cases brought before the ECJ, the UK would participate in proceedings in the same way as an EU member state. The former Brexit Minister Lord Frost wanted the ECJ's role in overseeing the protocol to be removed. In a paper published in July 2021, the government said it had only agreed to the ECJ's role because of the ""very specific circumstances"" of the protocol negotiation. It wanted a new governance arrangement in which disputes should be ""managed collectively and ultimately through international arbitration"". This objection to the ECJ's role can be linked back to the Brexit referendum. In fact it goes right back to one of the problems that British Eurosceptics have always had with the EU - the fact that European courts were able to rule on matters of EU law in the UK. During the Brexit campaign a key slogan for the leave campaign was ""take back control"". Then at the Conservative Party conference in October 2016, the then Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We are not leaving (the EU) only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That is not going to happen."" ""Take back control"" was a key slogan of the Vote Leave campaign Vague promises to take back control of our laws suddenly became a very specific promise to end the jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK. It became a government red line. But that did not stop the government signing up to the NI Protocol, complete with ECJ oversight. It is that which Lord Frost wanted to change. Speaking  in October 2021, European Commission Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ  said: ""I find it hard to see how Northern Ireland would stay or would keep the access to the single market without oversight of the European Court of Justice."" There was also a strong response from the then Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney after Lord Frost reiterated that he wanted the ECJ removed from its oversight role. Simon Coveney, was the Irish Foreign Minister, said the UK was dismissing EU solutions Mr Coveney said the UK's demands on the protocol could ""cause a breakdown in relations"" with the EU. He added that the UK's dismissals were now ""more serious"", given the comprehensive compromise proposals the EU is bringing forward. ""Each time the EU comes forward with new ideas, new proposals to try to solve problems, they are dismissed before they are released and that is happening again this week,"" Mr Coveney said. He said dismissals were being seen across the EU as ""the same pattern, over and over again"" by the UK. One alternative that has been suggested is the model associated with dispute resolution used in the main withdrawal treaty with the EU and bilateral treaties the EU has concluded with neighbouring countries like Ukraine. Under these treaties, proceedings go to an arbitration panel before proceedings in front of the ECJ, but only for questions of interpreting EU law. David Phinnemore, professor of European politics at Queen's University Belfast, said one problem with this from the EU's point of view is that the EU is clear that the only body that can interpret EU law is the ECJ - not an intermediary such as the arbitration panel. But Anton Spisak, trade policy lead at the Tony Blair Institute, suggested it could provide a ""landing zone"" for the UK government and the EU. He said that while the ECJ is the only body that can interpret EU law, the arbitration panel acts as the ""default arbiter"". In his view the UK is ultimately prepared to accept a ""more narrow role for the ECJ not as a default, but only in those circumstances where EU rules apply"". He said: ""The arbitration panel is the one making the ultimate decision, but the panel has to take the views of the ECJ into account. ""This is the way the EU has dealt with other third countries applying EU law in the past and the reason why I think it is a realistic proposition is that the EU recently put it on the table with Switzerland."" Another possible alternative is something along the lines ofthe EFTA Court,external, which is responsible for the three countries which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA): Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Prof Phinnemore said: ""In theory that is a a possible alternative, but it would mean setting up a dedicated court for Northern Ireland."" He also pointed out that the EFTA Court rules in line with the jurisprudence of the ECJ. Mr Spisak also did not believe the EFTA Court was a practical solution. The principality of Liechtenstein is one of three members of the European Economic Area Prof Phinnemore said: ""There is no precedent that allows anything other than the ECJ to rule on EU market rules. ""If you want to be part of the single market for goods you have to follow EU rules and I cannot see the EU moving away from that"". Mr Spisak said: ""In a sensitive debate like this it is useful to start from the first principals. If there are EU rules in the protocol, whether now or in some kind of renegotiated agreement, it is simply unavoidable for the ECJ to be an arbiter of those rules. ""And because it is unlikely to have a protocol where EU rules don't feature at all, both sides have to find a way of accommodating the ECJ within that agreement."" But he believed there is a possible compromise to be struck. He said: ""There is a technical solution that looks like a more standard international treaty but involves the ECJ in specific circumstances. The real difficulty is political. ""The EU compromising on the ECJ would signal to the UK that it is ready to renegotiate a key part of the protocol, which it has said it wouldn't do.""

"This video can not be played Kerry Roberts and Tammy Kirkwood shared their experiences at an emotional meeting A mum whose daughter died after taking ecstasy has struck up an ""unlikely"" friendship with the mother of the teenager who supplied the fatal drug. Kerry Roberts' daughter Leah Heyes, 15, collapsed after taking MDMA supplied by Connor Kirkwood. After agreeing to meet his mother, Tammy, Ms Roberts said she realised both had ""lost something"" as a result of the drug. They are campaigning together to raise drugs awareness among young people. Leah died in May 2019 after she took the Class A drug with a group of friends in a car park in Northallerton, North Yorkshire. The drugs were brought into the town by Connor, then 17, with another boy, Mitchell Southern, handing them over to Leah. Connor, from Dishforth, was jailed for 21 months last yearbut was released after serving six months of his sentence. The mothers were introduced to each other through restorative justice - a process in which victims of crime can meet those who committed the offence against them. Although Ms Roberts did not want to meet Connor, it was suggested that by meeting his mother they would be able to share and understand each other's stories. Kerry Roberts said she and daughter Leah had the ""best relationship"" It gave Ms Kirkwood the opportunity to explain how she had been struggling for years to get help for Connor. He had become involved in county lines gangs, which target vulnerable teenagers and use them to supply drugs. Ms Roberts said: ""People will look at us and think it's an unlikely friendship. ""People will see us as two separate things but we are both grieving. They are both our children."" Connor Kirkwood and Mitchell Southern both admitted supplying ecstasy and were jailed last year Ms Kirkwood described how, from the age of 15, Connor went from being a ""presentable young man"" to ""wearing trackies and not speaking to anyone"".

UK warning over different drugs in identical pills How social media is being used to sell drugs Despite police involvement and her constant requests for help, Ms Kirkwood said they were never offered a drug referral or other support. She said she had struggled with ""guilt and shame"" over whether she could have prevented Leah's death. ""I thought where have I gone wrong? How did this happen? What did I do?"" she said.

"We all knew it was coming, but now it's official: Squid Game has become Netflix's biggest ever series launch. The Korean drama was watched by 111 million users in its first 28 days, knocking Bridgerton (82 million) off the top spot. Netflix counts a view as anyone who's watched two minutes of an episode. Netflix's vice president for content in Korea, South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand says the show's success is ""beyond our wildest dreams"". Minyoung Kim told CNN: ""When we first started investing in Korean series and films in 2015, we knew we wanted to make world-class stories for the core K-content fans across Asia and the world. ""Today, Squid Game has broken through beyond our wildest dreams."" The nine-part series, which debuted in September, tells the story of a group of misfits taking part in a series of children's playground games. There's a prize of 45.6bn Korean won (Â£28m) up for grabs, which doesn't sound too bad until you realise if you lose, you get killed. Squid Game subtitles 'change meaning of the show' Why 26 Korean words have been added to the dictionary From celebrities to sports stars, everyone's been talking about Squid Game. The show's actors have shot to international fame - Jung Ho-yeon, who plays Sae-byeok, has gained 14 million Instagram followers since it launched on 17 September,Forbes says,external. So what's the secret to the drama's success? Warning - the rest of this article contains some mild spoilers... Similar in some ways to The Hunger Games, or the 2000 movie Battle Royale, the show focuses on a group of people in South Korea desperately in debt. They're first tricked (then volunteer) into playing a deadly tournament of children's games, realising this may be their only chance to win the money they need to survive. Chloe Henry is a fan of Korean shows and says Squid Game stands out from the others. ""It's not something that's been done before,"" the 26-year-old from Sheffield tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""With other shows, you can guess what's going to happen whereas this one is more 'wow' - a shock that you weren't expecting."" Chloe feels the actors did a great job in keeping the audience hooked She feels the characters and intense acting keep you connected to the show. ""The actor who plays Seong Gi-hun, his emotion was so raw and it was so interesting to watch."" Seong Gi-hun is a loveable gambling addict with huge debts and facing the loss of his daughter. He's the show's main character. Chloe says the drama also gives viewers a different perception of South Korea. ""People in general think of South Korea as a big flash country with a lot of rich people, so it's nice to see the other side that is not really spoken about, like the struggle and poverty.""

People here Googled Korea-related topics in October more than ever before,according to Google Trends data,external, and last month theOxford English Dictionary added 26 new wordsof Korean origin to its latest edition to ride ""the crest of the Korean wave"". As in the Oscar-winning Korean film, Parasite, the hardship seen in Squid Game is what makes it appealing to an international audience, says Dr Hye-Kyung Lee - who's researching the rise of K-drama and K-pop at King's College London. ""These dramas or films are entertaining, and they have something unique which can strike a chord with people around the world. ""They present a critique of society and social economic conditions, which people can relate to through the characters."" Squid Game: How one Netflix show gripped the world 'This sign will not lead you to Squid Game' Dr Lee says other Korean dramas do touch on issues of society, economy and politics, but Squid Game has been far more direct in its approach. ""It's serious, the message is extreme and I think that reflects what's happening right now."" The violence, which means the show's not recommended for anyone under the age of 15, is part of Squid Game's appeal for Chloe. ""Other Korean shows can be quite modest, they don't show blood, nudity and they blur out weapons. ""It's nice to be able see things and be unexpected.""

"The Conservative Party chairman says both he and the prime minister are sorry for ""the losses"" resulting from Covid in the UK Oliver Dowden's comments come a day after a report by MPs criticised the government's early handling of the pandemic The NHS Covid Pass, used to show a person's vaccine status for travel and events, stopped working for some users on Wednesday Some 42,776 new Covid cases - the highest daily total since 21 July - and a further 136 deaths have been recorded in the UK From November, the US will reopen its borders with Mexico and Canada to fully vaccinated travellers The UK economy grew by 0.4% in August after Covid restrictions were lifted The care sector in England is struggling to recruit staff, with more jobs unfilled than pre-pandemic, an industry body says Edited by Hamish Mackay We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic now, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's Covid news:  Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization's director general The World Health Organization (WHO) has put forward a list of 26 experts to advise on high-threat pathogens that could jump from animals to humans, sparking the next pandemic. Several of those named served on the WHO mission to Wuhan, China, to try to find out how coronavirus started. The WHO made a public call for experts to join the new Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago) last August. There will now be a two-week period of public consultation before the members are confirmed. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, says that while Covid-19 is ""the latest such virus, it will not be the lastâ. âUnderstanding where new pathogens come from is essential for preventing future outbreaks with epidemic and pandemic potential, and requires a broad range of expertise,"" he adds. Selected from over 700 applications, the 26 proposed Sago members have expertise in areas ranging from epidemiology to biosecurity and public health. They reflect âgeographic and gender diversityâ, says the WHO. With the highest number of daily cases since mid-July, the seven-day average for Covid cases in the UK now stands at 39,073 per day. The seven-day average for deaths, meanwhile, is 113 per day. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst There are reports today in Taiwanese media that mask wearing may be âphased outâ once 70% of the population has been fully vaccinated. According to the Taiwan News website, one mayor on the island has said they will ask Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre to relax existing restrictions once more than 70% of Taiwanâs population have received one vaccine dose. There are expectations that Taiwan will reach this milestone by the end of the month. Currently, Taiwan is following Level 2 restrictions in a four-tier system, where Level 1 is the least severe. Mask-wearing is largely enforced, but there are exceptions, such as in restaurants. Even in Level 1 restrictions, masks must still be worn at all times on public transport and in crowded public venues,according to Taiwanâs Central News Agency.,external This has led to some discussion recently about when people in Taiwan might be able to stop wearing masks altogether. The broadcaster SETN has quoted one toxicologist, Chao Ming-wei, as saying this will potentially by the spring. By this time, Taiwan will have hoped to fully vaccinate 70% of its 23.5m population. However, at present, only around 30% of the population have received two vaccine doses. Taiwan is currently somewhat free of Covid-19. Since the beginning of September, it has consistently only recorded single digit daily cases of the virus. No cases have been confirmed in the last 24 hours. The NHS Covid Pass app is working again, but it has come too late for one man who says it made him miss his flight because he was not able to prove his vaccination status. Chuck Adolphy, who's 24 and from Surrey, arrived at London's Gatwick Airport this morning, looking forward to a holiday in Slovenia. But when he attempted to show his Covid Pass on his phone to EasyJet staff, the app showed an error message. He tried showing his paper vaccination card but says the staff were ""having none of it"" - although he wasn't sure whether they were aware of the issues with the app at the time. Describing the situation as a ""shambles"", he tells the BBC he was turned away and missed his flight as a result. Chuck says the airline have refused to give him a refund so he's hoping to book a new flight tomorrow instead. In response, EasyJet said: âIf any passengers
were unable to board we will provide a free transfer to an alternative flight.
Whilst this is outside of our control we would like to apologise for any
inconvenience caused.â Here's what happened when the app went down. The NHS Covid Pass, used to prove vaccine status for travel and events, is up and running again after it stopped working earlier. At least one person says they missed their flight because of the problem,while others reported being ""stranded"" at an airport unable to fly. Today's figures show the number of new coronavirus infections in the UK are at their highest since July. There were42,776new casesrecorded in the last 24 hour,external. The last time the figure was higher than this was on 21 July when there were44,104new infections. Thedaily coronavirus data,externalfrom the government is out and it shows a further 42,776 new cases have been recorded in the UK. There have also been another 136 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Care homes in Wales are facing their worst crisis ""in living memory"", a leading industry figure says - with the sector left in a ""fragile state"" by the pandemic. Staffing levels are so low that homes could fill 20,000 vacancies within a week if people were available to work, says Mario Kreft, chairman of Care Forum Wales. He adds: ""We've got to find a mechanism to ensure that people are properly rewarded. ""Social care is a vital part of the foundation economy. It's worth over Â£50bn in the UK each year so we shouldn't be looking at cost, we should be looking at value."" One care worker in north Wales says she is dreading the winter as the sector reaches a ""critical point"". Emma Murray, manager of At Home - Vale Senior Care, a domiciliary care service in Denbigh, Denbighshire, says: ""You don't want to deliver care that's unsafe. We're desperate at the moment.""

Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers to get goods to the ports. It has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic. A spokesman for the port of Rotterdam says: ""It's more to do with Covid than anything else because of the balance of empty and full containers being in the wrong place."" Which items are in short supply? Gary Grant, boss of one of the biggest toy sellers in the UK, The Entertainer, says Paw Patrol toys and Barbie dolls are ""prime candidates for being short in the Christmas season."" Steve Parks, director at Seaport Freight which deals with food shipments from overseas says: ""Things like coconut milk, frozen fish and carpets are being delayed from China."" What should you do? Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, says there is ""no need to panic buy"" but advises customers to start their normal shopping process earlier. ""If you see something you want, now is the time to buy as retailers have most of their Christmas stock, but we can't guarantee having supplies of everything over the next few weeks.""

person in Scotland has died as a result of an adverse effect of the Covid-19
jab, according to the National Records of Scotland (NRS). It brings the total number of deaths related to the Covid-19 vaccine up
to five, the NRS says. More than 4.2 million people in Scotland have been given at
least one dose of the vaccine. The five reported deaths are significantly fewer than the 11,262 people that have died because of Covid-19 in Scotland.
Last week, 126 fatalities in Scotland mentioned Covid-19 on the death
certificate. Vaccinations remain the best protection against Covid-19 and
the Department of Health and Social Care continues to urge the population to
get vaccinated. The UK Health Security
AgencyCoronavirus Dashboard,externalreports that more than 94 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been given in the
UK so far. Public Health Scotland advises that side effects to the
jab can be reported on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agencyâs (MHRA)Coronavirus Yellow Card website,external. You can read more about vaccine safetyhere. Coronavirus travel restrictions are affecting tourism in the UK more than most other countries across the world, according to new figures. The London-based World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) - which describes itself as a forum for the industry - is forecasting that spending by tourists visiting the UK will drop by nearly 50% this year compared to 2020. It makes the UK ""one of the worst performing countries in the world"", the organisation says. The WTTC says the travel and tourism sector's contribution to the UK's economy could rise year-on-year by about 32% in 2021 - roughly in line with the global average. But that's being driven in part by the increase in domestic holidays, and it is not enough for a full economic recovery - or to save millions of jobs - says the WTTC. Users trying to access their NHS Covid pass are receiving error messages The NHS Covid Pass, which is used to show a person's vaccination status for travel and events, has stopped working. The feature, contained in the NHS smartphone app, usually allows users to access a barcode or text records about which vaccine doses they have had. Instead, users are receiving error messages or a notice saying that high traffic volumes are ""limiting access to the service"". In a post on Twitter,external, NHS Digital says there are currently issues with accessing the Covid Pass on the NHS App and website and it is investigating. The digital pass can be used by those over 16 years old who were vaccinated in England, Wales or the Isle of Man. Read more. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has recorded no new domestic Covid-19 cases for the seventh consecutive day. State media are lauding this, because in recent weeks, there have been outbreaks in multiple provincial-level regions, including northwest Xinjiang, northeast Heilongjiang and southeast Fujian. These have been suppressed with swift lockdowns, and mass testing drives have helped identify asymptomatic carriers. There is currently only one area of China that has lockdowns in place: the northeast city of Harbin. However, vigilance is high in the country, as last week hundreds of millions of journeys were made for the annual Golden Week holiday (1-7 October). In two weeks time, tens of thousands of people are set to travel again - to Wuhan, the original epicentre of the coronavirus. The city will host the Wuhan Marathon on 24 October and is expected to see 26,000 runners. Organisers say free tickets for the event will be given to medical workers who helped on the front line during the early stages of the pandemic. Robert Gibbon (centre) died with Covid in December 2020 Yesterday, Wales' health minister apologised for her government's handling of the early stages of the pandemic, after a critical report from MPs. But some bereaved families say an apology is not enough and have called for a separate inquiry into the Welsh response to Covid. Rhianna Gibbon, from Merthyr Tydfil, lost her father Robert, 63, to Covid in December 2020, after he was sent home from hospital due to ""overrun"" corridors. She says lessons should have been learned for the second wave after the delay in introducing the first national lockdown. ""An apology is just not enough. My dad was just one of thousands of people who lost their lives unnecessarily,"" she tells BBC Radio Wales. ""I accept the apology, they've taken responsibility, but this is one of the biggest health issues ever. They [the government] should be held accountable."" You can read more reaction from families and health workers to yesterday's report here. BBC Monitoring Russia is threatening to include British newspaper articles about itsSputnik V coronavirus vaccineon the âfake news"" section of its Foreign Ministry website unless they apologise. It wants papers to retract claims that Russian developers copied the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to create Sputnik V. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says: ""They still have a chance to save a semblance of dignity and respect for the reader and offer their apologies to the Russian developers of the vaccine."" The Russian Foreign Ministry's press office collects what it describes as âarticles circulating untrue information about Russia"". They include articles in the Western media about World War Two that Russia says amount to a ""falsification of history"", stories about the nerve agent poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, and what Russia calls the West's propaganda war on Russian vaccines. Earlier this week, UK Home Office minister Damian Hinds would not be drawn on allegations that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's design was used to create Russia's Sputnik V jab, instead saying more generally that ""state activity"" was involved in ""industrial espionage"". The number of people who died in Scotland last week was 30% higher than the average before the pandemic began.. There were 1,353 deaths - from all causes - registered in the week to 10 October, the National Records of Scotland said. It's 315 more than the average for that week from 2015 to 2019. It's also the highest rate of ""excess"" deaths since the first week of January. They include deaths caused by things like cancer, heart disease or dementia. The number of deaths where Covid was mentioned in registration has fallen for a second week, to 126. The number of deaths linked to the pandemic had been rising since mid-August, but appears to have peaked in the week ending 27 September at 167 - far below previous peaks during the initial outbreak of the virus and at the start of 2021. Read more about it here. Suranjana TewariBBC News Singapore's borders have effectively been closed for 21 months, so news that rules will finally be relaxed has sent residents rushing for a ticket out. From 19 October, vaccinated people can travel freely from Singapore to a dozen countries around the world - without quarantine and with fewer swab tests. By 15 November, another nine countries will be added to the list. ""The cabin fever was just driving us crazy. There's no demarcation between leisure and work here,"" Low Ka Wei, a corporate communications executive told the BBC. The demand for tickets was so great that travel websites crashed. The Singapore Airlines website went down over the weekend, causing a frenzy among eager travellers and leading to one Reddit thread asking: ""Did we just collectively break SIA's website?"" So, having no luck online, Mr Low and many others went the old-fashioned way, spending hours queueing outside a downtown airline office to book. Hospitals across the UK remain under pressure with long waiting lists, Covid infections on the rise and winter looming. We meet staff at one of England's flagship hospitals, Addenbrooke's in Cambridge, as it gears up for what it expects to be its busiest winter ever. James Wheeler, divisional director of surgery and theatres, says the hospital is fortunate in being able to ring-fence beds in order to keep ""elective surgical patients safe"". He says: ""Any wait is painful to watch. All I can really reassure is that we are doing everything in our powers to get through the backlog patients."" Dr Joseph Newman, a respiratory registrar with Cambridge University Hospitals, tell us this hospital is vaccinating staff against flu and Covid to keep them both safe and in work. ""Staff shortages this time last year were a real issue, adding to the pressure even more, so I think trying to keep everyone fit and healthy is really important,"" he says. Roland Sinker, chief executive of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, says he is ""desperately sorry"" that people are having to wait at all. ""If we can get the hospital teams, the population and partners outside the hospital playing together in a way that we did during Covid, I think we can get through this six to nine-month period,"" he says.

"A potentially risky laser treatment offered to menopausal women to rejuvenate the vagina is no better than sham or fake therapy, researchers say. They tested it ina trial,externalto see if it might ease vaginal dryness and painful sex linked to going through the change. NHS advisory body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says the therapy should only be used for research. Some private clinics in the UK and the US, however, continue to offer it. Laser rejuvenation involves a probe being inserted into the vagina to heat and change or remodel the surrounding tissue. Clinics claim kick-starting the body's healing process by purposefully injuring the tissue can increase natural lubrication and restore sexual gratification. The non-surgical treatment can be completed within a lunch hour but is not entirely risk free, officials say. TheUS regulator,externalhas already said it is ""deeply concerned"" women can be harmed by the procedure. Some who have had it have experienced vaginal burns and scarring. The research, described in the Journal of the American Medical Association, is one of the largest studies to independently scrutinise the therapy using the ""gold standard"" design of a clinical trial. NICE has been calling for this type of work, to determine if the therapy is safe and beneficial enough to recommend for wider use in the NHS. The Australian researchers, not funded by the industry, randomised 85 women to receive either the laser treatment or a placebo procedure - where the probe was inserted but the required ""dose"" of the laser energy not delivered. No serious side-effects were recorded - but during the year of follow-up, there was no discernible difference between the two groups in terms of symptom improvement either. An accompanying editorial in JAMA likened the laser-therapy situation to the recent vaginal-mesh scare, when some women were harmed by a procedure later halted amid safety concerns. Vaginal mesh: 'No-one believed my pain' Mesh patients can have corrective surgery in US The authors, Drs Marisa Adelman and Ingrid Nygaard, from the University of Utah School of Medicine, said: ""The widespread clinical use of vaginal laser therapy, followed by burgeoning reports of adverse events and FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] warnings, brought an unfortunate sense of deja vu. ""After a rush to market vaginal mesh products for the management of pelvic organ prolapse prior to the completion of rigorous randomised trials, these products are no longer marketed in the US. ""Although marketing prior to the availability of evidence demonstrating efficacy and safety may be associated with short-term profits for companies and clinicians, this approach closes any window of opportunity to actually learn what individuals, if any, benefit from the treatment, as well as those at increased risk for harms."" British Menopause Society past-president and spokesman Tim Hillard, a consultant gynaecologist in Dorset, said: ""This is the type of study we have been waiting for. ""It's one of the biggest randomised trials and isn't industry funded. ""It really reinforces that doctors should only be offering this therapy in clinical trials to gather more evidence."" New treatments for menopause symptoms were very much needed and worth researching, Mr Hillard said. ""Symptoms like vaginal dryness, itching and discomfort or pain during intercourse are very common and can be very distressing for women,"" he said. ""It can be difficult to talk about them. ""Many women put up with it and don't seek advice - but there are some treatments that may help and there are specialists who can advise."" Most women will reach menopause between the ages of 45 and 55 Symptoms can begin months or even years before periods stop entirely and continue for years after Hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, mood changes and difficulty sleeping are common Doctors may do a blood test to measure hormone levels and can refer patients to a menopause specialist Hormone-replacement therapy or vaginal oestrogen creams and lubricants may help This video can not be played Menopause: what are the symptoms and why does it happen?

"Luna has scored a victory for oat milk drinkers after convincing Lidl to recall a batch of the drink A Scottish TikToker has won a victory against one of the UK's biggest food retailers after using her platform to campaign for a batch of ""lumpy"" oat milk to be removed. Luna, known as @lunahtic, wanted Lidl to act on her concerns about its oat milk, and after a one-woman campaign, succeeded in having it recalled. Her videos highlighting the problem won millions of views. Lidl has now recalled all its oat milk with a use-by date in the next year. It said fresh batches would be available in stores soon. The 23-year-old student started monitoring the Lidl Just Free oat milk situation in August when she noticed a carton she had purchased was ""lumpy"" and ""smelly"". In one video, Luna put the Lidl milk through a blender after comments from followers which suggested the milk just needed ""a good shake"" ""It's good milk and I've used it for years,"" she said. ""I use four cartons every week and I had bought a big batch of it with the sell by date of 2022. But I noticed when I opened it it was full of lumps and really smelly. ""I thought it was just the one carton but tried a few more and they were all like that. On 15 August I contacted Lidl HQ and asked for a refund for the Â£11.20 I had spent on the milk. ""They never gave me a refund, but said their quality assurance team were looking into it. This went on for ages and I eventually got a refund for one carton."" By this point, Luna was concerned that the milk was still on sale. She took toher TikTok account,externalto vent her frustration. ""Lots of people agreed with me and it got lots of views. But some people said I was storing it wrong, or it was lumps of oat, or I just needed to shake the carton, so I kept going back to buy the milk to show that it was off."" One of her videos went viral, racking up more than three million views in just a few days. To illustrate her concern, she dashes into the store, buys the milk and then pours out the carton outside to show the lumps. She filmed herself cleaning up the mess afterwards. Luna recorded an uncut video to illustrate her point Luna said: ""I did it to hopefully prove to people who were sceptical. Across the country people were tagging me in their videos of this milk and I thought they shouldn't be selling that."" The oat milk mission continued, with Luna contacting Lidl again. She was sent Â£50 in vouchers for the store as a gesture to say the company was taking her concerns seriously, which she spent on items for afood bank,external. More TikTok videos followed and more calls to Lidl HQ. Luna said she was told that the product would not be recalled because it was ""not a health hazard"". The next step was to refer the issue to her local environmental health department. They agreed to investigate. However, Monday brought a breakthrough - Luna revealed to her 57,000 followers that she had been sent paperwork which suggested the milk was finally being removed from stores. An employee sent Luna a recall notice dated 6 October One Lidl employee sent her a recall notice and gave her permission to share it. She said: ""This document shows that all Lidl oat milk in the UK up to the date stated on the letter has to be recalled. ""I spoke to my local Lidl store manager who did tell me the oat milk had been recalled. I was told that new batches of the same oat milk will be back on the shelves really soon and you can guarantee I'll be first in line."" Then, on Tuesday, her report to her local authority environmental health team brought results. The reply said that they had spoken to colleagues at the London Borough of Bexley, which is the primary authority for Lidl UK stores, and they would look into the complaints. Luna compared different brands Lidl told the local authority: ""Our latest oat milk withdrawal was last Wednesday which was sent to all regions. This was due to a number of complaints we had relating to the product being lumpy/white floating bits. Was confirmed not to be a health and safety risk."" A spokesman for Lidl told the BBC on Tuesday: ""At Lidl, it is never our intention for a customer to be dissatisfied in any way and we work very closely with our suppliers to ensure that the products in our stores are of the highest possible quality. ""Following customer feedback we have recalled the affected batch and the product will be back in stores very soon."" Luna said she was delighted her efforts had paid off. ""It's not very often you can get the attention of big company to do things and it might seem like a small thing but a lot of people had experienced the same issue.""

"The Conservative Party chairman says both he and the prime minister are sorry for ""the losses"" resulting from Covid in the UK Oliver Dowden's comments come a day after a report by MPs criticised the government's early handling of the pandemic The NHS Covid Pass, used to show a person's vaccine status for travel and events, stopped working for some users on Wednesday Some 42,776 new Covid cases - the highest daily total since 21 July - and a further 136 deaths have been recorded in the UK From November, the US will reopen its borders with Mexico and Canada to fully vaccinated travellers The UK economy grew by 0.4% in August after Covid restrictions were lifted The care sector in England is struggling to recruit staff, with more jobs unfilled than pre-pandemic, an industry body says Edited by Hamish Mackay We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic now, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's Covid news:  Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization's director general The World Health Organization (WHO) has put forward a list of 26 experts to advise on high-threat pathogens that could jump from animals to humans, sparking the next pandemic. Several of those named served on the WHO mission to Wuhan, China, to try to find out how coronavirus started. The WHO made a public call for experts to join the new Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago) last August. There will now be a two-week period of public consultation before the members are confirmed. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, says that while Covid-19 is ""the latest such virus, it will not be the lastâ. âUnderstanding where new pathogens come from is essential for preventing future outbreaks with epidemic and pandemic potential, and requires a broad range of expertise,"" he adds. Selected from over 700 applications, the 26 proposed Sago members have expertise in areas ranging from epidemiology to biosecurity and public health. They reflect âgeographic and gender diversityâ, says the WHO. With the highest number of daily cases since mid-July, the seven-day average for Covid cases in the UK now stands at 39,073 per day. The seven-day average for deaths, meanwhile, is 113 per day. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst There are reports today in Taiwanese media that mask wearing may be âphased outâ once 70% of the population has been fully vaccinated. According to the Taiwan News website, one mayor on the island has said they will ask Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre to relax existing restrictions once more than 70% of Taiwanâs population have received one vaccine dose. There are expectations that Taiwan will reach this milestone by the end of the month. Currently, Taiwan is following Level 2 restrictions in a four-tier system, where Level 1 is the least severe. Mask-wearing is largely enforced, but there are exceptions, such as in restaurants. Even in Level 1 restrictions, masks must still be worn at all times on public transport and in crowded public venues,according to Taiwanâs Central News Agency.,external This has led to some discussion recently about when people in Taiwan might be able to stop wearing masks altogether. The broadcaster SETN has quoted one toxicologist, Chao Ming-wei, as saying this will potentially by the spring. By this time, Taiwan will have hoped to fully vaccinate 70% of its 23.5m population. However, at present, only around 30% of the population have received two vaccine doses. Taiwan is currently somewhat free of Covid-19. Since the beginning of September, it has consistently only recorded single digit daily cases of the virus. No cases have been confirmed in the last 24 hours. The NHS Covid Pass app is working again, but it has come too late for one man who says it made him miss his flight because he was not able to prove his vaccination status. Chuck Adolphy, who's 24 and from Surrey, arrived at London's Gatwick Airport this morning, looking forward to a holiday in Slovenia. But when he attempted to show his Covid Pass on his phone to EasyJet staff, the app showed an error message. He tried showing his paper vaccination card but says the staff were ""having none of it"" - although he wasn't sure whether they were aware of the issues with the app at the time. Describing the situation as a ""shambles"", he tells the BBC he was turned away and missed his flight as a result. Chuck says the airline have refused to give him a refund so he's hoping to book a new flight tomorrow instead. In response, EasyJet said: âIf any passengers
were unable to board we will provide a free transfer to an alternative flight.
Whilst this is outside of our control we would like to apologise for any
inconvenience caused.â Here's what happened when the app went down. The NHS Covid Pass, used to prove vaccine status for travel and events, is up and running again after it stopped working earlier. At least one person says they missed their flight because of the problem,while others reported being ""stranded"" at an airport unable to fly. Today's figures show the number of new coronavirus infections in the UK are at their highest since July. There were42,776new casesrecorded in the last 24 hour,external. The last time the figure was higher than this was on 21 July when there were44,104new infections. Thedaily coronavirus data,externalfrom the government is out and it shows a further 42,776 new cases have been recorded in the UK. There have also been another 136 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Care homes in Wales are facing their worst crisis ""in living memory"", a leading industry figure says - with the sector left in a ""fragile state"" by the pandemic. Staffing levels are so low that homes could fill 20,000 vacancies within a week if people were available to work, says Mario Kreft, chairman of Care Forum Wales. He adds: ""We've got to find a mechanism to ensure that people are properly rewarded. ""Social care is a vital part of the foundation economy. It's worth over Â£50bn in the UK each year so we shouldn't be looking at cost, we should be looking at value."" One care worker in north Wales says she is dreading the winter as the sector reaches a ""critical point"". Emma Murray, manager of At Home - Vale Senior Care, a domiciliary care service in Denbigh, Denbighshire, says: ""You don't want to deliver care that's unsafe. We're desperate at the moment.""

Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers to get goods to the ports. It has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic. A spokesman for the port of Rotterdam says: ""It's more to do with Covid than anything else because of the balance of empty and full containers being in the wrong place."" Which items are in short supply? Gary Grant, boss of one of the biggest toy sellers in the UK, The Entertainer, says Paw Patrol toys and Barbie dolls are ""prime candidates for being short in the Christmas season."" Steve Parks, director at Seaport Freight which deals with food shipments from overseas says: ""Things like coconut milk, frozen fish and carpets are being delayed from China."" What should you do? Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, says there is ""no need to panic buy"" but advises customers to start their normal shopping process earlier. ""If you see something you want, now is the time to buy as retailers have most of their Christmas stock, but we can't guarantee having supplies of everything over the next few weeks.""

person in Scotland has died as a result of an adverse effect of the Covid-19
jab, according to the National Records of Scotland (NRS). It brings the total number of deaths related to the Covid-19 vaccine up
to five, the NRS says. More than 4.2 million people in Scotland have been given at
least one dose of the vaccine. The five reported deaths are significantly fewer than the 11,262 people that have died because of Covid-19 in Scotland.
Last week, 126 fatalities in Scotland mentioned Covid-19 on the death
certificate. Vaccinations remain the best protection against Covid-19 and
the Department of Health and Social Care continues to urge the population to
get vaccinated. The UK Health Security
AgencyCoronavirus Dashboard,externalreports that more than 94 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been given in the
UK so far. Public Health Scotland advises that side effects to the
jab can be reported on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agencyâs (MHRA)Coronavirus Yellow Card website,external. You can read more about vaccine safetyhere. Coronavirus travel restrictions are affecting tourism in the UK more than most other countries across the world, according to new figures. The London-based World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) - which describes itself as a forum for the industry - is forecasting that spending by tourists visiting the UK will drop by nearly 50% this year compared to 2020. It makes the UK ""one of the worst performing countries in the world"", the organisation says. The WTTC says the travel and tourism sector's contribution to the UK's economy could rise year-on-year by about 32% in 2021 - roughly in line with the global average. But that's being driven in part by the increase in domestic holidays, and it is not enough for a full economic recovery - or to save millions of jobs - says the WTTC. Users trying to access their NHS Covid pass are receiving error messages The NHS Covid Pass, which is used to show a person's vaccination status for travel and events, has stopped working. The feature, contained in the NHS smartphone app, usually allows users to access a barcode or text records about which vaccine doses they have had. Instead, users are receiving error messages or a notice saying that high traffic volumes are ""limiting access to the service"". In a post on Twitter,external, NHS Digital says there are currently issues with accessing the Covid Pass on the NHS App and website and it is investigating. The digital pass can be used by those over 16 years old who were vaccinated in England, Wales or the Isle of Man. Read more. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has recorded no new domestic Covid-19 cases for the seventh consecutive day. State media are lauding this, because in recent weeks, there have been outbreaks in multiple provincial-level regions, including northwest Xinjiang, northeast Heilongjiang and southeast Fujian. These have been suppressed with swift lockdowns, and mass testing drives have helped identify asymptomatic carriers. There is currently only one area of China that has lockdowns in place: the northeast city of Harbin. However, vigilance is high in the country, as last week hundreds of millions of journeys were made for the annual Golden Week holiday (1-7 October). In two weeks time, tens of thousands of people are set to travel again - to Wuhan, the original epicentre of the coronavirus. The city will host the Wuhan Marathon on 24 October and is expected to see 26,000 runners. Organisers say free tickets for the event will be given to medical workers who helped on the front line during the early stages of the pandemic. Robert Gibbon (centre) died with Covid in December 2020 Yesterday, Wales' health minister apologised for her government's handling of the early stages of the pandemic, after a critical report from MPs. But some bereaved families say an apology is not enough and have called for a separate inquiry into the Welsh response to Covid. Rhianna Gibbon, from Merthyr Tydfil, lost her father Robert, 63, to Covid in December 2020, after he was sent home from hospital due to ""overrun"" corridors. She says lessons should have been learned for the second wave after the delay in introducing the first national lockdown. ""An apology is just not enough. My dad was just one of thousands of people who lost their lives unnecessarily,"" she tells BBC Radio Wales. ""I accept the apology, they've taken responsibility, but this is one of the biggest health issues ever. They [the government] should be held accountable.""

BBC Monitoring Russia is threatening to include British newspaper articles about itsSputnik V coronavirus vaccineon the âfake news"" section of its Foreign Ministry website unless they apologise. It wants papers to retract claims that Russian developers copied the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to create Sputnik V. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says: ""They still have a chance to save a semblance of dignity and respect for the reader and offer their apologies to the Russian developers of the vaccine."" The Russian Foreign Ministry's press office collects what it describes as âarticles circulating untrue information about Russia"". They include articles in the Western media about World War Two that Russia says amount to a ""falsification of history"", stories about the nerve agent poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, and what Russia calls the West's propaganda war on Russian vaccines. Earlier this week, UK Home Office minister Damian Hinds would not be drawn on allegations that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's design was used to create Russia's Sputnik V jab, instead saying more generally that ""state activity"" was involved in ""industrial espionage"". The number of people who died in Scotland last week was 30% higher than the average before the pandemic began.. There were 1,353 deaths - from all causes - registered in the week to 10 October, the National Records of Scotland said. It's 315 more than the average for that week from 2015 to 2019. It's also the highest rate of ""excess"" deaths since the first week of January. They include deaths caused by things like cancer, heart disease or dementia. The number of deaths where Covid was mentioned in registration has fallen for a second week, to 126. The number of deaths linked to the pandemic had been rising since mid-August, but appears to have peaked in the week ending 27 September at 167 - far below previous peaks during the initial outbreak of the virus and at the start of 2021.

Suranjana TewariBBC News Singapore's borders have effectively been closed for 21 months, so news that rules will finally be relaxed has sent residents rushing for a ticket out. From 19 October, vaccinated people can travel freely from Singapore to a dozen countries around the world - without quarantine and with fewer swab tests. By 15 November, another nine countries will be added to the list. ""The cabin fever was just driving us crazy. There's no demarcation between leisure and work here,"" Low Ka Wei, a corporate communications executive told the BBC. The demand for tickets was so great that travel websites crashed. The Singapore Airlines website went down over the weekend, causing a frenzy among eager travellers and leading to one Reddit thread asking: ""Did we just collectively break SIA's website?"" So, having no luck online, Mr Low and many others went the old-fashioned way, spending hours queueing outside a downtown airline office to book. Hospitals across the UK remain under pressure with long waiting lists, Covid infections on the rise and winter looming. We meet staff at one of England's flagship hospitals, Addenbrooke's in Cambridge, as it gears up for what it expects to be its busiest winter ever. James Wheeler, divisional director of surgery and theatres, says the hospital is fortunate in being able to ring-fence beds in order to keep ""elective surgical patients safe"". He says: ""Any wait is painful to watch. All I can really reassure is that we are doing everything in our powers to get through the backlog patients."" Dr Joseph Newman, a respiratory registrar with Cambridge University Hospitals, tell us this hospital is vaccinating staff against flu and Covid to keep them both safe and in work. ""Staff shortages this time last year were a real issue, adding to the pressure even more, so I think trying to keep everyone fit and healthy is really important,"" he says. Roland Sinker, chief executive of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, says he is ""desperately sorry"" that people are having to wait at all. ""If we can get the hospital teams, the population and partners outside the hospital playing together in a way that we did during Covid, I think we can get through this six to nine-month period,"" he says.

"We all knew it was coming, but now it's official: Squid Game has become Netflix's biggest ever series launch. The Korean drama was watched by 111 million users in its first 28 days, knocking Bridgerton (82 million) off the top spot. Netflix counts a view as anyone who's watched two minutes of an episode. Netflix's vice president for content in Korea, South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand says the show's success is ""beyond our wildest dreams"". Minyoung Kim told CNN: ""When we first started investing in Korean series and films in 2015, we knew we wanted to make world-class stories for the core K-content fans across Asia and the world. ""Today, Squid Game has broken through beyond our wildest dreams."" The nine-part series, which debuted in September, tells the story of a group of misfits taking part in a series of children's playground games. There's a prize of 45.6bn Korean won (Â£28m) up for grabs, which doesn't sound too bad until you realise if you lose, you get killed. Squid Game subtitles 'change meaning of the show' Why 26 Korean words have been added to the dictionary From celebrities to sports stars, everyone's been talking about Squid Game. The show's actors have shot to international fame - Jung Ho-yeon, who plays Sae-byeok, has gained 14 million Instagram followers since it launched on 17 September,Forbes says,external. So what's the secret to the drama's success? Warning - the rest of this article contains some mild spoilers... Similar in some ways to The Hunger Games, or the 2000 movie Battle Royale, the show focuses on a group of people in South Korea desperately in debt. They're first tricked (then volunteer) into playing a deadly tournament of children's games, realising this may be their only chance to win the money they need to survive. Chloe Henry is a fan of Korean shows and says Squid Game stands out from the others. ""It's not something that's been done before,"" the 26-year-old from Sheffield tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""With other shows, you can guess what's going to happen whereas this one is more 'wow' - a shock that you weren't expecting."" Chloe feels the actors did a great job in keeping the audience hooked She feels the characters and intense acting keep you connected to the show. ""The actor who plays Seong Gi-hun, his emotion was so raw and it was so interesting to watch."" Seong Gi-hun is a loveable gambling addict with huge debts and facing the loss of his daughter. He's the show's main character. Chloe says the drama also gives viewers a different perception of South Korea. ""People in general think of South Korea as a big flash country with a lot of rich people, so it's nice to see the other side that is not really spoken about, like the struggle and poverty.""

As in the Oscar-winning Korean film, Parasite, the hardship seen in Squid Game is what makes it appealing to an international audience, says Dr Hye-Kyung Lee - who's researching the rise of K-drama and K-pop at King's College London. ""These dramas or films are entertaining, and they have something unique which can strike a chord with people around the world. ""They present a critique of society and social economic conditions, which people can relate to through the characters."" Squid Game: How one Netflix show gripped the world 'This sign will not lead you to Squid Game' Dr Lee says other Korean dramas do touch on issues of society, economy and politics, but Squid Game has been far more direct in its approach. ""It's serious, the message is extreme and I think that reflects what's happening right now."" The violence, which means the show's not recommended for anyone under the age of 15, is part of Squid Game's appeal for Chloe.

"Incidents have been reported at the US embassy in Bogota US officials are investigating possible cases of Havana syndrome illness in Colombia, days before a visit by the Secretary of State, US media say. US embassy staff in Bogota may have been injured by the mysterious illness, which causes a painful sound in the ears, fatigue and dizziness. First reported in Cuba in 2016, US diplomats around the world have since reported cases of the syndrome. Its origins are unknown, with some speculating it is a type of weapon. On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal first reported that emails sent by US Ambassador to Colombia Philip Goldberg confirmed a number of ""unexplained health incidents"" or UHIs - the term used for Havana syndrome by the US government - since mid-September. Colombian President IvÃ¡n Duque told the New York Times that the country is investigating the reports. He added that the US is leading the inquiry. Americans who have been hit by Havana syndrome have described an intense and painful sound in their ears. Some of the estimated 200 affected have been left with dizziness and fatigue for months.â¯ More than half of those impacted were CIA employees, according to the Times. âHavana syndromeâ and the mystery of the microwaves On Friday, reports of Havana syndrome emerged at the US embassy in Berlin. President Joe Biden released a statement vowing to find ""the cause and who is responsible"". It came hours after he signed a new law that entitles the heads of the CIA and State Department to provide financial compensation to those US government employees who have been harmed by the syndrome. A State Department official refused to confirm the reports to BBC News on Tuesday. In a statement, the official said ""we are vigorously investigating reports of AHIs wherever they are reported,"" and that they are ""actively working to identify the cause of these incidents and whether they may be attributed to a foreign actor"". The news comes ahead of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's scheduled travel to Bogota next week. In August, Vice-President Kamala Harris delayed travel to Vietnam after two US officials were medically evacuated from the country after falling ill. âHavana syndromeâ and the mystery of the microwaves Berlin police probe Havana syndrome at US embassy CIA officer 'develops Havana syndrome' in India CIA 'removes Vienna boss' over Havana syndrome Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"The UK economy grew by 0.4% in August as more people dined out, went on holiday and attended music festivals. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the services sector made the biggest contribution to economic growth in the first full month after all Covid restrictions were lifted in England. It said arts, entertainment and recreation grew 9%, boosted by sports clubs, amusement parks and festivals. There was also more demand for hotels and campsites. Restrictions on social distancing were eased from 19 July. The ONS said the economy is now 0.8% smaller than it was before the pandemic. ""The economy picked up in August as bars, restaurants and festivals benefited from the first full month without Covid-19 restrictions in England,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""However, later and slightly weaker data from a number of industries now mean we estimate the economy fell a little overall in July."" The ONS said economic growth fell by 0.1% in July compared with initial estimates of 0.1% growth. Activity in accommodation and food services rose by 10.3% in August, within which hotels and campsites recorded 22.9% growth. In travel, air transport and rail both grew in August as Covid-related measures eased, however both industry are still trading far below pre-pandemic levels. Emma-Lou Montgomery associate director at Fidelity International, said that while August's growth ""marks a small rebound"" on July, ""the worry remains that economic growth won't even be in touching distance of pre-pandemic levels until well into next year"". She said supply chain disruption risks dampening consumer confidence. ""This all comes in the crucial lead up to Christmas, when suppliers and retailers should be firing on all cylinders,"" Ms Montgomery said.""But with households facing steep price rises for everyday items, from the food shop through to the gas bill, there will be little desire - or capacity - to spend, spend, spend."" Growth in the economy - everything produced, from new cars to haircuts to restaurant meals - isn't at all slow by normal standards at 0.4% in a month. But we're supposed to be bouncing back with growth of 7% this year. What's becoming increasingly clear, is that it's not a lack of demand for goods and services that's holding the recovery back but the inability of firms to supply that demand. A big part of the reason? Shortages. In construction, for example, where business is not growing but shrinking, firms reported to the ONS that they've got healthy order books. But they can't meet more orders, partly because of a shortage of materials in August (for example, wood and steel) and partly because of a shortage of skilled staff. The ONS reports evidence that the shortage of haulage drivers is slowing down industries from pharmaceuticals to electric lighting. Exports of goods, too, are down by 13% compared with 2018. Some of these shortages may be due to supply bottlenecks related to the post-pandemic global surge in activity. But without doubt some, notably the ongoing shortage of lorry drivers, are in large part related to Brexit. Elsewhere, economic growth was uneven with some sectors hit by shortages of materials. Output in construction fell by 0.2% in August and the sector remains 1.5% below pre-pandemic levels. The ONS said: ""This reflects recent challenges faced by the construction industry from rising input prices and delays to the availability of construction products - notably steel, concrete, timber and glass."" The manufacturing sector expanded by 0.5% in August following a 0.6% in July. The ONS said growth was led by an increase in vehicle production ""as it continues to recover following supply side challenges predominantly caused by the global microchip shortage disrupting car production"". But it said the output in the manufacture of motor vehicles remains 14.5% below a peak in February this year. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""Such drags may have become more widespread and significant in September and October, with the fuel crisis preventing some people from getting to work."" He said Capital Economics' activity indicator ""suggests that GDP may not have increased at all in September"". Martin Beck, economist at professional services firm, EY,said: ""The recovery is certainly facing more headwinds. ""Rising inflation, driven by significant increases in energy prices, and the recent cut in Universal Credit are squeezing consumers' spending power.""

Help wasn't able to arrive in time to stop it ending with one driver dead and another seriously injured.

It was edging close to 22:30 on a Friday night in 2019, with traffic flow on the M4 busier than normal. Penny Roberts and her family had spent the week in London and were now among that traffic, heading home to west Wales. Penny Roberts believes her decision to ask partner Mark to drive may well have saved their lives It was such a regular journey that she, and her partner Mark, had an established routine to share the driving. As they neared Newport it would normally be her turn to drive, but that night Mark was at the wheel. ""We'd stopped at junction 24 to get coffee, I just didn't feel like driving so asked Mark to carry on instead,"" she recalls. ""I'm just so relieved that he did. I'm not sure we'd still be here if it wasn't for him."" They finished their coffees and rejoined the westbound carriageway, cruising at about 65mph. Penny rode in the passenger seat of her small Mercedes A class car. Her 23-year-old daughter, boyfriend and the family dog squeezed in the back seat; the boot crammed full of luggage. They passed the slip road for junction 26 at Malpas, and were gaining steadily on the car in front when Mark indicated and moved out to the middle lane to overtake. ""At that point we were heading uphill, and all I could see ahead of me was red tail lights,"" he said. And then he did a double take. ""Amongst all the red, I saw the glare of white headlights, moving across from the left. I then realised very quickly that a car was on the wrong side of the road and it was coming towards us, at speed."" Man hit by speeding car forgives teen driver Losing son in moped crash 'a living hell' Man hit by car outside pub is 'happy to be alive' He stayed calm and planned a course of action. ""I decided to stay in the middle lane and just concentrate totally on the vehicle coming at us, on the grounds that if they swerved I would have to take evasive action,"" he said. A tense five or six seconds ticked by, before the silver Vauxhall Astra careered past in the outside lane, just half a metre from the driver side of their car. Mark recalls looking in his rear view mirror to see the car behind them veering across all three lanes as its driver desperately avoided a collision. ""It all happened in a split second, but it was absolutely terrifying,"" said Penny. ""Mark's a very good driver - he saw the car and kept his nerve. ""I don't know how he had time to comprehend all of that, but he did. I can't be sure that I would have done the same."" Penny, a former BBC Wales journalist, took out her phone and joined the flurry of motorists frantically dialling 999. The Vauxhall Astra continued driving the wrong way on the M4 before colliding with a BMW At the same time, Shifa Begum and her husband Walie were on the eastbound carriageway, travelling home to Weston-super-Mare. Their three children, aged 10, six and 15 months, were all fast asleep in the back. Her husband, who was driving, suddenly asked: ""Can you see that? There's a car - it's going the wrong way!"" She looked to her right, and saw they were keeping pace with a car as it travelled along the opposite carriageway. ""I grabbed my phone and called the police, but I was just so shocked that nothing was coming out of my mouth,"" she said. She put her phone on speaker and let her husband do the talking. ""He was trying to stay calm, because we didn't want to wake the kids and scare them. All I could think was that I hope that person manages to get off the road."" ""It's a Vauxhall Astra I think,"" Walie tells the operator. ""They're still going, they're not stopping."" ""Are they going fast?"" asks the operator. ""Well, we're doing 50 now, and ... oh! There's been a crash! They've hit a car!"" ""Seeing the moment they crashed like that was just horrendous, I couldn't breathe, I felt physically sick,"" said Shifa. ""We slowed right down and Walie asked me should he go and help? He really wanted to stop, but we had kids in the car. I said there was no way he could just run across the motorway."" Realising they had done all they could, they carried on. ""I was literally shaking, all the way home. My legs were like jelly. I just couldn't stop thinking about it,"" she said. The silver Vauxhall Astra, which the callers had seen travelling in the wrong direction, had crashed head-on into a black one series BMW, in lane three of the westbound carriageway. As Gwent Police forensic collision investigator Dean Burnett arrived at the scene, fire crews were working to free the 21-year-old driver of the BMW, who was seriously injured. The 38-year-old woman at the wheel of the Astra had died. Collision investigator Dean Burnett at the junction where witnesses saw the Vauxhall Astra turn left and drive up the slip road As Mr Burnett carried out a painstaking analysis of the scene evidence, he needed to find out why the woman was travelling on the wrong carriageway. Inquiries revealed how horrified witnesses saw her make a left-hand turn from the intersection at junction 28 in Newport. She lived locally, and was thought to be familiar with the junction lay out - yet still drove up the wrong slip road, towards oncoming traffic. She then continued for 2.8 miles before crashing into the BMW - but not without numerous close calls with other vehicles in the minutes beforehand. At an inquest into the woman's death, the coroner said it was hard to understand why the driver did not realise her mistake and pull over on to the hard shoulder. But blood tests revealed she was two-and-a-half times the legal alcohol limit to drive and she had also taken cocaine. Mr Burnett said: ""I was under no illusions at all that that level of intoxication was a significant, if not the main contributory factor in this collision."" The 21-year-old BMW driver had life-changing injuries, but the terrifying reality faced by numerous other unsuspecting motorists that night, was captured on motorway CCTV. With more than 20 years' experience investigating serious and fatal collisions, the impact of what he saw in the footage was not lost on Mr Burnett. ""There's some serious near misses. You can only imagine what those drivers are going through. It's horrific. ""Motorways are statistically our safest roads - because we're all going in the same direction, so the last thing you expect is something travelling towards you,"" said Mr Burnett. The natural instinct for most drivers faced with that scenario, is to brake and swerve - and this is seen numerous times in the CCTV. Amongst all the red lights there was the glare of white headlights But he added that there are ways to be on guard to deal with such unexpected issues on the road - and that is to stay alert, and always be looking well ahead. ""Motorways especially are where drivers tend to switch off more, because the traffic is going in the same direction. Extend your observations at all times, so you can see any changes in road circumstances in front of you. ""It's more of an effort to do this at night, when you're tired and it's dark and you're less likely to be alert, but this is a good example of why, even when you're tired, you still need to have your wits about you."" As soon as she got home, Shifa Begum began searching online, desperate to know the outcome. ""When I saw that the woman had died, I just felt numb, I've never seen anything like that before and wouldn't like to see it again."" And she pledged that from that day on, she would never drive on the motorway again. ""All these different scenarios just go through your head. I'm so scared now."" Penny Roberts is still regularly travelling between west Wales and London - but two years on, the experience is never far from her mind. ""I can't drive down that stretch of road without thinking about how we could have all been killed, and how my other daughter would have been left alone. ""I feel desperately sorry for the man who was injured, as well as the woman's family and her children. But I'm also very angry. Cars are lethal weapons, and can destroy lives. ""A matter of seconds could have been the difference between life and death for the four of us.""

"""I suppose you've rung me to talk about the Northern Ireland Protocol..."", comes the weary voice down the phone. It's not diplomats or politicians from any particular EU country who greet me like that these days. It's the reaction I get pretty much across the board. Four years of Brexit negotiations before the UK's final departure in January last year have left the EU with no appetite for more. Member states are far more focused on struggling with post-Covid economic challenges, soaring gas prices and smouldering intra-EU strife with Poland and Hungary. The last thing EU capitals say they need or want right now is a trade war with the UK. But tensions over the Northern Ireland Protocol are real. Brussels and London agree - though to differing degrees - that the protocol isn't working well for the people of Northern Ireland. On Tuesday, the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost called for far-reaching changes to the text. Frost proposes new NI protocol in Brexit row Why are there tensions over the NI Brexit deal? Brussels views this as a demand for a rewrite, and the EU is refusing to renegotiate the protocol's framework. It was drawn up as part of the Brexit divorce deal, known as the Withdrawal Agreement. The result of an effort by EU and UK negotiators to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - dividing Northern Ireland, which is part of post-Brexit UK, from EU member state Ireland. The fear was that a customs border between them might endanger the peace process. And that's how Northern Ireland - which is legally part of the UK customs union - ended up also remaining in the EU customs union and single market for goods after Brexit, as set out in the protocol. This ""exceptional solution"" as the negotiators saw it, was an attempt to recognise the exceptional case of Northern Ireland, to avoid that hard border with the Republic of Ireland and to safeguard the peace process after Brexit. But, to protect the EU's single market from goods potentially flooding in unchecked from the UK, Brussels insisted customs checks needed to be carried out between Great Britain and Northern Ireland - if they weren't going to take place on the island of Ireland. This has angered unionists in the North, who feel they are being severed from the United Kingdom. Lord Frost and others in the UK government warn the Protocol is upsetting the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland, thereby endangering the peace process the agreement was supposed to protect. But Brussels insists this is an international treaty signed knowingly at the time by the UK government. It says it is happy to work on ironing out any day-to-day practical difficulties of the protocol, raised by businesses and civil society in Northern Ireland. But the EU wants to make clear this week that it is not bowing to ""attempts at bullying"" by London, in the words of one European diplomat I spoke to. The EU describes its new proposals as ""practical steps to solve concrete problems"". It says it wants to ensure the smooth arrival of medicines from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. Because it has heard complaints in Northern Ireland that regulations are being made concerning life there, without local involvement, Brussels will undertake this week to consult more with the authorities and businesses there. Lord Frost said on Tuesday that British people ""voted for change and that's what they expect"" And while the EU insists that waiving customs checks altogether would endanger its single market, EU insiders say new measures being suggested this week to reduce the number of checks on goods and animal products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland (and therefore potentially onwards into the EU single market) already go too far for some EU member states. However, for now, Brussels is refusing to engage with Lord Frost's demand to remove the role of the European Court of Justice in the protocol. The ECJ is a red rag to many Brexit supporters including in the governing Conservative party. David Frost said on Tuesday he wanted to see the Protocol changed to become ""like a normal treaty in the way it is governed, with international arbitration instead of a system of EU law ultimately policed in the court of one of the parties, the European Court of Justice"". But again the EU insists the protocol is no normal treaty. It says that Northern Ireland's ongoing participation in the EU customs union and single market means in those areas it is subject to EU regulations and those, in turn, are always policed by the European Court of Justice. Yet there is some wiggle room here. In its agreements with sovereignty-minded Switzerland, the EU has an additional layer of oversight - placing the ECJ very much at arm's length. But even if Brussels eventually suggested this, would the UK government go for it? On Tuesday, Baroness Chapman, shadow Brexit Minister in the Labour Party, accused senior Conservatives of being ""desperate to use a tussle with Brussels"" to distract from what she described as the government's domestic failures - whether on Covid or the current energy crisis. A number of EU diplomats I've spoken to have echoed this sentiment. They're not convinced the government wants to resolve the protocol situation with Brussels, they say. At least not right away. That is an accusation denied by the UK government. Details of the proposed changes will be given by European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic later on Wednesday In fact, Lord Frost says he's put together the legal text of a ""forward-looking"" new protocol which he has passed to the European Commission for consideration. For now, despite some barbed exchanges by individual politicians (take a look at this weekend's Twitter spat between Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and Lord Frost) both the EU and the UK insist theirs are not take-it-or-leave-it positions. Both sides say they're open to discussion over the coming weeks. Lord Frost called on Brussels to be ""ambitious"" and to work together with the UK to agree ""a better way forward"". The EU is calling for ""constructive dialogue"". Let's see. The UK government has threatened to suspend parts of the protocol if it deems that to be necessary. The EU assumption is that, even if talks go badly, the UK would be unlikely to take such action before mid-November when the international COP26 climate summit in Glasgow comes to an end. This would avoid a big UK moment on the global stage being dominated by headlines about a row with Brussels and the possible endangering of the Northern Ireland peace process. But Brussels is readying itself for every eventuality. Key EU member states say they've asked the European Commission to prepare ""targeted retaliation"" if, for example, the UK suddenly stops customs checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. One possibility you hear mentioned is that the EU could start new legal proceedings against the UK and/or suspend parts of its post-Brexit ""zero tariff zero quota"" trade agreement with the UK. The idea would be to target strategic UK markets like whisky or cars ""to send a clear message to London"", according to EU diplomats I've spoken to. As bilateral discussions start again in earnest over the Northern Ireland Protocol, there's definite potential for things to get a lot messier.

"A potentially risky laser treatment offered to menopausal women to rejuvenate the vagina is no better than sham or fake therapy, researchers say. They tested it ina trial,externalto see if it might ease vaginal dryness and painful sex linked to going through the change. NHS advisory body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says the therapy should only be used for research. Some private clinics in the UK and the US, however, continue to offer it. Laser rejuvenation involves a probe being inserted into the vagina to heat and change or remodel the surrounding tissue. Clinics claim kick-starting the body's healing process by purposefully injuring the tissue can increase natural lubrication and restore sexual gratification. The non-surgical treatment can be completed within a lunch hour but is not entirely risk free, officials say. TheUS regulator,externalhas already said it is ""deeply concerned"" women can be harmed by the procedure. Some who have had it have experienced vaginal burns and scarring. The research, described in the Journal of the American Medical Association, is one of the largest studies to independently scrutinise the therapy using the ""gold standard"" design of a clinical trial. NICE has been calling for this type of work, to determine if the therapy is safe and beneficial enough to recommend for wider use in the NHS. The Australian researchers, not funded by the industry, randomised 85 women to receive either the laser treatment or a placebo procedure - where the probe was inserted but the required ""dose"" of the laser energy not delivered. No serious side-effects were recorded - but during the year of follow-up, there was no discernible difference between the two groups in terms of symptom improvement either. An accompanying editorial in JAMA likened the laser-therapy situation to the recent vaginal-mesh scare, when some women were harmed by a procedure later halted amid safety concerns. Vaginal mesh: 'No-one believed my pain' Mesh patients can have corrective surgery in US The authors, Drs Marisa Adelman and Ingrid Nygaard, from the University of Utah School of Medicine, said: ""The widespread clinical use of vaginal laser therapy, followed by burgeoning reports of adverse events and FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] warnings, brought an unfortunate sense of deja vu. ""After a rush to market vaginal mesh products for the management of pelvic organ prolapse prior to the completion of rigorous randomised trials, these products are no longer marketed in the US. ""Although marketing prior to the availability of evidence demonstrating efficacy and safety may be associated with short-term profits for companies and clinicians, this approach closes any window of opportunity to actually learn what individuals, if any, benefit from the treatment, as well as those at increased risk for harms."" British Menopause Society past-president and spokesman Tim Hillard, a consultant gynaecologist in Dorset, said: ""This is the type of study we have been waiting for. ""It's one of the biggest randomised trials and isn't industry funded. ""It really reinforces that doctors should only be offering this therapy in clinical trials to gather more evidence."" New treatments for menopause symptoms were very much needed and worth researching, Mr Hillard said. ""Symptoms like vaginal dryness, itching and discomfort or pain during intercourse are very common and can be very distressing for women,"" he said. ""It can be difficult to talk about them. ""Many women put up with it and don't seek advice - but there are some treatments that may help and there are specialists who can advise."" Most women will reach menopause between the ages of 45 and 55 Symptoms can begin months or even years before periods stop entirely and continue for years after Hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, mood changes and difficulty sleeping are common Doctors may do a blood test to measure hormone levels and can refer patients to a menopause specialist Hormone-replacement therapy or vaginal oestrogen creams and lubricants may help This video can not be played Menopause: what are the symptoms and why does it happen?

"The protocol avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland The EU has released its plan for a reduction of post-Brexit checks on goods and medicines arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland has a special Brexit deal which keeps it in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But it means goods arriving from Britain face checks and controls. The UK government said it is studying the detail of the EU's proposals. The new plan, which seeks to calm a long-running dispute over a key part of the Brexit agreement, would remove about 80% of spot checks, the EU said. The EU said customs paperwork would also be cut by 50%. Most food products will not need to be physically checked when arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. A cut to the required administration for Northern Ireland importers. Expanded trusted trader arrangements meaning more products and companies are exempt from customs tariffs. Change to current laws to ensure no disruption to  moving medicines across the Irish Sea. Improved engagement with stakeholders in Northern Ireland including politicians and business groups. The UK says the current arrangement imposes too many barriers. At the start of the year, the new post-Brexit arrangement -known as the Northern Ireland Protocol- was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It involves keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods - but this, in turn, creates a new trade border with Great Britain. Unionists say this undermines their place in the UK. Sinn FÃ©in seeks NI Assembly recall over EU proposals Brexit Minister Lord Frost said the protocol - which the UK originally agreed to - was harming the peace process in Northern Irelandand that it undermined the Good Friday Agreement. The EU acknowledges that it has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and is now attempting to ease that burden with what it calls ""a different model"". This video can not be played Watch the lorry journey from England to NI It has produced ""bespoke arrangements"" covering food, customs and medicines. European Commission Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ said he had listened to, and engaged with, those in Northern Ireland. ""Today's proposals are a direct, genuine response to their concerns,"" he said. ""We have put a lot of hard work into them to make a tangible change on the ground."" Maros Å efÄoviÄ says he has listened to and engaged with those in Northern Ireland He said he looked forward to ""engaging earnestly and intensively"" with the UK government. Some firms in Northern Ireland affected by the protocol say supply chains are being disrupted, andwhile there may be opportunities, there are also some problems. On Wednesday, a UK government spokesman said the next step should be a ""rapidly conducted"" round of intensive talks on both the UK and EU proposals. ""Significant changes which tackle the fundamental issues at the heart of the protocol, including governance, must be made if we are to agree a durable settlement which commands support in Northern Ireland,"" he said. A solution is needed that both safeguards the Good Friday Agreement and ""puts the UK-EU relationship on a stronger footing"", he added. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley told the BBC's Newsnight programme that Prime Minister Boris Johnson told him ""personally that after agreeing to the protocol he would sign up to changing that protocol and indeed tearing it up, that this was just for the semantics"". ""I do believe that the government didn't really want this to happen to Northern Ireland and they took a short term bet. ""The trouble is this has cost the business people of Northern Ireland Â£850m which we can't afford, so it's got to be fixed and it's got to be fixed fast."" Talks between the EU and UK on the new proposals are now likely to go on for several weeks. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the proposals were a ""major effort"" to address the post-Brexit trade rules between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. ""Meats, whether they're chilled meats or other food stuffs, can come into Northern Ireland and if they're staying in Northern Ireland then the checks that are currently required will not be required,"" he said. This would be dependent on proper sharing of data and proper labelling, he added. There are also plans to give Northern Ireland politicians and other interested parties greater influence over the implementation of the protocol. However, the measures will fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from an oversight role. This video can not be played Lord Frost says the NI Protocol is ânot being implemented with the necessary sensitivity"" and it had to be ""redone"". On Tuesday, the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frostproposed plans for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing one. As part of these plans, the UK government wants to reverse its previous agreement on the oversight role of the ECJ, which is the EU's highest court. The agreement states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland - so for example, if there was a dispute around complying with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ. The movement of food products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have faced the biggest difficulties due to the EU's strict rules. The Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal:It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU). It means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules:As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland. But some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all:EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found. Read more:The Northern Ireland Protocol explained The EU says its new plan for food means that most products destined for consumers will not need to be physically checked when arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. A grace period, which means the protocol is not being fully implemented, currently means that supermarkets do not face a full range of controls. The EU says its new proposals will go beyond this and cover more businesses. It says the level of identity and physical checks will be up to 80% lower compared to other single market borders. However, it says for this to work it will need the UK to build properly equipped border posts at Northern Ireland's ports, allow access to real time trade data and implement ""only for sale in UK"" labelling. The possibility also remains that some GB food products could be banned in Northern Ireland. The EU maintains a ""prohibited and restricted"" list of food imports, which includes chilled meat products like fresh sausages. The EU is proposing that ""national identity goods"", or those which do not have a non-GB supply chain, would be exempt, but that leaves open the possibility that some goods could be banned. On customs, the EU is proposing what it calls a ""unique facilitation"" for paperwork, which it says will mean Northern Ireland importers can submit a greatly reduced amount of information. It estimates this will halve the administrative burden. It will also expand the concept of ""goods not at risk"" - this is an existing arrangement which Northern Ireland traders use so they do not have to pay EU tariffs on GB goods. Why is there a Brexit row over a European court? Katya Adler: Will talks lead to truce or trade war? 'We do see opportunities, but have had problems' The EU says the combination of the agri-food and customs proposals will effectively create an ""express lane"" to help facilitate the movements of GB goods whose end destination is Northern Ireland. Thesupply of medicinesfrom Great Britain to Northern Ireland has emerged as one of the most difficult issues. Pharmaceutical distributors have warned that if the current protocol was fully implemented they would have to withdraw hundreds of products from sale in Northern Ireland. The EU is now proposing to change its laws around the regulation of medicines to keep products flowing. Mr Å efÄoviÄ has previously said he will do ""whatever it takes"" to guarantee the supply of medicines. This is a complicated area and the pharmaceutical industry will need time to assess if the plan will work. Some unionists in Northern Ireland have held street protests against the protocol The EU originally floated a version of this idea in July but the industry was unconvinced at that time. The proposals for giving Northern Ireland politicians and other stakeholders a greater voice include the establishment of structured groups to provide a forum for discussion on key issues. It would also see interested parties invited to some meetings of the Specialised Committee, one of the joint UK/EU bodies that oversee the protocol. The EU says it also wants to create a stronger link between the Northern Ireland Assembly and the EU/UK Parliamentary Partnership Assembly. It also intends to create a website to track which EU legislation is applicable in Northern Ireland. The headline was amended on 1 December, 2021, to make clear that the EU offer of fewer checks is a proposal only.

The new plan, which seeks to calm a long-running dispute over a key part of the Brexit agreement, would remove about 80% of spot checks, the EU said. The EU said customs paperwork would also be cut by 50%. Most food products will not need to be physically checked when arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. A cut to the required administration for Northern Ireland importers. Expanded trusted trader arrangements meaning more products and companies are exempt from customs tariffs. Change to current laws to ensure no disruption to  moving medicines across the Irish Sea. Improved engagement with stakeholders in Northern Ireland including politicians and business groups. The UK says the current arrangement imposes too many barriers. At the start of the year, the new post-Brexit arrangement -known as the Northern Ireland Protocol- was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It involves keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods - but this, in turn, creates a new trade border with Great Britain. Unionists say this undermines their place in the UK. Sinn FÃ©in seeks NI Assembly recall over EU proposals Brexit Minister Lord Frost said the protocol - which the UK originally agreed to - was harming the peace process in Northern Irelandand that it undermined the Good Friday Agreement. The EU acknowledges that it has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and is now attempting to ease that burden with what it calls ""a different model"".

European Commission Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ said he had listened to, and engaged with, those in Northern Ireland. ""Today's proposals are a direct, genuine response to their concerns,"" he said. ""We have put a lot of hard work into them to make a tangible change on the ground."" Maros Å efÄoviÄ says he has listened to and engaged with those in Northern Ireland He said he looked forward to ""engaging earnestly and intensively"" with the UK government. Some firms in Northern Ireland affected by the protocol say supply chains are being disrupted, andwhile there may be opportunities, there are also some problems. On Wednesday, a UK government spokesman said the next step should be a ""rapidly conducted"" round of intensive talks on both the UK and EU proposals. ""Significant changes which tackle the fundamental issues at the heart of the protocol, including governance, must be made if we are to agree a durable settlement which commands support in Northern Ireland,"" he said. A solution is needed that both safeguards the Good Friday Agreement and ""puts the UK-EU relationship on a stronger footing"", he added. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley told the BBC's Newsnight programme that Prime Minister Boris Johnson told him ""personally that after agreeing to the protocol he would sign up to changing that protocol and indeed tearing it up, that this was just for the semantics"". ""I do believe that the government didn't really want this to happen to Northern Ireland and they took a short term bet. ""The trouble is this has cost the business people of Northern Ireland Â£850m which we can't afford, so it's got to be fixed and it's got to be fixed fast."" Talks between the EU and UK on the new proposals are now likely to go on for several weeks. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the proposals were a ""major effort"" to address the post-Brexit trade rules between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. ""Meats, whether they're chilled meats or other food stuffs, can come into Northern Ireland and if they're staying in Northern Ireland then the checks that are currently required will not be required,"" he said. This would be dependent on proper sharing of data and proper labelling, he added. There are also plans to give Northern Ireland politicians and other interested parties greater influence over the implementation of the protocol. However, the measures will fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from an oversight role. This video can not be played Lord Frost says the NI Protocol is ânot being implemented with the necessary sensitivity"" and it had to be ""redone"". On Tuesday, the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frostproposed plans for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing one. As part of these plans, the UK government wants to reverse its previous agreement on the oversight role of the ECJ, which is the EU's highest court. The agreement states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland - so for example, if there was a dispute around complying with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ. The movement of food products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have faced the biggest difficulties due to the EU's strict rules. The Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal:It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU). It means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules:As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland. But some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all:EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found. Read more:The Northern Ireland Protocol explained The EU says its new plan for food means that most products destined for consumers will not need to be physically checked when arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. A grace period, which means the protocol is not being fully implemented, currently means that supermarkets do not face a full range of controls. The EU says its new proposals will go beyond this and cover more businesses. It says the level of identity and physical checks will be up to 80% lower compared to other single market borders. However, it says for this to work it will need the UK to build properly equipped border posts at Northern Ireland's ports, allow access to real time trade data and implement ""only for sale in UK"" labelling. The possibility also remains that some GB food products could be banned in Northern Ireland. The EU maintains a ""prohibited and restricted"" list of food imports, which includes chilled meat products like fresh sausages. The EU is proposing that ""national identity goods"", or those which do not have a non-GB supply chain, would be exempt, but that leaves open the possibility that some goods could be banned. On customs, the EU is proposing what it calls a ""unique facilitation"" for paperwork, which it says will mean Northern Ireland importers can submit a greatly reduced amount of information. It estimates this will halve the administrative burden. It will also expand the concept of ""goods not at risk"" - this is an existing arrangement which Northern Ireland traders use so they do not have to pay EU tariffs on GB goods. Why is there a Brexit row over a European court? Katya Adler: Will talks lead to truce or trade war? 'We do see opportunities, but have had problems' The EU says the combination of the agri-food and customs proposals will effectively create an ""express lane"" to help facilitate the movements of GB goods whose end destination is Northern Ireland. Thesupply of medicinesfrom Great Britain to Northern Ireland has emerged as one of the most difficult issues. Pharmaceutical distributors have warned that if the current protocol was fully implemented they would have to withdraw hundreds of products from sale in Northern Ireland. The EU is now proposing to change its laws around the regulation of medicines to keep products flowing. Mr Å efÄoviÄ has previously said he will do ""whatever it takes"" to guarantee the supply of medicines. This is a complicated area and the pharmaceutical industry will need time to assess if the plan will work. Some unionists in Northern Ireland have held street protests against the protocol The EU originally floated a version of this idea in July but the industry was unconvinced at that time. The proposals for giving Northern Ireland politicians and other stakeholders a greater voice include the establishment of structured groups to provide a forum for discussion on key issues. It would also see interested parties invited to some meetings of the Specialised Committee, one of the joint UK/EU bodies that oversee the protocol. The EU says it also wants to create a stronger link between the Northern Ireland Assembly and the EU/UK Parliamentary Partnership Assembly. It also intends to create a website to track which EU legislation is applicable in Northern Ireland. The headline was amended on 1 December, 2021, to make clear that the EU offer of fewer checks is a proposal only.

"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.
