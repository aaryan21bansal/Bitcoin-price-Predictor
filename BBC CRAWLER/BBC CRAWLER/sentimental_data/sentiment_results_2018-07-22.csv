"This video can not be played A student activist filmed a woman and a man being beaten on 1 May France's interior minister has been grilled by MPs over his handling of a policing scandal in which a presidential security aide was filmed assaulting a demonstrator on 1 May. GÃ©rard Collomb said he learned of the video on 2 May and did not report it to prosecutors because it was a matter for President Emmanuel Macron's staff. Mr Macron fired the aide, Alexandre Benalla, on Friday, but MPs want to know why he did not act sooner. Mr Benalla, 26, faces several charges. He is accused of assault with an accomplice, interfering in police work, impersonating a police officer and illegally receiving surveillance footage. On Monday Mr Benalla, who was Mr Macron's top bodyguard during last year's election campaign, defended his actions, claiming that he was ""lending a hand"" to the riot officers at the scene after he was ""invited to observe"" their operations. He added that he believed his behaviour was being exploited for ""media and political ends"", his lawyers said. Mr Macron and Mr Benalla pictured together on Bastille Day this month Vincent Crase, a security agent for Mr Macron's La RÃ©publique en Marche (Republic on the Move) party, has also been charged. Three police officers were charged and questioned on Saturdayfor allegedly passing surveillance footage to Mr Benalla to try to prove his innocence. Mr Collomb told MPs: ""I condemn in the strongest possible terms the actions of Mr Benalla."" He said his staff had informed Mr Macron's administration about the incident and ""it was up to them to respond"". ""I did not pursue this matter any further."" Besides the MPs' inquiry, the police disciplinary body, IGPN, is also investigating the assault. Interior Minister Collomb (R) said he had assumed Mr Benalla was a regular policeman The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris writes: There is no private militia at the ElysÃ©e Palace. People can sense that the real culprit is Alexandre Benalla himself, who for a self-declared security officer showed himself disgracefully lacking in self-control. But it is also true that President Macron will not emerge unscathed. His silence has come across as a sort of majestic insouciance, which irritates. Read Hugh's analysis in full here. The French presidency has been accused of trying to cover up the assault and failing to act swiftly against Mr Benalla. Mr Macron is already under scrutiny over what some see as an elitist presidential style: there have been controversies overhis expensive new dinner serviceandplans for a private swimming pool. Public outrage has been stoked by additional footage that appears to show several police officers watching the Benalla incident without intervening. The video shows Mr Benalla dragging away a woman and then beating a man during May Day protests in Paris.

Under growing pressure, he met several ministers on Sunday to discuss the row. An official said Mr Macron had described the incident as ""unacceptable"" and promised there would be ""no impunity"". But Mr Macron has not yet spoken publicly about it. Senior presidential official Alexis Kohler is to look into reorganising Mr Macron's private office so as to prevent a repeat of the incident, officials say. The video was posted on social media in May, but the case only became a political scandal after Le Monde newspaper revealed on 18 July that the attacker was Mr Benalla. He was hired as an aide to the president's chief of staff after last year's election. He was then given an apartment in an upmarket Paris district and a chauffeur-driven car, French media say. He also had the highest security clearance to parliament. In May, a few days after the incident, he was suspended for two weeks but nothing was reported to prosecutors. The incident took place in a popular tourist spot in Paris' Latin Quarter, whereabout 100 people had gathered during demonstrations against Mr Macron's public sector labour reforms- in particular the cutting of public sector workers and the introduction of merit-based pay. Police later said that about 1,200 masked and hooded individuals attended the 1 May demonstration by labour unions before clashes erupted with officers policing the event. Allow Twitter content?

In the original video of the assault, footage shows a man wearing a police helmet, but no uniform, joining CRS riot police as they tried to control the crowds. He grabs a woman by the neck, dragging her down the street, before both disappear off camera. Shortly afterwards he returns to the scene, attacking a male protester who had been carried a short distance by police before being left alone on the ground. The man in the helmet can be seen grabbing the young protester around the neck, hitting him on the head and apparently stamping on his stomach when he falls to the ground.

"This video can not be played Channel 4 Dispatches presenter Datshiane Navanayagam was made homeless as a child and again as a working adult. More than half of families living in temporary accommodation in England are in employment  ""working every hour they can"", says housing charity Shelter. Its analysis suggests 55% of families (33,000) living in temporary digs were also working in 2017 - up 73% on 2013. The charity blames a mix of expensive private rents, a housing benefit freeze and a chronic lack of social housing. The government said it was investing Â£1.2bn to support homeless people. Temporary accommodation is the property offered to people by local authorities after they have been declared without a permanent home. ""The link between an income and a job, which used to be enough to secure a home, is just completely breaking down in the housing market,"" Greg Beales, Shelter's director of policy, told BBC Breakfast. Chief executive Polly Neate said it was disgraceful that families were forced to experience homelessness despite working ""every hour they can"". ""In many cases, these are parents who work all day or night before returning to a cramped hostel or B&B where their whole family is forced to share a room,"" she added. ""A room with no space for normal family life like cooking, playing or doing homework. ""We cannot allow struggling families to slip through the cracks created by our housing crisis - the government must urgently come up with a new plan for social housing that delivers the genuinely affordable homes we desperately need."" 'My double life in a homeless hostel' Based on Shelter's research, Channel 4 Dispatches has created a programme looking at homelessness in working people. Presenter Datshiane Navanayagam has experienced homelessness herself - as a child and then again as a working adult. ""The basic reason why anyone goes to work, is because they think that should at least afford them somewhere to live and when that's not happening, you're in a very frightening situation, ""she told BBC Breakfast. Mary and her children lived in three temporary homes in two years One mother of three, Mary Smith, who lives in temporary accommodation with her sons in Watford, described how she struggled to hold on to her job in a shoe shop because of her housing situation. She said: ""Sometimes I even think that I don't want to wake up in the morning, but I do. ""I get on with it because I have other people relying on me."" She added: ""Letting my colleagues know at work what's happening is very hard. ""Luckily I have an understanding manager now, but I nearly lost my job when I first became homeless because the transport links from my hostel were so bad. ""We've lived in three different places in two years, and it's been really tough on the children."" The charity's analysts arrived at the 33,000 figure by combining Department for Work and Pensions statistics on the number of families known to be in work but homeless, official data on homelessness from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) and housing benefit data. A MHCLG spokesman said its Homelessness Reduction Act would ensure more struggling people are provided with support. He said: ""Councils have a duty to provide suitable temporary accommodation to those who need it, and families with children get priority. ""So families can get a permanent home, we are investing Â£9bn in affordable properties, including Â£2bn for social rent housing."" 30,000 lone parent families made homeless Households in temporary housing up by 6% Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Ugochukwu Nwamo has set up a childcare group with friends and family on Telegram The school summer holidays have now officially begun for most children. The kids may well be excited, but for working parents managing the six week period of no school and hence no state childcare, can be difficult. Whilst school holiday camps, sports clubs and au pairs often provide the solution, it can be expensive. In fact the cost of holiday childcare has jumped 4% since last summer, according to The Family and Childcare Trust, with parents now paying on average Â£133 per child each week. But some parents have found innovative ways to cut the costs. We detail five possible solutions below. One solution is to form a ""childcare co-operative"" with other parents who can look after each other's kids. Ugochukwu Nwamo, a delivery manager for BT, has two children aged four and two, both of whom are still at nursery. However, already planning ahead, he recently created a childcare group for the school holidays comprising friends and family on messaging app Telegram. ""If anybody has childcare needs then they can post their request and it's up to others to respond,"" the Londoner says. The cost of holiday childcare has jumped 4% since last summer Holiday childcare: 'My sister has my child' Job-training parents 'need free childcare' 'The everyday sexism I face as a stay-at-home dad' So far there are only 10 members, but he says it's already proved useful. He himself has used it to have a Friday night out, but says someone on the group has also managed to secure ""two to three days of childcare"" through the app. ""It's up to the parents to make sure no one takes advantage of any other parent without reciprocating,"" he says. Grace, a mother from Belfast, says the co-operative she has joined has a different way of keeping things fair. ""Myself and friends use a points system,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake up to Money. ""So you look after their kids for a day you get two points in the bank, a half day is one point. Works well. ""Points move between friends and at the end of summer if you have more points than your friends then they take you out to dinner."" Sally Pinnegar set up her own business so she could better manage her childcare needs Sally Pinnegar from Cambridgeshire was working as a cartographer when she had her son, Rory, at the age of 39 but soon felt at odds working a rigid 37-hour week in an office. She says she always felt ""terrible guilt"" that she couldn't be at home with Rory, both during the holidays and term time. ""And working from home was fairly new to the organisation then and not everyone trusted it,"" she says. So when Rory turned 10 she decided to put her nutrition and personal training qualification to use and set up her own business which which she could run from home. She admits it takes ""a lot of time and effort"" and she works ""twice as long now each week"" than she did in the office. ""But I do it when it suits me, I love what I do and am happier that I'm there for my child,"" she says. ""I don't feel on the back foot for not being there at exactly the same time as everyone else."" Marissa Charles has asked her nephew to look after her son Campbell this summer Volunteer development manager Marissa Charles, 44, is a single mum based in London who splits childcare during the summer holidays with her ex. However, with only 25 days holiday from work a year, she can't take the whole three weeks off To make up the shortfall she's come up with an idea. ""I am flying my 18-year-old nephew over from Norway [at a cost of Â£94] to hang out with my 10-year-old son. ""I plan stuff for them to do every day so they actually get out of the house for a few hours. It works out great."" She says she could put her son in a summer camp but he hates being in situations with kids he doesn't know. He could also stay with his grandmother, but she's 77 and ""some days he would be stuck in the house"", Ms Charles says. ""This way he gets to stay in London, go to the cinema and museums and I get to see him every day. And my nephew gets a holiday in London."" Some people send their child to family overseas While it may sound extreme, some people have found it is cheaper to send their children abroad during the summer holidays than to pay for childcare at home. Milena Kuicka from Burton upon Trent sometimes sends her nine-year-old daughter to Poland during the holidays. Mrs Kuicka, 33, says her daughter ""loves going"" as she has friends and family in the country and she learns Polish. ""Our family mostly speaks in English at home as dad is English,"" Ms Kuicka says. Her four-year-old son will go for the first time next year, but even though she says she will miss them while they are away, she feels she has no choice. ""If I wanted to keep them with me in UK it would cost me over Â£2,000 for six weeks' childcare. Also I feel that they need contact with their grandparents as they don't see them much and their English grandparents are dead."" Rebecca Budworth says her boys are happy with scrap paper and pens Getting any work done with a child present may seem impossible, but some have made it work. Office manager Rebecca Budworth who works for her family's property business says:  ""If I need to be in the office then I take my two boys with me, they are good and will be happy enough with a raft of scrap paper and a big box of pens."" Some companies actively encourage it. Investment bank Goldman Sachs, which already runs a nursery for staff in London, opens it up to 5-12 year olds during the school holidays. It has 48 spaces and around 1,200 parents are registered, representing almost a quarter of Goldman's London staff. Sebastian Howell, executive media manager at the bank, says staff love being able to ""pop downstairs"" to see their kids at lunch. Each parent at the bank also gets 20 free ""back-up"" days each year to use the centre for emergency childcare.

"Children as young as eight have been caught speeding by police in Britain in the last two years, Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency figures reveal. A Freedom of Information response shows two instances where people aged eight were found in cars or on motorbikes. More than 900 people in their 90s got penalty points for speeding, with three incidents involving people aged 99. The FOI request sought details of driving offences committed in 2017 and so far this year. If a driver is underage, theendorsements are held on file by the DVLA,externaland the penalty points can be added to any driving licence they hold in the future. The DVLA did not provide information about the circumstances of the driving offences, saying its role was to compile information provided by the courts. But its figures show more than one million speeding offences were recorded over the period concerned. Nearly 1,400 offences related to people aged under 17, including one aged 11 and three aged 13. The majority of speeders were people in their 40s, which is thought to include the largest age group of motorists. The highest number of speeders were aged 46, amounting to 30,075 offences.

"Protesters gathered in Tel Aviv's central Rabin Square Tens of thousands of Israeli protesters have rallied in Tel Aviv against a law denying surrogacy to gay couples and single fathers. Demonstrators held their gathering in the central Rabin Square, and at one point briefly blocked a major motorway. At least one person was arrested. Israel's parliament on Wednesday allowed surrogacy for single women and women unable to bear children. Previously, only heterosexual married couples were granted the same rights. The legislation also envisaged state funding for surrogacy. The corner of Europe where women rent out their wombs ""We came here today (Sunday) to say to the government 'No more',"" demonstrator Oz Dani in Rabin Square was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""We want equality and we want equal rights for everyone."" Similar rallies were also held in several other cities, including Jerusalem. Many protesters said gay couples wanting to have children were being forced to seek surrogate mothers abroad and pay large sums of money. A number of Israeli companies said they were ready to make financial contributions to help such couples. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had previously supported the extension of surrogacy rights to gay couples and single men. But he voted against this last week, saying that otherwise the entire bill would have been blocked in parliament.

"Carter Page was put under surveillance in October 2016 One of Donald Trump's ex-foreign policy aides says allegations that he worked with the Russian government during the 2016 US election are ""misleading"". The FBI believed Carter Page was ""collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government"" at that time. His alleged relationships with Russian intelligence officials are highlighted in court applications which led to him being put under surveillance. Mr Trump said it appeared that his campaign was illegally spied on. But he provided no evidence to support the claim. The newly released surveillance applications,externalwere granted and renewed by several different judges sitting in a court authorised by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa). The court, which has the power to authorise wiretaps and surveillance of suspected foreign spies, is one of the most secretive institutions in the US. The FBI released the previously secret document cache on Saturday night following Freedom of Information requests by several US organisations. It contains 412 pages of heavily redacted material which includes the surveillance applications, their later renewals, and warrants surrounding the investigation into Mr Page. ""The FBI believes that Page has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government,"" the October 2016 application to the court states. According to the documents, ""the FBI believes that the Russian government's efforts are being co-ordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with"" Mr Trump's presidential campaign. It also said Mr Page ""has established relationships with Russian government officials, including Russian intelligence officers"". Donald Trump said the documents ""confirm the Department of 'Justice' and FBI misled the courts"" Mr Page told CNN that describing him as an adviser to the Russian government was ""way over the top"". ""I've never been an agent of a foreign power by any stretch of the imagination,"" he said. ""You talk about misleading the courts, it's just so misleading. It's literally a complete joke."" Asked about his previous comments referring to himself as an informal adviser to the Kremlin, Mr Page responded that his contacts had been ""informal, having some conversations with people... this is really nothing and just an attempt to distract from the real crimes shown in this misleading document"". Mr Page is an energy industry consultant with longstanding ties to Russia. He first contacted the Trump campaign in 2015 before meeting Mr Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, in January 2016. By March 2016, Mr Trump had identified Mr Page as one of a handful of campaign foreign policy advisers. However, after allegations emerged inthe Steele dossierthat he had served as an intermediary between Russian officials and the president's campaign as they worked to advance Mr Trump's presidential efforts, Mr Page resigned from his role. He denied all the allegations against him. Read more:Carter Page has a story that doesn't always add up Republicans have criticised the FBI for using material from the Steele dossier in applications to the Fisa court - describing its contents as entirely without foundation - while not telling the court that the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign had helped fund the research. Democrats point out that the applications contain evidence against Mr Page that is not related to the Steele dossier, and that the FBI clearly told the court that the research sponsor wanted to discredit Mr Trump's presidential campaign. The application said that based on the dossier author's previous reliable reporting history with the FBI, the agency believed the information to be credible. The president took to Twitter to welcome the release of the documents and accuse the Department of Justice and the FBI of breaking the law to mislead the courts and spy on his campaign - to benefit his Democratic opponent in the election, Hillary Clinton.

The leader of the Democratic Party in the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, came to a different conclusion. In a statement, she said: ""Despite President Trump's repeated claims, these documents provide clear evidence of 'Russia's co-ordination with Carter Page', a high-ranking Trump campaign official, 'to undermine and improperly and illegally influence the 2016 US presidential election'."" She added: ""The GOP [Republican Party] must cease their attacks on our law enforcement and intelligence communities, and finally decide where their loyalty lies."" The documents' release comes nine days after12 Russians were charged with hacking Democratic officialsin the 2016 US elections. The charges form part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into US intelligence findings that Russians conspired to tilt the election in Mr Trump's favour, and whether any of his campaign aides colluded. Mr Trump has labelled the investigation a ""witch hunt"". So far, the inquiry has indicted 32 people - mostly Russian nationals in absentia. Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? This video can not be played Trump on Putin: ""As the leader of a country, you would have to hold him responsible, yes"" Just days later, Mr Trump met his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, at a summit in Helsinki and was asked by reporters whether he believed Russia had meddled in the 2016 election, ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied, appearing to back the Russians over his own agencies. Will Helsinki change the course of Trump's presidency?

"Your yoghurt carton might be buried in landfill You try to be virtuous, wiping the curdling yoghurt off a plastic pot, then putting it in the recycling bin. Perhaps you envisage the pot eventually re-incarnated as a frisbee or maybe even a plastic bench. But donât rest easy. Your pot might get burned or buried in landfill, and youâd never know. The National Audit Office (NAO) says over half of the packaging reported as recycled is actually being sent abroad to be processed. As a result, it says, the government has little idea of whether the recyclables are getting turned into new products, buried in landfill or burned. While an illusion of success has been created by the UKâs system for recycling packaging, the NAO says, the reality may be quite different. Its report finds that: The government has turned a blind eye to underlying problems with the waste system Firms may be over-stating the amount they are recycling The Environment Agency has only carried out 40% of the recycling checks it planned to The UK is said to have increased recycling from under a third in 1998 to nearly two thirds last year, easily beating the EU target. It sounds good. But the NAO says most of the recorded increase in recycling has been due to the UK exporting its waste problem. Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, is already on record saying the UK has got to stop exporting its dirt. Reducing waste and using resources better, as well as tackling packaging waste is key to that. The environment department Defra estimates that UK packaging recycling rates have increased from 31% in 1998 to 64% in 2017. That beats the EU target of 55%. But since 2002 the quantity of packaging waste exported has increased six-fold, whilst the quantity recycled in the UK has remained the same. Whatâs more, the figures donât take into account the risk of undetected fraud and error. The NAO says thereâs nothing to prove that packaging sent for recycling actually gets recycled. Nor does Defra have evidence that the system has done what itâs supposed to have done by encouraging companies to minimise their use of packaging or make it easy to recycle. Is it time to scrap shrink-wrapped records? The NAO's report found only 25% of the firms most likely to misbehave over re-processing or exporting waste are inspected, while just 40% of planned compliance visits were actually carried out. An Environment Agency spokesperson, said ""where we find any evidence of fraud or error in data reported to us, we remove that information from the overall packaging recycling data and calculations"". But Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said ""a tighter grip on packaging recycling is needed"". âTwenty years ago, the government set up a complex system to subsidise packaging recycling, which appears to have evolved into a comfortable way of meeting targets without addressing the fundamental issues. âThe government should have a much better understanding of the difference this system makes and a better handle on the risks associated with so much packaging waste being recycled overseas."" Currently large firms handling over 50 tonnes of packaging a year need to show they have recycled a certain amount of packaging. They do this by paying for a credit note - a Packaging Recovery Note (PRN) - from a recycling firm to contribute to improving recycling. UK consumers use around 13 billion plastic drinks bottles a year but more than three billion are not recycled Defra says the scheme raised Â£50m in 2016. The cash was to be used for ""capacity building"" in the recycling system through increasing collection and processing of recyclables. But critics say the scheme is so opaque it is hard to tell exactly how the money is spent. Local councils, which have to run waste collection and litter services,complain they donât see a penny of it. A government spokesman says that scheme has increased recycling rates ""significantly"". âHowever, there is much more to do. We donât recycle enough waste, and we export too much of it. âThatâs why we have already committed to overhaul the system, and we will set out our reforms in the Resources and Waste Strategy later this year.â Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Molinari produced a two-under final round of 69 in windy conditions on the Scottish links to finish eight under. He finished two ahead of four players, including home favouritesJustin RoseandRory McIlroy,tied on six under. Tiger Woods finished five under after leading midway through the round, withJordan Spiethon four under. Molinari, 35, emerged from a six-way tie for the lead, when all the players were either on the back nine or in the clubhouse, to lift the Claret Jug. The Europe Ryder Cup player started the final day three shots adrift of overnight leaders Spieth,Kevin KisnerandXander Schauffele,but maintained composure while his rivals all dropped shots in a thrilling battle for the lead. ""It is absolutely amazing,"" Molinari said. ""I think it will take a long time to sink in. It has been a great week. ""The course bit me a few times in the first two days, but to go bogey-free around this track at the weekend is incredible."" The Cut podcast: Day four review - The Italian Job Molinari in disbelief at Open win Rory McIlroy has 'no regrets' after tie for second This video can not be played Francesco Molinari wins Open Championship with birdie at 18 Molinari, ranked 15th in the world, had been tipped by a number of experts before the tournament as a player to watch at Carnoustie - and he proved them right with an assured display over the four days. Despite a modest Open record, he had been backed on the strength of a fine few months that saw him claim the PGA Championship at Wentworth - his biggest win on the European Tour - and his maiden PGA Tour victory at the Quicken Loans Classic. Steady opening rounds of 70 and 72 took him into the weekend, before a stunning 65 on Saturday propelled him into contention. Molinari stressed the importance of making pars on Sunday in an interview after his third round, and he fulfilled his target by beginning with 13 pars in succession in testing conditions. That steady sequence was ended with a birdie on the par-five 14th, before a glorious approach on the 18th allowed him to pick up another shot. After finishing his round, Molinari looked anxious as he waited in the scorer's cabin, watching nearest remaining challenger Schauffele bogey the 17th. The 24-year-old American needed to eagle the last hole to force a play-off, but his approach landed short, allowing Molinari to celebrate with his caddie and wife. This video can not be played Woods signs glove for fan after hitting him with shot Woods is a global star who has transcended the sport since he won his first major at the 1997 Masters aged 21. Thirteen more majors followed over the next 11 years as the American looked on course to break Jack Nicklaus' tally of 18 major victories - a record that has stood since 1986. But his career derailed when a series of personal scandals were followed by a serious back injury, leaving many questioning whether he would ever return to anywhere near his best. Ranked 650th at the start of the year, Woods has answered that positively with his lowest 72-hole total at a major since the 2012 Open. Woods' surge was accompanied by fervent support on the Scottish links, with a buzz of excitement following the 42-year-old around the course and on social media. His challenge helped attract a record Carnoustie crowd of 172,000 attend over the week. Two birdies on the front nine on Sunday, coupled with dropped shots for Spieth and Schauffele, helped him take the outright lead of a major for the first time since his peak years. But a double bogey at the 11th derailed his bid for a first major since the 2008 US Open and, although a birdie on the 14th briefly reignited his hopes, he had to settle for a share of sixth place after signing for a level-par 71. This video can not be played McIlroy eagles 14 to put him back in with a chance England's Rose and Northern Ireland's McIlroy were rated as the leading home hopes going into the 147th Championship and still had outside chances when they stepped onto the first tee on Sunday. Rose only just made the cut by sinking a birdie on the 18th in Friday's second round, but a career-best round at a major of 64 on Saturday gave him hope of a first Open title. Meanwhile, McIlroy started the day a shot better off at five under as he aimed to claim his first major since the 2014 PGA Championship. Both players appeared to have lost their chances of threatening the top of the leaderboard until they each made an eagle at the par-five 14th - Carnoustie's easiest hole - to move back into the reckoning. Rose also birdied the last to finish on six under, a score that was matched by McIlroy shortly afterwards with pars on the final four holes. A play-off looked their best hope of an unlikely success - until Molinari also took advantage of the 14th to take control. The Cut: Download the BBC golf podcast Amateur Sam Locke to consider future after 'a week I'll never forget' Another Englishman,Tommy Fleetwood, moved to six under with a birdie on the first, only to drop four shots in three holes before the turn and end up three under for the tournament with a two-over 73. Fleetwood finished two shots adrift of compatriotEddie Pepperell, who shot a 67 - the lowest round of the final day - to earn his best finish at a major. Pepperell, 27, was set to commentate for BBC Radio 5 live before claiming a late qualification spot, going on to finish in sixth place and earning prize money of Â£287,000.

The 24-year-old American was the favourite to reclaim the Claret Jug going into the final round, holding a share of the lead at nine under with Schauffele. Both players dropped three shots between the fifth and seventh holes, though, dealing a major blow to their chances of victory. Spieth dropped two more shots on the back nine to card a five-over 76, while Schauffele signed for a three-over 74. Jordan Spieth collapse ends attempt to match 149-year record ""We were in the strangest spots possible on the golf course, where we didn't think we would be,"" said Schauffele. ""Every time I looked up at the leaderboard, there's four, five, six guys in the lead, and five, six guys one back.

He said that the illness had struck him when he was the fittest he had ever been ""by a country mile"", because he had embraced a healthy ""LA lifestyle"". But because he was in such good shape, he said, he put off going to Lewisham Hospital in south-east London until the day after the flight landed, despite having to be taken from the aircraft in a wheelchair. Even after arriving in accident and emergency suffering from shortness of breath, he said he thought he would simply get drugs and perhaps be kept in overnight.

It was only when his sister, Juliet, posted images from the hospital on Instagram that the seriousness of his condition became known. After spending more than a week in an unconscious state, he regained consciousness and was well enough to be discharged on 19 July.

"Nicola Roberts (second from right) had been in a relationship with Davies while in Girls Aloud The Crown Prosecution Service has apologised to Girls Aloud star Nicola Roberts for failing to prosecute an ex-boyfriend accused of stalking her. Carl Davies was given a lifetime restraining order in May 2017 for stalking the singer. Davies was later charged with breaching it by looking at her social media, but the case was later dropped by the CPS. Roberts told the Sunday Times she had been left ""too scared to take the dogs for a walk"". Davies, from Flint, had sent 3,000 messages from 35 fake Twitter accounts to Roberts, after they split in 2008. They included threats to stab and burn her. In May last year, the Afghanistan veteran was given a 15-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, after admitting stalking the singer. Stalking reports treble as prosecution rates fall Stalking centre launched to tackle 'hidden crime' What to do if you're being stalked He was later charged with breaching the restraining order against her after being accused of viewing Miss Roberts's Instagram posts between July and August 2017. But the CPS dropped the case because it believed there was no realistic prospect of a conviction. Carl Davies sent messages from fake Twitter accounts threatening to stab and burn Nicola Roberts Instead the judge extended the ban to prevent Davies viewing her social media posts and websites. Now the CPS has apologised to Roberts for failing to prosecute Davies for breaching the restraining order. ""We accept our decision not to prosecute the breach of the order was incorrect,"" said a CPS statement. ""We have written to Ms Roberts to apologise and have taken steps to ensure lessons are learned from the case. Nicola Roberts dated Carl Davies for 18 months before their split in 2008 ""We fully appreciate the impact stalking and harassment has on victims and we take prosecuting these cases extremely seriously. ""We regularly update our legal guidance to keep up with changes in technology, including social media platforms."" Roberts told The Sunday Times her experience had left her too scared to keep her window open at night. The 32-year-old said Davies, who she dated for 18 months before their break up in 2008, had started following her again on Instagram after last year's restraining order to let her know that ""he was still watching me"".

"Taskmaster featuring Alex Horne and Greg Davies is one of Dave's most popular shows Fans of Taskmaster and Red Dwarf have expressed their frustration after Dave was one of 10 UKTV channels to be dropped by Virgin Media in a fees row. About four million households using the cable company are unable to watch the comedy shows - or channels like Gold. Virgin says UKTV charges ""inflated"" fees, and complains that its joint owner, the BBC, does not allow all channels to be shown on demand. UKTV says it cannot accept the ""drastic"" price cut Virgin proposes. Five UKTV channels - Dave, Drama, Home, Really and Yesterday - are broadcast on free-to-air services Freeview and Freesat - and it also has the paid-for services Gold, Alibi, Eden, Good Food and W. Netflix effect poses challenge to TV The end of watching TV as a family All were removed from Virgin cable boxes at midnight on Saturday after talks between the two companies broke down. Virgin subscribers tuning into the channels in recent days had seen a message warning that they would be disappearing. Some new channels have been added, however, including the Paramount Network, IQTV and FreeSports. Taskmaster, a comedy panel game show featuring Alex Horne and Greg Davies began on Dave in 2015 and is one of its most popular shows. The opening episode of the sixth series - in which Alice Levine, Liza Tarbuck and Tim Vine were among the celebrities undertaking bizarre challenges - attractedan audience of 1.175m viewers.,external Red Dwarf VIII from 1999: The sitcom was given a new lease of life on Dave in 2008 Dave's other big success has been its revival of cult sci-fi sitcom Red Dwarf, commissioning four new series since of the show since 2009, after screening repeats of the BBC original. A further series - Red Dwarf XIII - has also been commissioned but will not be seen on Virgin unless a new deal is struck. Gold shows classic comedy including Only Fools and Horses, Porridge and The Vicar of Dibley, while Australian crime drama Harrow is shown on Alibi. Some Virgin Media customers have taken to social media to say they may cancel their subscriptions, while others said they would do so if the channels did not return. On Twitter,Darren Woodward said,externalhe was ""gutted"" not to be able to see Taskmaster, while Tom Langdon was one of a number of subscribers to wonder whether his monthly bill would be reduced because they could no longer watch the show.

Only Fools and Horses fan Helen Iles is among several people to contact the BBC to express their disappointment at lack of notice Virgin gave its viewers. ""As a Virgin Media customer for many years I feel disappointed that I have had no previous warning, especially when I recently changed my plan,"" she said. Mike Shingleton from London said: ""This whole affairs stinks.  We were given only 24 hours notice about the loss of these channels. He said the replacement channels ""do not reflect the quality or subject matter of those lost"". Linda Robertson from Nottingham she was ""livid"" after only having found out about the changes through Twitter, adding ""there are so many people who can't continue watching their favourite shows"" including her 90-year-old mother. Virgin Media chief digital entertainment officer David Bouchier said company was prepared to restore UKTV's free channels ""immediately"" with its permission. He said UKTV had been willing to let it continue carrying the free channels but at the ""11th hour that offer was withdrawn and that is why we have the chaos today"". ""We have been in extensive discussions with UKTV but we have not been able to reach an agreement which reflects the reality of how people are watching television in the 21st Century,"" he added. ""UKTV is insisting on holding back its channels, like Dave, which are freely available over the air and online, unless we pay inflated sums of money for its paid channels like Gold."" UKTV chief executive Darren Childs said:  ""We're hugely disappointed for the many customers who are losing out because our channels are no longer available through Virgin Media. ""We completely understand their frustration and would love to continue to bring them the shows and channels that they're so passionate about, but we need a fair price to support our growing investment in programmes."" A spokesman for BBC Studios, the corporation's commercial arm, said: ""This is clearly an attempt to negotiate through the press. We are fully supportive of the approach taken by UKTV management, who are leading discussions."" All UKTV channels are available on Sky, BT and Talk Talk subscription services. Some programmes, including Taskmaster, are also accessible online via the UKTV Play website.

"This video can not be played Footage from the Israel Defense Forces shows the evacuation from Syria to Jordan Israel says it has carried out an evacuation of members of Syria's White Helmets civil defence group from a war zone in south-western Syria. Some 422 volunteers and family members were taken to Jordan via the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights overnight. The UK, one of the nations requesting Israel's help, hailed the operation and will assist with resettlement. The White Helmets describe themselves as a volunteer workforce that acts to save people in Syria's war zones. Supporters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and his Russian allies, say the White Helmets support the rebels and also have links to jihadist groups. The unstoppable momentum of Assadâs war Why is there a war in Syria? The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they were acting on a request from the US, the UK and other European nations. The White Helmets had become trapped in an area of south-western Syria near the border with the Golan Heights after an offensive by the Syrian military. Pictures supplied by the Israel Defence Forces show families waiting to get off the bus after being safely evacuated The offensive, begun in June, has seen a number of agreements that have led to the evacuation of rebel forces from the Deraa and Quneitra areas to regions further north. The latest deal for Quneitra was reached on Thursday. The White Helmets operate only in rebel-held areas, although they say they are non-partisan. The evacuees were driven to the border with the Golan Heights and taken on from there by Israeli troops to Jordan. The plan had been to evacuate 800 White Helmets and their families, but only 422 made it. The BBC's Mark Lowen says the others have been hemmed in by the expansion of Islamic State group fighters into pockets of south-west Syria and, as this was a one-off operation, fears remain for the fate of those left behind. Those successfully evacuated included about 100 White Helmets, with the rest family members. The IDF said they had ""completed a humanitarian effort to rescue members of a Syrian civil organisation and their families"", saying there was an ""immediate threat to their lives"".

Although Israel is not directly involved in the Syria conflict, the two countries have been in a state of war for decades. Despite the intervention, the IDF said that ""Israel continues to maintain a non-intervention policy regarding the Syrian conflict"". Jordan's government confirmed it had ""authorised the United Nations to organise the passage of 800 Syrian citizens through Jordan to be resettled in Western countries"". The White Helmet volunteers and their families will be held in a ""restricted area"" of Jordan and assessed by the UN, pending resettlement. Jordan said that ""Britain, Germany and Canada made a legally binding undertaking to resettle them within a specified period of time due to 'a risk to their lives'."" The families are now in Jordan, pending resettlement The UK confirmed it would help with the resettlement, providing protection to ""as many of the volunteers and their families as possible"". A statement from Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said: ""White Helmets have been the target of attacks and, due to their high profile, we judged that, in these particular circumstances, the volunteers required immediate protection.

Their official name is the Syrian Civil Defence and it began in early 2013 as an organisation of volunteers from all walks of life, including electricians and builders. Its main task soon became to rescue civilians in war zones in the immediate aftermath of air strikes, and it says its volunteers have saved the lives of more than 100,000 people during the civil war. The White Helmets fight fires and carry out repairs in war zones Numbering about 3,000 volunteers, they also carry out essential repair works. Some 200 members have been killed. The White Helmets have gained worldwide praise, were nominated for the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize and were the subject of a Netflix documentary andBBC Panorama programme. But Syria's government and its ally Russia have accused the group of links to jihadist groups. President Assad said it used ""humanitarian masks and umbrellas just to implement a certain agenda"". The group has been financed by public donations, as well as funding from foreign governments.

"Children as young as eight have been caught speeding by police in Britain in the last two years, Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency figures reveal. A Freedom of Information response shows two instances where people aged eight were found in cars or on motorbikes. More than 900 people in their 90s got penalty points for speeding, with three incidents involving people aged 99. The FOI request sought details of driving offences committed in 2017 and so far this year. If a driver is underage, theendorsements are held on file by the DVLA,externaland the penalty points can be added to any driving licence they hold in the future. The DVLA did not provide information about the circumstances of the driving offences, saying its role was to compile information provided by the courts. But its figures show more than one million speeding offences were recorded over the period concerned. Nearly 1,400 offences related to people aged under 17, including one aged 11 and three aged 13. The majority of speeders were people in their 40s, which is thought to include the largest age group of motorists. The highest number of speeders were aged 46, amounting to 30,075 offences.

"Three officers have already been served with gross misconduct notices, according to the IOPC Allegations of ""serious corruption and malpractice"" within the Met Police are being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Gross misconduct notices have been served on three officers, while ""a number"" of other officers are being assessed, according to the IOPC. IOPC director Jonathan Green said claims of racial discrimination within the Met were also being investigated. The Met said it was ""fully co-operating"" with the investigation. A source told the BBC the investigation was at an early stage and may involve up to 14 officers. It is claimed there are officers in the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) who are said to have interfered with or curtailed investigations, according to Mr Green. He added: ""The investigation includes alleged interference in, and curtailment of, investigations by potentially conflicted senior officers, failure to investigate allegations of wrongdoing, systemic removal of the restrictions of officers under investigation and racial discrimination. ""As part of this investigation, three officers have been served with gross misconduct notices and one of those officers is also under criminal investigation. ""Assessments on the status of a number of other officers remains ongoing."" According toThe Sunday Times,external, three whistleblowers from the Met approached the IOPC to allege members of the DPS were shielding officers from a range of allegations. Undercover policing inquiry 'not sabotaged' by Met Police The Met Police force owes its officers 189,000 rest days A Met spokesman said: ""The Metropolitan Police Service has referred allegations regarding the conduct of a number of MPS personnel to the IOPC which is conducting an independent investigation. ""The MPS is fully co-operating with the IOPC investigation."" Over the last 50 years the Met has been through a series of corruption scandals. In the late 1970s and 80s Operation Countryman investigated claims Met officers were working to help organised criminals. The controversial investigation resulted in misconduct proceedings but no criminal convictions. In 1994 a covert team was set up under Operation Othona, tasked with looking at claims police were conspiring with criminals including losing evidence, being involved with drugs, and running protection rackets. The intelligence gathered led to the creation of a new anti-corruption unit CIB3 in 1998, which eventually became the Directorate of Professional Standards. However a government-commissioned inquiry led by Mark Ellison QCrevealed that many of the Othona files had been shredded in the past, making it hard to prove there was corruption.

"Minibus taxis are the most popular form of transport in South Africa Gunmen in South Africa have killed 11 taxi drivers in an ambush, police say. The men from Gauteng province were travelling to Johannesburg on Saturday night when their minibus was fired at. The dead men, and four more who were critically injured, were returning from a colleague's funeral in the coastal region of Kwa-Zulu Natal, police said. The motive is unclear although rivalry between groups running minibus taxi routes in South Africa has led to violence in the past. Minibus taxis are the most popular form of transportation among South Africa's population of 55 million. This video can not be played How violent is South Africa? Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said the vehicle was attacked between the towns of Colenso and Weenen, in the coastal province. ""The vehicle was ambushed. There were 11 fatalities and four were seriously injured and are in hospital,"" he told reporters. ""There has been a lot of taxi violence in the area but we are still investigating who the perpetrators were."" The targeted attack comes days after deadly shootings in Johannesburg, South African media reported. In one week,a taxi owner reportedly with ""no enemies"" was shot dead in his vehicle,external, and two others were killed while travelling under a police escort.

"Carter Page was put under surveillance in October 2016 One of Donald Trump's ex-foreign policy aides says allegations that he worked with the Russian government during the 2016 US election are ""misleading"". The FBI believed Carter Page was ""collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government"" at that time. His alleged relationships with Russian intelligence officials are highlighted in court applications which led to him being put under surveillance. Mr Trump said it appeared that his campaign was illegally spied on. But he provided no evidence to support the claim. The newly released surveillance applications,externalwere granted and renewed by several different judges sitting in a court authorised by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa). The court, which has the power to authorise wiretaps and surveillance of suspected foreign spies, is one of the most secretive institutions in the US. The FBI released the previously secret document cache on Saturday night following Freedom of Information requests by several US organisations. It contains 412 pages of heavily redacted material which includes the surveillance applications, their later renewals, and warrants surrounding the investigation into Mr Page. ""The FBI believes that Page has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government,"" the October 2016 application to the court states. According to the documents, ""the FBI believes that the Russian government's efforts are being co-ordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with"" Mr Trump's presidential campaign. It also said Mr Page ""has established relationships with Russian government officials, including Russian intelligence officers"". Donald Trump said the documents ""confirm the Department of 'Justice' and FBI misled the courts"" Mr Page told CNN that describing him as an adviser to the Russian government was ""way over the top"". ""I've never been an agent of a foreign power by any stretch of the imagination,"" he said. ""You talk about misleading the courts, it's just so misleading. It's literally a complete joke."" Asked about his previous comments referring to himself as an informal adviser to the Kremlin, Mr Page responded that his contacts had been ""informal, having some conversations with people... this is really nothing and just an attempt to distract from the real crimes shown in this misleading document"". Mr Page is an energy industry consultant with longstanding ties to Russia. He first contacted the Trump campaign in 2015 before meeting Mr Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, in January 2016. By March 2016, Mr Trump had identified Mr Page as one of a handful of campaign foreign policy advisers. However, after allegations emerged inthe Steele dossierthat he had served as an intermediary between Russian officials and the president's campaign as they worked to advance Mr Trump's presidential efforts, Mr Page resigned from his role. He denied all the allegations against him. Read more:Carter Page has a story that doesn't always add up Republicans have criticised the FBI for using material from the Steele dossier in applications to the Fisa court - describing its contents as entirely without foundation - while not telling the court that the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign had helped fund the research. Democrats point out that the applications contain evidence against Mr Page that is not related to the Steele dossier, and that the FBI clearly told the court that the research sponsor wanted to discredit Mr Trump's presidential campaign. The application said that based on the dossier author's previous reliable reporting history with the FBI, the agency believed the information to be credible. The president took to Twitter to welcome the release of the documents and accuse the Department of Justice and the FBI of breaking the law to mislead the courts and spy on his campaign - to benefit his Democratic opponent in the election, Hillary Clinton.

The leader of the Democratic Party in the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, came to a different conclusion. In a statement, she said: ""Despite President Trump's repeated claims, these documents provide clear evidence of 'Russia's co-ordination with Carter Page', a high-ranking Trump campaign official, 'to undermine and improperly and illegally influence the 2016 US presidential election'."" She added: ""The GOP [Republican Party] must cease their attacks on our law enforcement and intelligence communities, and finally decide where their loyalty lies."" The documents' release comes nine days after12 Russians were charged with hacking Democratic officialsin the 2016 US elections. The charges form part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into US intelligence findings that Russians conspired to tilt the election in Mr Trump's favour, and whether any of his campaign aides colluded. Mr Trump has labelled the investigation a ""witch hunt"". So far, the inquiry has indicted 32 people - mostly Russian nationals in absentia. Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? This video can not be played Trump on Putin: ""As the leader of a country, you would have to hold him responsible, yes"" Just days later, Mr Trump met his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, at a summit in Helsinki and was asked by reporters whether he believed Russia had meddled in the 2016 election, ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied, appearing to back the Russians over his own agencies. Will Helsinki change the course of Trump's presidency? The next day, following widespread outrage, he read a pre-prepared statement, saying he actually meant ""wouldn't"".

A photo posted online of the incident, which took place in Trowbridge, Wiltshire on Saturday afternoon, has since gone viral on social media. Tim Brown, who took the photo, said when he challenged the boy's guardian he was told he was a ""do-gooder"". Mr Brown, from Birmingham, described it as ""absolutely unbelievable"". He said when he explained to the man, who was also with two young girls, that ""people are seriously injured and die doing this"", the man replied ""the train's not due"" and ""he only wants to look at the track"". Mr Brown, who works for Network Rail, said he pointed out that freight or unscheduled trains could pass through at any time and he reported the matter to a guard. On Facebook, David Routley wrote: ""As a freight train driver who drove a 1,000 tonne train through this station yesterday morning, to see this scares and shocks me to the core.""

"Displaced residents gathered on Sunday to protest at the lack of access to their homes since last month's Glasgow School of Art fire Business owners and residents have protested at the lack of access to their properties since last month's Glasgow School of Art fire. About 30 people holding placards stood next to a cordon surrounding the school, which the city council has warned remains in a dangerous state. The protesters wanted to enter their properties to retrieve belongings. Earlier they were told that they faced arrest if they attempted to breach the cordon. There were no reports of arrests during the protest. The dismantling of unsafe sections of the Mackintosh building is expected to take several more weeks. Glasgow School of Art dismantling to take eight weeks Glasgow taskforce offers support to fire-hit businesses Residents and businesses hit out over art school fire support During the protest, displaced resident Angela Simpson, who has been unable to return to her house for the past five weeks, said: ""We just want in - 10 minutes in the house to get some belongings. ""I have my bags, just want to open the bags and go. We don't want to cause any trouble, we want to be peaceful."" Gill Hutchison, whose business Biggars Music also lies inside the cordon, said: ""We've asked Glasgow City Council and it's fallen on deaf ears. It's time they listened. ""It's a shocking situation when they're threatening people who are homeless with arrest, in a situation when absolutely no danger seems to befall the workers who are wandering around having cups of coffee - and they're closer to the dangerous building than our buildings are."" Naya Koulocheri, who has not been allowed back into her rented flat on Sauchiehall Street since the fire, told BBC Scotland: ""We don't want to break the law. We need access to our properties and hopefully that can start today. ""We feel drained - that's how 99% of the business owners and residents feel. It's been a long time and we are running out of energy."" The protesters were joined by Glasgow MSP Pauline McNeill, who backed their call for supervised access. She said: ""Surely there could be supervised access with the proper health and safety equipment - for those who say 'I need my electric toothbrush or my car keys or my laptop' or 'I'm running a small business, and my plans and my drawings for my business are inside, can I just get them?'"" The Glasgow School of Art, Mackintosh building, is currently being dismantled Earlier, a ""notice of entry"" letter was circulated by Garnethill Displaced Residents Group and Sauchiehall Street Inner Cordon Businesses, demanding ""full and legal access"" to their properties from noon on Sunday. It read: ""This will be accomplished in an orderly and peaceful manner in succession, one at a time, and for a period of 10-20 minutes, having full understanding and recognition of the risks associated therewith..."" But Glasgow City Council chief executive Annemarie O'Donnell said the cordon should not be breached at any time until building control officers declared that the structures hit by the fire were no longer dangerous. She continued: ""The building has suffered significant trauma, as a result the walls have moved in ways which will certainly lead to parts of the building collapsing. That collapse could happen without warning. ""Anyone in any adjacent buildings in the path of falling masonry would be at risk of death. ""I note from your letter that you intend to take this action 'having full understanding and recognition of the risks associated'. ""However the law compels the council to protect life, regardless of whether you wish to accept that risk."" The building is being dismantled brick by brick Ms O'Donnell said legislation also empowered the council to evacuate buildings which were dangerous, or made dangerous by an adjacent building. She added: ""Anyone who has been displaced in this way and reoccupies the building while it is still dangerous is committing a criminal offence."" Police said officers remained at the cordon for public safety purposes. A police spokesman said: ""The building has been deemed dangerous by Glasgow City Council and anyone who enters the cordon is putting themselves at risk. ""If anyone enters the cordon they may find themselves arrested, however, this would be on the grounds of concern for their safety and in order to protect them.""

"Children as young as eight have been caught speeding by police in Britain in the last two years, Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency figures reveal. A Freedom of Information response shows two instances where people aged eight were found in cars or on motorbikes. More than 900 people in their 90s got penalty points for speeding, with three incidents involving people aged 99. The FOI request sought details of driving offences committed in 2017 and so far this year. If a driver is underage, theendorsements are held on file by the DVLA,externaland the penalty points can be added to any driving licence they hold in the future. The DVLA did not provide information about the circumstances of the driving offences, saying its role was to compile information provided by the courts. But its figures show more than one million speeding offences were recorded over the period concerned. Nearly 1,400 offences related to people aged under 17, including one aged 11 and three aged 13. The majority of speeders were people in their 40s, which is thought to include the largest age group of motorists. The highest number of speeders were aged 46, amounting to 30,075 offences.

"Tim Brown, who took the photo and challenged the man, described the incident as ""absolutely unbelievable"" A child was seen lying with his head over the edge of a railway station platform prompting an investigation by British Transport Police. A photo posted online of the incident, which took place in Trowbridge, Wiltshire on Saturday afternoon, has since gone viral on social media. Tim Brown, who took the photo, said when he challenged the boy's guardian he was told he was a ""do-gooder"". Mr Brown, from Birmingham, described it as ""absolutely unbelievable"". He said when he explained to the man, who was also with two young girls, that ""people are seriously injured and die doing this"", the man replied ""the train's not due"" and ""he only wants to look at the track"". Mr Brown, who works for Network Rail, said he pointed out that freight or unscheduled trains could pass through at any time and he reported the matter to a guard. On Facebook, David Routley wrote: ""As a freight train driver who drove a 1,000 tonne train through this station yesterday morning, to see this scares and shocks me to the core."" Hanif Ali added: ""What world is he living in? If he can't see the obvious dangers then he shouldn't be allowed anywhere near children."" British Transport Police confirmed it had been notified and was awaiting further information prior to launching an investigation. A spokesman for Great Western Railway (GWR), which manages Trowbridge railway station, said: ""Trains often pass through railway stations without stopping and without appearing on any timetable at very high speeds. ""Stay safe by keeping back from the platform edge and behind the yellow line at all times, and listen out for announcements.""

"This model is wearing a fake fur jacket - now sales of real fur could be banned A ban on sales of real fur should be considered, a committee of MPs has recommended. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee investigation into the issue came after some real fur was found wrongly labelled as fake. They described the current labelling of fur products as ""not fit for purpose"". The government said Brexit would allow the UK to ""go further"" when it came to introducing further restrictions on the fur trade. Is your fur faux or real? Retailers criticised over fur mis-selling Labour party pledges to ban fur imports Fur farming was banned in the UK in 2000, but it is legal to sell some types of real fur that have been imported, if it is accurately labelled. But the Efra committee said retailers and Trading Standards had been complacent about items being incorrectly labelled. Their inquiry came after it emerged High Street and online retailers including TK Maxx, BooHoo, Amazon and Tesco had recently sold real fur as fake. Other retailers found to have passed items off as faux fur included Not on the High Street, Groupon, Etsy, FatFace, Boots, Kurt Geiger and Romwe. This video can not be played The difference between real and fake fur The Efra committee started its investigation in February, when cases of mislabelling came to light via reports from media and campaign groups. The MPs found that while many of the retailers concerned had no-fur policies, the so-called faux fur had actually come from animals including rabbit, fox and chinchilla. It said Brexit could be an opportunity to tighten regulations around the sale of fur and called for a consultation on a bar on the sale of all real fur. ""Many consumers have an ethical reason for not buying garments containing real fur,"" the committee's report said. ""The last few years have shown that there is vulnerability in retailers' supply chains and that real fur has been sold as fake fur. ""Our inquiry has highlighted that the current labelling system is confusing, not fit for purpose and with a high degree of non-compliance. It is also not being enforced."" The committee recognised that fur is ""a subject that raises strong feelings"", adding: ""In looking at whether to ban the sale and import of fur post-Brexit, the government will have to balance the needs of animal welfare against consumer choice."" Emotions can run high on the subject of real fur Committee chairman Neil Parish said: ""Reports of real fur being sold as fake fur shows that retailers are flouting their responsibility to consumers. ""The mis-selling of real fur should not be discovered by campaign organisations and the media, but by Trading Standards officers and retailers. ""Retailers of all sizes are complacent about the issue of fake faux fur. It is illegal to give misleading information and Trading Standards have been poor at identifying and acting against those who are doing so."" He recommended that the government should make sure local authorities had the proper resources, and Trading Standards adequate training, to help bring an end to the issue. ""Brexit provides an opportunity to step up our game when it comes to labelling,"" added Mr Parish, Conservative MP for Riverton and Honiton. ""The labelling of clothes must be consistent, transparent and customer-friendly, but current EU requirements are not good enough to allow consumers to understand the origin and contents of their clothing."" The British Fur Trade Association said it welcomed the committee's recommendations on addressing the problems of mis-selling fur and agreed the current European labelling was not fit for purpose. Chief executive Mike Moser said it was vital that consumers were able to make informed decisions, whether they were buying natural or fake fur. He wants to see a fur-specific label introduced on to the UK market which would give greater detail about the type of fur used. However, he said he was disappointed that the committee was recommending a possible trade ban,  despite acknowledging that the fur industry was a legitimate business and wearing fur was a matter of consumer choice. A government statement said: ""The government shares the British public's high regard for animal welfare, and fur farming was banned in the UK in 2000. ""Trade in fur from domestic cats, dogs or commercial seal hunts are also banned, but while the UK is a member of the EU it is not possible to introduce additional restrictions on the fur trade. ""Brexit gives us the opportunity to go further. Meanwhile, we will closely consider the committee's report and respond in due course."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said real fur sales should be banned. ""I think fur products are unnecessary and there is often a great deal of cruelty involved in the production of fur pelts and the synthetic alternatives are much better,"" he said.

"Three officers have already been served with gross misconduct notices, according to the IOPC Allegations of ""serious corruption and malpractice"" within the Met Police are being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Gross misconduct notices have been served on three officers, while ""a number"" of other officers are being assessed, according to the IOPC. IOPC director Jonathan Green said claims of racial discrimination within the Met were also being investigated. The Met said it was ""fully co-operating"" with the investigation. A source told the BBC the investigation was at an early stage and may involve up to 14 officers. It is claimed there are officers in the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) who are said to have interfered with or curtailed investigations, according to Mr Green. He added: ""The investigation includes alleged interference in, and curtailment of, investigations by potentially conflicted senior officers, failure to investigate allegations of wrongdoing, systemic removal of the restrictions of officers under investigation and racial discrimination. ""As part of this investigation, three officers have been served with gross misconduct notices and one of those officers is also under criminal investigation. ""Assessments on the status of a number of other officers remains ongoing."" According toThe Sunday Times,external, three whistleblowers from the Met approached the IOPC to allege members of the DPS were shielding officers from a range of allegations. Undercover policing inquiry 'not sabotaged' by Met Police The Met Police force owes its officers 189,000 rest days A Met spokesman said: ""The Metropolitan Police Service has referred allegations regarding the conduct of a number of MPS personnel to the IOPC which is conducting an independent investigation. ""The MPS is fully co-operating with the IOPC investigation."" Over the last 50 years the Met has been through a series of corruption scandals. In the late 1970s and 80s Operation Countryman investigated claims Met officers were working to help organised criminals. The controversial investigation resulted in misconduct proceedings but no criminal convictions. In 1994 a covert team was set up under Operation Othona, tasked with looking at claims police were conspiring with criminals including losing evidence, being involved with drugs, and running protection rackets. The intelligence gathered led to the creation of a new anti-corruption unit CIB3 in 1998, which eventually became the Directorate of Professional Standards. However a government-commissioned inquiry led by Mark Ellison QCrevealed that many of the Othona files had been shredded in the past, making it hard to prove there was corruption.

"The Trump administration says protecting US steel and aluminium producers is a matter of national security A trade war is now a reality, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned as G20 ministers gather for a summit in Argentina. The current US trade policy of imposing unilateral tariffs is based on ""the law of the jungle"", he said. But US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin defended the tariffs and urged the EU and China to open their markets to allow free competition. Last week,US President Donald Trump described the EU as a ""foe"" on trade. Mr Trump later threatened to impose tariffs on all $500bn (Â£380bn) of Chinese goods entering the USin a growing trade row. The US has large trade deficits with both the 28-member EU and China. The two-day talks in Buenos Aires bring together finance ministers and central bankers of the world's top 20 economies. What is a trade war and why should I worry? G7 summit ends in disarray over tariffs Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs? ""World trade cannot base itself on the law of the jungle and the unilateral increase of tariffs is the law of the jungle,"" Mr Le Maire told AFP news agency. Partners or foes? Steven Mnuchin (left) and Bruno Le Maire at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires ""The law of the fittest - this cannot be the future of global trade relations. The law of the jungle will only turn out losers, it will weaken growth, threaten the most fragile countries and have disastrous political consequences."" He added that a trade war was now a reality, and that the EU could not consider negotiating a free trade deal with the US without America first withdrawing its tariffs on steel and aluminium. Mr Mnuchin said it was pretty simple. ""My message is pretty clear, it's the same message the president delivered at the G7 (last month in Canada): if Europe believes in free trade, we're ready to sign a free trade agreement with no tariffs, no non-tariff barriers and no subsidies. It has to be all three,"" he said. Mr Mnuchin said China had to open its markets ""so we can compete fairly"". ""We share a desire to have a more balanced relationship and the balanced relationship is by us selling more goods [to China],"" he said. Little has caused Donald Trump more annoyance than the trading deficits between the US and its major partners. He believes that if you have a trade deficit - if you import more than you export - you are losing out. Tackling what he has called ""unfair trading practices"" has become a key plank of his administration. The European Union, China and the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) countries, Mexico and Canada, have been his main targets. Mr Trump has pulled out of theTrans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade dealandwants a renegotiated Nafta deal.

"Police released CCTV images of three men they want to speak to about the attack A three-year-old boy has been seriously injured in a suspected acid attack in a shop. The boy was ""deliberately attacked"" at Home Bargains in Worcester at 14:15 BST on Saturday, West Mercia Police said. He has since been discharged from hospital after being treated for serious burns to his arm and face. A 39-year-old man from Wolverhampton has been arrested in connection with the attack at Shrub Hill Retail Park, Tallow Hill. The boy was discharged from hospital on Sunday afternoon, though the ""long-term implications of his injuries are unknown"" Ch Supt Mark Travis said. The boy was ""out with his young family"" when ""acid or a corrosive substance"" was either ""thrown at or sprayed towards him"" in what the officer described as a ""very rare"", ""deliberate attack"". The city's MP said it was ""horrific"", while the city council leader described it as ""pure evil"". Police released images taken from CCTV footage. ""The three men in the photo may have information vital to our investigation,"" Ch Supt Travis said. ""I am sure someone will recognise them and I would urge anyone with information to contact us as a matter of urgency."" Police said the three men may have ""vital information"" ""The incident will rightly shock the local community and I would like to reassure local people that we are carrying out a thorough investigation to identify those responsible,"" Ch Supt Travis added. The motive for the attack is so far ""unclear"", he said. Officers said they were working to determine what the substance involved was and exactly what happened. The 39-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm, and remains in police custody. Robin Walker, MP for Worcester, described it as ""horrific"". ""The shock will be universal. Anyone conducting such an attack on a small child is just appalling,"" he said. Officers said they were working to determine what the substance involved was and exactly what happened at the store ""It's an issue which rightly there has been a lot of concern in Parliament [about] and a move to toughen sentences for any kind of acid attack,"" he added. ""But particularly the nature of this being a small child is very concerning indeed. ""At this stage the key thing is for the police to act quickly and see if they can track down the perpetrator and understand what's behind it, because it is an unthinkable thing to happen."" A Home Bargains spokesperson said: ""Our thoughts are with this young child and his family at this very difficult time."" Ch Supt Travis said: ""I would like to praise the staff in store and emergency services who provided fantastic care and as a result that has mitigated the impact on the little boy."" Worcester City Council leader Marc Bayliss said it was ""absolutely pure evil"". ""Worcester is not that sort of place. We are a quintessential small English city,"" he said. ""I have never heard of an acid attack in Worcester, so this is absolutely not something we have any experience of."" He urged anyone with information to come forward, saying: ""Think if this was a member of your family, an innocent child, a three-year-old probably scarred or damaged for life by this.

"This video can not be played Footage from the Israel Defense Forces shows the evacuation from Syria to Jordan Israel says it has carried out an evacuation of members of Syria's White Helmets civil defence group from a war zone in south-western Syria. Some 422 volunteers and family members were taken to Jordan via the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights overnight. The UK, one of the nations requesting Israel's help, hailed the operation and will assist with resettlement. The White Helmets describe themselves as a volunteer workforce that acts to save people in Syria's war zones. Supporters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and his Russian allies, say the White Helmets support the rebels and also have links to jihadist groups. The unstoppable momentum of Assadâs war Why is there a war in Syria? The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they were acting on a request from the US, the UK and other European nations. The White Helmets had become trapped in an area of south-western Syria near the border with the Golan Heights after an offensive by the Syrian military. Pictures supplied by the Israel Defence Forces show families waiting to get off the bus after being safely evacuated The offensive, begun in June, has seen a number of agreements that have led to the evacuation of rebel forces from the Deraa and Quneitra areas to regions further north. The latest deal for Quneitra was reached on Thursday. The White Helmets operate only in rebel-held areas, although they say they are non-partisan. The evacuees were driven to the border with the Golan Heights and taken on from there by Israeli troops to Jordan. The plan had been to evacuate 800 White Helmets and their families, but only 422 made it. The BBC's Mark Lowen says the others have been hemmed in by the expansion of Islamic State group fighters into pockets of south-west Syria and, as this was a one-off operation, fears remain for the fate of those left behind. Those successfully evacuated included about 100 White Helmets, with the rest family members. The IDF said they had ""completed a humanitarian effort to rescue members of a Syrian civil organisation and their families"", saying there was an ""immediate threat to their lives"".

Although Israel is not directly involved in the Syria conflict, the two countries have been in a state of war for decades. Despite the intervention, the IDF said that ""Israel continues to maintain a non-intervention policy regarding the Syrian conflict"". Jordan's government confirmed it had ""authorised the United Nations to organise the passage of 800 Syrian citizens through Jordan to be resettled in Western countries"". The White Helmet volunteers and their families will be held in a ""restricted area"" of Jordan and assessed by the UN, pending resettlement. Jordan said that ""Britain, Germany and Canada made a legally binding undertaking to resettle them within a specified period of time due to 'a risk to their lives'."" The families are now in Jordan, pending resettlement The UK confirmed it would help with the resettlement, providing protection to ""as many of the volunteers and their families as possible"". A statement from Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said: ""White Helmets have been the target of attacks and, due to their high profile, we judged that, in these particular circumstances, the volunteers required immediate protection.

Their official name is the Syrian Civil Defence and it began in early 2013 as an organisation of volunteers from all walks of life, including electricians and builders. Its main task soon became to rescue civilians in war zones in the immediate aftermath of air strikes, and it says its volunteers have saved the lives of more than 100,000 people during the civil war. The White Helmets fight fires and carry out repairs in war zones Numbering about 3,000 volunteers, they also carry out essential repair works. Some 200 members have been killed. The White Helmets have gained worldwide praise, were nominated for the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize and were the subject of a Netflix documentary andBBC Panorama programme. But Syria's government and its ally Russia have accused the group of links to jihadist groups. President Assad said it used ""humanitarian masks and umbrellas just to implement a certain agenda"". The group has been financed by public donations, as well as funding from foreign governments.

"Displaced residents gathered on Sunday to protest at the lack of access to their homes since last month's Glasgow School of Art fire Business owners and residents have protested at the lack of access to their properties since last month's Glasgow School of Art fire. About 30 people holding placards stood next to a cordon surrounding the school, which the city council has warned remains in a dangerous state. The protesters wanted to enter their properties to retrieve belongings. Earlier they were told that they faced arrest if they attempted to breach the cordon. There were no reports of arrests during the protest. The dismantling of unsafe sections of the Mackintosh building is expected to take several more weeks. Glasgow School of Art dismantling to take eight weeks Glasgow taskforce offers support to fire-hit businesses Residents and businesses hit out over art school fire support During the protest, displaced resident Angela Simpson, who has been unable to return to her house for the past five weeks, said: ""We just want in - 10 minutes in the house to get some belongings. ""I have my bags, just want to open the bags and go. We don't want to cause any trouble, we want to be peaceful."" Gill Hutchison, whose business Biggars Music also lies inside the cordon, said: ""We've asked Glasgow City Council and it's fallen on deaf ears. It's time they listened. ""It's a shocking situation when they're threatening people who are homeless with arrest, in a situation when absolutely no danger seems to befall the workers who are wandering around having cups of coffee - and they're closer to the dangerous building than our buildings are."" Naya Koulocheri, who has not been allowed back into her rented flat on Sauchiehall Street since the fire, told BBC Scotland: ""We don't want to break the law. We need access to our properties and hopefully that can start today. ""We feel drained - that's how 99% of the business owners and residents feel. It's been a long time and we are running out of energy."" The protesters were joined by Glasgow MSP Pauline McNeill, who backed their call for supervised access. She said: ""Surely there could be supervised access with the proper health and safety equipment - for those who say 'I need my electric toothbrush or my car keys or my laptop' or 'I'm running a small business, and my plans and my drawings for my business are inside, can I just get them?'"" The Glasgow School of Art, Mackintosh building, is currently being dismantled Earlier, a ""notice of entry"" letter was circulated by Garnethill Displaced Residents Group and Sauchiehall Street Inner Cordon Businesses, demanding ""full and legal access"" to their properties from noon on Sunday. It read: ""This will be accomplished in an orderly and peaceful manner in succession, one at a time, and for a period of 10-20 minutes, having full understanding and recognition of the risks associated therewith..."" But Glasgow City Council chief executive Annemarie O'Donnell said the cordon should not be breached at any time until building control officers declared that the structures hit by the fire were no longer dangerous. She continued: ""The building has suffered significant trauma, as a result the walls have moved in ways which will certainly lead to parts of the building collapsing. That collapse could happen without warning. ""Anyone in any adjacent buildings in the path of falling masonry would be at risk of death. ""I note from your letter that you intend to take this action 'having full understanding and recognition of the risks associated'. ""However the law compels the council to protect life, regardless of whether you wish to accept that risk."" The building is being dismantled brick by brick Ms O'Donnell said legislation also empowered the council to evacuate buildings which were dangerous, or made dangerous by an adjacent building. She added: ""Anyone who has been displaced in this way and reoccupies the building while it is still dangerous is committing a criminal offence."" Police said officers remained at the cordon for public safety purposes. A police spokesman said: ""The building has been deemed dangerous by Glasgow City Council and anyone who enters the cordon is putting themselves at risk. ""If anyone enters the cordon they may find themselves arrested, however, this would be on the grounds of concern for their safety and in order to protect them."" Business owners and residents affected by the fire recently wrote an open letter to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, claiming that the local council was overwhelmed by the recovery task. In a tweet on Saturday, Ms Sturgeon wrote: ""The issues raised in your letter are being properly and thoroughly considered (which does take a bit of time) before a full response is sent, hopefully early next week.""

"Attention has turned to Northern Ireland after the Republic of Ireland voted to overturn the country's abortion ban More than 170 politicians from the UK and Ireland have signed a letter urging the UK government to reform Northern Ireland's abortion laws. It is the only part of the UK where abortion is illegal unless there is a serious risk to a woman's health. The letter,published in the Sunday Times,,externalsays ministers cannot continue to argue that it is a devolved matter. It comes as figures suggest 28 women a week on average go to England from Northern Ireland for an abortion. The unpublished data, obtained by Labour MP Stella Creasy from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service - a charity which provides abortions, suggests that 342 women made the journey between March and May this year. Ms Creasy told the BBC's Sunday Politics that she did not want the women of Northern Ireland to be the ""collateral damage"" of Theresa May needing the DUP to prop up her government. The prime minister relies on Arlene Foster's DUP party - which oppose changes to the abortion laws in Northern Ireland - for her parliamentary majority. The DUP's Sammy Wilson told the BBC it would be babies who would become ""collateral damage"" if changes went ahead. Rise in NI women travelling for abortions UK minister urges NI abortion law change Theresa May stuck on NI abortion law Attention has turned to Northern Ireland afterthe Republic of Ireland voted overwhelmingly in favour of overturning the country's abortion banin May. Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland and an abortion is allowed only if a woman's life is at risk or there is a serious or permanent risk to her mental health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which an abortion can be performed legally. Last montha majority of Supreme Court judges said those restrictions were incompatiblewith the European Convention on Human Rights. A United Nations Committee has also saidwomen's rights are being breached. This video can not be played MPs held a highly-charged debate about abortion The cross-party letter to Prime Minister Theresa May and her Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar was coordinated by Ms Creasy and signed by 173 parliamentarians from across the UK and Ireland. They include Labour's Harriet Harman and Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, as well as Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald and the party's vice-president Michelle O'Neill. It said the Good Friday Agreement was signed on the understanding that laws would be compliant and called for an ""explicit legislative timetable"" to be set out to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland. It reads: ""This is a critical step towards ending the treatment of women in Northern Ireland as second-class citizens."" Downing Street has so far said that the issue should be dealt with by the Northern Ireland Assembly, once devolution is restored. The Democratic Unionist Party says it is ""pro-life"" and has campaigned against any extension of abortion rights in Northern Ireland. The DUP's Sammy Wilson said abortion law was a decision for the people in Northern Ireland. However, there has not been an executive at Stormont since the governing parties - the DUP and Sinn Fein - split over a bitter row 18 months ago. This means there are no ministers in place to approve any major decisions. But Mr Wilson said: ""This idea that somehow laws which don't reflect the views of the people of Northern Ireland should be slid under the radar because we don't have an assembly is totally against all of the devolution settlements and certainly against democracy."" Figures from the UK Department of Health show that more than 900 women from Northern Ireland travelled to England for an abortion last year. The number was an increase of more than 25% on the year before and followed a government announcement that women from Northern Ireland would be able toget free abortions in England.

The suspect was seen being led away from the shop by police The suspect had asked that he put handcuffs on himself before leaving the shop, the LAPD said. He had an arm injury. A young woman inside Trader Joe's was shot and killed by the suspect, police said. She has not been identified. ""I regret to inform you that there is one fatality that occurred inside, of a woman,"" Mayor Eric Garcetti said. Earlier, terrified shoppers and staff were seen fleeing in panic - some jumping from windows, others climbing down a rope ladder.

Trader Joe's staff and shop customers were clearly traumatised by the incident Eyewitness Don Kohles said he saw the car the suspect was driving crash into what was a fire hydrant or a utility pole. ""Then this guy comes out of the car and starts running toward TJs,"" Mr Kohles told CNN. ""I look behind me and there were two police guys coming with heavy guns, then boom boom boom boom, so I go into TJ's and I see this guy and he comes in. ""And I see the two front glass doors shot out. I look around and I see a TJ's employee laying on the ground. ""We all laid there for about a half-an-hour until LAPD came and got us out. They helped carry me across the parking lot and they sort of tossed me over a wall,"" Mr Kohles added. During the stand-off, a woman was taken from the crashed car and transported to a local hospital.

"Mr Raab replaced David Davis earlier this month It's going to be quite a baptism of fire for the UK's new Brexit secretary on his first visit to Brussels in the new job. He'll hardly have a foot through the door at the European Commission before he's faced with a barrage of questions. The EU wants clarity on the UK's negotiating position: is it based on Theresa May's Chequers cabinet agreement or the subsequent parliamentary amendments? Will the UK position change again in a few days or a week's time? The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier then has another message he's hell-bent on delivering. Work with us, he will say to Dominic Raab, to finish the UK's exit deal - the so-called Withdrawal Agreement - otherwise the chances are rising of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal come March next year. Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Boris Johnson's joke-free pitch to MPs Now coincidence of coincidences, just as Mr Raab arrives in town, the European Commission will publish a paper instructing EU governments to do more to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit which - it warns - would have a considerable impact on European businesses and citizens. The paper mentions amongst other things the potential immediate impact on EU borders - with goods and people from the UK subject to customs checks. It predicts the aviation industry could be severely disrupted- with EU-UK airline and passenger rights agreements no longer valid. It advises that personal data transfers to the UK would be subject to new limitations and that the City of London would no longer have financial passporting rights. Mr Barnier is warning that the chances of a no deal Brexit could rise The paper also alerts pharmaceutical companies to the fact that the testing of European medicines could no longer to be carried out in the UK in the case of a no-deal Brexit and it informs that the UK would have to be removed from EU databases. Contrary to some UK media reports which suggest that the Commission's ""preparedness paper"" as it's known is being published now as a result of the political turmoil and uncertainty in Westminster, this is something the Commission has been working on for months. The Commission likes to say it began its preparedness research when the UK government began the mantra of ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" though that, I think, is questionable. Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Brussels fears UK turmoil may lead to no-deal Brexit I've seen a draft of the preparedness paper but have been told it is a work in progress and will only be finalised on Thursday morning, just in time for Mr Raab's Brussels arrival. As one senior EU diplomat put it to me: ""When it comes to Brexit, there are no innocent timings."" Having had a lot of background chats with senior European officials of late, I can say with certainty that the Commission paper is not simply a scaremongering exercise. There is genuine concern in Brussels that: EU-UK negotiating time is running out even if Theresa May or whoever takes her job (if it gets that far) is able to strike a Brexit deal in Brussels, they may not have the ability to sell it to parliament back home The EU thinks a Brexit no-deal scenario would be a bureaucratic, practical and financial nightmare for Europe. So expect Mr Barnier to adopt encouraging tones with Mr Raab, reminding him that the Withdrawal Agreement is already 80% signed off between the EU and UK. This video can not be played What will Brexit mean for expat dogs? However, the 20% left is challenging to say the least - covering flashpoints like data protection, UK military bases in Cyprus and who should police the withdrawal agreement and subsequent almost two-year transition period. On the Irish border backstop - where both the EU and UK have undertaken to avoid the re-introduction of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Ireland whatever their post-Brexit relationship looks like - the Commission, I'm told, is working on rewording the protocol in the declared hope that will make it easier for team Theresa May to sign up to. Former EU trade official Peter Guilford told me this week he believes the Brussels rumours that Brexit talks will go down to the wire this autumn and it would only be when the Commission ""saw the whites of UK negotiators' eyes"" that they would start making their own compromises instead of always hammering the UK for them. But EU diplomats wonder: can Theresa May hang on till then?

"The new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab unveiled the White Paper on Thursday The government has published its long-awaitedBrexit White Paper,external. The document is 104 pages long and follows last week's Chequers agreement which set out the sort of relationship the UK wants with the EU after Brexit. TheWhite Paper is split into four chapters,external: economic partnership, security, cooperation and institutional arrangements. Most of the debate surrounds the first section, the future economic relationship. So here are the key excerpts from the chapter on ""economic partnership"" and what they mean. This is a line that emerged in the Chequers statement last Friday, and it is one of the most important in this White Paper. It is the UK government's answer to the concerns expressed by businesses that rely on ""just-in-time"" manufacturing supply chains (such as car manufacturers), and to the need toavoid the reimposition of a hard border in Ireland. The White Paper proposes a free trade area for goods - but it is very close to single market membership for goods in all but name. The suggestion of a common rulebook sounds very collaborative, but it does - in effect - mean the UK agreeing to take on the EU's rules and regulations in all these areas. If the UK parliament chose not to sign up to any of those rules, the idea of frictionless trade would begin to fall apart. The other big sensitivity in this section will be the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The White Paper says the role of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end, and it sets out detailed proposals for joint institutional arrangements to police future economic ties. But the ECJ is the ultimate legal authority on EU rules with which the UK proposes to harmonise. There's more detail here about how the UK proposes to combine bits of its two previous customs proposals, to create an entirely new customs relationship with the EU. It would take advantage of new technologies to make trade as frictionless as possible, but it would still involve the UK collecting EU tariffs (taxes on imports) at UK borders on the EU's behalf - something which isn't done anywhere else in the world on any significant scale. The White Paper says the UK would also apply its own tariffs, and an independent trade policy, for goods intended for consumption in the UK. In other words, it would still seek to strike its own trade deals around the world, even though it would be bound by EU rules and regulations. For once, Brexiteers and the EU appear united - neither thinks the proposal has much chance of working because of its sheer complexity. Unsurprisingly the UK government disputes that, and says it wants to be at the cutting edge of global customs policy. But it's also worth noting that the White Paper says the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) would have to be phased in - which is code for saying that it wouldn't be ready by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020. Reality Check: What's the EU common rulebook? Reality Check: Why services matter in any Brexit deal? Reality Check: The Brexit challenge for Irish trade The White Paper confirms that the UK will seek active participation in (if not full membership of) the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and the European Medicines Agency. The government is keen to address business demands that they only need to go through one approval mechanism to access both markets, in highly regulated parts of the economy. The EU has previously ruled out full UK membership of these agencies, and noted that it would have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice if it were to sign up to their rules and regulations. The White Paper accepts that the UK would not have any voting rights in the way the agencies go about their business, and that it would have to make appropriate financial contributions to them. This is part of the pragmatic Brexit the government is now advocating, but it is not the resumption of full UK sovereignty that some leading leave campaigners had promised. The section on services confirms that the UK is seeking a looser relationship with the EU forroughly 80% of the UK economy. Financial and other services will no longer be able to take advantage of passporting, which gives them automatic access to other EU markets (the UK's Financial Conduct Authority says about 5,500 UK financial firms currently have EU passporting rights). The government has abandoned plans for a new relationship based on the concept of mutual recognition of financial regulations, partly because it had been so comprehensively rejected by the EU. But it is still seeking something more ambitious than the ""equivalence' regime"" that the EU has with most other third countries (part of the problem with that is that it can be withdrawn, by either side, with just 30 days notice). So, the UK argues that the importance of the City of London to the EU's entire financial system means a more ambitious solution needs to be found. The trouble with a lot of these proposals though is that the EU will see them as cherry-picking from the four freedoms that underpin the single market. It has already said that the UK cannot have full access to the single market for goods and not services, especially if it is determined to end the free movement of people. The White Paper emphasises repeatedly that free movement of people will come to an end. Full details of a new immigration policy are due to be published in a separate White Paper, which has already been delayed several times. But there are hints in this document of what could be to come - it sets out proposals for a mobility framework, which is pretty standard in trade agreements. It could - among other things - ""allow citizens to travel freely, without a visa, for tourism and temporary business activity."" But some Brexiteers fear that what will eventually emerge will be free movement under another name, and they are already suspicious that this is just an opening bid from the government. The EU will certainly push for further concessions if the UK is to get anything close to the economic relationship it wants. Part of the problem for the UK is that it is asking the EU to be a little bit more flexible in the way it interprets its rules-based system. But that request is being made at a time when the EU thinks its rules are under threat from external sources like President Trump, and internal sources like governments in Italy, Hungary and Poland.

"This video can not be played Three politicians give their view on a Brexit ""no deal"" A deal with the EU can be reached by October but the UK is preparing for the possibility of no deal, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said. He said he would return to Brussels for talks on Thursday and strain ""every sinew"" to get ""the best deal"". But the government had plans in place in case talks did not end well, he told the BBC. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said there must be a ""serious stepping up of negotiations"" to avoid no deal. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards. Theresa May hopes the government's plan, detailed recently in the Brexit White Paper, will allow the two sides to reach a deal on relations by the autumn. Downing Street said on Sunday that cabinet ministers would be promoting the plan across Europe over the summer. Theresa May would ""take the lead"" by meeting the Austrian chancellor, Czech prime minister and Estonian prime minister next week. Mrs May said: ""We must step up the pace of negotiations and get on to deliver a good deal that will bring greater prosperity and security to both British and European citizens. ""We both know the clock is ticking - let's get on with it."" Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if the ""energy, ambition and pragmatism"" the UK brought to negotiations was reciprocated, a deal would be done in October. He noted that 80% of the withdrawal agreement was already settled. And he said it was ""useful"" that EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had raised questions about the prime minister's blueprint for the UK's future trading relationship with the EU. ""The fact Michel Barnier is not blowing it out of the water but asking questions is a good, positive sign - that's what we negotiate on."" Barnier questions May's Brexit plan What would a 'no deal' Brexit look like? Brexit: All you need to know What does UK White Paper reveal? But he said preparations such as hiring extra border staff were being made because ""any responsible government"" would make sure plans were in place in case negotiations failed. Technical notices would be released for businesses and citizens affected during the summer to be ""very clear about what they should do and what we are doing on their behalf"" he added. Asked about European Commission comments that there were no arrangements in place for UK and EU expats in the event of no deal, Mr Raab said: ""Well, I think that's a rather irresponsible thing to be coming from the other side. ""We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the continent and also here. ""There is obviously an attempt to try and ramp up the pressure."" Analysis by Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent We've heard it often enough: ""No deal is better than a bad deal"". But for EU negotiators to believe the UK would walk away without agreement, the government has to be seen to be taking that option seriously. And so we are told about ""planning"" and ""technical notices"" to prepare for a ""clean break"" Brexit. Reports of food stockpiles and a motorway becoming a lorry park are dismissed as ""unhelpful snippets"" but contingency plans will be made nonetheless. Both sides agree a deal needs to be reached by October, and negotiations are likely to go down to the wire. So even if a deal appears to be in sight, expect the talk of the UK leaving the EU without one to continue. He added that the prospect of people being removed from the UK was ""far-fetched and fanciful"" and said it would be ""frankly irrational"" for the EU to go for the ""worst case scenario"" of no deal. But the UK had to be prepared with things like allocating money, preparing treaty relations, and hiring extra border staff ""so that Britain can thrive, whatever happens,"" he said. Labour leader Mr Corbyn, on a visit to the annual Tolpuddle Martyrs Festival in Dorset, said it seemed the priority was preparation for no deal. He added that would be ""very bad"", as ""we then go onto World Trade Organization tariff rates that would hit the manufacturing industry and hit the food processing industry, and hit an awful lot of things in Britain very rapidly"". ""There has to be a serious stepping-up of negotiations to reach an agreement on customs and on trade."" Baptism of fire for UK's new Brexit minister Reality Check: What's the EU common rulebook? Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Earlier, Mr Raabsuggested to the Sunday Telegraph,externalthat he was still persuading other cabinet ministers that the government's ""pragmatic"" strategy for leaving the EU was the ""best plan"" and that the UK could refuse to pay its so-called divorce bill, a payment from the UK to the EU estimated to be about Â£39bn, if it does not get a trade deal. Theresa May's proposal for a future trade relationship with the EU sparked two cabinet resignations, including Mr Raab's predecessor David Davis. The White Paper proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but will end free movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations. Critics at Westminster say it is an unworkable compromise which would leave the UK being governed by the EU in many areas, but with no say in its rules. And EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier questioned on Friday whether UK plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical and said the EU would not run the risk of weakening its single market. Meanwhile, Mr Davis, whose resignation from Mrs May's top team was followed by that of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson,told the Sunday Express,externalthe government should ""start again"" on withdrawal plans.

"President Trump has imposed tariffs on a range of Chinese goods US President Donald Trump has shaken the foundations of global trade, slapping steep tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods from the EU, Canada, Mexico and China. All these countries are responding in kind, retaliating with levies on thousands of US products. This puts the world's largest economies at each other's throats. But what is a trade war? How does protectionism work? And how will it all affect you? It's what it sounds like - a trade war is when countries try to attack each other's trade with taxes and quotas. One country will raise tariffs, a type of tax, causing the other to respond, in a tit-for-tat escalation. This can hurt other nations' economies and lead to rising political tensions between them. US President Donald Trump reckons trade wars are ""good"" and easy. He's not afraid to raise tariffs. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Four reasons Trump is hanging tough on trade It's a tax on a product made abroad. In theory, taxing items coming into the country means people are less likely to buy them as they become more expensive. The intention is that they buy cheaper local products instead - boosting your country's economy. The president has placed tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods from around the world, in particular China. He's imposed a 10% levy on $200bn (Â£150bn) worth of Chinese products so far. In May, he announcedplans to impose a 25% tariff on $325bn of other Chinese goods,external. Mr Trump said the $100bn gained from the tariffs will be used to buy US agricultural products, which will then be sent to ""poor and starving countries"" for ""humanitarian assistance"". He also wants to cut the trade deficit with China - a country he has accused of unfair trade practices since before he became president. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump made a big point on the campaign trail about cutting the country's trade deficits. He's convinced it hurts US manufacturing, and has said time and time again on the stump and on Twitter thatthe US must do more to tackle them,external. It's a term meaning the difference between how much your country buys from another country, compared with how much you sell to that country. And the US has a massive trade deficit with China. Last year,it widened by $43.6bn to $419.2bn. He wants to cut back this trade deficit, and he intends to use tariffs to do it. But while the president hates them, trade deficits are not necessarily a bad thing. Many wealthier countries have in recent decades shifted from manufacturing economies to service economies - focusing on areas like banking, travel and tourism. Reality Check: Is Trump right about US trade deficit? Services contribute to the majority of the US economy's net income. China, in contrast, doesn't export nearly as many services as it does manufactured goods. So the president's obsession with trade deficits is not always popular, with critics damning the administration's moves as protectionism. This video can not be played Trump constantly worries about the trade deficit - should we? Protectionism is trying to use restrictions such as tariffs to boost your country's industry, and shield it from foreign competition. Take Mr Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs. In May 2018, the president announceda 25% tariff on all steel imports, and 10% on aluminium. The Trump administration claims the US relies too much on other countries for its metals, and that it couldn't make enough weapons or vehicles using its own industry if a war broke out. Critics point out the US gets most of its steel from Canada and the EU - staunch US allies. In theory, taxing foreign steel and aluminium will mean US companies will buy local steel instead. The thinking is that will boost the US steel and aluminium industries, as more companies will want to buy their goods. Steel and aluminium prices will go up in the US because there will be less of these goods coming in from abroad - so the greater demand for local steel will push up the price, lifting profits for steel makers. Protectionism: What Trump has in common with Lincoln and Ferris Bueller The number of people employed in the US steel industry fell by almost 50,000 between 2000 and 2016 Sort of. US steel makers could get a boost - demand will drive new hires and bigger profits. But the US companies that need raw materials, like car and aeroplane makers, will see their costs rise. Could Trump tariffs damage US steel? Steel tariffs - what impact will they really have? That means they might have to put up the prices on their finished products. That would hurt consumers. So car prices could go up in the US. As could prices for gadgets, plane tickets and even beer - the price of making a can could rise. Making beer cans could become more pricey - and that cost could be pushed onto consumers They could affect people around the world - especially since China has retaliated. The world's second-largest economy has taxed US agricultural and industrial products, from soybeans, pork and cotton to aeroplanes, cars and steel pipes. It has also pledged to take ""necessary countermeasures"" over Trump's latest proposed tariffs. Charting the US-China trade battle How a US-China trade war could hurt us all In theory, China could also tax US tech companies like Apple. That would hit the tech giant, and it could be forced to raise its prices to compensate. A global trade war could hurt consumers around the world by making it harder for all companies to operate, forcing them to push higher prices onto their customers. Depends who you ask. Free trade is the opposite of protectionism - it means as few tariffs as possible, giving people the freedom to buy cheaper or better-made products from anywhere in the world. This is great for companies trying to cut costs, and that's helped drive prices down and boost the world economy. Free trade has led to a vast expansion of shipping and transfer of goods around the world Cars, smart phones, food, flowers - free trade has brought affordable products from around the world to your home. But at the same time, that means companies are less likely to buy local products. Why buy domestic when you can get more, cheaper, from a different country? This means the loss of jobs in wealthier countries, and uneven growth - while free trade has made some people richer, it's made others poorer. No idea. Historians have pointed out that tariffs often lead to higher costs for the consumer, while economists across the board are against the plans. The Republican Party is also overwhelmingly against Mr Trump on tariffs - they're big supporters of free trade. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"""No deal"" can be a confusing term in the Brexit debate because there are, in fact, several potential deals waiting to be done. The main ones are: a withdrawal agreement - which needs to be finalised and ratified before the UK leaves the EU an agreement on what the future UK-EU relationship will look like Negotiations on the future relationship, which was the focus of the recentBrexit White Paper, look set to continue long after Brexit has taken place. But when people talk about preparing for no deal at the moment, they mean the prospect of failing to reach agreement on the terms of departure, which are being negotiated underArticle 50 of the Lisbon treaty,external. It is these Article 50 negotiations, led by Michel Barnier for the EU and the new Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, for the UK, which are supposed to end with a withdrawal agreement. A lot of the heavy lifting is being done behind the scenes by teams of experts led by Mr Barnier's deputy, Sabine Weyand, and by British civil servant Ollie Robbins. But in the end, the Article 50 negotiations are a political process. If they fail, we are heading for no deal. And the reason that is now back in the headlines is that time is running short. The two-year period outlined by Article 50 comes to an end on 29 March 2019 and unless all 28 EU countries agree to extend that period, the withdrawal agreement will have to be done and dusted well before then. And no withdrawal agreement would also mean there would be no transition period after Brexit. Instead, there would be an abrupt rupture in UK/EU relations. So ""no deal"" needs to be taken seriously. Michel Barnier has called for ""no deal"" preparations to be stepped up There is an element of needing to look tough under pressure in negotiations - ""Don't think we won't walk away,"" and all that. Some supporters of Brexit also say it would mean the UK wouldn't have to pay a ""divorce bill"" to the EU, although that is an argument that would probably end up in court. But there's also a real concern that the pace of preparations for no deal - among governments and businesses - needs to increase. TheEU published a document,externalon Thursday which warned that contingency planning should be stepped up in all countries and all sectors of the economy. Among other things, it said: There would be no specific arrangement on the future rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU Border checks would have to be re-imposed, and transport between the UK and the EU would be severely affected The UK would become a ""third country"" with substantially less access to the EU single market. The UK's relationship with the EU would suddenly be governed not by the common rules and regulations that have been built up over more than 40 years but by general international public law. That would include the basic rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), something which many Brexit supporters say they would be perfectly happy with. But it is worth pointing out that no other major trading partner of the EU trades with it on WTO terms alone. Many businesses - especially those that rely on just-in-time manufacturing supply chains - have also been lobbying hard against it. Falling back on WTO rules would also mean the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Quite how border controls would actually be set upin Irelandin the first few days after a no-deal Brexit is far from clear. But it's something both sides say they are determined to avoid. May: EU must 'evolve' Brexit position What is the EU common rulebook? What does UK White Paper reveal? It's worth emphasising that the UK government says it does not ""want or expect a no-deal scenario"". But it, too, is stepping up contingency planning. Throughout August and September individual departments will be publishing a set of around 70 technical notices to help businesses, citizens and consumers prepare for March 2019 in the event of no deal. The EU has already published68 technical notices,externalof its own focusing on the preparations that different sectors of the economy need to make for Brexit. One important issue is timing. If both sides conclude fairly soon that negotiations will not succeed and that ""no deal"" is highly likely, they will at least have several months to prepare. But if there is a last-minute hitch, that would prove extremely challenging. That's when people talk of a cliff-edge Brexit. Well, some of them are pretty obvious. To ensure the supply of basic services, for example. At a hearing of the House of Commons Public Administration Committee on Thursday the chief executive of the civil service, John Manzoni, highlighted the need to protect ""supply chains for food and medicines"" under the ""almost unimaginable"" scenario of a cliff-edge departure. The Department of Health, he said, had already announced that it would stockpile medicines. Mr Manzoni also mentioned transport - there would be a need to try to negotiate a series of bilateral agreements with individual countries to allow planes to fly, if the UK left the European Aviation Safety Agency with no new deals in place. Another example emerged this week ina report from the National Audit Office,external. Currently, it says, 100,000 International Driving Permits are issued every year by 89 post offices around the country. In the first year after a no-deal Brexit, those numbers would rise to an estimated 4,500 post offices issuing up to seven million permits - to take into account journeys into the EU. In other words, every area of the economy needs to be ready for no deal. Just in case. We keep being told that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. But this could be the biggest gamble of all. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"The Trump administration says protecting US steel and aluminium producers is a matter of national security A trade war is now a reality, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned as G20 ministers gather for a summit in Argentina. The current US trade policy of imposing unilateral tariffs is based on ""the law of the jungle"", he said. But US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin defended the tariffs and urged the EU and China to open their markets to allow free competition. Last week,US President Donald Trump described the EU as a ""foe"" on trade. Mr Trump later threatened to impose tariffs on all $500bn (Â£380bn) of Chinese goods entering the USin a growing trade row. The US has large trade deficits with both the 28-member EU and China. The two-day talks in Buenos Aires bring together finance ministers and central bankers of the world's top 20 economies. What is a trade war and why should I worry? G7 summit ends in disarray over tariffs Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs? ""World trade cannot base itself on the law of the jungle and the unilateral increase of tariffs is the law of the jungle,"" Mr Le Maire told AFP news agency. Partners or foes? Steven Mnuchin (left) and Bruno Le Maire at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires ""The law of the fittest - this cannot be the future of global trade relations. The law of the jungle will only turn out losers, it will weaken growth, threaten the most fragile countries and have disastrous political consequences."" He added that a trade war was now a reality, and that the EU could not consider negotiating a free trade deal with the US without America first withdrawing its tariffs on steel and aluminium. Mr Mnuchin said it was pretty simple. ""My message is pretty clear, it's the same message the president delivered at the G7 (last month in Canada): if Europe believes in free trade, we're ready to sign a free trade agreement with no tariffs, no non-tariff barriers and no subsidies. It has to be all three,"" he said. Mr Mnuchin said China had to open its markets ""so we can compete fairly"". ""We share a desire to have a more balanced relationship and the balanced relationship is by us selling more goods [to China],"" he said. Little has caused Donald Trump more annoyance than the trading deficits between the US and its major partners. He believes that if you have a trade deficit - if you import more than you export - you are losing out. Tackling what he has called ""unfair trading practices"" has become a key plank of his administration. The European Union, China and the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) countries, Mexico and Canada, have been his main targets.

"This video can not be played Footage from the Israel Defense Forces shows the evacuation from Syria to Jordan Israel says it has carried out an evacuation of members of Syria's White Helmets civil defence group from a war zone in south-western Syria. Some 422 volunteers and family members were taken to Jordan via the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights overnight. The UK, one of the nations requesting Israel's help, hailed the operation and will assist with resettlement. The White Helmets describe themselves as a volunteer workforce that acts to save people in Syria's war zones. Supporters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and his Russian allies, say the White Helmets support the rebels and also have links to jihadist groups. The unstoppable momentum of Assadâs war Why is there a war in Syria? The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they were acting on a request from the US, the UK and other European nations. The White Helmets had become trapped in an area of south-western Syria near the border with the Golan Heights after an offensive by the Syrian military. Pictures supplied by the Israel Defence Forces show families waiting to get off the bus after being safely evacuated The offensive, begun in June, has seen a number of agreements that have led to the evacuation of rebel forces from the Deraa and Quneitra areas to regions further north. The latest deal for Quneitra was reached on Thursday. The White Helmets operate only in rebel-held areas, although they say they are non-partisan. The evacuees were driven to the border with the Golan Heights and taken on from there by Israeli troops to Jordan. The plan had been to evacuate 800 White Helmets and their families, but only 422 made it. The BBC's Mark Lowen says the others have been hemmed in by the expansion of Islamic State group fighters into pockets of south-west Syria and, as this was a one-off operation, fears remain for the fate of those left behind. Those successfully evacuated included about 100 White Helmets, with the rest family members. The IDF said they had ""completed a humanitarian effort to rescue members of a Syrian civil organisation and their families"", saying there was an ""immediate threat to their lives"".

Although Israel is not directly involved in the Syria conflict, the two countries have been in a state of war for decades. Despite the intervention, the IDF said that ""Israel continues to maintain a non-intervention policy regarding the Syrian conflict"". Jordan's government confirmed it had ""authorised the United Nations to organise the passage of 800 Syrian citizens through Jordan to be resettled in Western countries"". The White Helmet volunteers and their families will be held in a ""restricted area"" of Jordan and assessed by the UN, pending resettlement. Jordan said that ""Britain, Germany and Canada made a legally binding undertaking to resettle them within a specified period of time due to 'a risk to their lives'."" The families are now in Jordan, pending resettlement The UK confirmed it would help with the resettlement, providing protection to ""as many of the volunteers and their families as possible"". A statement from Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said: ""White Helmets have been the target of attacks and, due to their high profile, we judged that, in these particular circumstances, the volunteers required immediate protection.

Their official name is the Syrian Civil Defence and it began in early 2013 as an organisation of volunteers from all walks of life, including electricians and builders. Its main task soon became to rescue civilians in war zones in the immediate aftermath of air strikes, and it says its volunteers have saved the lives of more than 100,000 people during the civil war. The White Helmets fight fires and carry out repairs in war zones Numbering about 3,000 volunteers, they also carry out essential repair works. Some 200 members have been killed. The White Helmets have gained worldwide praise, were nominated for the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize and were the subject of a Netflix documentary andBBC Panorama programme.

"This video can not be played Footage from the Israel Defense Forces shows the evacuation from Syria to Jordan Israel says it has carried out an evacuation of members of Syria's White Helmets civil defence group from a war zone in south-western Syria. Some 422 volunteers and family members were taken to Jordan via the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights overnight. The UK, one of the nations requesting Israel's help, hailed the operation and will assist with resettlement. The White Helmets describe themselves as a volunteer workforce that acts to save people in Syria's war zones. Supporters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and his Russian allies, say the White Helmets support the rebels and also have links to jihadist groups. The unstoppable momentum of Assadâs war Why is there a war in Syria? The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they were acting on a request from the US, the UK and other European nations. The White Helmets had become trapped in an area of south-western Syria near the border with the Golan Heights after an offensive by the Syrian military. Pictures supplied by the Israel Defence Forces show families waiting to get off the bus after being safely evacuated The offensive, begun in June, has seen a number of agreements that have led to the evacuation of rebel forces from the Deraa and Quneitra areas to regions further north. The latest deal for Quneitra was reached on Thursday. The White Helmets operate only in rebel-held areas, although they say they are non-partisan. The evacuees were driven to the border with the Golan Heights and taken on from there by Israeli troops to Jordan. The plan had been to evacuate 800 White Helmets and their families, but only 422 made it. The BBC's Mark Lowen says the others have been hemmed in by the expansion of Islamic State group fighters into pockets of south-west Syria and, as this was a one-off operation, fears remain for the fate of those left behind. Those successfully evacuated included about 100 White Helmets, with the rest family members. The IDF said they had ""completed a humanitarian effort to rescue members of a Syrian civil organisation and their families"", saying there was an ""immediate threat to their lives"".

Although Israel is not directly involved in the Syria conflict, the two countries have been in a state of war for decades. Despite the intervention, the IDF said that ""Israel continues to maintain a non-intervention policy regarding the Syrian conflict"". Jordan's government confirmed it had ""authorised the United Nations to organise the passage of 800 Syrian citizens through Jordan to be resettled in Western countries"". The White Helmet volunteers and their families will be held in a ""restricted area"" of Jordan and assessed by the UN, pending resettlement. Jordan said that ""Britain, Germany and Canada made a legally binding undertaking to resettle them within a specified period of time due to 'a risk to their lives'."" The families are now in Jordan, pending resettlement The UK confirmed it would help with the resettlement, providing protection to ""as many of the volunteers and their families as possible"". A statement from Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said: ""White Helmets have been the target of attacks and, due to their high profile, we judged that, in these particular circumstances, the volunteers required immediate protection. ""We pay tribute to the brave and selfless work that White Helmet volunteers have done to save Syrians on all sides of the conflict."" Allow Twitter content?

Their official name is the Syrian Civil Defence and it began in early 2013 as an organisation of volunteers from all walks of life, including electricians and builders. Its main task soon became to rescue civilians in war zones in the immediate aftermath of air strikes, and it says its volunteers have saved the lives of more than 100,000 people during the civil war. The White Helmets fight fires and carry out repairs in war zones Numbering about 3,000 volunteers, they also carry out essential repair works. Some 200 members have been killed. The White Helmets have gained worldwide praise, were nominated for the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize and were the subject of a Netflix documentary andBBC Panorama programme.

"Attention has turned to Northern Ireland after the Republic of Ireland voted to overturn the country's abortion ban More than 170 politicians from the UK and Ireland have signed a letter urging the UK government to reform Northern Ireland's abortion laws. It is the only part of the UK where abortion is illegal unless there is a serious risk to a woman's health. The letter,published in the Sunday Times,,externalsays ministers cannot continue to argue that it is a devolved matter. It comes as figures suggest 28 women a week on average go to England from Northern Ireland for an abortion. The unpublished data, obtained by Labour MP Stella Creasy from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service - a charity which provides abortions, suggests that 342 women made the journey between March and May this year. Ms Creasy told the BBC's Sunday Politics that she did not want the women of Northern Ireland to be the ""collateral damage"" of Theresa May needing the DUP to prop up her government. The prime minister relies on Arlene Foster's DUP party - which oppose changes to the abortion laws in Northern Ireland - for her parliamentary majority. The DUP's Sammy Wilson told the BBC it would be babies who would become ""collateral damage"" if changes went ahead. Rise in NI women travelling for abortions UK minister urges NI abortion law change Theresa May stuck on NI abortion law Attention has turned to Northern Ireland afterthe Republic of Ireland voted overwhelmingly in favour of overturning the country's abortion banin May. Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland and an abortion is allowed only if a woman's life is at risk or there is a serious or permanent risk to her mental health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which an abortion can be performed legally. Last montha majority of Supreme Court judges said those restrictions were incompatiblewith the European Convention on Human Rights. A United Nations Committee has also saidwomen's rights are being breached. This video can not be played MPs held a highly-charged debate about abortion The cross-party letter to Prime Minister Theresa May and her Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar was coordinated by Ms Creasy and signed by 173 parliamentarians from across the UK and Ireland. They include Labour's Harriet Harman and Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, as well as Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald and the party's vice-president Michelle O'Neill. It said the Good Friday Agreement was signed on the understanding that laws would be compliant and called for an ""explicit legislative timetable"" to be set out to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland. It reads: ""This is a critical step towards ending the treatment of women in Northern Ireland as second-class citizens."" Downing Street has so far said that the issue should be dealt with by the Northern Ireland Assembly, once devolution is restored. The Democratic Unionist Party says it is ""pro-life"" and has campaigned against any extension of abortion rights in Northern Ireland. The DUP's Sammy Wilson said abortion law was a decision for the people in Northern Ireland. However, there has not been an executive at Stormont since the governing parties - the DUP and Sinn Fein - split over a bitter row 18 months ago. This means there are no ministers in place to approve any major decisions. But Mr Wilson said: ""This idea that somehow laws which don't reflect the views of the people of Northern Ireland should be slid under the radar because we don't have an assembly is totally against all of the devolution settlements and certainly against democracy."" Figures from the UK Department of Health show that more than 900 women from Northern Ireland travelled to England for an abortion last year. The number was an increase of more than 25% on the year before and followed a government announcement that women from Northern Ireland would be able toget free abortions in England.
