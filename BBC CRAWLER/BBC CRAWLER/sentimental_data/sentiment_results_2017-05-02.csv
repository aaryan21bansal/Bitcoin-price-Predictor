"Moussa Dembele and Stuart Armstrong have been vital to Celtic's title win Celtic striker Moussa Dembele has been shortlisted for player and young player of the year in the PFA Scotland awards. The 20-year-old Frenchman is joined in the senior list by team-mates Stuart Armstrong and Scott Sinclair, plus Aberdeen wide man Jonny Hayes. His opponents for the young player award are team-mates Patrick Roberts and Kieran Tierney, the holder, along with Hibernian striker Jason Cummings. The winners will be announced on Sunday 7 May at the PFA's annual dinner. Celtic players have won the last three top-flight player of the year awards and have only failed to win it twice in the past 13 seasons. Motherwell striker Michael Higdon topped the list in 2013, Rangers midfielder Steven Davis took the award in 2010, while Rangers defender Fernando Ricksen shared it with Celtic's John Hartson in 2005. Patrick Roberts and Kieran Tierney, who won last year, are both up for the young player award Players make the shortlist after voting among players in the Scottish Professional Football League. Striker Leigh Griffiths was theirtop choice last season,with midfielder Stefan Johansen the year before and Kris Commons in 2014. If Hayes were to win, he would become the first Dons player to take the award since Scotland midfielder Jim Bett in 1990. This video can not be played Premiership player of the year nominees The shortlists for the Championship, League One and League Two player of the year awardswere announced last week. Cummings, whose goals have helped Hibs win promotion, was shortlisted for Championship player of the year as well as the overall young player award. Left-back Tierney could become the first to win the young player award twice since Aberdeen midfielder Eoin Jess in 1993 - and the first to win it two years running since Hearts defender Craig Levein in 1986. Stuart Armstrong, 25, midfielder (Celtic):the former Dundee United midfielder has blossomed in his second full season at Celtic Park and has contributed 14 goals in his 44 appearances, earning himself his first Scotland cap. Moussa Dembele, 20, striker (Celtic):the France Under-21 international has proved a bargain signing for around Â£500,000 from Fulham last summer and scored 32 goals in 49 appearances before his season was cut short this month because of a hamstring injury. Jonny Hayes, 29, winger (Aberdeen):in his fifth season at Pittodrie, the versatile wide man has played at full-back and on the wing, scoring eight times in 40 appearances and re-established himself in the Republic of Ireland squad in helping the Dons into second place in the Premiership and make two cup finals. Scott Sinclair, 28, winger (Celtic):his career having stalled at Aston Villa, the former Swansea City and Manchester City winger has been a revelation under Brendan Rodgers and scored 25 goals in 45 games for the league and League Cup winners. Jason Cummings' goals helped Hibs win the Championship title and promotion Jason Cummings, 21, striker (Hibernian):the product of Hibs' youth system and Scotland Under-21 international has found the net 23 times in 38 appearances as the Edinburgh side won the Championship title and promotion, as well as reaching the Scottish Cup semi-finals. Moussa Dembele, 20, striker (Celtic):the Frenchman won his early-season joust with Leigh Griffiths to become first-choice striker under Brendan Rodgers and it led to speculation about a multi-million pound January move to Chelsea. Patrick Roberts, 20, winger (Celtic):continuing his 18-month loan from Manchester City, the England Under-20 international has had to share a place in the starting line-up with Scotland winger James Forrest but has looked a constant threat, scoring seven goals in 42 games. Kieran Tierney, 19, left-back (Celtic):despite having an injury disrupted season, the flying wide man has had another fine season that has led to reports of interest from top English clubs and should lead to a fourth Scotland cap against England in June.

"Two entirely different tales emerged from dinner at Downing Street Welcome to the EU/UK dominated Brexit Galaxy of Spin and Counter-Spin. A crazy old place. The galactic atmosphere is such these days that the dimensions of truth are elastic; at times, distorted. Take the arguments this weekend over whether the Downing Street dinner last Wednesday at which Theresa May hosted European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was a complete disaster or not. Not at all, insists Downing Street. But it was a fiasco, according to Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and thereafter hitting Twitter and headlines across the UK. In Brussels, Politico quotes an EU diplomat saying the dinner went ""badly, really badly"". He reportedly went as far as to claim the British government was now ""living in a different galaxy"" to the EU when it came to Brexit expectations. This all seems rather inflammatory, so who's right and who's stretching the truth? Even French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron has been talking Brexit Well, in this politically volatile pre-Brexit negotiations time, ahead of elections in biggest players UK, Germany and France and with the EU as a whole fighting to appear united, relevant and strong, one has to be extremely spin-aware. For example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel talked last week about the UK harbouring Brexit ""illusions"". And French presidential favourite Emmanuel Macron announced he would, post-Brexit, end the bilateral deal by which France keeps in Calais so-called ""illegal migrants"" attempting to cross to Dover. But these tough-sounding comments are at least as much aimed at their domestic audience as at the British government. That said, a high-level EU source has confirmed to me that feelings were running pretty high following the Downing Street dinner due to what he described as a huge ""asymmetry of expectations"" and a ""completely different reading"" of the Brexit situation at No 10. This video can not be played Theresa May said the report was ""Brussels gossip"" He said the British government, from their comments about negotiations, clearly had ""no good understanding of the fundamentals"" around which he said the EU was united, and which would now not be undone. There are certainly obvious sticking points where the EU and UK do seem a galaxy or two apart: Downing Street keeps insisting on parallel divorce and future trade talks from the offset The British government also suggests, I'm told, that a deal on EU citizens' rights can be rapidly reached (by the time of the EU leaders' summit this June) And it doesn't seem to accept Brussels' assertion that the UK has a sizeable bill of outstanding financial commitments to honour before it leaves the EU. Poppycock, says a frustrated EU, to all of the above. My source told me Mr Juncker was already vexed when he arrived at No 10 on Wednesday having only just been informed of the UK's (legally justified, but awkward) decision not sign the mid-term review of the EU's multi-annual budget until after the June elections. The review needs unanimous approval to go ahead. It doesn't call for more cash but rather its redistribution. The EU is anxious to send money Africa-wards, for example, to halt the flow of migrants coming from there. But the review is frozen until the UK signs it. ""They gave Juncker no warning at all and told him the night before he came to dinner,"" my source told me. ""They have no idea how Brussels works."" Another high-level source I spoke to attended a meeting with all the EU team present at the Downing Street dinner. ""The word 'Ã©chec' (French for 'failure') came up several times,"" he told me. Brexit: All you need to know May: Dinner row claim is Brussels gossip Where UK parties stand on Brexit ""Before that the word wasn't used very often in connection with Brexit but now we're told we have to prepare for the possibility of a failure scenario."" What percentage chance of a successful outcome was being projected in EU leadership circles at the moment? ""50/50 with hopes for more clarity after the British elections are over,"" I was told. Over and again, EU diplomats insist this is no ""us against them"" situation; that there's no desire to punish Britain and that a good Brexit is in everyone's interest. ""It's in our mutual interest to correct all the misunderstandings,"" I was told today. My source was confident that Downing Street was beginning to realise that now too. Or are we still in the galaxy of spin? What happens now that a deal's been done?

"This video can not be played Debbie Wilson went to court to win back her disability payments. The number of people going to court to try to win back a key disability benefit is expected to continue to rise this year, a leaked letter seen by the BBC suggests. We follow one woman who took her case to tribunal. Debbie Neal was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease 10 years ago. She takes dozens of pills each morning to manage her symptoms - sickness, high blood pressure and seizures. She may well need a transplant in future. For the moment, she has to empty excess fluid from a tube attached to her stomach, and replace it with new liquid from a bag, five times a day. ""It is a burden,"" she tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""They say, 'Don't let it affect your life,' but you can only live your life to a point. ""I can't even remember what it was like not doing it."" Five times a day Debbie has to take in liquid via a tube in her stomach Debbie lives on her own, and works part-time as a cleaner. For years, she has relied on disability living allowance (DLA) benefit payments - worth Â£80 a week - to help pay the bills. But last year a letter came in the post, saying her payments had been stopped completely. DLA is being replaced by another disability benefit scheme - the personal independence payment (Pip). Debbie's case had been reassessed by a private company and it was decided she did not need the payments. ""I was scared. I thought, 'Why are they doing it?'"" she explains. ""You sort of judge yourself differently. You think, 'Well [my condition] can't be that bad then.' ""But they can't be right when I'm doing this all the time,"" she says, sitting connected to the bag of fluids. ""I mean, do they have to do it? How much would it disrupt their life?"" Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel. The government says overall it is spending more on disability benefits, and that Pip is a better system based on individual need than the ""outdated"" DLA scheme it replaced. Official figures show more than 250,000 people have lost money in the switch from DLA, some with incurable diseases. Debbie had been given an indefinite, or ""life"", payment under the old system. After failing to get her case reviewed, she decided to go to a tribunal - in court - to ask a judge to overturn the decision. The number of people taking the government to court over Pip has risen sharply in recent years as more people were switched to the new benefit. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has seen a leaked letter to tribunal judges - from a senior judge working on benefit tribunals - suggesting the number is expected to increase again this summer. Around 65% of people who take their case to tribunal are successful, higher than for most other types of benefit. Debbie's case was heard at Kidderminster Magistrates' Court When Debbie's case was heard at Kidderminster Magistrates' Court, she was questioned for around an hour in front of a panel including a judge, a doctor and a disability specialist. Debbie was awarded the standard daily living element of Pip for 10 years - an unusually long period of time without reassessment. Any money she had lost was backdated. New figures seen by the Victoria Derbyshire programme suggest the amount of public money spent on Pip tribunals stands at around Â£1m a week. Judges and others who sit on tribunals can lose their jobs if they speak to the media, but some were prepared to talk on the condition of anonymity. ""As a tribunal member we often have to start again when it comes to appeals,"" said one. ""We often see people who get nothing at all in the first assessment. Then we end up giving the maximum award possible and just can't understand [the original decision]. ""It's pretty obvious assessors are rushed and they are just copying and pasting answers. ""Sometimes they don't even change the pronouns, so you get a woman being described as 'he' in the assessment document. ""Not all are like that but the problem is, if some can't be trusted, then it taints the whole system."" The government says since Pip was introduced, more than 2 million decisions have been made - of these 7% of cases have been appealed against and 3% overturned. A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We constantly review our processes to make sure they are working in the best way possible."" For Debbie, the whole experience was stressful and nerve-racking, as she puts it, but ultimately she feels it was worthwhile. ""For people who are out there, who are honest and who need the help, just don't give up,"" she says.

"Would you pick Lennox Lewis, Frank Bruno or Anthony Joshua as Great Britain's best heavyweight - or someone else? A good heavyweight needs power, grace, stamina and plenty of heart. They face off in boxing's glamour division, but only a few are ever good enough to make their mark. Great Britain waited nearly 96 years between Bob Fitzsimmons' world heavyweight title win and Lennox Lewis claiming a version of the title in 1992. Anthony Joshua is the latest to make a telling dent among the sport's biggest men. But who is Britain's greatest heavyweight? In a BBC Sport poll, 70% of voters chose Lennox Lewis as Britain's greatest heavyweight. Active: 1885-1914 Photography was in its infancy when Fitzsimmons reigned as world heavyweight champion Born in Cornwall but largely raised in New Zealand, Fitzsimmons was the first fighter to win titles in three divisions - becoming world champion at middleweight, light-heavyweight and heavyweight. A blacksmith by trade, he became known as a brutal puncher. In winning the middleweight title in 1891, he reportedly knocked down opponent Jack Dempsey (not the later heavyweight champion of the same name) 13 times. Active: 1954-1971 Cooper troubled Ali (then known as Cassius Clay) in the fourth round but was beaten in the fifth of their title fight at Wembley Cooper's trademark left hook - christened 'Enry's 'Ammer' - famously dropped Muhammad Ali (then known as Cassius Clay) at Wembley Stadium in 1963. The London fighter did not have enough time to close the job in the fourth round and Ali's canny trainer, Angelo Dundee, delayed the start of the fifth, claiming his man's gloves were damaged. A British, Commonwealth and European champion, Cooper was the first person to win BBC Sports Personality of the Year twice. Active: 1967-1999 Bugner fought Muhammad Ali in 1973 and 1975, losing by unanimous decision on both occasions Hungary-born but a naturalised resident of the UK and, later, Australia, Bugner fought for more than 31 years. He lost to Muhammad Ali on points twice, and also took Joe Frazier to the cards. A world title eluded him, although he held European and British belts. Active: 1982-1996 Bruno twice lost to Tyson, here in 1989 and later in the final fight of his career in 1996 He lost world title bouts to Tim Witherspoon, Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis before capturing the WBC belt in the penultimate fight of his career - out-pointing Oliver McCall at Wembley in 1995. Much loved by the British public, Bruno was a destructive force, landing 38 wins by knockout. Active: 1989-2003 Lennox Lewis knocked out former champion Mike Tyson in his penultimate fight in 2002 The last man to be undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, courtesy of his 1999 victory over Evander Holyfield. His list of conquests includes the likes of Mike Tyson and Vitali Klitschko, brother of Wladimir. Lewis avenged his two defeats by securing knockout wins over Oliver McCall and Hasim Rahman. Active: 2002-present Haye's speed and agility saw him win the world title against a lumbering Nikolai Valuev in Nuremberg A unified champion at cruiserweight, Haye became the first man since Evander Holyfield to also win a world title at heavyweight. He took the WBA belt from Nikolai Valuev in 2009 in a fight in which he weighed in almost seven stones lighter than his opponent. He is now three fights into a return to the sport, losing his most recent bout to Tony Bellew. Active: 2008-present Fury's victory over Klitschko was regarded as one of the greatest upsets in heavyweight history Fury produced an excellent performance to end Wladimir Klitschko's 11-year unbeaten run and claim the WBA, IBF and WBO titles in November 2015. Fury has since battled personal problems and does not have an active licence to compete at the moment, although has vowed to return. His ascent to world level took in British, Commonwealth and European titles. Active: 2013-present Joshua holds two of the four world heavyweight title belts and wants to unify the division Like Lewis, Olympic gold preceded his professional career but it took Joshua just 34 rounds to land the IBF world title. His rapid rise through the professional ranks made him just the second fighter - after Frazier - to hold a world heavyweight title while still reigning as Olympic champion.

"Sexual harassment scandals have rocked Fox News - and led to some top-level departures The ancient adage was never wrong, and thanks to Fox News we can now offer an update: to lose one may be considered a misfortune; to lose two is a sign something's up; but to lose three is a sign that something is rotten in America's most watched news network. The sacking of ratings juggernaut Bill O'Reilly last month was the most significant departure in the modern history of American cable news. Except that is, for the departure of his boss Roger Ailes last year. These two monumental media events - the first, a dismissal of the biggest talent on America's most influential news service; the second, a dismissal of the most influential man in American news media (after his boss, Rupert Murdoch) - have now been followed by another remarkable departure: that of Bill Shine, who ran Fox News with Ailes for two decades, and was appointed co-president to sort the mess out. Three huge departures within nine months. There is now chatter that Sean Hannity, the senior anchor who tweeted last week that Fox News would be finished without Shine, could be the next to go. What is going on? And could this affect UK communications regulator Ofcom's forthcoming judgement on whether to reject the Murdoch family's bid for the 61% of broadcaster Sky they don't own? That is certainly the hope of the cross-party group of MPs who have been lobbying Ofcom, and who would rather not see the Murdochs consolidate their power here in the UK. Interestingly, former business secretary Sir Vince Cable said on BBC Radio 4's World at One that Ofcom told him they were in listening mode. And there is certainly a lot of noise emanating from Fox News HQ in Manhattan right now. There is a palpable fear in New York that the sexual harassment scandal which has toppled Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly could be an American version of the phone hacking scandal that dogged Rupert Murdoch's British newspapers. The echoes are eerie. Roger Ailes - Is he just one rogue individual? First, there is the instinctive blame on one rogue individual. Fox insiders have generally blamed the dominant, strongman personality of Roger Ailes for what went wrong, saying that with his departure the culture would improve. This sounds familiar to those who remember the initial claim that phone hacking was conducted by ""one rogue reporter"". Second, there are the wider questions about a corporate culture. I don't mean by this whether or not Fox News leans to the right. I mean whether or not it is well run. Shine, who we're told resigned over the weekend, wasn't accused of sexual or racial harassment himself; but he was accused by multiple individuals of knowing plenty about the behaviour of his boss, and failing to act appropriately. Third, and related, there are the legal investigations now under way: not one, but two. The bigger one is a federal probe looking at whether or not Fox withheld settlement payments over sexual harassment from investors. And fourth, and worst of all for the Murdochs, there is the time. The phone hacking scandal derailed their last attempt to acquire the part of Sky which they don't already own. Now, with Ofcom's assessment of their latest takeover bid in the long grass until after the UK general election on 8 June, this huge scandal threatens to generate all the wrong headlines. The timing couldn't be worse. For all that, it is important to note that Fox's ratings haven't suffered, and the advertising boycott that followed the revelations around O'Reilly - who strenuously denies he's done anything wrong, and is now forging a fresh career as a podcaster - hasn't yet dented Fox revenues in a really significant way. The Murdochs' last takeover bid for Sky was derailed by the phone hacking scandal Moreover, Fox has moved swiftly and decisively in removing toxic individuals, in a way that shows they are extremely alert to potential reputational and commercial damage. It really was unimaginable this time last year that Fox News could exist without Ailes, let alone O'Reilly and even Megyn Kelly, who is probably America's most sought after female anchor, and left the network a few months ago. The dominant narrative in American media is that these moves show Rupert's sons, James and Lachlan, imposing their worldview on their father's media giant by decisively rejecting the orthodoxies of his reign. In conversations with seasoned observers of Planet Murdoch, individuals at 21st Century Fox, and opponents of that company's bid for the 61% of Sky it doesn't already own, that narrative finds plenty of support. That both Ailes and O'Reilly have gone does give credence to the idea that Fox News is being reconfigured by its parent company, 21st Century Fox, where Executive Chairman Lachlan, and CEO James - who are of equal status - want change. Since they acquired this joint status in June 2015, these two have made a concerted effort to modernise their father's firm. They have held regular town hall meetings with staff, extended parental leave, and made a habit of sending memos to staff - whether groups or individuals - saying well done: a pillar of right-on modern management. More importantly, they have appointed several women to key roles, from Stacey Snider (in charge of 20th Century Fox film studio) to Courteney Monroe (CEO of National Geographic, a particular passion for James). The entertainment division of 21st Century Fox has several women in key executive roles, from Elizabeth Gabler and Nancy Utley to Emma Watts and Vanessa Morrison. Rupert Murdoch still rules the roost - but his sons have moved to modernise the family business Fox insiders are frustrated that the strides made in equality in the entertainment division garner much less publicity than the misdeeds of senior men in the (much smaller and less profitable) news division. With commercial titans like Chase Carey, Peter Chernin, and now Ailes out of the picture, and James and Lachlan in the ascendant, there is a sense of a new broom at the company. But Rupert still rules the roost. I would urge caution on those who argue that his grip is weakening. Not only was he, as you'd expect, ultimately responsible for the decisions to remove Ailes, Shine and O'Reilly; not only did he install himself as the temporary but very hands-on chairman of Fox News after Ailes left; but the idea that there was a battle of wills between father and sons, who outnumbered and outfoxed their father, is fanciful. It is worth bearing in mind how much Rupert would have hated the New York Times felling of O'Reilly. It was their brilliant investigation that revealed the payments made to complainants against O'Reilly, causing a boycott by dozens of advertisers. Murdoch senior coveted the Grey Lady for many years, and paid a huge price for the Wall Street Journal partly because he was so determined to get one over it. The New York Times is the very embodiment of the liberal coastal elite O'Reilly, Shine and Ailes have spent decades bashing. The irony is not lost on either party. Government extends Sky takeover inquiry Six priorities for Editor George Osborne Will Wikitribune work? What next for Fox News? Hannity's future remains unclear. Former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who works for Fox News, told me a fortnight ago that Tucker Carlson, the anchor who has replaced O'Reilly in the key 8pm slot, has long been thought of as his likely successor. In his first few days, Carlson has rated well. But the bigger drama is yet to come: the federal probes into whether payments were withheld from investors could intensify just as Ofcom consider whether to approve the Murdochs' bid for Sky. The last bid was of course derailed by the phone hacking scandal; and while Ofcom won't comment on what is a quasi-judicial process, their deliberations aren't taking place in a vacuum. In ancient times, before Donald Trump was elected and when some people naively believed Hillary Clinton would be US president, the mood music coming out of New York suggested that the sons would build Fox News around Megyn Kelly, taking it in a more centrist and female-friendly direction. Now she's gone, and Rupert Murdoch is trying to rid his network of the cancer threatening to spread through it. Suddenly, the future of Fox News is up for grabs - and British regulators are watching.

"Forget bottle-flipping and ditch your loom bands, there's a new craze sweeping school playgrounds. Fidget spinners were originally developed as a way for children with ADHD or autism to relieve stress. But in the last few weeks, these palm-sized toys have become the latest ""must-have"" for almost every school child in the country. On video-sharing websites like YouTube, vloggers have amassed millions of views from performing tricks with their fidget spinners. And teachers have reported a huge increase in the number being brought to schools by pupils. There are reports that some schools have banned the toys, but primary school teacher Danielle Timmons told BBC Radio Scotland that they can have benefits. ""Fidget toys have always been something that we've had in schools,"" she toldThe Kaye Adams Programme. ""They've only ever really been used by children with additional support needs. In fact, specialists coming into the school recommend them for children and we'll buy them in for the children that are identified. ""For a long time they've always existed but they've never been as popular as they seem to be now. ""It's become a playground toy as well as something that is used by children to stop them from fidgeting."" Remember loom bands? These bright rubber bracelets adorned millions of wrists in 2014 There are many different types of fidget spinners but the most popular is a small, three-pronged device. When it is placed between the thumb and a finger, the user can give it a quick flick to trigger a spin. Like all the best playground toys, they can be bought for a couple of pounds in a local corner shop - though some are retailing at a much higher price online. But now some parents have raised concerns that they may be a distraction in the classroom. Mother-of-three Doreen Boyle said the toys were ""infuriating"". ""My youngest, who is 13, appeared with this fidget on Thursday, and it has not left his side. ""I've had a house full of little boys all weekend and they've all got them, and nobody can talk to you, nobody can have any eye contact with you because they're all playing with this thing. ""And I can't believe that they're not going to affect performance in class."" Teacher Ms Timmons said that they can aid learning among some children. However in her class there are strict rules that, if they are being used, they must be kept below the desk and out of the sight of teachers and fellow pupils. ""If a child is going to fidget, they're going to fidget, there's nothing you can do to stop them,"" she said. ""But these fidget toys are one way of allowing them to fidget without the disruption of the tapping pencils fidgeting, or the tapping feet. ""It's a much less disruptive way to channel their energies into something else while the teaching is going on. "" The fidget spinners were originally developed to help children with ADHD and autism There are a range of so-called ""fidget toys"", including this cube device Dr Amanda Gummer, a child psychologist, said the craze was helping to de-stigmatise a toy that was previously only used by children with additional needs. The fidget toy phenomenon is one that is sweeping the world, not just the UK, according to Richard Gottlieb, founder of US-based consultancy Global Toy Experts. ""It's spreading globally...and rapidly,"" he said. They are not just confined to the playground however. Adults are also increasingly turning to fidget toys. So what is their appeal? ""I think its the need to fidget manually,"" said Mr Gottlieb. ""That's why some people smoke, others squeeze a rubber ball and even Captain Queeg in the movie the Caine Mutiny manipulated two steel balls in his hand whenever he got worked up. ""I think people in general are pretty stressed out right now by Brexit, the various elections, Donald Trump, Syria, North Korea....you name it. ""So, it is a good time to be selling something that allows an individual to fidget off some stress - particularly at a time when smoking is looked down on."" He believes the playground craze has been fuelled by a generation of stressed-out children. ""Typically there are people who are influencers, and they can be anything from the coolest kid on the playground to the coolest person in the office, that by simply using a product cause others to do so as well,"" he said. ""In this case, however, it took off like crazy and I think it is, again, because adults are anxious but, at least in the US, kids are anxious as well. ""There is just way too much much pressure from parents, too much school work and too much time engaged in adult supervised activities.""

"A smart collar helps Rhonda Vandermeer keep track of her English cocker spaniel Boz A missing pet poster attached to a tree or lamp-post is a sad sight, as a lost moggy or pooch is a minor tragedy in any owner's life. But luckily for Rhonda Vandermeer, a dog breeder from North Carolina, technology means she doesn't have to worry about her furry friends ever going missing. If she ever wants to check on the whereabouts of her five-year-old English cocker spaniel Boz, she just taps on her mobile and can see his exact location. Boz wears a smart collar with GPS tracking built in. ""He's always let off his lead and if he sees a squirrel, he's off, and I'm afraid he's going to keep running and we won't get him back,"" says Ms Vandermeer, who arranges for minders to look after her canine companions when she's away. The Link AKC collar also pings her a notification if Boz has strayed beyond the boundaries she's set, which means she can quickly alert her local dog minders that he's escaped. The collar also keeps track of the ambient temperature and how much exercise Boz has been doing. ""It's great for when I'm away and I can see how much exercise he does and what level of activity he's receiving a day,"" says Ms Vandermeer. But isn't there a danger that such tech could make her a little obsessive? Could pet trackers see an end to lost pet posters? ""At first it was like a toy and I was always checking,"" she admits. And did the dog minders feel like they were being spied on? ""I explained the tools to them. I never wanted them to think I was checking up on them,"" she says. A smart fitness-tracking dog collar may sound like a gadget too far, but pet owners are splashing out on all kinds of gadgets to keep track of their feline and canine companions. Pet tech is a booming industry, with the global market predicted to reach $2.36bn (Â£1.84bn) by 2022, according to Grand View Research. ""People think of their pets as a part of their family and with tech adoption growing, it makes perfect sense to innovate in this area,"" says Abhishek Sharma, analyst at market research firm Technavio. This video can not be played FitBark - one of a slew of pet tech apps hitting the market Dan Makaveli, an academic tutor and director at Media Savvy, a digital training agency, uses FitBark, a bone-shaped collar sensor, to track his six-year-old doberman Diego's daily activity. ""He's well walked anyway but it gives you a little bit of an extra incentive to do it most days,"" says Mr Makaveli, who lives in Sunderland, north-east England. ""I know that by having it, it makes me determined to reach Diego's daily goal of exercise. So if he hasn't reached it and even if it's hail-stoning outside, I will take him for a run around the block."" With FitBark you can also sync your own fitness tracker with that of your dog's and compare results with other dogs of the same breed. ""My wife regularly syncs in with him and they can see where they are on the leaderboard,"" says Mr Makaveli. Super-fit Diego even joined the couple when they took on Britain's Three Peaks Challenge last year. If tracking your pet's fitness isn't enough, you can even order a 3D sculpture of it via a company such as Arty Lobster, watch it live through the Petzi Treat Cam, and organise a video conference with a vet via app-based vet practice Pawsquad. Tiddles seems a little bemused by EasyPlay's new interactive pet gadget And if you've ever worried about your pet getting a little bored while you're out of the house, EasyPlay could be the answer. It's a ball that works as both a pet monitor and an interactive toy. Controlled by a smartphone, EasyPlay - which launches in July - allows owners to watch live video of their pets, talk to them, and remotely control a treats dispenser. ""EasyPlay is designed to enhance pet health and fitness in a fun and playful way, for both cats and dogs,"" says Adam Anderson, managing director of Gosh!, EasyPlay's parent company. But do such devices simply make it more acceptable for owners to spend less time with their pets? ""The EasyPlay was not created to replace a personal, one-on-one relationship with your pet, instead it is a device that allows you to connect while away and improve your pet's mental wellbeing,"" says Mr Anderson. If humans can have fitness trackers, why not pets? And is all this tech really necessary, or just businesses being opportunistic? ""With the increasing awareness about pet health, owners around the world are more willing to spend on various types of tech to keep their pets safe,"" argues Mr Sharma. ""There has been an increase in pets being lost or stolen and hence it requires continuous monitoring to keep track of them."" But how about the animal itself? Are the gadgets always comfortable? ""Pets feel a little uncomfortable during the initial phase,"" says Mr Sharma. ""Having said that, it is almost like getting used to a regular collar."" As for the future, given the rising adoption of the internet of things and smartphones, pet tech looks set to continue flourishing. And for pet owners who like to keep tabs on their pets, that's just purr-fect.

"This video can not be played The Queen is centre stage in Russian production of The Audience The final chairs scrape into place, mobile phones click off and the curtain in a Moscow theatre slides open on Buckingham Palace. Peter Morgan's The Audience is a very British drama, which imagines the private weekly encounters between Queen Elizabeth II and a whole series of prime ministers. But it is being staged in Russia as relations with the UK have seriously soured. That has turned the performance into an act of cultural diplomacy. Inna Churikova - a star of the Russian stage - plays the Queen As a woman in a neat red skirt-suit emerges onto the set, the audience breaks into applause. Inna Churikova, a legend of Soviet cinema and stage, has been transformed into the Queen for this lavish production. ""It started with me looking for a beautiful role for my mother,"" explains Ivan Panfilov, who is the show's producer as well as Ms Churikova's son. He even bought the ""Queen"" some pet corgis for the role, just like the original. But Mr Panfilov also had another agenda. ""We wanted to pay tribute and respect to the Queen and to Britain. Because no matter what happens in policy, people still find a place for each other in their hearts,"" he says. There has been plenty of real-life drama in British-Russian relations lately. Moscow's envoy to the UN Security Council, Vladimir Safronkov, flung diplomacy out of the window toharangue his British counterpartin snarling, crude Russian. Days before, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had called off talks in Moscow and proposed fresh sanctions for Russia's policy on Syria. The play was staged at the Theatre of Nations in central Moscow But backstage at Moscow's Theatre of Nations it's a different story. ""I'm fascinated by this woman and how she got the world to bend the way she wanted,"" enthuses Galina Tyunina. The actor, sporting tweed and clutching a small leather handbag, is playing a Russian Margaret Thatcher. A man marching up and down in the corridor, arms swinging, says he's practising his ""David Cameron walk"". The real-life Mr Cameron was keen on doing business with Russia when he first became PM. Then came Russia's annexation of Crimea, conflict in eastern Ukraine and sanctions. Relations headed downhill, fast. Gorevoy's Churchill: Many Russians still admire the British wartime leader ""The tension between Russia and the United Kingdom, personally I don't like it at all,"" declares a remarkably life-like ""Winston Churchill"", complete with bow-tie, cane and jowls. ""We need to put us together. To know each other better. Definitely,"" actor Mikhail Gorevoy adds in English. The ""Queen"" herself is openly enamoured of her character and admits to nerves despite her vast experience. ""This role is very worrying. It's a great responsibility. Because [I'm playing] the wonderful, living soul that is the British Queen,"" Inna Churikova explains. ""I feel in love with this wonderful woman,"" the leading lady adds. Not all the very British political jokes in this play make sense here, but the audience is curious and forgiving. ""It's fascinating to look at this culture. We have great respect for characters like Churchill and esteem for his statesmanship,"" Dmitry comments, during the first interval. ""It's far from our life and political system,"" Gala admits. ""But England is a kind of example, for imitation."" The play's producers are hoping their Russian-British fusion can help build bridges. At the very least it is an oasis of friendship in an increasingly hostile climate.

"Trump has displayed an affinity for Jackson in the past President Trump has caused controversy with a revisionist riff on Civil War history, telling journalist Salena Zito in aninterview,externalthat Andrew Jackson could have prevented the war if he'd been president a little later, and that Jackson was ""really angry"" as he watched it unfold. Jackson, a slave-owner and strongman who took office in 1829, died 16 years before the war began. We asked three prominent Civil War historians - David Blight, from Yale; Judith Geisberg, from Villanova University; and Jim Grossman, from the American Historical Association - toparse Trump's comments,external, line by line. The battlefield at Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, after the bloodiest battle of America's Civil war, Giesberg: Trump has a fondness for Jackson. This isn't the first time he's cosied up to him and complimented him. He sees him as a fellow populist, someone who promised to give the White House back to the people. Grossman: There's a shared notion of what constitutes leadership. Something I think both men would see as very male. It's figuring out how to get what you want by pushing people as much as you can, rather than creating consensus. Blight: Jackson had a strong approach to the presidency, he invigorated executive power, and I suspect Trump likes that. Jackson was perceived as strong, as a military man. I mean, Trump is not a military man. Giesberg: Trump loves these kind of figures. They are a good cover for a man with no military experience, and who doesn't understand the military. Blight: Other than that, it's a real-estate tycoon from New York and a slave-holder general from Tennessee. Not that close. Blight: I have no idea what he means here. A big heart certainly wasn't demonstrated by theIndian Removal Act,external. Grossman: American Indians would probably question the size of Jackson's heart, or at least the quality of it. And Jackson was a slaveholder. If he did have a big heart, there were some obvious limits to it. Is Trump really the modern Andrew Jackson? Snapshots of the American Civil War Why do people still fly the Confederate flag? Grossman: He starts from the wrong premise - the premise that the Civil War should somehow have been avoided, and that someone more skilled on the White House could have avoided it. If one sees the Civil War as a war of liberation, which is what it was, then it shouldn't have been avoided. Had you compromised out the differences between the government and the confederacy, or between anti-slavery forces and southern slaveholders, the victims would have been the enslaved people of the south. If the president has the notion that it would be desirable to compromise that out, without emancipation, it is frightening. Blight:If it reflects anything, it reflects a kind of great man idea of history, that if you just have the right man with the right strength you can change the course of history. And that is plain nonsense. Hundreds of people gathered for the official ceremony marking the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg. Grossman: Jackson died 16 years before the Civil War began. You can quote me on that. Blight:He was dead even before the compromise of 1850 for God's sake. He was dead at the time of the Mexican war. Grossman: I don't know what he means by this. The first Queen Elizabeth once said something about not wanting to draw windows into men's minds. She was a very astute woman. Giesberg:Maybe he meant Andrew Johnson? Grossman: It could be he has the wrong Andrew from Tennessee. Lincoln's successor Andrew Johnson was from Tennessee, and Trump is actually a lot like Johnson. Giesberg: People have been asking that question from the moment the war began. There are generations of answers. Historians have come to a consensus that slavery is the reason. We do ask the question, but it's not an answer everyone in America is convinced about. Grossman: When people say it was about state's rights, in 1861 states had nothing else to defend but slavery. They seceded because they thought the election of Lincoln threatened the institution of slavery. There are people who are not happy with that answer, who would like to see the Civil War as having been about something else. Giesberg: I think it shows that he continues to be tone-deaf about contemporary racial issues. And I think it shows that he's selling a version of history that is useful for what he's trying to do today. But he might not have spent a huge amount of time on it. Blight:Jackson had absolutely no vision of any kind of racial egalitarianism. He had no hint of any kind of anti-slavery movement. And if President Trump doesn't understand anything about why we had a civil war, what can he understand about race relations now? Or about our problems with inequality? And he thinks Andrew Jackson would have prevented the war... Where do I start? Trump stirs debate in Civil War remarks What has Trump achieved at half-way mark?

"Two entirely different tales emerged from dinner at Downing Street Welcome to the EU/UK dominated Brexit Galaxy of Spin and Counter-Spin. A crazy old place. The galactic atmosphere is such these days that the dimensions of truth are elastic; at times, distorted. Take the arguments this weekend over whether the Downing Street dinner last Wednesday at which Theresa May hosted European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was a complete disaster or not. Not at all, insists Downing Street. But it was a fiasco, according to Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and thereafter hitting Twitter and headlines across the UK. In Brussels, Politico quotes an EU diplomat saying the dinner went ""badly, really badly"". He reportedly went as far as to claim the British government was now ""living in a different galaxy"" to the EU when it came to Brexit expectations. This all seems rather inflammatory, so who's right and who's stretching the truth? Even French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron has been talking Brexit Well, in this politically volatile pre-Brexit negotiations time, ahead of elections in biggest players UK, Germany and France and with the EU as a whole fighting to appear united, relevant and strong, one has to be extremely spin-aware. For example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel talked last week about the UK harbouring Brexit ""illusions"". And French presidential favourite Emmanuel Macron announced he would, post-Brexit, end the bilateral deal by which France keeps in Calais so-called ""illegal migrants"" attempting to cross to Dover. But these tough-sounding comments are at least as much aimed at their domestic audience as at the British government. That said, a high-level EU source has confirmed to me that feelings were running pretty high following the Downing Street dinner due to what he described as a huge ""asymmetry of expectations"" and a ""completely different reading"" of the Brexit situation at No 10. This video can not be played Theresa May said the report was ""Brussels gossip"" He said the British government, from their comments about negotiations, clearly had ""no good understanding of the fundamentals"" around which he said the EU was united, and which would now not be undone. There are certainly obvious sticking points where the EU and UK do seem a galaxy or two apart: Downing Street keeps insisting on parallel divorce and future trade talks from the offset The British government also suggests, I'm told, that a deal on EU citizens' rights can be rapidly reached (by the time of the EU leaders' summit this June) And it doesn't seem to accept Brussels' assertion that the UK has a sizeable bill of outstanding financial commitments to honour before it leaves the EU. Poppycock, says a frustrated EU, to all of the above. My source told me Mr Juncker was already vexed when he arrived at No 10 on Wednesday having only just been informed of the UK's (legally justified, but awkward) decision not sign the mid-term review of the EU's multi-annual budget until after the June elections. The review needs unanimous approval to go ahead. It doesn't call for more cash but rather its redistribution. The EU is anxious to send money Africa-wards, for example, to halt the flow of migrants coming from there. But the review is frozen until the UK signs it. ""They gave Juncker no warning at all and told him the night before he came to dinner,"" my source told me. ""They have no idea how Brussels works."" Another high-level source I spoke to attended a meeting with all the EU team present at the Downing Street dinner. ""The word 'Ã©chec' (French for 'failure') came up several times,"" he told me. Brexit: All you need to know May: Dinner row claim is Brussels gossip Where UK parties stand on Brexit ""Before that the word wasn't used very often in connection with Brexit but now we're told we have to prepare for the possibility of a failure scenario."" What percentage chance of a successful outcome was being projected in EU leadership circles at the moment? ""50/50 with hopes for more clarity after the British elections are over,"" I was told. Over and again, EU diplomats insist this is no ""us against them"" situation; that there's no desire to punish Britain and that a good Brexit is in everyone's interest. ""It's in our mutual interest to correct all the misunderstandings,"" I was told today. My source was confident that Downing Street was beginning to realise that now too. Or are we still in the galaxy of spin? What happens now that a deal's been done?
