"TV presenter Ant McPartlin has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving after a collision involving three vehicles in south-west London. The Metropolitan Police said officers were called to Lower Richmond Road in Mortlake at 15:59 GMT on Sunday. The ambulance service and London Fire Brigade also attended and a number of people were treated for minor injuries. Police said a 42-year-old man was arrested at the scene after failing a roadside breathalyser test. He was taken to a south London police station for questioning before being released under investigation on Monday. A child passenger in one of the cars was taken to hospital for a check-up as a precaution, the Met added. Mr McPartlin, who co-hosts several ITV shows with Declan Donnelly, including I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, confirmed in January he was divorcing his wife of 11 years, Lisa Armstrong.

"This video can not be played How the Russian election unfolded Vladimir Putin will lead Russia for another six years, after securing an expected victory in Sunday's presidential election. Mr Putin, who has ruled the country as either president or prime minister since 1999, got more than 76% of the vote, official results show. The main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, was barred from the race. Addressing a rally in Moscow, Mr Putin said voters had ""recognised the achievements of the last few years"". Speaking to reporters after the results were announced, he laughed off a question about running again in another six years. ""What you are saying is a bit funny. Do you think that I will stay here until I'm 100 years old? No!"" he said. Putin basks in election he could not lose Google's most popular Putin search queries answered Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president The scale of victory - which had been widely predicted - appears to be a marked increase in his share of the vote from 2012, when he won 64%. Mr Putin's nearest competitor, millionaire communist Pavel Grudinin, received about 12%. The race also included Ksenia Sobchak, a former reality TV host, and veteran nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky - they got less than 2% and about 6% respectively. Mr Putin's campaign team said it was an ""incredible victory"". ""The percentage that we have just seen speaks for itself. It's a mandate which Putin needs for future decisions, and he has a lot of them to make,"" a spokesman told Russia's Interfax. In some areas, free food and discounts in local shops were on offer near polling stations. Video recordings from polling stations showed irregularities in a number of towns and cities across Russia. Several showed election officials stuffing boxes with ballot papers. Mr Navalny was excluded from the election because of an embezzlement convictionthat he said was manufactured by the Kremlin. In his first reaction to the news, Mr Navalny indicated he had been unable to contain his anger. ""Now is the season of Lent. I took it upon myself never to get angry and not to raise my voice. Oh well, I'll try again next year,"" he tweeted. Life in Putin's Russia explained in 10 charts Does Putin's Russia reject the West?

Videos taken from the election commission's live stream of polling stations also appeared to show some instances of officials stuffing ballots into boxes,external. In Dagestan, one election official said he was prevented from doing his job by a crowd of men who blocked the ballot box. But Ella Pamfilova, head of the Central Electoral Commission, said there were no serious violations. Turnout was reported to be 67% - higher than in the last vote ""We have analysed and monitored everything we could, everything that has arrived. Thank goodness, it's all rather modest so far,"" she told a commission meeting while speaking about violations. She had earlier said that anyone involved in violations would be caught. Sunday's vote was also the first in Crimea since Russia seized the region from Ukraine. Mr Putin's victory rally coincided with the anniversary of the annexation. The annexation was bitterly contested by Kiev and ratcheted up tensions between Russia and the West. Russians living in Ukraine were unable to take part in Sunday's vote because access to Russian diplomatic missions was blocked by the Kiev government.

"This video can not be played ""I'd given up hope"": Louise Willetts says she is completely well following her treatment Doctors say a stem cell transplant could be a ""game changer"" for many patients with multiple sclerosis. Results from an international trial show that it was able to stop the disease and improve symptoms. It involves wiping out a patient's immune system using cancer drugs and then rebooting it with a stem cell transplant. Louise Willetts, 36, from Rotherham, is now symptom-free and told me: ""It feels like a miracle."" A total of 100,000 people in the UK have MS, which attacks nerves in the brain and spinal cord. Just over 100 patients took part in the trial, in hospitals in Chicago, Sheffield, Uppsala in Sweden and Sao Paulo in Brazil. They all had relapsing remitting MS - where attacks or relapses are followed by periods of remission. The interim results were released at the annual meeting of the European Society for Bone and Marrow Transplantation in Lisbon. Nerve connections become damaged in people with MS The patients received either haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or drug treatment. After one year, only one relapse occurred among the stem cell group compared with 39 in the drug group. After an average follow-up of three years, the transplants had failed in three out of 52 patients (6%), compared with 30 of 50 (60%) in the control group. Those in the transplant group experienced a reduction in disability, whereas symptoms worsened in the drug group. Prof Richard Burt, lead investigator, Northwestern University Chicago, told me: ""The data is stunningly in favour of transplant against the best available drugs - the neurological community has been sceptical about this treatment, but these results will change that."" Multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition which can affect the brain and/or spinal cord It can cause problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance Average life expectancy is slightly reduced It is estimated that there are more than 100,000 people diagnosed with MS in the UK Source:NHS,external The treatment uses chemotherapy to destroy the faulty immune system. Stem cells taken from the patient's blood and bone marrow are then re-infused. These are unaffected by MS and they rebuild the immune system. Prof John Snowden, haematologist and director of blood and bone marrow transplantation at Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, told me: ""We are thrilled with the results - they are a game changer for patients with drug resistant and disabling multiple sclerosis"". Prof Basil Sharrack, neurologist and director of MS research at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, told me: ""This is interim analysis, but with that caveat, this is the best result I have seen in any trial for multiple sclerosis."" Louise was diagnosed with MS in 2010 when she was only 28. She told me: ""MS ruled my life and I lived in fear of the next relapse. ""The worst time was not being able to get out of bed because I had no stability in my body - I struggled to walk and even spent time in a wheelchair. ""It also affected my cognition - it was like a brain fog and I misread words and struggled to keep up with conversations."" TheBBC's Panoramafilmed her undergoing her transplant in October 2015 and she is now back to full health. She got married to her partner Steve, on the first anniversary of her transplant, and their baby daughter Joy is now a month old. ""I feel like my diagnosis was just a bad dream. I live every day as I want to, rather than planning my life around my MS."" The transplant costs around Â£30,000, about the same as the annual price of some MS drugs. Doctors stress it is not suitable for all MS patients and the process can be gruelling, involving chemotherapy and a few weeks in isolation in hospital. Dr Susan Kohlhaas, director of research at the MS Society, said the stem cell transplant HSCT ""will soon be recognised as an established treatment in England - and when that happens our priority will be making sure those who could benefit can actually get it"". She added: ""We've seen life-changing results for some people and having that opportunity can't depend on your postcode.""

"This video can not be played Andria Zafirakou: ""I want to share this honour with my fellow teachers and wonderful students"" A teacher from north London has been announced as winner of a competition to find the world's best teacher. Andria Zafirakou, who teaches art and textiles in a Brent secondary school, has won a prize worth $1m (Â£720,000). She has spoken of the hardship and overcrowded housing conditions facing many of her pupils. But in accepting the prize, she called for more support for the ""power of the arts"" in school, particularly for the ""poorest communities"". Mrs Zafirakou becomes the first UK winner of the Global Teacher Prize, beating teachers nominated from more than 170 countries. The prize, launched in 2015 by an education charity, the Varkey Foundation, was created to give more status to the teaching profession, with an Oscars-style awards ceremony in Dubai. Andria Zafirakou has been praised for working with disadvantaged pupils and their families Prime Minister Theresa May sent a video message commending Mrs Zafirakou and said great teachers needed ""resilience, ingenuity and a generous heart"". Racing driver Lewis Hamilton, Olympic champion Mo Farah, former US vice president Al Gore and former UK prime minister Tony Blair were part of the event honouring the north London teacher. In her acceptance speech, she said schools should be ""safe havens"" and called for greater recognition for the value of arts subjects in school. She warned of ""deprivation"" and ""tough lives"" where ""children may not eat well because their lunch boxes are empty"". But she said school could make a great positive difference - particular through creative subjects. ""Too often we neglect this power of the arts to actually transform lives, particularly in the poorest communities."" The teacher from Alperton Community School has been praised for her work with the local community as well as with pupils. She says the mix of people and languages in this part of north London is a ""beautiful challenge"" which creates a ""buzzing"" atmosphere. Andria Zafirakou called for more recognition for the value of the arts and creativity in school It is claimed as one of the most ethnically diverse places in the UK, with 130 different languages spoken in the London borough. She has learned basic phrases in languages such as Hindi, Tamil and Gujarati and has visited homes to build links with the school. Mrs Zafirakou has been praised for making her pupils feel secure, working with the police to make sure they travel to and from school in safety. And she will have to stay in teaching, because a condition of the prize is remaining as a teacher for at least the next five years. Education Secretary Damian Hinds sent a message to say her ""story of selflessness and dedication is truly inspiring"". Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton said the award ""reminds us all of the power of great teachers, the importance of creative subjects, and demonstrates the world class standard of UK education"". When she reached the top 10 shortlist, she spoke of the disadvantages facing many of her pupils. ""By getting pupils to open up about their home lives, I discovered that many of my students come from crowded homes where multiple families share a single property,"" said Mrs Zafirakou. ""It's often so crowded and noisy I've had students tell me they have to do their homework in the bathroom, just to grab a few moments alone so they can concentrate."" In response, she organised extra lessons during the day and the weekend, including giving pupils a quiet place to work. Andria Zafirakou with pupils from Alperton Community School, Brent ""I am submitting a nomination for a teacher who is a true gem, one who inspires such possibility and potential in her students, their parents, the staff, her peers, the local community, and future teachers and leaders."" ""A phenomenal teacher and leader. She is guided by a moral compass that underpins a passionate desire to give every student at her school the world - no ceilings, no limitations, no boundaries."" ""She is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to ensuring that students deserve the best education possible."" ""One lady with care and passion can make a huge difference to the lives of many. She is upbeat, full of character, highly regarded and I wish all schools were blessed with a senior leader such as her!"" The finalists were drawn from more than 30,000 nominations in 173 countries. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey Foundation which runs the competition, said he hoped ""Andria's story will inspire those looking to enter the teaching profession and shine a powerful spotlight on the incredible work teachers do all over the world every day"". The other nine finalists for the Global Teacher Prize 2018 were: â¢Nurten AkkuÅ a pre-school teacher and principal, Samsun, Turkey â¢Marjorie Brown, history teacher, Johannesburg,  South Africa â¢Luis Gutierrez, social science teacher, Bogota, Colombia â¢Jesus Insilada, English teacher, Iloilo, Philippines â¢Glenn Lee, engineering and technology teacher, Hawaii, United States â¢Diego Mahfouz Faria Lima, school director, Sao Paulo, Brazil â¢Koen Timmers, lecturer and computer science teacher, Heusden-Zolder, Belgium â¢Eddie Woo, maths teacher, Sydney, Australia â¢Barbara Anna Zielonka, English teacher, Nannestad, Norway.

"Donald Trump's use of Twitter to attack opponents is unprecedented Donald Trump has attacked special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the US presidential election he won in 2016. He tweeted that the inquiry was unfair - and reiterated there had been ""no collusion"" between his election campaign and Russia. He added that it was dominated by ""hardened Democrats"" and supporters of his defeated opponent Hillary Clinton. Mr Mueller, a highly regarded former head of the FBI, is a Republican. The president's comments came a day after his lawyer, John Dowd, said it was time for the special counsel's investigation to end. Initially Mr Dowd said he was speaking for the president but later clarified he was ""speaking for myself"". Who's who in Russia-Trump inquiry? Trump Russia: Key questions answered What is a special counsel? Mr Trump's latest tweet drew warnings from fellow Republicans about interfering with the investigation. Allow Twitter content?

In earlier tweets, the president also berated former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Friday just two days before he was due to retire, and former FBI director James Comey, whom Mr Trump sacked last year. The latter firing led to the Mueller investigation being set up. Mr Trump accused Mr Comey of lying under oath before Congress, and described the contemporaneous notes that Mr McCabe and Mr Comey took following discussions with him as ""fake memos"". Mr McCabe has given memos about conversations he had with President Trump to the Mueller inquiry, US media say. The memos could support claims that Mr Trump sought to obstruct justice. Mr Mueller has so far indicted 19 people. Robert Mueller has admirers on all sides of US politics But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said Mr Mueller should be allowed to proceed without interference, and that many Republicans shared his view. He also warned Mr Trump against any attempt to dismiss Mr Mueller. ""If he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency, because we're a rule of law nation,"" Mr Graham said. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, a frequent Trump critic, said it appeared the president's latest comments seemed to be preparing the ground for the firing of Mr Mueller. ""I don't know what the designs are on Mueller, but it seems to be building toward that, and I just hope it doesn't go there, because it can't. We can't in Congress accept that,"" he told CNN. ""I'm just puzzled by why the White House is going so hard at this, other than that they're very afraid of what might come out."" Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer accused Mr Trump of ""floating trial balloons about derailing"" the investigation. ""Our Republican colleagues, particularly the leadership, have an obligation to our country to stand up now and make it clear that firing Mueller is a red line for our democracy that cannot be crossed,"" the Democrat said in a statement. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter With a weekend free of scheduled presidential obligations, Donald Trump has ratcheted up the rhetoric directed toward independent counsel Robert Mueller. Perhaps it is because the president feels emboldened by the one-two punch of the Republican intelligence committee conclusion that there was no ""collusion"" between the Trump camp and Russia, and his attorney general's decision to fire former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. Or maybe it is because Mr Trump is on edge following reports that Mr Mueller is now looking into the Trump Organization's business dealings with Russia. Whatever the reason, the president spent the weekend swinging at ""hardened Democrats"" on Mr Mueller's team and ""sanctimonious"" former FBI Director James Comey, and celebrating Mr McCabe's unceremonious exit. And so the president's strategy comes into shape. Paint his critics and investigators as anti-Trump, deep-state establishment forces and the entire inquiry as based on a biased and corrupt premise. The next step would be to claim any evidence of wrongdoing unearthed by Mr Mueller is irretrievably tainted. That, of course, isn't much of a legal defence. In a war for public opinion, however, it's a place where his side could dig in. Mr McCabe had been under internal investigation by the FBI and had already stepped down from his deputy post in January pending the review. He was sacked just two days short of his 50th birthday on Sunday, when he was expected to retire with a federal pension. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the ""extensive and fair investigation""had concluded that Mr McCabe ""made an unauthorised disclosure to the news media and lacked candour - including under oath - on multiple occasions"". The White House said it left the decision to fire Mr McCabe (right) to Mr Sessions (left) Although the decision to fire Mr McCabe was made by Mr Sessions, Mr Trump had criticised him for months. He has publicly pointed to donations that Mr McCabe's wife, a Democrat, received from a Clinton ally when she ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate in 2015 as evidence that Mr McCabe was politically biased. He welcomed the news of his dismissal almost immediately after Mr Sessions announced it, calling the move a ""great day for democracy"".

"Mariam Moustafa, 18, was attacked by a group of girls before boarding a bus in Nottingham Prosecutors in Rome have opened an investigation into the death of an 18-year-old student in Nottingham. Mariam Moustafa, an Egyptian national who was born in Rome, died on Wednesday after she was assaulted by a group of women on 20 February. The Rome prosecutor has asked the UK authorities to share details of the investigation, Italian media reported. The Italian foreign ministry said the ambassador to the UK was closely following the investigation. A post-mortem examination into Miss Moustafa's death was inconclusive. UK police said more tests would take place to establish if there was a link between the assault and her death. This video can not be played Footage has emerged of what police say was part of the attack on Mariam Moustafa Investigators said they were keeping an ""open mind"" about whether the attack on Miss Moustafa, an engineering student at Nottingham College was racially motivated. A 17-year-old girl, who was arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm, remains on bail. The case has caused alarm in Egypt and authorities there have also asked British officials for more information about the investigation. Mariam Moustafa was in a coma in hospital for three weeks after the attack Miss Moustafa's family said she was attacked about 20:00 GMT, taken to hospital and then discharged at about 02:00 that night. She was taken back to hospital later that day and died more than three weeks later at Nottingham City Hospital. Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust said its ""initial review of this tragic case does not indicate any significant untoward incident on the trust's part, however we will fully examine the family's concerns"". Nottinghamshire Police said Miss Moustafa was ""punched several times"" while waiting for a bus outside the Victoria Centre in Parliament Street. In a statement, the force said she had got on a bus but was followed ""by the same group of women who were threatening and abusive towards her before they got off"".

"This video can not be played BBC Radio 1Xtra DJ Reece Parkinson posted footage from the scene on Twitter At least 13 people have been injured after a man drove a car into a busy nightclub. Police were called at 23:47 GMT on Saturday after a Suzuki Vitara drove into Blake's in Gravesend, Kent. It is believed the driver had been asked to leave the club in Queen Street after an earlier altercation. A witness has described ""a complete mess of panic and chaos"". A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Kent Police said several of those hurt have suffered broken bones. As well as the 13 confirmed injured, officers believe several others may have left the scene. Seven people were taken to hospital, four with minor injuries and three with serious but not life-threatening injuries, the ambulance service added. Police said the driver of the vehicle suffered minor injuries and was taken to hospital as a precaution but is currently in custody. Det Ch Insp David Chewter said: ""This was a frightening experience for everyone involved and it is a miracle that nobody was killed."" Clubbers reported hearing a ""massive bang"" as the car crashed into the club Witnesses said a 4x4 had been driven into a tented area full of people. It is believed the car drove along an alleyway alongside the club before crashing into it. Chloe Germaney, 18, said she heard a ""massive bang"" before seeing the 4x4 ""driving into the club through the gates into the lounge, running people over"". She said security shouted for people to run, adding: ""Everyone ran for their lives back into the club, we got locked in, nobody knew what was going on. ""At that point I text my loved ones saying I've been in an incident and that I love them because I thought I wasn't going to make it out alive."" Ms Germaney said she has had flashbacks and ""feels so paranoid I can't even step outside"". There is a police presence at Blake's nightclub while investigations continue Footage posted on social media appeared to show a car inside a tented area with people being led to safety by police. BBC Radio 1Xtra DJ Reece Parkinson, who was in the club at the time, told BBC Newsbeat he initially thought it was a terror attack. He said: ""We heard screaming, turned around and saw a big 4x4 come in the room. ""We ran to the back and I was waiting to hear bullets or something, but thank God there wasn't. ""As soon as he [car driver] stopped people were throwing stuff at the car, they dragged him out, people were hitting him. He looked unconscious."" Three police cars, two from the forensic investigation team, are parked outside Blake's nightclub this morning. Staff from the club occasionally come outside, still appearing to be visibly shocked. Two broken wing mirrors lie in an alleyway between the club and the market next-door which is cordoned off. A tent at the far end of the alleyway is too far away to see the damage clearly. Jade Keepin, 18, said she saw a ""car in the middle of the floor that security had surrounded"". ""I saw a person smash the back window of the car with his elbow and people began throwing stuff at the car. It was manic."" Sonny Powar said he saw two people get hit by the car before the driver was pulled from the vehicle. ""[A man] drove his 4x4 into the tent we was all in and ran people over, it stopped at my feet so any further and I could have died. Then he reversed up and we all ran,"" he added. ""We ripped the tent wall apart and got out and called the police. It was a complete mess of panic and chaos."" It is believed the car drove along an alleyway alongside the club In a statement, Blake's nightclub thanked the ""heroic actions"" of door staff and guests who it said apprehended the man ""before further harm was caused"". The club said it was ""deeply saddened that injuries occurred"" but was ""grateful that no-one was fatally hurt"". It added: ""We strive to create a safe and positive environment for all. Last night however, the unpredictable actions of one individual ruined a great occasion for all."" Gravesham Borough Council praised the response of the emergency services in a tweet.

Kent Fire and Rescue Service and five South East Coast Ambulance Service crews also attended the scene. Det Ch Insp Chewter said: ""We believe there are likely to be further casualties who perhaps left the club during the panic and we would like to hear from them."" He also urged anyone who was in the club at the time or anyone with photos or original video footage to get in touch. Kent Police said it was not being treated as a terror-related incident.

"This video can not be played ""I'd given up hope"": Louise Willetts says she is completely well following her treatment Doctors say a stem cell transplant could be a ""game changer"" for many patients with multiple sclerosis. Results from an international trial show that it was able to stop the disease and improve symptoms. It involves wiping out a patient's immune system using cancer drugs and then rebooting it with a stem cell transplant. Louise Willetts, 36, from Rotherham, is now symptom-free and told me: ""It feels like a miracle."" A total of 100,000 people in the UK have MS, which attacks nerves in the brain and spinal cord. Just over 100 patients took part in the trial, in hospitals in Chicago, Sheffield, Uppsala in Sweden and Sao Paulo in Brazil. They all had relapsing remitting MS - where attacks or relapses are followed by periods of remission. The interim results were released at the annual meeting of the European Society for Bone and Marrow Transplantation in Lisbon. Nerve connections become damaged in people with MS The patients received either haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or drug treatment. After one year, only one relapse occurred among the stem cell group compared with 39 in the drug group. After an average follow-up of three years, the transplants had failed in three out of 52 patients (6%), compared with 30 of 50 (60%) in the control group. Those in the transplant group experienced a reduction in disability, whereas symptoms worsened in the drug group. Prof Richard Burt, lead investigator, Northwestern University Chicago, told me: ""The data is stunningly in favour of transplant against the best available drugs - the neurological community has been sceptical about this treatment, but these results will change that."" Multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition which can affect the brain and/or spinal cord It can cause problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance Average life expectancy is slightly reduced It is estimated that there are more than 100,000 people diagnosed with MS in the UK Source:NHS,external The treatment uses chemotherapy to destroy the faulty immune system. Stem cells taken from the patient's blood and bone marrow are then re-infused. These are unaffected by MS and they rebuild the immune system. Prof John Snowden, haematologist and director of blood and bone marrow transplantation at Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, told me: ""We are thrilled with the results - they are a game changer for patients with drug resistant and disabling multiple sclerosis"". Prof Basil Sharrack, neurologist and director of MS research at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, told me: ""This is interim analysis, but with that caveat, this is the best result I have seen in any trial for multiple sclerosis."" Louise was diagnosed with MS in 2010 when she was only 28. She told me: ""MS ruled my life and I lived in fear of the next relapse. ""The worst time was not being able to get out of bed because I had no stability in my body - I struggled to walk and even spent time in a wheelchair. ""It also affected my cognition - it was like a brain fog and I misread words and struggled to keep up with conversations."" TheBBC's Panoramafilmed her undergoing her transplant in October 2015 and she is now back to full health. She got married to her partner Steve, on the first anniversary of her transplant, and their baby daughter Joy is now a month old. ""I feel like my diagnosis was just a bad dream. I live every day as I want to, rather than planning my life around my MS."" The transplant costs around Â£30,000, about the same as the annual price of some MS drugs. Doctors stress it is not suitable for all MS patients and the process can be gruelling, involving chemotherapy and a few weeks in isolation in hospital. Dr Susan Kohlhaas, director of research at the MS Society, said the stem cell transplant HSCT ""will soon be recognised as an established treatment in England - and when that happens our priority will be making sure those who could benefit can actually get it"". She added: ""We've seen life-changing results for some people and having that opportunity can't depend on your postcode.""

"These rebranded recycling bins were removed after being placed on a supermarket car park without permission. Charities have lost hundreds of thousands of pounds after 750 clothing banks were taken from car parks, says the Textile Recycling Association. Recycling companies working with them say sometimes up to 20 a week have gone missing in the last year across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some have been rebranded with a different charity logo and placed at sites without permission, the TRA says. The Charity Commission has launched an investigation. There are around 15,000 clothing banks throughout the whole of the UK, often placed at supermarket car parks and recycling sites. Some are run by charities such as The Salvation Army, Oxfam and the British Heart Foundation  themselves, but others are operated by private recycling companies who give a donation to charities - on average Â£250 for every tonne of clothes collected. Around Â£75m was given to charities and local authorities last year. The TRA, which represents the sector, says the clothing banks have been taken from across the country - including in England's North West, the Midlands and East. It says charities receive on average Â£70 worth of donations a week from each bank. Because it can take between six to eight weeks to replace a bank, it is estimated charities could have lost nearly Â£370,000. In some cases, the recycling companies are not replacing the banks so the charities will lose out permanently. Recycling Solutions North West, based in Heywood in Greater Manchester, donates between Â£5,000 and Â£6,000 a month to a charity which helps critically ill babies and children. James Cook and his baby son Dexter, who died from an undiagnosed heart condition. Last month, 12 of its clothing banks were taken from sites across Greater Manchester. One of the directors, James Cook, is passionate about the charity after his son Dexter, who had an undiagnosed heart condition, died when he was only 13 months old. He said: ""I just can't understand why any individual would go out and take the clothing banks. ""The families, they're relying on that charity to carry out a service for their child. It is a lifesaving service. ""I do like to see the target go up every month, I like to see the money climb and I'm going to see it drop next month and that will hurt."" Another charity which is counting the cost is Reuben's Retreat in Glossop, which provides support to families who have lost a child or have children with life-limiting illnesses. The Reuben's Retreat charity is named after Reuben Graham who died from a brain tumour. It receives donations from a recycling company, but the amount it receives has now been reduced after a number of clothing banks were taken. Nicola Graham - who founded the charity after the death of her son Reuben - said: ""It will have a significant impact on our funding stream. ""Reuben's little photograph is on that bin, and all our details. ""It just beggars belief that somebody can think that it's OK to take from charity and actually take something with his little face on it."" The TRA say the cost of replacing a bank can be up to Â£1,500 and the total bill to its members could be as much as Â£1m. President Ian Woods said the loss of the banks was ""depriving members of the public from a service intended for them to recycle textiles and, more importantly, depriving charities and local authorities nationwide of revenue streams which are vitally important for the services they deliver"". He added: ""We are appealing to the police and other government agencies to join us in the campaign to clamp down on all forms of illegal activity connected to textile recycling."" Investigators working for the TRA have removed around 200 banks which they say have been rebranded with the logo of a registered charity called Helping Our Future and placed on supermarket car parks without authorisation. The charity, which is based in Wolverhampton, says it raised nearly Â£19,000 last year and works to promote recycling and relieve financial hardship. BBC 5 live Investigates has discovered Helping our Future is under investigation by the Charity Commission. A spokesperson said: ""The commission is examining the charity Helping Our Future as part of a regulatory compliance case. ""We have serious concerns about its management and activities, and are examining trustees' oversight of the charity, its relationship with third parties, including commercial fundraising companies, and whether the charity's management and operations have given rise to inappropriate benefit on the part of private individuals or companies."" The charity, which the BBC understands leases its banks from a third party, denies any wrongdoing. A company which says it acts for Helping Our Future told the BBC:  ""We are an associated contractor to HOF Trading Limited which is the logistical partner to Helping our Future Charity. ""We are contracted to abide by a written protocol which prevents us from carrying out any criminal activity and bringing any holistic partner into disrepute."" The company added that some of the charity's own banks had been taken and that this had been reported to the police. 5 live Investigates is onBBC Radio 5 live, 18 March at 11:00 GMT - catch up onBBC iPlayer Radio.

"This video can not be played The homes in Hemsby are ""teetering"" on the cliff edge Cliff-top homes in danger of collapsing into the sea off the Norfolk coast remain in a ""precarious position"", a council leader has said. Great Yarmouth Borough Council leader Graham Plant said it was ""too dangerous"" for residents of 13 chalets close to the cliff edge to return. The Coastguard said a shed and an oil tank fell into the sea at Hemsby as high winds and waves eroded the dunes. One homeowner said it felt like an ""earthquake"" as the cliff gave way. Mr Plant said the homes were being inspected after each high tide, but added it was unlikely residents could return home before Tuesday when he expected the weather to improve. ""It is a sad situation where people may lose their homes but the council will do its best to help residents,"" he said. Thirteen chalets are said to be vulnerable to falling into the sea at The Marrams The cliffs at Hemsby are made of sand which has suffered erosion over many years and the chalets are sited on privately-owned land. Coxswain of Hemsby Lifeboat, Daniel Hurd said a six-metre high (20ft) dune had been eroded in a 24-hour period. Chalet owner Stephen Chadwick said: ""I bought it for sea views, beautiful sea views, and now the sea's taking it away."" Speaking on Saturday, he added: ""I woke up this morning, had a cup of coffee at half past seven, the back door, and I felt... it was like an earthquake, and the cliff just went. ""I'm just in total shock."" Stephen Chadwick said he did not expect his home to survive Ten residents, forced to leave their chalets, spent Saturday night in a nearby hall, pub and holiday chalets. Paul Ray, who returned to his home early on Sunday, said he was ""devastated"" to find it was ""not safe to live there at all"". He had lived in the bungalow for eight years with his wife and two dogs. ""You can't go round the back; if you did you'd go straight on to the beach,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

The Coastguard has warned people not to take risks by standing close to the sea to take pictures Norfolk Police and Gorleston Coastguard have both warned members of the public to stay away from the area due to it being unsafe. ""Not only are you putting your own life at risk, but those that will have to rescue you when it goes wrong,"" a Coastguard spokesman said. The warning came after an individual was spotted taking a selfie near the sea edge where waves up to 3m (almost 10ft) high have been lashing the shore. ""With all this going on, the last thing you would expect to see is irresponsible people taking selfies,"" added the spokesman. An aerial picture shows just how close one chalet was to the cliff-top ahead of Saturday's high winds During a tidal surge in 2013, seven homes were badly damaged, includingthree that fell into the sea.

"Sitting president Vladimir Putin is hoping to secure another term in office Russians are voting in an election that is likely to return Vladimir Putin for a fourth term as president. Polls closed in Moscow at 17:00 GMT, with final votes due to be cast an hour later in the far west of the country. More than 100m are eligible to vote. Exit polls are expected late on Sunday. Mr Putin is hoping for another six-year term and faces seven other candidates. He said he would see as a success any result that gave him the ""right to perform the duties of president."" His comments were carried on national TV as he voted in Moscow. Mr Putin's rivals include a millionaire communist, Pavel Grudinin, a former reality television host, Ksenia Sobchak, and veteran nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. The main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has been prohibited from standing, because of a fraud conviction that he has condemned as politically motivated. Mr Navalny has urged voters to boycott the election and has sent thousands of observers to polling stations to watch for possible violations. Strawberry tycoon among Putin challengers Five things to know about the election Life in Putin's Russia explained in 10 charts Ksenia Sobchak has been dismissed as a Kremlin stooge but she has taken opposing positions to Putin Vladimir Putin, 65, has been Russia's dominant leader since 1999, either as president or prime minister. Independent election monitoring group Golos reported hundreds of irregularities throughout the day: Voting papers were found in some ballot boxes before polls opened Observers were barred from entering some polling stations Some people were bussed in amid suspicion of forced voting Webcams at polling stations were obstructed by balloons and other obstacles Allow Twitter content?

Videos taken from the election commission's live stream of polling stations also appeared to show some instances of officials stuffing ballots into boxes,external. In Dagestan, election official David Sepashvili says he was prevented from doing his job by some 50 ""muscular men"", according to AFP news agency. ""They filled the entire station, blocked the ballot box in a line,"" Mr Sepashvili, a member of the polling station's election commission, said. The observer working at the station tried to reach the box to prevent ballot stuffing, but the men ""knocked him on the ground, kicked him, and then carried him outside"" before telling Mr Sepashvili to leave the premises. ""I went to the policeman at the station, but he said he can't do anything because he doesn't have a weapon,"" Mr Sepashvili said. The election commission reported 13 breaches of electoral law and its head, Ella Pamfilova, said anyone involved in violations would be caught. In some regions, free food and discounts in local shops were on offer. Analysis by Sarah Rainsford, BBC Moscow Correspondent In Rostov-on-Don, Cossacks danced outside the polling station There's a lot to do besides vote at polling stations in Moscow today. We found a man playing The Clash on a balalaika outside one, and another man dressed as a rabbit. There were competitions and games galore, and a giant sign for people to take selfies in front of, that reads: ""I've elected the president."" It's all because turnout is the big issue at this election: Vladimir Putin wants the strongest possible mandate for another six years in power. That's why the election was scheduled for 18 March - the anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea. Hugely controversial abroad, that act saw Mr Putin's political rating at home surge to its highest point ever. Election officials said that by 18:00 Moscow time (15:00 GMT) turnout had reached almost 60%. They had earlier spoken of a ""significantly higher"" figure than in 2012. They also said they had repelled a cyber attack on their website overnight. Thedistributed denial of service (DDoS)attack was sourced to 15 countries, they said. A 100% turnout was reported in some areas of the far east.Interfax news agency quoted an election official as saying every resident in six villages on the Kamchatka peninsula had cast their ballots.,externalThe same turnout was reported in four villages in the Chukotka region. Russia's Tass news agency said that in Moscow, turnout was 59.5% an hour before polls closed there. But opposition observers have said their estimates for turnout are significantly different form the official figures. Sunday's vote is the first in Crimea since Russia seized the region from Ukraine. The move was bitterly contested by Kiev and ratcheted up tensions between Russia and the West. As a result, Russians living in Ukraine were unable to take part in Sunday's vote because access to Russian diplomatic missions was blocked by the Kiev government.

"This video can not be played Footage shows destroyed statues and flags being raised in the centre of Afrin Turkish-backed forces have taken full control of the centre of the Syrian-Kurdish city of Afrin. Fighters waved flags and tore down the statue of a legendary Kurdish figure after claiming the city centre on Sunday. The two-month Turkish-led operation aimed to rid the border region of a Kurdish militia that Turkey considers a terrorist group. Activists say 280 civilians have died, although this is denied by Ankara. Earlier, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that ""units of the Free Syrian Army... took control of the centre of Afrin this morning"". Turkish forces and the Free Syrian Army entered Afrin on Sunday Operations continued on Sunday to clear mines and remaining Kurdish resistance elsewhere in Afrin. ""Most of the terrorists have already fled with tails between their legs,"" the Turkish president said. ""In the centre of Afrin, symbols of trust and stability are waving instead of rags of terrorists."" How historical Afrin became a prize worth a war Why the battle for northern Syria matters Pictures and video footage emerged of forces tearing down a Kurdish statue with a bulldozer. The monument depicted the blacksmith Kawa, a legendary figure for Kurds. Syrian rebels celebrated after the statue of Kawa was brought down in the centre of Afrin A statement on a Whatsapp group for the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces called it the ""first blatant violation of Kurdish people's culture and history since the takeover of Afrin"". A Turkish armed forces Twitter page posted a video of troops displaying the nation's flag in Afrin's centre. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mohammad al-Hamadeen, spokesman for the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA), said they met no resistance as they entered Afrin on three fronts. ""Maybe it will be cleared by the end of the day - it is empty of [YPG] fighters, they cleared out,"" he said. Turkish military spokesman Bekir Bozdag said the campaign would continue until the area around Afrin was secure. This video can not be played A short guide to the Syrian civil war He said the YPG's ""terrorism corridor"" in Afrin was over. However, in a televised statement, the co-chair of the Afrin executive council, Othman Sheikh Issa, said the war against Turkey had entered ""a new stage"". Kurdish forces remained in the region and would ""strike the positions of the Turkish enemy and its mercenaries at every opportunity"", he said. ""Our forces all over Afrin will become a constant nightmare for them,"" he added. The statement also said civilians had not fled, but were evacuated ""to avoid a worse catastrophe"". Civilians have fled Afrin in the past few days By Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey Correspondent President Erdogan has achieved his twin objectives: to remove a key area under YPG control and to rally the vast majority of Turks behind their commander-in-chief. The jingoism here has been breathtaking. Targeting the Kurdish militants, Turkey's age-old enemy, is a rare uniting force in a polarised country. Those who have spoken out - several hundred - have been detained for ""terrorism propaganda"". The question now is whether Turkey pushes on to other YPG-held areas, namely Manbij, which could put Turkish troops in direct conflict with US soldiers there who see the YPG as allies. That depends on talks between Ankara and Washington, and the sacking of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last week removes an important interlocutor for Turkey. The risk in Afrin is that many residents who will return are Kurdish and could see Turkey as the aggressor. Tearing down a Kurdish statue in the town centre doesn't augur well. Will the Afrin operation actually push more local people into the arms of the YPG? The Turkish assault on Afrin, named Operation Olive Branch, began on 20 January, with the aim of ridding the city and surrounding region of the YPG. Turkey regards the YPG as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in south-eastern Turkey for three decades. The YPG denies any direct organisational links to the PKK - an assertion backed by the US, which is allied with the YPG in the battle against the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in Syria. Turkey targets Kurds: The 100, 300 and 700-word story Who are the Kurds? US plans to help form a Kurdish border force set alarm bells ringing in Ankara, and prompted the launch of Operation Olive Branch. President Erdogan vowed to ""suffocate"" what he called a ""terror army."" Turkey also announced plans to push Kurdish forces from Manbij, another city near the border. Backed by Turkey, the Free Syrian Army is a rebel group operating in the north of the country. It is helping Turkey to secure its border with Syria, and has fought against the Syrian army, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and the Islamic State group. Who are the groups fighting Assad? The assault in the north-west coincides with a Syrian and Russian offensive on Eastern Ghouta, an enclave near Damascus. The Syrian army is pushing into the area with the support of Russian air strikes, and there are reports of civilian casualties. Exodus as Syrian war rages on two fronts Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space The pro-government assault is said to have captured 80% of the enclave. Seizing it would be a major victory for President Bashar al-Assad, who reportedly visited Syrian troops in the Eastern Ghouta on Sunday. State television broadcast images of the president in shirt and jacket surrounded by soldiers in an unspecified part of the district. Allow Twitter content?

"Donald Trump's use of Twitter to attack opponents is unprecedented Donald Trump has attacked special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the US presidential election he won in 2016. He tweeted that the inquiry was unfair - and reiterated there had been ""no collusion"" between his election campaign and Russia. He added that it was dominated by ""hardened Democrats"" and supporters of his defeated opponent Hillary Clinton. Mr Mueller, a highly regarded former head of the FBI, is a Republican. The president's comments came a day after his lawyer, John Dowd, said it was time for the special counsel's investigation to end. Initially Mr Dowd said he was speaking for the president but later clarified he was ""speaking for myself"". Who's who in Russia-Trump inquiry? Trump Russia: Key questions answered What is a special counsel? Mr Trump's latest tweet drew warnings from fellow Republicans about interfering with the investigation. Allow Twitter content?

In earlier tweets, the president also berated former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Friday just two days before he was due to retire, and former FBI director James Comey, whom Mr Trump sacked last year. The latter firing led to the Mueller investigation being set up. Mr Trump accused Mr Comey of lying under oath before Congress, and described the contemporaneous notes that Mr McCabe and Mr Comey took following discussions with him as ""fake memos"". Mr McCabe has given memos about conversations he had with President Trump to the Mueller inquiry, US media say. The memos could support claims that Mr Trump sought to obstruct justice. Mr Mueller has so far indicted 19 people. Robert Mueller has admirers on all sides of US politics But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said Mr Mueller should be allowed to proceed without interference, and that many Republicans shared his view. He also warned Mr Trump against any attempt to dismiss Mr Mueller. ""If he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency, because we're a rule of law nation,"" Mr Graham said. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, a frequent Trump critic, said it appeared the president's latest comments seemed to be preparing the ground for the firing of Mr Mueller. ""I don't know what the designs are on Mueller, but it seems to be building toward that, and I just hope it doesn't go there, because it can't. We can't in Congress accept that,"" he told CNN. ""I'm just puzzled by why the White House is going so hard at this, other than that they're very afraid of what might come out."" Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer accused Mr Trump of ""floating trial balloons about derailing"" the investigation. ""Our Republican colleagues, particularly the leadership, have an obligation to our country to stand up now and make it clear that firing Mueller is a red line for our democracy that cannot be crossed,"" the Democrat said in a statement. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter With a weekend free of scheduled presidential obligations, Donald Trump has ratcheted up the rhetoric directed toward independent counsel Robert Mueller. Perhaps it is because the president feels emboldened by the one-two punch of the Republican intelligence committee conclusion that there was no ""collusion"" between the Trump camp and Russia, and his attorney general's decision to fire former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. Or maybe it is because Mr Trump is on edge following reports that Mr Mueller is now looking into the Trump Organization's business dealings with Russia. Whatever the reason, the president spent the weekend swinging at ""hardened Democrats"" on Mr Mueller's team and ""sanctimonious"" former FBI Director James Comey, and celebrating Mr McCabe's unceremonious exit. And so the president's strategy comes into shape. Paint his critics and investigators as anti-Trump, deep-state establishment forces and the entire inquiry as based on a biased and corrupt premise. The next step would be to claim any evidence of wrongdoing unearthed by Mr Mueller is irretrievably tainted. That, of course, isn't much of a legal defence. In a war for public opinion, however, it's a place where his side could dig in. Mr McCabe had been under internal investigation by the FBI and had already stepped down from his deputy post in January pending the review. He was sacked just two days short of his 50th birthday on Sunday, when he was expected to retire with a federal pension. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the ""extensive and fair investigation""had concluded that Mr McCabe ""made an unauthorised disclosure to the news media and lacked candour - including under oath - on multiple occasions"". The White House said it left the decision to fire Mr McCabe (right) to Mr Sessions (left) Although the decision to fire Mr McCabe was made by Mr Sessions, Mr Trump had criticised him for months. He has publicly pointed to donations that Mr McCabe's wife, a Democrat, received from a Clinton ally when she ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate in 2015 as evidence that Mr McCabe was politically biased. He welcomed the news of his dismissal almost immediately after Mr Sessions announced it, calling the move a ""great day for democracy"". News that Mr McCabe had kept records of his conversations with Mr Trump at the time he was acting FBI director emerged on Saturday. US media say the memos will support Mr Comey's account of the circumstances of his dismissal last May. This video can not be played Comey's most revealing moments Mr Comey has testified that Mr Trump had asked him for his ""loyalty"" and requested he drop an inquiry into his disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. He, too, has said he kept contemporaneous notes of his dealings with the president. In a statement responding to his firing on Friday, Mr McCabe vehemently denied wrongdoing,external. ""I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,"" his response said. Republican memo accuses FBI of abusing power Trump renews attack on 'disgraceful' FBI The statement alleges that the justice department report recommending his firing was ""accelerated"" after he indicated that he would corroborate Mr Comey's version of events. On Saturday Mr Comey - who is due to release a book - said Americans would soon be able to judge for themselves ""who is honourable or not"". Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Drone footage shows extent of mill fire Firefighters are continuing to tackle a blaze at a mill in Greater Manchester. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to the mill in Clarence Street, Stalybridge, at 23:43 GMT on Saturday. Incident commander Bjorn Burdsall said the service was ""getting towards"" damping down some areas of the fire, but parts of the mill are unstable so they ""cannot yet fully extinguish it"". At its height, five storeys of the building were alight. The damage to the mill in Clarence Street was visible as the fire receded Overnight incident commander Billy Fenwick said the fire had been ""surrounded"" by 06:00 on Sunday, and added that crews had stopped it from spreading. ""We are confident nearby buildings are safe from harm,"" he added. More than 50 firefighters were tackling the blaze at its height. Mr Fenwick said firefighters would continue to tackle the blaze throughout Sunday and said a fire investigation team would attend to ""try and establish a cause"". The fire service said they did not believe anyone was in the mill, which is believed to be home to a number of small businesses, at the time. More than 50 firefighters tackled the blaze at its height One of the tenants, cheerleading and dance class provider TCA Tycoons,posted on Facebook,externalthat it was ""heartbroken"". ""This was not only where our cheer and dance programme was based, it was also a home and a safe place for so many parents and athletes,"" it said. Two aerial platforms are being used ""to put water on the fire from height and to help control the plume of smoke"". Mr Fenwick advised nearby residents to keep doors and windows closed as a precaution, to stop smoke entering their homes. ""Please also ensure you stay away from the nearby area and do not drive nearby - for both your safety and to make sure we can fight this fire,"" he added. Road closures are in place around Clarence Street and Tame Street. The fire service said roads in the immediate area are expected to remain closed for the majority of the week. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Vladimir Chizhov suggests UK lab could be nerve agent source Russia's EU ambassador has suggested a UK research laboratory could be the source of the nerve agent used in the attack on an ex-spy and his daughter. Vladimir Chizhov told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show Russia had ""nothing to do"" with the poisoning in Salisbury of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. He said Russia did not stockpile the poison and that the Porton Down lab was only eight miles (12km) from the city. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson described the claims as ""satirical"". Retired military intelligence officer Mr Skripal, 66, and Yulia, 33, remain critically ill in hospital after being found slumped on a bench in Salisbury city centre on 4 March. What are Novichok nerve agents? Russian spy: What we know so far Czechs reject Russia spy poisoning claims UK Prime Minister Theresa May has told MPs that Porton Down - Britain's military research base -  identified the substance used as being part of a group of military-grade nerve agents known as Novichok developed by the Soviet Union. Mr Johnson told the Marr Show that Russia's reaction to the incident ""was not the response of a country that really believes itself to be innocent"". He said the UK had evidence that Russia, within the last 10 years, had been developing and stockpiling Novichok, as well as investigating the delivery of nerve agents for the purpose of assassination. He also said experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) would arrive in the UK on Monday to test samples of the nerve agent. The results are expected to take a ""minimum of two weeks"", the Foreign Office added. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Mr Chizhov, when asked how the nerve agent came to be used in Salisbury, said: ""When you have a nerve agent or whatever, you check it against certain samples that you retain in your laboratories. ""And Porton Down, as we now all know, is the largest military facility in the United Kingdom that has been dealing with chemical weapons research. ""And it's actually only eight miles from Salisbury."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played ""Smug sarcasm"": Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson criticises Russia's response to ex-spy case Russia has been stockpiling the nerve agent used in the attack on an ex-spy and his daughter over the last decade, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says. He also dismissed a suggestion by Russia's EU ambassador that the agent might have come from a UK laboratory. Vladimir Chizhov had said the Porton Down lab in Wiltshire may have been the source of the substance. Sergei and Yulia Skripal remain critically ill in hospital after being exposed to the substance in Salisbury. They were found slumped on a bench in the Wiltshire city on 4 March. Prime Minister Theresa May has said Russia is ""culpable"" for the attack. On Sunday, newly elected President Vladimir Putin denied Russia was behind the incident but added that he was ""ready for co-operation"" with the UK. He told reporters: ""Any reasonable person understands that it would be total rubbish, ravings and nonsense for anyone in Russia to allow themselves such antics ahead of the election and the World Cup.""

"John McDonnell has said he ""agrees with the prime minister"" that the Russian state is ""responsible"" for the Salisbury spy poisoning. The shadow chancellor told ITV ""whichever way you look at it"", Russia's Vladimir Putin ""is responsible and all the evidence points to him"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbynhas been criticisedfor not blaming the Russian state categorically for the attack. A Labour spokesman said there had been ""no shift"" in Labour's policy. Former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain critically ill in hospital after being found slumped on a bench on 4 March. Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who was exposed to the nerve agent while responding to the incident, is no longer considered critical but remains in hospital. Russia stockpiling nerve agent - Johnson Labour row over Corbyn stance on Russia What are Novichok nerve agents? Russian spy: What we know so far Asked whether he blamed Mr Putin for the attack, Mr McDonnell told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""I agree completely with the prime minister. ""What she's said is that Russia is culpable, either by direct commission - either [President] Putin's ordered this - or they've lost control of their supplies."" He added: ""There's a pattern of people being murdered here, therefore it leads you to the conclusion that Putin has questions to answer, because this is highly likely this could have been a state execution."" Mr McDonnell defended his leader's Commons response to the prime minister's statement - in which he condemned the attack, but raised questions about Russian donations to the Conservative Party and criticised cuts to the Foreign Office. Conservative MPs accused him of political point scoring, while some Labour MPs suggested he had misjudged his response. The shadow chancellor told ITV it had not been ""an attack"" on the prime minister: ""It was a critique. It was asking questions about investment in diplomacy, it was asking questions about where you go from here in building that international coalition. ""That is what oppositions do and it was a constructive critique, I think others have misread that."" He called for the introduction of an ""oligarch levy"" to strengthen the UK's hand in imposing effective sanctions on Russia. Jonathan Blake, BBC politics correspondent The position may not have officially changed, but the language clearly has. Senior Labour politicians are choosing their words carefully after Jeremy Corbyn's statement to Parliament on the Salisbury attack was criticised by some of his party's MPs. The shadow chancellor struck a bullish tone, saying it was ""highly likely this could have been a state execution"". A more measured line came from Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti, who said: ""Russia is looking responsible."" A few days ago Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said the attack should be condemned, ""no ifs, no buts"". All of the above is consistent with the leader's position, the party maintains. So what difference does a subtle shift in language, tone or emphasis make? It all adds up to the message. And in the last few days, for Labour, that has been far from clear. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May told the Commons that Russia was ""culpable"" for the attack and that she was expelling 23 Russian diplomats. Moscow has denied all involvement, and expelled British diplomats in turn. On Thursday, amid calls for him to be firmer in his condemnation of Russia, Mr Corbyn said the ""evidence points towards Russia on this"". But later in an article for the Guardian newspaper, he drew a link with the build-up to the war in Iraq and warned people not to ""rush ahead of the evidence"". He condemned the attack but argued the involvement of Russian ""mafia-like groups"" could not be ruled out. More than 30 Labour MPs havesigned a motion,externalwhich ""unequivocally"" accepts the Russian state's ""culpability"". Backbencher Stephen Kinnock told the BBC on Friday the Guardian article had ""muddied the waters somewhat"". But senior Labour figures denied the party was divided over the issue. Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""I am here to make clear that I am completely at one, not just with Jeremy but with Nia Griffith, Emily Thornberry, Keir Starmer. ""We must condemn Russian responsibility, whether it is negligent or whether it is even more serious."" The Labour Party has denied Mr McDonnell's comments are a shift in its position over culpability for the poisoning. A spokesman said: ""This week the prime minister laid out two alternatives: that Russia is directly responsible, or negligent because it lost control of this nerve agent. ""Labour agrees that the evidence overwhelmingly points to those two alternatives. ""The Russian authorities must be held to account on the basis of the evidence and our response must be both decisive and proportionate.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will never tolerate a threat to the life of British citizens and others on British soil"" Russia is to expel 23 British diplomats in a row over the nerve agent attack on an-ex spy and his daughter in the UK. The Russian foreign ministry said the UK staff would be expelled from Moscow within a week in response to Britain's decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats. It also said it would close the British Council in Russia, which promotes cultural ties between the nations, and the British Consulate in St Petersburg. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain critically ill in hospital. They were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire on 4 March. The UK government says they were poisoned with a nerve agent of a type developed by Russia called Novichok - the Russian government denies any involvement in the attack. Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK government would consider its next steps ""in the coming days, alongside our allies and partners"". What we know so far What happens when you expel a diplomat? Why does UK think it was Russia? ""We will never tolerate a threat to the life of British citizens and others on British soil from the Russian government,"" she added. The British Council, the UK's international organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities,said it was ""profoundly disappointed"" at being told to cease operations in Russia.,external BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said the move was significant because the Council fosters people-to-people relationships and, as it serves young people, could be crucial for the UK's relationship with a post-Putin Russia. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Meanwhile, counter-terrorism police have renewed their appeal for witnesses who may have seen Mr Skripal's burgundy BMW car in Salisbury on 4 March. Neil Basu, Met Police Assistant Commissioner, said: ""We are learning more about Sergei and Yulia's movements but we need to be clearer around their exact movements on the morning of the incident."" Police believe the car - registration plate HD09 WAO - may have been in the areas of London Road, Churchill Way North and Wilton Road at about 09:15 GMT. At about 13:30 GMT it was seen being driven down Devizes Road towards the centre of town. Mr Basu said investigators were making good progress but further work could take ""months"". He added that the continued presence of officers in the area wearing specialist protective clothing was a precaution and that the risk to the public was low. Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who was part of the initial response to the incident, remains in a serious but stable condition in hospital after being exposed to the chemical. Britain's ambassador to Russia, Laurie Bristow, was summoned to Russia's foreign ministry on Saturday morning, where he was informed of Moscow's decision. Following the meeting, Mr Bristow said the UK had no quarrel with the Russian people and would ""always do what is necessary to defend ourselves"". This video can not be played Ambassador Laurie Bristow: ""We will always do what is necessary to defend ourselves"" By Sarah Rainsford, BBC Moscow correspondent The British ambassador had been expecting this call for three days. In the end, he spent just over 10 minutes in the foreign ministry where he was handed Russia's counter-sanctions. The response from Moscow is robust and does go further than the UK measures. But it doesn't appear calculated to escalate tensions. The ministry has stuck to 23 for 23 in terms of diplomatic expulsions, no more. And while it is ordering the closure of the UK consulate in St Petersburg - both Moscow and Ekaterinburg remain open. Russia's response has also targeted the British Council, which promotes cultural ties. That will be seen by Britain as a low blow, hurting the Russian people - not the British government. But the UK is unlikely to want to retaliate in kind. The council's activity here had already been significantly curtailed by Moscow after the last crisis in relations, whenAlexander Litvinenko was poisoned. Meanwhile, the double tactic of denial and distraction here continues, both in comments by officials, and in the mocking, dismissive coverage of the Skripal case on state-run media. The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement that the British diplomats would be ""declared persona non grata"", adding that it ""reserves the right to introduce other retaliatory measures in case of further unfriendly actions"". It said it was responding to ""provocative actions"" and ""unproven accusations"" by Britain. Russia's UK embassy tweeted a picture of a reception held to thank staff being expelled from Britain Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also said that the most likely source of the nerve agent was Britain, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden or the United States. Speaking to state-owned Russian news channel Rossiya 24, she said those countries, not Russia, had been intensively testing the substance since the 1990s. Czech foreign minister Martin Stropnicky rejected the claims as ""unsubstantiated"" and ""a classic way of manipulating information in the public space"". Swedish foreign minister Margot Wallstrom tweeted: ""Forcefully reject unacceptable and unfounded allegation"" and added,  ""Russia should answer UK questions instead."" Meanwhile, the Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, hosted a reception at the Russian embassy in London for the diplomats who are being expelled from the UK.

A post-mortem examination found the 68-year-old died from ""compression to the neck"". Police say there is no evidence at this stage linking his case with the Salisbury attack. However, they have begun to contact a number of Russian exiles to discuss their safety.

"This video can not be played The homes in Hemsby are ""teetering"" on the cliff edge Cliff-top homes in danger of collapsing into the sea off the Norfolk coast remain in a ""precarious position"", a council leader has said. Great Yarmouth Borough Council leader Graham Plant said it was ""too dangerous"" for residents of 13 chalets close to the cliff edge to return. The Coastguard said a shed and an oil tank fell into the sea at Hemsby as high winds and waves eroded the dunes. One homeowner said it felt like an ""earthquake"" as the cliff gave way. Mr Plant said the homes were being inspected after each high tide, but added it was unlikely residents could return home before Tuesday when he expected the weather to improve. ""It is a sad situation where people may lose their homes but the council will do its best to help residents,"" he said. Thirteen chalets are said to be vulnerable to falling into the sea at The Marrams The cliffs at Hemsby are made of sand which has suffered erosion over many years and the chalets are sited on privately-owned land. Coxswain of Hemsby Lifeboat, Daniel Hurd said a six-metre high (20ft) dune had been eroded in a 24-hour period. Chalet owner Stephen Chadwick said: ""I bought it for sea views, beautiful sea views, and now the sea's taking it away."" Speaking on Saturday, he added: ""I woke up this morning, had a cup of coffee at half past seven, the back door, and I felt... it was like an earthquake, and the cliff just went. ""I'm just in total shock."" Stephen Chadwick said he did not expect his home to survive Ten residents, forced to leave their chalets, spent Saturday night in a nearby hall, pub and holiday chalets. Paul Ray, who returned to his home early on Sunday, said he was ""devastated"" to find it was ""not safe to live there at all"". He had lived in the bungalow for eight years with his wife and two dogs. ""You can't go round the back; if you did you'd go straight on to the beach,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

""Not only are you putting your own life at risk, but those that will have to rescue you when it goes wrong,"" a Coastguard spokesman said. The warning came after an individual was spotted taking a selfie near the sea edge where waves up to 3m (almost 10ft) high have been lashing the shore. ""With all this going on, the last thing you would expect to see is irresponsible people taking selfies,"" added the spokesman.

"These rebranded recycling bins were removed after being placed on a supermarket car park without permission. Charities have lost hundreds of thousands of pounds after 750 clothing banks were taken from car parks, says the Textile Recycling Association. Recycling companies working with them say sometimes up to 20 a week have gone missing in the last year across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some have been rebranded with a different charity logo and placed at sites without permission, the TRA says. The Charity Commission has launched an investigation. There are around 15,000 clothing banks throughout the whole of the UK, often placed at supermarket car parks and recycling sites. Some are run by charities such as The Salvation Army, Oxfam and the British Heart Foundation  themselves, but others are operated by private recycling companies who give a donation to charities - on average Â£250 for every tonne of clothes collected. Around Â£75m was given to charities and local authorities last year. The TRA, which represents the sector, says the clothing banks have been taken from across the country - including in England's North West, the Midlands and East. It says charities receive on average Â£70 worth of donations a week from each bank. Because it can take between six to eight weeks to replace a bank, it is estimated charities could have lost nearly Â£370,000. In some cases, the recycling companies are not replacing the banks so the charities will lose out permanently. Recycling Solutions North West, based in Heywood in Greater Manchester, donates between Â£5,000 and Â£6,000 a month to a charity which helps critically ill babies and children. James Cook and his baby son Dexter, who died from an undiagnosed heart condition. Last month, 12 of its clothing banks were taken from sites across Greater Manchester. One of the directors, James Cook, is passionate about the charity after his son Dexter, who had an undiagnosed heart condition, died when he was only 13 months old. He said: ""I just can't understand why any individual would go out and take the clothing banks. ""The families, they're relying on that charity to carry out a service for their child. It is a lifesaving service. ""I do like to see the target go up every month, I like to see the money climb and I'm going to see it drop next month and that will hurt."" Another charity which is counting the cost is Reuben's Retreat in Glossop, which provides support to families who have lost a child or have children with life-limiting illnesses. The Reuben's Retreat charity is named after Reuben Graham who died from a brain tumour. It receives donations from a recycling company, but the amount it receives has now been reduced after a number of clothing banks were taken. Nicola Graham - who founded the charity after the death of her son Reuben - said: ""It will have a significant impact on our funding stream. ""Reuben's little photograph is on that bin, and all our details. ""It just beggars belief that somebody can think that it's OK to take from charity and actually take something with his little face on it."" The TRA say the cost of replacing a bank can be up to Â£1,500 and the total bill to its members could be as much as Â£1m. President Ian Woods said the loss of the banks was ""depriving members of the public from a service intended for them to recycle textiles and, more importantly, depriving charities and local authorities nationwide of revenue streams which are vitally important for the services they deliver"". He added: ""We are appealing to the police and other government agencies to join us in the campaign to clamp down on all forms of illegal activity connected to textile recycling."" Investigators working for the TRA have removed around 200 banks which they say have been rebranded with the logo of a registered charity called Helping Our Future and placed on supermarket car parks without authorisation. The charity, which is based in Wolverhampton, says it raised nearly Â£19,000 last year and works to promote recycling and relieve financial hardship. BBC 5 live Investigates has discovered Helping our Future is under investigation by the Charity Commission. A spokesperson said: ""The commission is examining the charity Helping Our Future as part of a regulatory compliance case. ""We have serious concerns about its management and activities, and are examining trustees' oversight of the charity, its relationship with third parties, including commercial fundraising companies, and whether the charity's management and operations have given rise to inappropriate benefit on the part of private individuals or companies."" The charity, which the BBC understands leases its banks from a third party, denies any wrongdoing. A company which says it acts for Helping Our Future told the BBC:  ""We are an associated contractor to HOF Trading Limited which is the logistical partner to Helping our Future Charity. ""We are contracted to abide by a written protocol which prevents us from carrying out any criminal activity and bringing any holistic partner into disrepute."" The company added that some of the charity's own banks had been taken and that this had been reported to the police. 5 live Investigates is onBBC Radio 5 live, 18 March at 11:00 GMT - catch up onBBC iPlayer Radio.

"This video can not be played The homes in Hemsby are ""teetering"" on the cliff edge Cliff-top homes in danger of collapsing into the sea off the Norfolk coast remain in a ""precarious position"", a council leader has said. Great Yarmouth Borough Council leader Graham Plant said it was ""too dangerous"" for residents of 13 chalets close to the cliff edge to return. The Coastguard said a shed and an oil tank fell into the sea at Hemsby as high winds and waves eroded the dunes. One homeowner said it felt like an ""earthquake"" as the cliff gave way. Mr Plant said the homes were being inspected after each high tide, but added it was unlikely residents could return home before Tuesday when he expected the weather to improve. ""It is a sad situation where people may lose their homes but the council will do its best to help residents,"" he said. Thirteen chalets are said to be vulnerable to falling into the sea at The Marrams The cliffs at Hemsby are made of sand which has suffered erosion over many years and the chalets are sited on privately-owned land. Coxswain of Hemsby Lifeboat, Daniel Hurd said a six-metre high (20ft) dune had been eroded in a 24-hour period. Chalet owner Stephen Chadwick said: ""I bought it for sea views, beautiful sea views, and now the sea's taking it away."" Speaking on Saturday, he added: ""I woke up this morning, had a cup of coffee at half past seven, the back door, and I felt... it was like an earthquake, and the cliff just went. ""I'm just in total shock."" Stephen Chadwick said he did not expect his home to survive Ten residents, forced to leave their chalets, spent Saturday night in a nearby hall, pub and holiday chalets. Paul Ray, who returned to his home early on Sunday, said he was ""devastated"" to find it was ""not safe to live there at all"". He had lived in the bungalow for eight years with his wife and two dogs. ""You can't go round the back; if you did you'd go straight on to the beach,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

The Coastguard has warned people not to take risks by standing close to the sea to take pictures Norfolk Police and Gorleston Coastguard have both warned members of the public to stay away from the area due to it being unsafe. ""Not only are you putting your own life at risk, but those that will have to rescue you when it goes wrong,"" a Coastguard spokesman said. The warning came after an individual was spotted taking a selfie near the sea edge where waves up to 3m (almost 10ft) high have been lashing the shore. ""With all this going on, the last thing you would expect to see is irresponsible people taking selfies,"" added the spokesman.

"This video can not be played Drone footage shows extent of mill fire Firefighters are continuing to tackle a blaze at a mill in Greater Manchester. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to the mill in Clarence Street, Stalybridge, at 23:43 GMT on Saturday. Incident commander Bjorn Burdsall said the service was ""getting towards"" damping down some areas of the fire, but parts of the mill are unstable so they ""cannot yet fully extinguish it"". At its height, five storeys of the building were alight. The damage to the mill in Clarence Street was visible as the fire receded Overnight incident commander Billy Fenwick said the fire had been ""surrounded"" by 06:00 on Sunday, and added that crews had stopped it from spreading. ""We are confident nearby buildings are safe from harm,"" he added. More than 50 firefighters were tackling the blaze at its height. Mr Fenwick said firefighters would continue to tackle the blaze throughout Sunday and said a fire investigation team would attend to ""try and establish a cause"". The fire service said they did not believe anyone was in the mill, which is believed to be home to a number of small businesses, at the time.

""This was not only where our cheer and dance programme was based, it was also a home and a safe place for so many parents and athletes,"" it said. Two aerial platforms are being used ""to put water on the fire from height and to help control the plume of smoke"". Mr Fenwick advised nearby residents to keep doors and windows closed as a precaution, to stop smoke entering their homes. ""Please also ensure you stay away from the nearby area and do not drive nearby - for both your safety and to make sure we can fight this fire,"" he added.

"Mr McCabe was fired on Friday, two days short of his expected retirement date Ex-FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe has given memos about conversations he had with President Donald Trump to an inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, US media say. The memos could support claims that Mr Trump sought to obstruct justice. Mr McCabe was fired from the FBI on Friday. Mr Trump had accused him of bias and said on Sunday Mr McCabe had never taken notes when the two met. The president has also dismissed the Russia investigation as a ""witch hunt"". The investigation is led by special counsel Robert Mueller, himself a former FBI director. He has so far indicted 19 people. Who's who in Russia-Trump inquiry? Trump Russia: Key questions answered What is Mueller's special counsel? The president's lawyer, John Dowd, issued a statement on Saturday saying it was time for the special counsel's investigation to end.Mr Trump has since complained that the Mueller team is composed of ""13 hardened Democrats,external, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans"". Mr McCabe had been under internal investigation by the FBI and had already stepped down from his deputy post in January pending the review. He was sacked just two days short of his 50 birthday on Sunday, when he was expected to retire with a federal pension. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the ""extensive and fair investigation""had concluded that Mr McCabe ""made an unauthorised disclosure to the news media and lacked candour - including under oath - on multiple occasions"". The White House said it would leave the decision to fire Mr McCabe (right) to Mr Sessions (left) Although the decision to fire Mr McCabe was made by Mr Sessions, Mr Trump had criticised him for months. He has publicly pointed to donations that Mr McCabe's wife, a Democrat, received from a Clinton ally when she ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate in 2015 as evidence that Mr McCabe was politically biased.

"Nashra Balagamwala visiting Paris When Pakistani designer Nashra Balagamwala produced a board game about arranged marriage, most news reports about her wrongly assumed she was dead against it. Actually her position is far more nuanced. And one goal is to explain to people in the UK and elsewhere how it works. ""People in the West often confuse arranged marriages with forced marriages,"" Nashra Balagamwala says, on the phone from Islamabad. ""They go by a lot of what they see in the press. The acid attacks. The so-called honour killings. The complete absence of choice. My game was not meant to be part of that dialogue."" Balagamwala's board game, Arranged!, is far from an advert for arranged marriage. Its central character is a matchmaker ""auntie"" eagerly trying to chase down three girls while they attempt to outwit her and delay marriage. Players create distance from the auntie, and impending marriage, by drawing cards with commands like ""You were seen at the mall with boys. The auntie moves three spaces away from you."" Other cards that put auntie off include ""Your older sister married a white man"", or ""The auntie finds out you used tampons before marriage."" (Many in South Asia believe that a tampon is an indication of sexual activity.) Balagamwala says the game has a dual purpose. One is to start a dialogue among South Asian families on what is expected of women. ""I wanted to create an innocent platform where families could talk about some of the silly aspects of my culture, in a non-confrontational way. Like how a 'good girl' knows how to make a good cup ofchaiand doesn't have male friends. ""Secondly, I wanted to explain arranged marriage to white people, so they could better understand the nuance of South Asian traditions."" Balagamwala was at the Rhode Island School of Design in the US when she came up with the idea. ""I was about to head home to Pakistan at the end of the year, and I had some proposals waiting for me, so I started stalking the Facebook accounts of those guys to find something about them that my parents wouldn't approve of, so I could get out of meeting them. And then I thought to myself, 'Why not get rid of the problem once and for all?' So I created a list of every ridiculous thing I've done to get out of an arranged marriage and turned it into this light-hearted board game."" She tested her game out on her friends, a mixture of South Asians and white Americans. An American male friend was in fits of laughter while playing. He admitted to Balagamwala that he'd been worried the game would trivialise the subject, but said that he now had a better understanding of it. Encouraged by the reaction of her friends, and frustrated by her family's endless questions about when she would settle down, Balagamwala set up a Kickstarter page to help fund her game. ""Gaming is my therapy,"" she says. ""Making board games soothes me. I've made others too, but they are too controversial for a South Asian audience."" Balagamwala says she understands traditional South Asian families. Her own family had been reluctant for her to continue her higher education, particularly in the US, and the dean of her high school, as well as a procession of friends and cousins, had to convince them that it was a good move. The Kickstarter campaign was quickly funded, with more than 500 people placing their orders. Media attention followed, but many reporters failed to grasp her intention, she says, assuming the game was a protest against arranged marriage. ""It upset me that so many news outlets chose to hyperlink to ghoulish stories about acid attacks and honour killings. It was as if my game, which was meant to be thought-provoking but humorous, was somehow part of that narrative. It was now a blanket warning against arranged marriage. That wasn't my intention."" Balagamwala is keen to not deny the experience of women who are subjected to forced marriage. She says she's aware that happens a lot in Pakistan and India and that it deserves media scrutiny. But that, she says, is not what arranged marriage is. ""I'm not against tradition or the idea of an introduction - one that I have the option to decline - from a family member. Especially in a society as conservative as Pakistan, where men and women aren't really allowed to be friends. But only when I'm ready. ""People in the West should realise that is what a lot of people in South Asia mean when they say 'arranged marriage'. You may hear about the horror cases, those forced marriages, but that isn't the reality for millions of people. ""Also, how is an introduction any different from being set up on a blind date or arranging your own introduction via a dating app?"" Soon after Arranged! was profiled on several media outlets, including the BBC, Balagamwala and her family attended a family wedding in Karachi. While her immediate family were supportive, a wider circle were colder. This video can not be played The board game sparking debate about arranged marriage ""Some openly said, 'You're going against our values, you're going against what we taught you.' Others avoided me completely. ""My dad joked, 'Well, you didn't want to get married and now you've made sure that no-one in Pakistan will marry you!'"" The biggest critics of the game were the ""Rishta Aunties"" - a nickname in Hindi and Urdu for meddlesome older women, not necessarily blood relations, who scout for younger women at weddings to pair up with an eligible young man. They aren't doing it for monetary compensation but purely for the thrill of setting up a good match. The aunties, says Balagamwala, have a set of criteria for what makes a desirable girl. ""It's often girls who don't speak their mind. They're seen and not heard. They're good home-makers, ready to support her husband and his ambitions,"" she says. ""And after I was profiled in the press, I was now outside this frame of what makes a desirable wife - for the Rishta Aunties."" The release of the game struck a nerve with many young women. ""I had messages and support from South Asian women across the world. South Asian women often retain a lot of their traditional values and culture, even if they are born in the US or Europe, so the subject resonated with them. ""A girl in India messaged me and saying that my game gave her the courage to have an uncomfortable conversation with her family and say, 'Look not all Asian women want to get married in their 20s.'"" The reaction from young South Asian men surprised her the most. They were overwhelmingly positive. Many sent her direct messages thanking her for explaining the female perspective. Some asked her out. More than 50 strangers from the internet proposed. Some of the proposals Balagamwala received - in the background, her many Facebook friend requests ""Initially I didn't get any proposals from Pakistani men within my society because the aunties no longer wanted me,"" Balagamwala says. However, it's now been six months and they've started up again. Last week four men known to her family expressed interest in marriage. ""The sad part is that I'm a girl with light skin and light eyes, and that's the reason they're proposing again. ""I'm not kidding. These aunties, when they call my mum, actually say, 'Oh we're going to have a green-eyed daughter-in-law.'"" Balagamwala has declined all offers so far. She's still in no hurry to get married, she says.

Then, on a Sunday, he would play another venue in another town. Often it would be Blackpool's northern rival Scarborough. That's more than a million paying customers in total. Blackpool is the spiritual home of comedians like Ken Dodd Forty years on, his most regular Scarborough haunt, the Futurist, is being knocked down.  The other two summer season theatres, the Floral Hall and the Opera House, have both long since gone. However, if you want to understand Ken Dodd, it helps if you remember something of this era at the tail end of variety and music hall. Modern comedy has split in to two.  At the bottom are the small clubs of traditional stand-up.  The crowd is usually young and well lubricated.  At the top are the select band of TV stars who can play the really big tours. Tributes to 'brilliant' comic Ken Dodd Tattyfilarious: 17 of Ken Dodd's best gags Tickling sticks and tears for Doddy In Ken Dodd's heyday, his audience were families on a week's holiday by the seaside.  Fish and chips, tea, bread and butter - and big portions - were the normal pre-show preparation. He, in turn, would deliver big portions of comedy. Scarborough's taxi drivers dreaded his visits, knowing they would be waiting on the foreshore into the early hours of the morning. Sir Ken Dodd harked back to the good old days on the BBC's The Good Old Days Occasionally, in old recordings, you get a glimpse of the audience and see how many of them were older women and relatively young children. He needed to find a way of making them all laugh. The solution was the torrent of gags. One after another they poured down at you. If three missed their mark, then the fourth would get you.  All around you would be the sound of sustained laughter, which seemed to make everything that bit funnier. There was a reason why, when every one of his contemporaries had long since retired, he was still filling theatres -  this was comedy that was broad, silly and brilliantly judged.  He could be slightly saucy but knew exactly how to deliver it to his family audience. Standing in the wings would be his fiancee Anne, checking off the jokes to ensure that people were getting something relatively fresh. Obituary: Sir Ken Dodd His life in pictures 'Don't call me eccentric' Then, even once the show was over, he would still be found backstage holding court, signing autographs and telling yet more jokes.  As I said, big portions. This was industrial-sized comedy for a world before Benidorm and the long decline of the industrial north. In the '60s, the playwright John Osborne took actors from the Royal Court to see him to show how comedy was done. Prime Minister Harold Wilson was also once seen in the audience. And in a fascinating interview with Ken Dodd on the BBC's Late Night Line-Up, he was asked about the other big thing in the comedy at the time, the satire boom. He was scathing.  It was, he said, the difference between wit and humour.  Wit, he felt, was barbed, with something unpleasant. Humour was about bringing people together. Ken Dodd was always on the side of humour.

"A suspected link between abnormal breast growth in young boys and the use of lavender and tea tree oils has been given new weight, after a study found eight chemicals contained in the oils interfere with hormones. Gynaecomastia is rare, and there is often no obvious cause. But there have been a number ofcases,externallinked to use of these essential oils. The American study found that key chemicals in the oils boost oestrogen and inhibit testosterone. Not everyone will have the same reaction to an essential oil. The plant-derived oils are found in a number of products such as soaps, lotions, shampoos and hair-styling products. They're also popular as alternative cleaning products and medical treatments. Lead researcher J. Tyler Ramsey from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), in North Carolina, suggested caution when using the oils. ""Our society deems essential oils as safe. However, they possess a diverse amount of chemicals and should be used with caution because some of these chemicals are potential endocrine disruptors."" A growing number of reported cases of male gynaecomastia have coincided with topical exposure to the oils. After they stopped using the products, the symptoms subsided. A previous study,externalby Dr Kenneth Korach - who was also co-investigator for this study - found that lavender and tea tree oil had properties that competed with or hindered the hormones that control male characteristics, which could affect puberty and growth. The new study looked at eight key chemicals from the hundreds that make up the oils. Four of the tested chemicals appear in both oils and the others were in either oil. They were tested on human cancer cells in the laboratory to measure the changes. The researchers found all eight demonstrated varying degrees of promoting oestrogen and/or inhibiting testosterone properties. ""Lavender oil and tea tree oil pose potential environmental health concerns and should be investigated further,"" said Mr Ramsey. Many of the chemicals tested appear in at least 65 other essential oils, which is of concern, he added. Precautions should be observed when using essential oils since they are highly concentrated Do not apply undiluted essential oils directly to the skin Never use undiluted oils on children under the age of three If you are pregnant you should seek the advice of your doctor, midwife before using essential oils When used appropriately, essential oils and aromatherapy products are safe for all the family Source: Aromatherapy Trade Council Prof Ieuan Hughes, emeritus professor of paediatrics at the University of Cambridge said the findings ""have confirmed why an individual using such oils containing these chemicals may develop breast tissue"". ""The anti-male hormone effects are rather unexpected and it is not possible to comment further without the data. ""Of course, not everyone exposing themselves to such oils has adverse effects, so it is possible there are particular individuals who may be more sensitive to the effects of the chemicals, or perhaps are using the products in excess. He said attention should be given to better regulation of these products. Prof Hughes added: ""Clearly, the longer-term effects of such exposure are unknown."" Dr Rod Mitchell, honorary consultant paediatric endocrinologist at the Queens Medical Research Institute in Edinburgh said the study ""is important in establishing a possible mechanism for the suggested link between gynaecomastia and exposure to lavender and tea tree oils"". ""However, there are important factors that must be taken into account when interpreting these results. The tests are conducted in cancer cells, which may not represent the situation in normal breast tissue. ""The concentration (dose) to which the cells are exposed may not be equivalent to exposure in humans. There is a complex relationship between oestrogen, testosterone and other hormones in the body, that cannot be replicated in these experiments."" He called for further larger studies. ""At present, there is insufficient evidence to support the concept that exposure to lavender and tea tree oil containing products cause gynaecomastia in children, and further epidemiological and experimental studies are required."" The study results will be presented on 19 March at the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in Chicago.

"This video can not be played BBC Radio 1Xtra DJ Reece Parkinson posted footage from the scene on Twitter At least 13 people have been injured after a man drove a car into a busy nightclub. Police were called at 23:47 GMT on Saturday after a Suzuki Vitara drove into Blake's in Gravesend, Kent. It is believed the driver had been asked to leave the club in Queen Street after an earlier altercation. A witness has described ""a complete mess of panic and chaos"". A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Kent Police said several of those hurt have suffered broken bones. As well as the 13 confirmed injured, officers believe several others may have left the scene. Seven people were taken to hospital, four with minor injuries and three with serious but not life-threatening injuries, the ambulance service added. Police said the driver of the vehicle suffered minor injuries and was taken to hospital as a precaution but is currently in custody. Det Ch Insp David Chewter said: ""This was a frightening experience for everyone involved and it is a miracle that nobody was killed."" Clubbers reported hearing a ""massive bang"" as the car crashed into the club Witnesses said a 4x4 had been driven into a tented area full of people. It is believed the car drove along an alleyway alongside the club before crashing into it. Chloe Germaney, 18, said she heard a ""massive bang"" before seeing the 4x4 ""driving into the club through the gates into the lounge, running people over"". She said security shouted for people to run, adding: ""Everyone ran for their lives back into the club, we got locked in, nobody knew what was going on. ""At that point I text my loved ones saying I've been in an incident and that I love them because I thought I wasn't going to make it out alive."" Ms Germaney said she has had flashbacks and ""feels so paranoid I can't even step outside"". There is a police presence at Blake's nightclub while investigations continue Footage posted on social media appeared to show a car inside a tented area with people being led to safety by police. BBC Radio 1Xtra DJ Reece Parkinson, who was in the club at the time, told BBC Newsbeat he initially thought it was a terror attack. He said: ""We heard screaming, turned around and saw a big 4x4 come in the room. ""We ran to the back and I was waiting to hear bullets or something, but thank God there wasn't. ""As soon as he [car driver] stopped people were throwing stuff at the car, they dragged him out, people were hitting him. He looked unconscious."" Three police cars, two from the forensic investigation team, are parked outside Blake's nightclub this morning. Staff from the club occasionally come outside, still appearing to be visibly shocked. Two broken wing mirrors lie in an alleyway between the club and the market next-door which is cordoned off. A tent at the far end of the alleyway is too far away to see the damage clearly. Jade Keepin, 18, said she saw a ""car in the middle of the floor that security had surrounded"". ""I saw a person smash the back window of the car with his elbow and people began throwing stuff at the car. It was manic."" Sonny Powar said he saw two people get hit by the car before the driver was pulled from the vehicle. ""[A man] drove his 4x4 into the tent we was all in and ran people over, it stopped at my feet so any further and I could have died. Then he reversed up and we all ran,"" he added. ""We ripped the tent wall apart and got out and called the police. It was a complete mess of panic and chaos."" It is believed the car drove along an alleyway alongside the club In a statement, Blake's nightclub thanked the ""heroic actions"" of door staff and guests who it said apprehended the man ""before further harm was caused"". The club said it was ""deeply saddened that injuries occurred"" but was ""grateful that no-one was fatally hurt"". It added: ""We strive to create a safe and positive environment for all. Last night however, the unpredictable actions of one individual ruined a great occasion for all."" Gravesham Borough Council praised the response of the emergency services in a tweet.

Kent Fire and Rescue Service and five South East Coast Ambulance Service crews also attended the scene. Det Ch Insp Chewter said: ""We believe there are likely to be further casualties who perhaps left the club during the panic and we would like to hear from them."" He also urged anyone who was in the club at the time or anyone with photos or original video footage to get in touch. Kent Police said it was not being treated as a terror-related incident.

"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital The Czech Republic has rejected Russian claims that it was one of four countries most likely to have manufactured the nerve agent used to poison Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Czech Foreign Minister Martin Stropnicky said this was ""wholly unsubstantiated"" and ""highly speculative"". The ex-spy and his daughter Yulia remain critically ill in hospital. They were found unconscious on a bench in southern England on 4 March. The UK government says they were poisoned with a nerve agent of a type developed by Russia called Novichok. The Russian government denies any involvement in the attack. Mr Stropnicky was responding to claims made by Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. She had said the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the UK and Sweden were most likely to have produced Novichok, the nerve agent identified in the Skripal case - and which the UK government says originated in Russia. They were the ones carrying out ""intense research"" on the substances from the late 1990s until now, she alleged. What are Novichok nerve agents? Police warning to Russian exiles in UK Mr Stropnicky tweeted: ""We must protest at the claims of the origins of Novichok, which are wholly unsubstantiated. ""This is a classic way of manipulating information in the public space; releasing a highly speculative claim with no proof whatsoever. ""This information already appeared several days ago on the disinformation website Sputnik."" Meanwhile, Russia is to expel 23 British diplomats as the row over the attack on the Skripals continues. The Russian foreign ministry said the UK staff would be expelled from Moscow within a week in response to Britain's decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats.

"Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin For nearly two years the Trump-Russia affair has dominated front pages and mired the president's administration in conflict and controversy. But what is it exactly? How did it begin? And what did it find out? The inquiry, led by widely respected former director of the FBI Robert Mueller, focused on alleged collusion between Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign team and Moscow. The report stated that no evidence of a conspiracy was found, but it did lay out 10 instances where the president possibly obstructed justice. Mr Mueller has said his report did not exonerate the president, but that charging a sitting president was not an option. Here's a breakdown on one of the most high-profile political inquiries in US history. Mr Trump's campaign and transition teams were accused of conspiring with Russian agents to influence the US election in the then Republican candidate's favour. US intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scales of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. Both the Russian and US presidents had poured scorn on suggestions of ""collusion"", with Mr Trump calling it ""the greatest political witch hunt in history"". At least 17 Trump associates had contacts with Russians or Wikileaks, which released hacked documents, during the campaign or transition, according toan analysis of public records by the New York Times,external, with at least 100 face-to-face interactions, phone calls or electronic messages with Russians or Kremlin-linked figures and at least 51 individual communications. Trump aides known to have had contact with Russians include the president's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, his son Donald Trump Jr, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The president's supporters point out that interactions with foreign nationals are routine during any White House campaign, but three Trump associates have now admitted lying about these encounters. The special counsel has indicted more than 30 people, including four members of Mr Trump's campaign team or administration, an adviser and long-time ally, and 26 Russians, as well as three Russian companies. A former prosecutor, Mr Mueller went on to become the second-longest serving FBI director in history, after J Edgar Hoover. His Senate confirmation vote as FBI director went 98-0 in his favour. A special Senate vote to extend his term beyond the usual 10 years to 12 passed 100-0. With a team of experienced lawyers drawn from private practice and from the Department of Justice, as well as FBI officers, Mr Mueller worked quietly from an unassuming building in south-west Washington, not issuing any public comment during the investigation. What is a special counsel? America's most mysterious public figure On 22 March, he submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr, who replaced Jeff Sessions after he was forced to resign. The448-page report,externalpainted a mixed picture of the president's conduct. While it did not establish that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to meddle in the election, it built an extensive obstruction-of-justice case against the president. Mr Mueller said the report did not exonerate the president but stopped short of saying Mr Trump committed a crime. Eight new things in the Mueller report ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" It also revealed Mr Trump instructed a White House lawyer to try and remove Mr Mueller over alleged ""conflicts of interest"", but the lawyer resigned. Around 10% of the public report is redacted. As well as the special counsel inquiry by Mr Mueller under the aegis of the justice department there have been four congressional investigations: The Senate and House Intelligence Committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee are investigating alleged Kremlin meddling and any collusion with Trump aides The House Oversight Committee is scrutinising links between Trump associates and Russian officials The Judiciary Committee has issued more than 80 document requests in a broad probe that goes beyond alleged contacts between the campaign and Moscow Meanwhile federal prosecutors at the Southern District of New York and in Washington are looking at other areas related to Russia All of the House inquiries were plagued by political squabbling amongst lawmakers, and closed without leading to any charges or claims of Russian collusion. Democrats have reopened the investigations after gaining a majority in the House in January. The Senate committee has yet to release its findings. Before the redacted report was released, Mr Barr, who was attorney general under the late George HW Bush between 1991 and 1993, spent two days poring over Mr Mueller's report beforeissuing his interpretation to Congress. There was a lot of speculation that an obstruction of justice legal case against the president could be considered. One of the possibilities raised was that it could look into Mr Trump's sacking of James Comey as head of the FBI. But legal experts had warned that the charge carried a fairly high threshold - proof of ""corrupt intent"". In his summary, Mr Barr says, quoting Mr Mueller's report: ""The special counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him'."" Mr Barr then says that, after consulting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, there was insufficient evidence ""to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence"". Mr Mueller gave a rare statement in May about the investigation, and announced his office was officially shutting down. His statement largely reaffirmed what was in the report released with redactions last month. He said if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump ""clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so"". Mr Mueller added that ""the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process. The special counsel said he did not believe it was ""appropriate to speak further"" about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team's report. But the end of the special counsel investigation does not mark the end of the story. The former FBI director will face questions from two congressional committees about his report on the Donald Trump campaign and Russia. The congressional probes could stretch into 2020 and several of the prosecutions Mr Mueller initiated could be continued by lawyers within the Department of Justice. This video can not be played What to expect from Mueller hearings Mr Barr has said that it is his objective to get as much information to Congress and the public as possible, consistent with prosecutorial guidelines and confidentiality requirements. Democrats in Congress have called for whatever information Mr Mueller produces to be released publicly in its entirety. Back in February 2017, before Mr Mueller was appointed as special counsel, the FBI was investigating Michael Flynn over his contacts with Russian officials. Then-head of the FBI, Mr Comey, attended a briefing in the Oval Office at the White House, along with Vice-President Mike Pence and Mr Sessions. According to a detailed account of the meeting written by Mr Comey immediately afterwards, the president asked Mr Pence and Mr Sessions to leave the room before suggesting Mr Comey end the Flynn investigation. The FBI director's notes quote the president as saying: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" Mr Comey prepared memos from his notes and shared them with other senior FBI officials, saying he was concerned about the nature of the meeting. A few months later, in May, the president sacked Mr Comey, citing ""this Russia thing"", a move that shocked Washington and led to talk of a cover-up. Part of the inquiry focuses on a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City involving Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. The meeting occurred after a Russian intermediary contacted Mr Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would ""incriminate"" Hillary Clinton - the Democratic candidate - and be ""very useful to your father"". It was part of the Russian government's ""support"" for Mr Trump, he noted. Mr Trump Jr replied: ""I love it."" Mr Trump Jr later defended the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya offered only ""inane nonsense"" and nothing came of it, but he also told Fox News' Sean Hannity ""in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently"". In an initial statement to explain the meeting one year after it occurred, Mr Trump Jr claimed that it had been held to discuss Russian adoptions. But in a follow-up statement he said that the actual purpose had been about political opposition research. In June 2018 Mr Trump tweeted that the meeting was ""to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics"". President Trump's lawyers say he dictated his son's first misleading explanation, leading to questions of whether the president sought to obstruct a Department of Justice inquiry. See our fullRussia timeline. The arrest of Mr Stone, a long-time adviser and close confidant to Mr Trump, marks a significant development in this legal drama. The charges against him are linked to an alleged Russian-led hack into the emails of Democratic Party officials. Mr Stone denies suggestions of criminal misconduct. The information contained in the emails was released by Wikileaks during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Stone: Trump ally, political strategist and Nixon fan It means that, for the first time, a member of Mr Trump's inner circle is facing charges directly related to Russian election meddling. Mr Papadopoulos's role in the drama begins with a May 2016 drink in a London bar with an Australian diplomat. He told the envoy that Russia had ""political dirt"" on Hillary Clinton - a conversation which was later reported by Australian authorities to the FBI and may have prompted the bureau's investigation into the campaign. In late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Mr Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. He falsely claimed he had met two figures with Russian connections before joining the Trump campaign in March 2016. In fact, he met them after joining the campaign. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. Emails reveal that he communicated with high-level figures in the Trump campaign. He was pictured in March 2016 seated at a foreign policy meeting with Mr Trump, Jeff Sessions and others, in a photo Mr Trump shared on Twitter. Just before he began a two-week sentence in a Wisconsin prison in late November 2018 however, he sent a tweet saying he had ""never met a single Russian official"". On his release, he announced he was publishing a book entitled ""Deep State Target: How I got caught in the crosshairs of the plot to bring down President Trump"". In January 2017, a secret dossier was leaked to the press. It had been compiled by a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, Christopher Steele, who had been paid to investigate Mr Trump's ties to Russia. The dossier alleged Moscow had compromising material on Mr Trump, including claims he was once recorded with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel during a 2013 trip for one of his Miss Universe pageants. Mr Trump emphatically denies this. The file purported to show financial and personal links between Mr Trump, his advisers and Moscow. It also suggested the Kremlin had cultivated Mr Trump for years before he ran for president. Mr Trump dismissed the dossier, arguing its contents were based largely on unnamed sources. It was later reported that Mr Steele's report was funded as opposition research by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Fusion GPS, the Washington-based firm that was hired to commission the dossier, had previously been paid via a conservative website to dig up dirt on Mr Trump. It didn't, exactly. Hacking voter machines, and rigging elections generally, is very, very difficult. Hacking people? That would be easier. The special counsel charges show that Russia effectively ran a two-pronged operation. The first prong in mid-2016 allegedly involved sending rafts of so-called ""phishing"" emails to figures in the Democratic Party - an unsophisticated method used by everyone from state-sponsored actors to low-level scammers for duping people into giving up their passwords. Hackers gained access to the Democratic National Committee's systems and the personal email of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. They leaked tens of thousands of emails revealing the inner workings of the Clinton campaign and the party's operations, along with mundane, embarrassing details. The second prong allegedly involved flooding social media networks, especially Facebook, with bogus stories designed to smear the Democrats and undermine the Clinton campaign. According to testimony by Facebook before Congress, Russia-backed content reached as many as 126 million Americans on the social network during and after election. In August 2016, an envelope arrived at the White House marked for the eyes of President Barack Obama and three senior aides. According to theWashington Post,external, the envelope had come by courier from the CIA, and contained a bombshell revelation - Mr Putin was directing a state-sponsored effort to interfere with the US election. The FBI was already looking at ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, but the CIA memo seemed to confirm Russian efforts to throw the election Mr Trump's way. According to reporting in the Post and elsewhere, the Obama administration agonised over whether to divulge the alleged operations. Reportedly fearful of appearing to attempt to interfere politically, they stayed relatively quiet. Other intelligence agencies were slow in reaching the same conclusion as the CIA, and congressional Republicans were reluctant to offer support to a public condemnation of Moscow. Warnings were issued to Russian officials, but it wasn't until the main US intelligence agencies agreed, in late September, that President Obama directed them to make a public statement. To avoid appearing partisan, the statement would not carry his name. The president is celebrating the findings of the special counsel's report revealed by Mr Barr, but there are a variety of ongoing investigations into Mr Trump's conduct and that of his businesses. Several of them pose a legitimate threat to the president, both legal and political. However, it is effectively impossible to bring criminal charges against a sitting president, and any case would have to be brought by the executive branch, of which Mr Trump is the boss. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? As for impeachment, it remains unlikely at this stage. A majority in the House of Representatives is first required to approve an article of impeachment, and the Democratic leaders in that chamber appear reluctant to make such a move until the multiple investigations are concluded. In the event of a successful House vote, the Senate holds a trial presided over by the Supreme Court chief justice, and a two-thirds majority vote is required in the Senate to convict the president. That's a high bar - two presidents, Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, have been acquitted at this stage. With a Republican majority in the 100-seat Senate, at least 19 members of Mr Trump's own party would have to break ranks to remove him from office.

"It was more gripping than any box set we could get our hands on. Over two years, the investigations into Russian interference in the US election, and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin, delivered daily developments and drama worthy of anything seen in House of Cards. In the end, 35 people and three companies were charged by Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. Here's our guide to the main characters in the four seasons of the only political drama that mattered. This was the season in which Donald Trump, the reality TV star, took centre stage in his own political drama by launching a presidential campaign. He was supported by his family and got the attention of the Russians. The season ended with a cliffhanger - could Trump the outsider actually win?! It's been a while since all of this happened, so let's remind you of the key players in this season. Who was he?Donald Trump, the billionaire candidate (who by Season Three is the 45th president of the United States). If you really need a refresher,here's his life story. Key plot lineAs Donald Trump was busy traversing the country canvassing for votes in Season One, Russia hacked into the emails of his Democratic rivals, investigators later said. The question is why? Was the Kremlin trying to alter the outcome of the election, and what did Trump and his campaign know? Skip forward to the end of Season Four and Mr Trump stood triumphant before reporters in a Florida airport, celebrating what he called ""a complete and total exoneration"". But in between, there was no shortage of drama or tension. Who was he?He was Trump's campaign chairman before being forced to quit over his ties to Russian oligarchs and Ukraine. Key plot lineHe was one of the biggest dominoes to fall. When he ended up being arrested, it was a big season-ending shocker. Manafort hung around a bit in Season One, but then disappeared from view for a while. He quit the campaign after being accused of having links to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine. He also sat in on a crucial meeting with a Russian lawyer who may have been trying to feed the Trump team classified information (more on that later). After an FBI raid on his home in Season Three, Manafort was found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud, and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts and is sentenced to 47 months in prison. In Season Four, he agreed to co-operate with a special counsel inquiry in exchange for a reduced prison term. But then, in a twist - prosecutors claimed he breached his plea bargain by repeatedly lying to the FBI. Read more:The man who helped Trump win Who was he?The president's eldest child, who it emerged met some questionable Russians. Key plot lineDonald Trump Jr's role in this unfolding saga all came down to a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer, which was set up by a music publicist (the full details of which come out in Season Three). If it sounds random, then in many ways it is. The publicist, Rob Goldstone, offered Trump Jr a meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, promising him dirt on Hillary Clinton. This meeting was the key to much of our plot line because it raised several key questions. Did this amount to the campaign colluding with a foreign government? Why did he agree to the meeting? What happened at the meeting was the scene investigators played over and over again as they tried to work out if there was any impropriety. In the end, no collusion charges were brought. Read more:Trump Jr's habit for making headlines DonaldTrumpconfounded his critics by winningthe presidency.But the transition was as gripping as the season before it as Trump picked his cabinet, introducing key characters to the mix. The season ended with Trump taking the oath of office on a cold January morning - but there were more twists to come. Who was he?The granite-faced former general who later became the shortest-serving member of Donald Trump's cabinet. He resigned after not being honest about his contact with a Russian official - and was later charged with making false statements to the FBI. Key plot lineFlynn was appointed national security adviser just days after the election, against the advice of then-President Obama, who warned Trump not to hire him. Flynn's starring role came in December 2016, just before Trump was sworn in, when he spoke to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. The Washington Post and New York Times said the men discussed Russian sanctions, and that Flynn later lied to the Vice President Mike Pence about the conversation (Mr Kislyak says the men discussed only ""simple things""). The substance of those talks eventually led to Flynn being prosecuted as part of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. At the end of Season Three, in December 2017,Flynn pleaded guiltyto making ""false, fictitious and fraudulent statements"" to the FBI about what he and Kislyak discussed. With that, the investigation reached Trump's inner circle. Read more:Out after 23 days - who is Michael Flynn? Who was he?Many roads in this drama led back to Sergei Kislyak, the jolly and charismatic figure, who up until July 2017 wasthe Russian ambassador to Washington. Key plot lineKislyak's role in this drama remained unclear up to the end - but many of the players in this drama had meetings with him, and that put them in awkward spots. The key questions for investigators were: why were they drawn to him, and what was said? The Russian ambassador spoke to both Flynn and Attorney-General Jeff Sessions - meetings which both Trump officials didn't initially acknowledge took place. Anything else we should know? Well, Russia fiercely fought back against claims on CNN that Kislyak was a ""top spy and recruiter of spies"". Who was he?Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III hovered in the background during Season One, when he was an Alabama senator and a trusted Trump adviser, but we really got to know him during Season Two, when he became Trump's nominee for attorney general, a job he kept for almost two years. Key plot lineSessions was one of several Trump aides to meet Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and question marks emerged over the nature of those meetings. When the FBI investigation focused on the Trump campaign, Sessions stood down from the inquiry, much to Trump's irritation. That decision to step down dogged him to the end, and he was written out of the series close to the end of Season Four, when Trump forced him to resign. That move put control of the Mueller investigation into the hands of a Trump loyalist. Read more:An attorney general dogged by scandal This was where the drama really picked up and all the plot lines came together. A lot of the background characters we saw in Season One came back with a vengeance and the infighting got nasty - and this is when the police started circling. Who was she?A Russian lawyer with a fearsome reputation who fought against US restrictions on Russia. But was she a Kremlin stooge? Despite earlier denials, she admitted in April 2018 to being an ""informant"" for Russia's prosecutor general. Key plot lineHers was a small but crucial role - she's the one who Manafort, Trump Jr and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met in June 2016, the details of which begin trickling out a year later in a flashback sequence. She said the meeting was to discuss adoptions - but those who helped set it up said she was offering dirt on the Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign. While the meeting became a central plot point, whatever happened inside never actually led to any charges. That meeting would never have happened without... Who were they?Emin Agalarov is Azerbaijan's biggest pop star, of course. Have you not heard Love is a Deadly Game? Emin helped bring Donald Trump's Miss Universe competition to Russia and the two are close enough tosend each other birthday messages,external. His dad, Aras, is a billionaire who mixes in the highest circles of influence in Moscow. Key plot lineAgain in a flashback scene, we met Emin as he set the wheels in motion on that Trump Jr meeting. An email sent to Trump Jr suggested Emin was offering information on the Democrats (Emin said he wasn't). The email also said Aras Agalarov had apparently met the ""crown prosecutor"" of Russia - a role that weirdly didn't exist - and got information on Hillary Clinton. Are you keeping up? Read more:The tough-talking networker Who was he?He became deputy attorney general under Jeff Sessions. In the TV drama of the Russia scandal, this is the sort of role that would go to a solid Broadway actor you recognise but can't put a name to. Key plot lineWhen Sessions stood down from leading the main investigation into the Trump-Russia ties, it fell to Rosenstein to do that job. In a major plot development, he appointed a special investigator - not a popular move with the White House. Read more:Who is Rod Rosenstein? Who was he?Married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, Kushner was the character who was seen but very rarely heard. Key plot lineAmid cries of nepotism, he was given a plum White House job as senior adviser to the president with a wide-ranging portfolio. It was his contacts with the Russians during the election campaign and beyond that led investigators to circle him. In June 2016, Kushner attended THAT meeting with Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer. He said he was so bored he messaged his assistant to call him so he could leave. Kushner was also another character who had repeated contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak - contact that he initially failed to disclose. Read more:The son-in-law with Trump's ear Who was he?A British former tabloid journalist, with a penchant for selfies in silly hats, was perhaps an unlikely addition to the cast, but in most good dramas there's always room for the slightly out-of-place eccentric. Key plot lineRob Goldstone found his way into Donald Trump's circle of trust thanks to his connections with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov. Goldstone managed the pop star, and it was he who contacted Donald Trump Jr on behalf of his client to set up that now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. Goldstone sent an email to Trump Jr promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Read more:The Music Man with a love for hats Who was he?At 6ft 8in, James Comey was a towering figure, the character who gave little away about himself personally but had a huge role in this story. Key plot lineHe first entered this drama in Season One, when as head of the FBI he reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails - just weeks before the election. Democrats blamed him for her loss, Republicans hailed him a hero. That, we thought, was the last we'd seen of him. Jump ahead to Season Three, when months into the Trump presidency, Comey was fired by the new president. In true television drama style, he learned of his sacking as he was watching TV news during a trip to LA. Up to then, Comey was heading up an investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Even by the end of the series, whether this amounted to obstruction of justice by the president remained an unresolved plot point. Comey's testimony to the Senate was one of the most set-pieces in the series up to this point, as  - under oath - he told politicians he was asked to pledge loyalty to the president, but refused. Read more:The FBI director who took centre stage Who was he?A former election adviser to Trump, although you'd be forgiven if you didn't remember the face. He was in only a few scenes in Season Two, but he had a massive role to play in Season Three, becoming the first person to plead guilty as part of the investigation. Key plot lineIn late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. His guilty plea and co-operation with the investigation had the potential to damage the US leader because it related directly to his campaign - but in the end, it didn't do so. Read more:Why Papadopoulos case matters Who was he?The man who held the fate of the Trump presidency in his hands. Key plot lineSome characters wielded a lot of power, but didn't have a starring role, such as Robert Mueller, the tall chiselled figure who was appointed as ""special counsel"" to take over the Russia investigation after the dismissal of James Comey. Mueller came from the same stock as Comey - both were former heads of the FBI. There were no showboating scenes and powerhouses speeches from Mueller in this series - we only ever saw him studiously working in his office. There were reports that the president considered firing Mueller at one point - but Mueller stayed in the background doing his job until the very end of the series. After Season Three ended with the first charges being laid down by Robert Mueller, things really sped up in Season Four.The president's fury with the special counsel investigation increased and he fired his Attorney-General. But the series ended with no charges laid against the president and a sense of victory in the White House. Might we see a spin-off series...? Who was he?OK, he wasn't Putin's chef by this point, but he once was. In Season Four, he was the man accused of spearheading Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election. Key plot lineA little out of the blue, Mueller announced charges against Prigozhin and 12 other Russians, accusing them of tampering with the US election by (among other things) organising and promoting political rallies in the US. In one surreal flashback sequence, we even see the Russians trying to buy a cage large enough to hold an actress dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison costume. Read more:Seven key takeaways from indictment Who was he?The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump - but who instead turned against him. Key plot lineCohen, as Trump's long-time personal lawyer, lingered around the edges of the plot for the first three seasons, but became the big player of the fourth. When Mueller's team began looking into Cohen's finances, they passed on their concerns to investigators in New York. Then the plot took an unexpected new turn: Cohen, a long-time Trump loyalist, flipped and began co-operating with investigators. Not only that, but he ended up giving them a lot of help in exchange for a lighter sentence. Cohen ended up admitting violating campaign finance laws, committing tax evasion and lying to Congress. The last shot of the entire series was a mournful Cohen being locked into his jail cell. Who was he?A long-time Washington political operative who acted as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign. He called himself an agent provocateur, and once defended his actions by saying: ""One man's dirty trick is another man's political, civic action."" Key plot lineStone was one of those memorable bit-part characters in Seasons One and Two - a colourful character known for his fiery tongue, sharp suits and the Richard Nixon tattoo spread across his back. Towards the end of Season One, he appeared to let the cat out of the bag, hinting on Twitter that there was damaging information coming out on Hillary Clinton. Soon after, that information (that we later learned was found by Russia) was made public. After a bit of a lull in the middle of Season Four, investigators indicted Stone on seven counts of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements, although he wasn't charged with co-ordinating with Russia. All the way through, he denied any wrongdoing. He, like the president, called the investigation a ""witch-hunt"" and once said the accusations of collusion with Russia were ""a steaming plate of bull"".

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will never tolerate a threat to the life of British citizens and others on British soil"" Russia is to expel 23 British diplomats in a row over the nerve agent attack on an-ex spy and his daughter in the UK. The Russian foreign ministry said the UK staff would be expelled from Moscow within a week in response to Britain's decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats. It also said it would close the British Council in Russia, which promotes cultural ties between the nations, and the British Consulate in St Petersburg. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain critically ill in hospital. They were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire on 4 March. The UK government says they were poisoned with a nerve agent of a type developed by Russia called Novichok - the Russian government denies any involvement in the attack. Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK government would consider its next steps ""in the coming days, alongside our allies and partners"". What we know so far What happens when you expel a diplomat? Why does UK think it was Russia? ""We will never tolerate a threat to the life of British citizens and others on British soil from the Russian government,"" she added. The British Council, the UK's international organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities,said it was ""profoundly disappointed"" at being told to cease operations in Russia.,external BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said the move was significant because the Council fosters people-to-people relationships and, as it serves young people, could be crucial for the UK's relationship with a post-Putin Russia. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Meanwhile, counter-terrorism police have renewed their appeal for witnesses who may have seen Mr Skripal's burgundy BMW car in Salisbury on 4 March. Neil Basu, Met Police Assistant Commissioner, said: ""We are learning more about Sergei and Yulia's movements but we need to be clearer around their exact movements on the morning of the incident."" Police believe the car - registration plate HD09 WAO - may have been in the areas of London Road, Churchill Way North and Wilton Road at about 09:15 GMT. At about 13:30 GMT it was seen being driven down Devizes Road towards the centre of town. Mr Basu said investigators were making good progress but further work could take ""months"". He added that the continued presence of officers in the area wearing specialist protective clothing was a precaution and that the risk to the public was low. Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who was part of the initial response to the incident, remains in a serious but stable condition in hospital after being exposed to the chemical. Britain's ambassador to Russia, Laurie Bristow, was summoned to Russia's foreign ministry on Saturday morning, where he was informed of Moscow's decision. Following the meeting, Mr Bristow said the UK had no quarrel with the Russian people and would ""always do what is necessary to defend ourselves"". This video can not be played Ambassador Laurie Bristow: ""We will always do what is necessary to defend ourselves"" By Sarah Rainsford, BBC Moscow correspondent The British ambassador had been expecting this call for three days. In the end, he spent just over 10 minutes in the foreign ministry where he was handed Russia's counter-sanctions. The response from Moscow is robust and does go further than the UK measures. But it doesn't appear calculated to escalate tensions. The ministry has stuck to 23 for 23 in terms of diplomatic expulsions, no more. And while it is ordering the closure of the UK consulate in St Petersburg - both Moscow and Ekaterinburg remain open. Russia's response has also targeted the British Council, which promotes cultural ties. That will be seen by Britain as a low blow, hurting the Russian people - not the British government. But the UK is unlikely to want to retaliate in kind. The council's activity here had already been significantly curtailed by Moscow after the last crisis in relations, whenAlexander Litvinenko was poisoned. Meanwhile, the double tactic of denial and distraction here continues, both in comments by officials, and in the mocking, dismissive coverage of the Skripal case on state-run media. The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement that the British diplomats would be ""declared persona non grata"", adding that it ""reserves the right to introduce other retaliatory measures in case of further unfriendly actions"". It said it was responding to ""provocative actions"" and ""unproven accusations"" by Britain. Russia's UK embassy tweeted a picture of a reception held to thank staff being expelled from Britain Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also said that the most likely source of the nerve agent was Britain, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden or the United States. Speaking to state-owned Russian news channel Rossiya 24, she said those countries, not Russia, had been intensively testing the substance since the 1990s. Czech foreign minister Martin Stropnicky rejected the claims as ""unsubstantiated"" and ""a classic way of manipulating information in the public space"". Swedish foreign minister Margot Wallstrom tweeted: ""Forcefully reject unacceptable and unfounded allegation"" and added,  ""Russia should answer UK questions instead."" Meanwhile, the Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, hosted a reception at the Russian embassy in London for the diplomats who are being expelled from the UK. 'Arsenal fans will be safe in Moscow' Conspiracy theories and denial in Russia What are Novichok agents and what do they do?

Elsewhere, the Met Police have launched a murder investigation into the death of businessman and Kremlin critic Nikolai Glushkov - aRussian exile who was found deadin his south-London home on Monday. A post-mortem examination found the 68-year-old died from ""compression to the neck"". Police say there is no evidence at this stage linking his case with the Salisbury attack. However, they have begun to contact a number of Russian exiles to discuss their safety. Russia has also opened criminal investigations into ""the murder"" of Mr Glushkov, and the ""attempted murder"" of Ms Skripal.

"This video can not be played Cliff-top homes at Hemsby could fall into the sea, police have warned Residents of 10 seaside chalets ""perilously close"" to the edge of cliffs have been evacuated as high winds and waves threaten their homes. Norfolk Police said earlier that six of the properties at Hemsby had ""a very good chance"" of going into the sea. In 2013, tidal storms saw three homes in the village washed away. Hemsby Lifeboat warned high tides due on Saturday evening and easterly 48mph (77km/h) gusts could do similar damage. BBC reporter Robby West at the scene said police had closed part of the coast road and the exposed foundations of one property, previously metres from the cliff top, could be seen. Beachy Head cliff visitors 'shocked' by rock fall photos WATCH: Sidmouth cliff-top houses losing gardens to erosion Norfolk Police and the parish council have been advising people to keep away from the beach and the dunes. However, Maurice Broom, who lives in one of the threatened properties, said he intended to stay overnight to look after his pets. ""I had 90 metres between me and the sea when I first came here only two years ago, and now I've only got nine feet,"" he added. An aerial picture shows just how close one chalet was to the cliff-top ahead of Saturday's high winds Officers had earlier warned residents of the 10 occupied properties, telling them to pack a bag in case they had to leave at short notice.

This chalet was just a few feet from the cliff edge on Saturday morning Sgt Ben Millican, of Norfolk Police, said 13 properties in total were at risk, 10 of them occupied. ""Six of them have got a very good chance of going into the sea if the weather conditions stay as they are with the high tides coming back in the evening,"" he said. A UK Power Networks team is disconnecting power to the homes and lifeboat crews are helping people evacuate. They believe five homes are at risk, but the harsh winds are making everyone's jobs harder. The Hemsby Lifeboat team have told me waves are breaking halfway up the dune, causing sand to be washed away. They believe it's a matter of ""when"" for some of the properties, not ""if"".

"This video can not be played Ireland celebrate Grand Slam win with victory over England 2018 Six Nations England (5) 15 Tries:Daly 2, May Ireland (21) 24 Tries:Ringrose, Stander, Stockdale,Cons:Sexton 2, CarberyPen:Murray Ireland thumped England on St Patrick's Day to win only the third Grand Slam in their history in thrilling fashion. First-half tries from Garry Ringrose, CJ Stander and Jacob Stockdale lit up a snowy Twickenham as Joe Schmidt's men opened up a 21-5 lead despite having Peter O'Mahony in the sin bin. A double from Elliot Daly and Jonny May's try with the clock in the red at the end of the game brought only faint consolation for the home side on another chastening afternoon for Eddie Jones. Clinical with their chances, composed on an afternoon of immense pressure, Ireland were fully deserving of their triumph. Schmidt hails Irish 'class and courage' 'An incredible achievement' - Hickie This video can not be played Six Nations 2018: Ireland beat England to win Grand Slam - highlights This team now joins the heroes of 1948 and 2009, their thrilling blend of experience and youth a class above their northern hemisphere rivals. England had won 14 matches on the bounce at Twickenham but their poor Six Nations went from disappointing to disastrous under a green-shirted onslaught. Not since the dark days of 2006 have they lost three matches in a single Six Nations campaign, and with Scotland beating Italy and Wales beating France in the late kick-off, they eventually finished fifth in the table for the first time. *Ireland are awarded three bonus points for winning the Grand Slam Ireland got off to a wonderful start when Anthony Watson, challenged by Rob Kearney, spilled a testing high kick sent into the snow by Sexton and Ringrose dived on the loose ball as it bobbled over the try line. England had the chance to hit back but opted to put a kickable penalty to the corner and then had their rolling maul held up. It was Fields of Athenry that was ringing through the freezing air rather than Swing Low and it was Ireland who came again on the pitch, Bundee Aki on the left wing dropping a Kearney pass eight metres out with only a scrambling Jonny May ahead of him. Sexton hit the post with a penalty from distance but straight in front and England were relieved not to be 10 points down. The let-off was short-lived. Aki smashed through the English midfield after sweet hands from prop Tadgh Furlong and a flat pass to his left found CJ Stander charging on to slide at the line and touch the ball against the base of the left post for a try given after confirmation from the TMO. From in front Sexton converted for 14-0, and at last England awoke. Daly was felled by a shoulder from Aki, who was lucky not to receive at least a yellow card, and from a series of penalties kicked to the corner a driving maul was illegally brought down to see O'Mahony sent to the sin bin. England overthrew the subsequent line-out but came again, and from a clever grubber from Farrell, Daly gathered in the left-hand corner for 14-5. Most teams would have tried to see out the period with a man down. Ireland were both braver and better. A series of penalties won territory before Stockdale kicked over Mike Brown, kneed the ball on as it bounced and did wonderfully well to regain his balance before diving to get a hand to the ball just before it went dead. Joey Carbery, on with Sexton having a head injury assessment, stroked over the conversion and at 21-5 Ireland had one hand on history. This video can not be played Six Nations Shuffle: Celebrations for Ireland, aerial ping pong & a crocodile roll England came out seeking redemption and went close down the left when Daly was tap-tackled by a scrambling Earls and again when Ben Te'o's poor pass forced May to stop with the line beckoning. At last their forwards were starting to make inroads, the ball quick and the runners hitting passes at pace, but there were no points to show for it. Remorselessly Ireland took back control. Aki went off injured and England coach Eddie Jones threw on his finishers for a job that had barely been started, yet it was the men in green who threatened again. Aki's replacement Jordan Larmour chose to go solo with Earls outside him on the right before Conor Murray knocked over a penalty for 24-5. Twickenham was silenced, the gap between two sides on the scoreboard far greater than most had foreseen but an accurate reflection of their respective form. The excellent Daly profited from a clever Brown offload to dive over in the left-hand corner to make it 24-10 with 15 minutes to go as replacement George Ford made a late impact. With Sexton off too Ireland lost their fluency and Brown was denied in the corner before May went over down the right at the death. But the work had been done, and the celebrations reverberated from Twickenham to Tyrone as the final whistle sounded. It is over a decade since England lost three matches in a single Six Nations campaign A brilliant prop, but so much more than a prop too. Hands like a back, carries like a second row. The Wexford man is of the true heroes of this Grand Slam team. Ireland boss Joe Schmidt:""I thought our boys showed that they can deliver in the big moments on a number of occasions today - they worked incredibly hard and merited the win. ""We showed a little bit of class where we opened them up and at the other end of the pitch it was pure courage."" This video can not be played Six Nations 2018: Joe Schmidt couldn't be much prouder of Ireland England boss Jones:""We gave them too many penalties at the start of the game and allowed them to build a lead. ""They are a good tough team, very worthy Grand Slam champions and they've performed extremely well today."" This video can not be played Six Nations 2018: Individual discipline let England down - Eddie Jones Ireland captain Rory Best:""I'm massively proud of everyone today. It was a ferocious Test match and words can't describe how we feel having won today. ""We had to make every moment count and try to build as close to a perfect 80 minutes as we could. We showed what we were made of today."" England captain Dylan Hartley:""Individual discipline was poor today. It leaves a dirty taste in the mouth to lose the last game in the tournament. ""In the grand scheme of things, we're on a journey and are learning about ourselves. It's not a great thing to lose three games but it gives us a reality check and it keeps us honest and hungry."" Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson: ""I would put Ireland as the best team in the world at the moment. They were so ruthless in every department and I don't think New Zealand would have been able to do that to England today."" Former Ireland wing Denis Hickie:""It's an incredible achievement for this team. It'll mean so much for them to do it here, to close it out and get over the final hurdle here. There are some world class players in this Irish team - it's very fitting for them to win the Grand Slam."" Andrew Priestley:There are some wise old heads in the Ireland squad, but it was notable the number of young Irish players on the pitch at the full-time whistle. The future's bright, the future's green. Daniel Fellows:Thoroughly deserved Grand Slam to Ireland, great achievement. There's one in the tap for you all.

"The UK has also cut off high-level contacts with Russia after the Salisbury nerve agent attack Russia has decided to expel 23 UK diplomats, in a tit-for-tat response to the UK's expulsion of 23 of its diplomats. The British government announced plans to expel the Russian diplomats as part of its response to the Salisbury nerve agent attack. But why do countries expel diplomats? And what happens when a diplomat is told to leave the country? Russia to expel 23 UK diplomats in spy row Why the UK is expelling diplomats Diplomats around the world are granted immunity in their host country - meaning they cannot be prosecuted there. However, their right to stay in the host country can be withdrawn if they break the law, upset the host nation - or in the event of a diplomatic crisis, as between the UK and Russia right now. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,externalgoverns how states interact. Under article 9 of the convention, the host country can ""at any time and for any reason"" declare a person to be persona non grata - unwelcome in their country. This video can not be played Ambassador Laurie Bristow: ""We will always do what is necessary to defend ourselves"" The host government decides which diplomats go and which ones stay. The British ambassador was summoned by Russia on Saturday, and had to go and break the news to his staff. This is what the UK did to the Russian ambassador, and what has happened in the past. UK and Malawi diplomats expelled However John Everard, former UK ambassador to North Korea, says there is ""no fixed way of telling diplomats"" who stays and who goes. Countries can summon the ambassador or issue a formal diplomatic note, he says. There is no law governing how to do it. Patric Duddy, Former US ambassador to Venezuela, was back in Washington in 2008 when he was phoned by the US state department and told he could not return to his host nation - then-PresidentHugo Chavez had announced his expulsion on the news,external. You leave, whenever the host country tells you to leave. Refusing to go is a breach of international treaties and could spark a major crisis. ""There's no bucking that,"" says Sir Christopher Meyer, former British ambassador to the US. ""They have to meet our deadlines, we have to meet theirs."" While Russia has given the UK a week for its diplomats to leave, sometimes the time can be far less - 72 hours or even 24 hours. Police cordons remain in place in parts of Salisbury, almost two weeks after the attack In the 1960s, one British insurance firm even offereda policy to protect diplomats against sudden expulsion,externalfrom Moscow. Mr Everard, also never expelled himself, compares it to being told to move by a major transnational corporation. ""You won't do any work that week,"" he says, with children's schooling one of the major issues to consider. ""You say goodbye to as many friends and colleagues as you can manage, and if you are lucky you throw a party at the end of it."" The Russians being expelled from the UK seem to have found time to do this. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There is no official Foreign Office guidance to its staff about what to do in the event of expulsion, althoughForeign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted on Saturday,externalthat his priority now was ""supporting those staff [who are] returning to the UK"". Sir Christopher was also never expelled himself, but he did work as a diplomat in the Soviet Union. He explains it is ""very rare"" for a person to return to the host country once declared persona non grata. Saying that though, he did know of someone who was able to go back to Russia after expulsion, applying and winning a posting there years later. ""There is no statutory period,"" he says. ""But it's not common."" This video can not be played The UK, US and Russia all addressed the UN over the use of a nerve agent on UK soil Expelled diplomats are not left waiting for the chance to return - they are reassigned ""in due course"", says Sir Christopher, even if they have specialised in one niche language.

"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital The Czech Republic has rejected Russian claims that it was one of four countries most likely to have manufactured the nerve agent used to poison Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Czech Foreign Minister Martin Stropnicky said this was ""wholly unsubstantiated"" and ""highly speculative"". The ex-spy and his daughter Yulia remain critically ill in hospital. They were found unconscious on a bench in southern England on 4 March. The UK government says they were poisoned with a nerve agent of a type developed by Russia called Novichok. The Russian government denies any involvement in the attack. Mr Stropnicky was responding to claims made by Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. She had said the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the UK and Sweden were most likely to have produced Novichok, the nerve agent identified in the Skripal case - and which the UK government says originated in Russia. They were the ones carrying out ""intense research"" on the substances from the late 1990s until now, she alleged. What are Novichok nerve agents? Police warning to Russian exiles in UK Mr Stropnicky tweeted: ""We must protest at the claims of the origins of Novichok, which are wholly unsubstantiated. ""This is a classic way of manipulating information in the public space; releasing a highly speculative claim with no proof whatsoever. ""This information already appeared several days ago on the disinformation website Sputnik."" Meanwhile, Russia is to expel 23 British diplomats as the row over the attack on the Skripals continues. The Russian foreign ministry said the UK staff would be expelled from Moscow within a week in response to Britain's decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats. It also said it would close the British Council in Russia, which promotes cultural ties between the nations, and the British Consulate in St Petersburg.
