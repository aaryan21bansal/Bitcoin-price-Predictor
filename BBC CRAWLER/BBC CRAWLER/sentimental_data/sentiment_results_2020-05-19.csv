"Mia has chronic lung disease, global developmental delay and autism The parents of a girl with special needs say they are having to skip meals to make ends meet amid lockdown. Tristan Howdle, from Harrogate, was made redundant as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and his wife, a carer, is working fewer hours. Charity Family Fund said many families of disabled children - including the Howdles with daughter Mia, 7 - struggle with food and energy costs. Lockdown measures also mean they are unable to access the support they need. More stories from around Yorkshire The charity has spoken out as the government announces Â£10m emergency funding to help low-income families care for children with complex needs at home. The grants, which are expected to work out at about Â£400-Â£500 per family, are being made available to help those with seriously ill or disabled children. Mr Howdle, who worked in recruitment before the lockdown began, says the family is shielding as daughter Mia has chronic lung disease, global developmental delay and autism. She usually goes to a special school in Wetherby, but cannot currently attend. Tristan Howdle said the family are struggling financially due to pressures brought on by the lockdown The situation has also forced Mrs Howdle to reduce her working hours to avoid any direct work with people due to the infection risks. She has also given up her usual night shifts, leaving her wages about Â£500 a month lower than normal. ""It's the total effect of everything we're missing which is hard for us, all her hospital appointments, all the support she receives at school, it's just incredibly hard on Mia,"" said Mr Howdle. He added he and his wife are not eating properly to be able to afford to give Mia the food she needs. ""You will eat toast or something, just so there is sustenance, but we won't go with full meals all the time, we are just eating what we can,"" he continued ""In terms of costs, we're spending more than we ever have before on food. Autism means that [Mia] will only touch and eat very specific brands of foods. ""Some of those brands are not cheap but she will not eat other brands. It's a specific part of that condition that anyone who understands autism will know."" Family Fund, based in York, said a survey it commissioned showed more than half of families of children with special needs are in a similar position. Mia was born prematurely and weighed just 1lb 8oz A quarter of the parents surveyed said they had missed meals in the past two weeks because of reduced income. It found that while the situation has improved, 26% of families still report having to go without toiletries, 25% without hygiene products and 13% without medicines. Children and families minister Vicky Ford, said: ""I know that these unprecedented times may put additional pressure on families, particularly those whose children have the most complex needs, and these parents deserve some extra help to loo after and educate them at home."" Cheryl Ward, of Family Fund, welcomed the funding and said it would make an ""incredible difference"" to ease some of the pressures these families face. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

"Wales lockdown rules are stricter than other parts of the UK Wales' health minister is considering whether people should be able to meet loved ones who are not already in their household outdoors. The next review of the Welsh Government's lockdown rules is due next week, on 28 May. It comes as new advice said the virus is ""very likely to decay very quickly"" when exposed to sunlight. Vaughan Gething said ministers were having a ""very real debate"". In Northern Ireland, groups of up to six people who do not share a household are being allowed to meet outdoors - in England people can meet one other person from outside their household outdoors. It is not expected any decision would be made before the lockdown review is completed. Meanwhile Mr Gething admitted that a new testing system is experiencing ""teething problems"" - after Wales joined a UK-wide scheme allowing members of the public with symptoms to have tests at home. Use common sense to see loved ones â Raab Jump in number claiming out-of-work benefits Arts groups 'losing Â£1.4m a week' The Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (TAC), in a paper published on Tuesday and dated 12 May, said coronavirus ""is very likely to decay very quickly (a few minutes) in air and on surfaces when exposed to sunlight. ""This adds to the evidence that outdoor environments are highly likely to be a lower risk for transmission,"" it says. The same paper, however, said the rate at which coronavirus is reproducing in Wales ""increased slightly"" last week. TAC said the consensus view was that R in Wales was between 0.7 and 1 - up from between 0.7 and 0.9. The Welsh Government has said it wants to keep R below one. The paper adds that while R is ""almost certain to be under 1, it could be close to it"". Explaining the increase, it said it is because ""the number of cases in the community is decreasing while the number in, or seeded by, care homes or hospitals remains broadly flat"". ""As a result, hospital or care home cases represent a higher proportion of total cases. This means that the rate at which the overall epidemic is shrinking has slowed."" Vaughan Gething spoke at the daily Welsh Government press conference People in Wales are not currently permitted to travel to see friends or family that do not live in their household. Asked at the daily Welsh Government press conference if the advice was a reason to allow the public to meet loved ones outdoors, Mr Gething said the evidence was ""developing"". ""So we need to think about what that then means, not just about being outside, but who you are outside with and the level of contact you have,"" he said. They are ""active considerations"", he said. Mr Gething said TAC's evidence helps to inform the ""very real debate that ministers are having with our advisors on how we continue to take a deliberately cautious approach"". He added he did not want to risk ""the health and safety of the people of Wales"" or throw away ""the hard won gains the people of Wales have delivered"". The original 'stay home' advice in Wales has been maintained On Monday the Welsh Government joined a UK-wide testing portal and home testing scheme, allowing people aged five and over to be tested if they have symptoms. But on Tuesday morning the portal showed no testing kits were available - although that changed by the evening. Testing sites in Wales could also not be booked for the general public, but could for key workers. Mr Gething said they would seek to understand ""teething problems"" in the system. ""We anticipate there will be a high level of demand for home testing kits over the first few days."" ""The UK government has confirmed priority will be given to home testing kits for critical workers and it will be working to increase home testing capacity for the public."" Home testing is a key part of the Welsh Government's plans for tracing coronavirus contacts, so people can be isolated if they are infected. Mr Gething announced the system will be piloted in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg, Powys, Betsi Cadwaladr and Hywel Dda health board areas. ""Each pilot will be delivered by a local authority and their staff,"" the minister said. Mr Gething said the trials would run for two weeks and would be ""small scale"".

"Daily global emissions of CO2 fell by 17% at the peak of the shutdown because of measures taken by governments in response to Covid-19, say scientists. Themost comprehensive account,externalyet published says that almost half the record decrease was due to fewer car journeys. But the authors are worried that, as people return to work, car use will soar again. They fear CO2 emissions could soon be higher than before the crisis. They are urging politicians to grasp the moment and make real, durable changes on transport and personal mobility. Coronavirus: Five charts about the biggest carbon crash Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external Can coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery? In the UK, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has pledged Â£250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure. Other countries are also looking at similar plans. The lockdowns that most governments have implemented in response to Covid-19 have had a significant impact on the carbon-producing activities that are embedded in almost everything we do. Road transport has declined hugely, as has aviation. However, now that the UK is beginning to return to work, Mr Shapps said people should drive to work rather than use public transport, should walking or cycling not be an option. ""If you can't walk or cycle but you do have access to a car, please use it rather than travelling by bus, train or tram,"" he said. Industry has temporarily closed down and demand for energy all over the world has crashed. Now in detailed analysis, researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our emissions of CO2. They've calculated the fall off in carbon based on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 countries that between them account for 97% of global emissions. During the peak of the crisis in early April, daily emissions dropped by 17% compared to the previous year, meaning around 17 million tonnes less CO2 were emitted every day. The key to the fall has been cars. Surface transport emissions have declined by 43%, the same amount as the drop from industry and power generation combined. What is climate change? Climate-related words and phrases explained How much warmer is your city? What is your diet's carbon footprint? Where we are in seven charts While the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the economic impact, it only accounts for 10% of the decrease during the pandemic. China has been responsible for the biggest drop, followed by the US, Europe and India. If some restrictions on economic activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the year, then global emissions will likely drop by 7%. If pre-pandemic levels of transport and economic activity return by mid-June, the annual fall would be around 4%. But the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound, especially on the roads, could see a carbon surge. Lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants, too. One of the UK's leading experts, Prof Frank Kelly, from King's College London, said he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised - fully two years before US authorities exposed the scandal. He told Radio 4's The Life Scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between emissions declared by the car firms and real readings on the road. Prof Kelly said he reported it to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), but they didn't publish his findings. He said work undertaken subsequently in the US led to legal action against car makers that had installed ""defeat devices"" to fool regulators. The government didn't deny the account. A spokesperson said: ""We are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our Clean Air Strategy has been commended by the World Health Organization as an 'example for the rest of the world to follow'"". Meanwhile, on the Covid-19 crisis, he said levels of the pollutant NO2 had fallen by up to 60% in London since the fall in traffic under lockdown. Levels of another pollutant, sooty particles, remained at harmful concentrations. ""A big worry that people will naturally want to go back to their cars to go to work, and that could rebound the emissions to the same level or even higher than before, once everybody goes back,"" said Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ© from the University of East Anglia, who led the analysis. The researchers say that fundamental, systemic change is needed if the emissions curve is to be flattened in a way that would limit the very worst impacts of climate change. When it comes to transportation, there are huge opportunities, according to Prof Le QuÃ©rÃ©. She says that after the global financial crisis in 2008, some governments like China, US and Germany made significant investments in wind and solar energy and this drove down the prices of these renewables. Airlines have been hit hard economically, but the slowdown in flying hasn't hugely impacted emissions ""Here now in 2020 we're very close to the same situation in electric mobility,"" she told BBC News. ""Battery prices have come down, we have lots of models and governments are going to try to boost their economies."" ""So if these two things can align, then it could make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow."" UK warned over coronavirus climate trap Government to urge us all to walk and cycle more Study pours cold water on oil firm net zero claims Grabbing the opportunity that the virus has presented is also at the forefront of corporate thinking on climate change. Aletter signed by 155 major companies,external, representing $2.4 trillion (Â£1.96 trillion) in market capitalisation, calls for a net-zero emissions response to the covid crisis. Corporations including Carlsberg, Iberdrola, EDF and Coca Cola Europe say they want governments to ""prioritise a faster and fairer transition from a grey to a green economy"". Electric cars may be the best way forward for transportation, scientists believe The authors of the latest analysis on carbon emissions agree that now is the moment for action. They point to the fact that while emissions of CO2 may be temporarily reduced, all the while CO2 concentrations are lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet. It will take a a dramatic shift to change that. ""I think very much that we are at a crossroads. And at this point, like the UK prime minister Boris Johnson said, it could go either way.""

The British Veterinary Association (BVA) said urgent action was needed to avert practice closures. A survey by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons found half of practices had seen turnover drop by 50% or more, with a quarter losing 75% of business, although these figures did improve in the most recent figures from mid-May. Meleri Wyn Tweed, a vet who cares for small animals in Swansea, has been on the furlough scheme since the lockdown: ""Out of six vets, there are only two working in the practice at the moment, and the turnover has dropped dramatically."" The Welsh Government said it recognised the difficulties and was working with vets to outline support available. Meleri Wyn Tweed has been furloughed but worries about her regular patients Fewer than 10% of childrenat risk of abuse and neglecthave been attending hub schools during lockdown, according to NSPCC Cymru. The Welsh Parliament's Children, Young People and Education Committee was told just 1,000 out of 16,000 vulnerable children have attended school, half of whom are at risk of abuse or neglect. NSPCC Cymru's Vivienne Laing told the committee it was ""very important for vulnerable children to attend these hubs"". ""What we do know is that home is not a safe place for too many children,"" she said. The Welsh Government accepted ""there is still more to do to encourage take-up"", but a spokesman said attendance had improved in recent weeks. All schools in Wales were closed in March in response to the coronavirus pandemic, with hub schools open only for vulnerable children and the children of keyworkers.

Care homes should assume all their residents have Covid-19 if there has been an outbreak, according to government advisors. A report for ministers says it is not always possible to isolate residents with symptoms âwithout causing harm or distressâ. âTherefore, if an outbreak already exists in a care home, there is a need to assume that everyone has the virus and act accordingly, regardless of whether mass testing is applied,â it says. The advice comes from the panel of scientists advising the Welsh Government on how to respond to coronavirus. In a report on care homes, submitted the day before a blanket testing policy was announced, the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) says there is âstrong evidenceâ to support testing all residents and staff in homes with new outbreaks. But it says âthe value of this testing will decrease over time from the point of the outbreak being identifiedâ. It also says it would be âvaluable to test in selected homesâ that appear to be free of the virus, to find out if anyone has been infected without displaying symptoms. Ministers have promised to go further than that, saying on 16 May that swabs will be available for residents and staff at all homes. The TAG report, dated 15 May, says mobile testing units should visit care homes. 

It also says: âThere is some evidence that staff working in more than one care home at a time will increase the risk of infection.â All 60Members of the Senedd(MS) will be able to take part in virtual sittings from June, the Welsh Parliament has said.

"The head of the organisation which represents care homes in England has strongly criticised the government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Professor Martin Green, of Care England, said people who were most at risk of dying of Covid-19 should have been prioritised from the beginning. He told MPs there were still problems with testing and PPE in care homes. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the care sector had received unprecedented levels of support during the crisis. It comes as an industry body has said care homes in England were planning their response to the coronavirus pandemic""with their hands tied""because data about outbreaks in the sector were not published until the end of April. Meanwhile, the latest figures suggestmore than 11,600 peoplehave died from coronavirus in UK care homes since the start of the pandemic. But for the second week running, the review of death certificates by statisticians showed the number of new deaths in care homes had fallen. The overall UK death toll now stands at 35,341 after the Department of Health recorded another 545 deaths of people in the UK following a positive coronavirus test. How big is the epidemic in care homes? When did care homes go into lockdown? Data delay saw care homes âfighting losing battleâ Giving evidence to the Health and Social Care Committee, Prof Green said pandemic planning had been completely inadequate and the government had focused on the NHS while discharging infected patients into care homes. He told MPs that despite promises from ministers, there were still huge issues with testing, with results lost and staff waiting eight to 10 days to find out if they have coronavirus. Answering an urgent question in the House of Commons, Mr Hancock insisted people were sent to care homes when community transmission rates were low. However, a Public Health England survey of London care homes found that agency workers doing shifts in different homes were a source of transmission. The study, which was carried out over the Easter weekend, looked at tests of staff and residents and the results were passed to the Department of Health and Social Care before the end of the month. PHE said the results suggested there were ""high numbers of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases among staff and residents"" and that ""infection may be being imported into the homes by staff"". It added it was possible that the usual staff may be off work self-isolating and the infection was introduced by the ""bank staff"" sent in as cover. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Prof Green told MPs there would need to be a ""forensic examination"" in the future to prevent a crisis in care homes from happening again. ""We should have been focusing on care homes from the start of this pandemic,"" he said. ""What we saw at the start was a focus on the NHS which meant care homes often had their medical support from the NHS withdrawn. ""We also had the disruption of our supply chains for PPE [personal protective equipment]. ""We also saw people being discharged from hospital when we didn't have the testing regime up and running. ""So despite what's been said, there were cases of people who either didn't have a Covid-19 status, or who were symptomatic, who were discharged into care homes."" He added: ""Given that care homes are full of people with underlying health conditions, I think we should've looked at focusing on where the people at most risk were, rather than thinking about a particular organisation."" Prof Green said a lot of care homes had not had the right set-up for isolating patients coming from hospitals, while other countries used separate quarantine facilities for infected patients. And he said some test results for staff or residents in care homes had been lost, while others waited so long that it was unclear if they were still valid. He insisted that PPE across care homes was still inadequate and called for testing ""two or three times a week"" to get on top of the virus. However, he said there were indications of a downward trend in cases, telling MPs: ""I think we are probably at the top of the curve and hopefully heading downwards."" James Bullion from the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services in England also gave evidence, and said both the lack of PPE and testing still remain a problem. ""The care workforce is 1.6 million. We are nowhere near the level of testing that is required,"" he said. Mr Hancock has claimed ministers have done everything they can to protect care homes. He said a ""protective ring"" has been thrown around care homes, adding that nearly two-thirds of care homes had not seen outbreaks. In the Commons on Tuesday, shadow social care minister Liz Kendall accused government ministers of being ""too slow"" to tackle the spread of coronavirus in care homes. She asked Mr Hancock to explain why guidance saying care homes were very unlikely to be infected was not withdrawn until 12 March. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'We've been able to protect the majority of care homes' Mr Hancock said the guidance to care homes that was in place until 13 March ""was in place whilst community transmission was low and said it would be updated as soon as transmission went broader and that's exactly what we did"". In early March, the government's chief medical adviser Professor Chris Whitty warned MPs it was ""highly likely"" community transmission of coronavirus in the UK was already happening. On discharging hospital patients to care homes, Mr Hancock said it was ""important to remember that hospital can be a dangerous place for people"". He stood by the principle of discharging patients to care homes, saying it was ""appropriate"" and ""safer"" in many cases. ""What's important is that infection control procedures are in place in that care home, and those infection control procedures were put in place at the start of this crisis and have been strengthened.""

Temperature screening is being introduced globally including in airports, workplaces, and restaurants Governments globally are experimenting with ways to detect and trace coronavirus symptoms.

It suggests that new products are flooding markets globally. Forcing citizens to have their temperature recorded risks violating their right to privacy, the ACLU suggests. It could also lead to wider health data being collected and potentially used by private healthcare companies, it adds.

But the researchers suggest a more fundamental rethink is required. They suggest the NHS considers shifting from its current ""centralised"" model - where contact-matching happens on a computer server - to a ""decentralised"" version - where the matching instead happens on people's phones.

frank answer from Angela McLean, the deputy chief scientific adviser, was telling. ""The advice that we gave certainly took
account of what testing was available,"" she told reporters. Perhaps thatâs not surprising. Scientists
have to advise, just as ministers have to decide, in the real world, not an

"Mia has chronic lung disease, global developmental delay and autism The parents of a girl with special needs say they are having to skip meals to make ends meet amid lockdown. Tristan Howdle, from Harrogate, was made redundant as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and his wife, a carer, is working fewer hours. Charity Family Fund said many families of disabled children - including the Howdles with daughter Mia, 7 - struggle with food and energy costs. Lockdown measures also mean they are unable to access the support they need. More stories from around Yorkshire The charity has spoken out as the government announces Â£10m emergency funding to help low-income families care for children with complex needs at home. The grants, which are expected to work out at about Â£400-Â£500 per family, are being made available to help those with seriously ill or disabled children. Mr Howdle, who worked in recruitment before the lockdown began, says the family is shielding as daughter Mia has chronic lung disease, global developmental delay and autism. She usually goes to a special school in Wetherby, but cannot currently attend. Tristan Howdle said the family are struggling financially due to pressures brought on by the lockdown The situation has also forced Mrs Howdle to reduce her working hours to avoid any direct work with people due to the infection risks. She has also given up her usual night shifts, leaving her wages about Â£500 a month lower than normal. ""It's the total effect of everything we're missing which is hard for us, all her hospital appointments, all the support she receives at school, it's just incredibly hard on Mia,"" said Mr Howdle. He added he and his wife are not eating properly to be able to afford to give Mia the food she needs. ""You will eat toast or something, just so there is sustenance, but we won't go with full meals all the time, we are just eating what we can,"" he continued ""In terms of costs, we're spending more than we ever have before on food. Autism means that [Mia] will only touch and eat very specific brands of foods. ""Some of those brands are not cheap but she will not eat other brands. It's a specific part of that condition that anyone who understands autism will know."" Family Fund, based in York, said a survey it commissioned showed more than half of families of children with special needs are in a similar position. Mia was born prematurely and weighed just 1lb 8oz A quarter of the parents surveyed said they had missed meals in the past two weeks because of reduced income. It found that while the situation has improved, 26% of families still report having to go without toiletries, 25% without hygiene products and 13% without medicines. Children and families minister Vicky Ford, said: ""I know that these unprecedented times may put additional pressure on families, particularly those whose children have the most complex needs, and these parents deserve some extra help to loo after and educate them at home."" Cheryl Ward, of Family Fund, welcomed the funding and said it would make an ""incredible difference"" to ease some of the pressures these families face. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

"EasyJet has admitted that a ""highly sophisticated cyber-attack"" has affected approximately nine million customers. It said email addresses and travel details had been stolen and that 2,208 customers had also had their credit and debit card details ""accessed"". The firm has informed the UK's Information Commissioner's Office while it investigates the breach. EasyJet first became aware of the attack in January. It told the BBC that it was only able to notify customers whose credit card details were stolen in early April. ""This was a highly sophisticated attacker. It took time to understand the scope of the attack and to identify who had been impacted,"" the airline told the BBC. ""We could only inform people once the investigation had progressed enough that we were able to identify whether any individuals have been affected, then who had been impacted and what information had been accessed."" Stolen credit card data included the three digital security code - known as the CVV number - on the back of the card itself. EasyJet added that it had gone public now in order to warn the nine million customers whose email addresses had been stolen to be wary of phishing attacks. It said that it would notify everyone affected by 26 May. It did not provide details about the nature of the attack or the motives, but said its investigation suggested hackers were targeting ""company intellectual property"" rather than information that could be used in identity theft. ""There is no evidence that any personal information of any nature has been misused, however, on the recommendation of the ICO, we are communicating with the approximately nine million customers whose travel details were accessed to advise them of protective steps to minimise any risk of potential phishing. ""We are advising customers to be cautious of any communications purporting to come from EasyJet or EasyJet Holidays."" In response to the breach, the ICO  said that it was investigating. ""People have a right to expect that organisations will handle their personal information securely and responsibly. When that doesn't happen, we will investigate and take robust action where necessary."" It also warned people to be on the lookout for phishing attacks and directed them to itsadvice on its website,externalon how to spot such scams. Phishing attempts - which see criminals sending emails with links to fake web pages that steal personal data - have risen exponentially during the coronavirus crisis. Google isblocking more than 100 million phishing emails every dayto Gmail users. It is likely that hackers will take advantage of the fact people are cancelling flights because of the uncertainty related to the spread of Covid-19, said Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy. ""Anybody who has ever purchased an EasyJet flight is advised to be extremely wary when opening emails from now on,"" he said. ""Phishing emails that leverage data stolen during the attack could be used as an attack vector at any point in the future. ""As a result, it is important for customers to be vigilant whenever they receive unsolicited emails or emails that appear to be from EasyJet, as these could be fake emails which link to cloned websites designed to steal your data."" The coronavirus pandemic has meant an end to much global travel, leaving airlines struggling financially. ""These are already turbulent times for all companies within the aviation industry but the situation has just got significantly worse for EasyJet,"" said Mike Fenton, chief executive of threat detection firm Redscan. ""To add to the company's woes, it is now has to explain how the personal records of nine million customers were able to be accessed. ""When it comes to cyber security, the airline industry doesn't have a great record.The British Airways breach in 2018should have been a wake-up call and passenger confidence is likely to be at an all-time low after this."" British Airways was fined a record Â£183m over a large data breach in 2018 British Airways announced that the personal details of more than half a million of its customers had been harvested by hackers in September 2018. Initially it said that only 380,000 transactions were affected and that the data did not include travel or passport details. The ICO later issued a record Â£183m fine over the breach. Compensation pay-outs to customers could see that reach Â£3bn. Under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), if EasyJet is found to have mishandled customer data, it could face fines of up to 4% of its annual worldwide turnover. ""It is impossible to determine yet whether or not there has been negligence but, if so, consumers could be eligible to claim compensation, raising the financial penalty imposed on the airline significantly,"" said Aman Johal from law firm Your Lawyers. Millions of EasyJet customers' details of some sort or another have been accessed by hackers - but even more people now need to be vigilant. Generally, personal details can be used by fraudsters to access bank accounts, open accounts and take out loans in the innocent victims' names, make fraudulent purchases, or sell on to other criminals. The risks to those whose card details have been compromised are clear. Their provider should already have stopped the card, a new one will be issued, and they will need to sort out any regular payments coming from that card. Following a similar data breach at British Airways in 2018, some found this a frustrating and time-consuming task. Millions of people whose email addresses and travel details have been accessed will need to change passwords, and be wary of any unexpected transactions. Everyone else, particularly EasyJet customers whose details have not been affected, must be alert to other unsolicited emails and messages.

"The government is considering introducing an extra bank holiday, possibly in October around the time of half-term. The idea was put forward by the UK's tourism agency Visit Britain. Its acting head, Patricia Yates, told MPs on Tuesday the industry had lost the benefit of two bank holidays in May because of the coronavirus lockdown. The government did, however, warn that having an extra break could have an economic downside. Downing Street said the government was supporting the tourism industry through this ""challenging period"" and would ""respond in due course"" to the proposal by Visit Britain. A spokesman said it was ""worth acknowledging that extra bank holidays do come with economic costs"". Ms Yates said an extra day in October would enable the UK tourism sector to extend the season. She said the industry could not keep up with developments and it was very difficult to estimate the amount that would be lost because of the coronavirus lockdown. She told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee: ""Every time we do the modelling the figures get worse. So for inbound, I mean we were looking at the beginning of this year at about Â£26.6bn coming from inbound tourism, we reckon a Â£15bn drop on that."" She said ordinarily, the domestic tourists contributed some Â£80bn a year, but she was expecting that to be down by Â£22bn. Ms Yates was one of a number of representatives from Britain's tourism industry appearing before the committee. She told the committee: ""To get British tourism up and running this summer is hugely important as we need that domestic audience."" Currently, overnight stays are not allowed in the UK. Hotels will not be opened until July at the earliest under the Government's lockdown plans. Ms Yates said a survey showed confidence was very low, and 74% of those who have a holiday booked between July and September did not think that holiday would take place. UK Hospitality the trade group that represents leisure businesses from bars to hotels, approve of the move, but struck a note of caution. Its chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said: ""A bank holiday in October may provide a welcome boost for hospitality businesses, not least at a time when consumer confidence will hopefully be returning to healthy levels. ""However, we are still some way from knowing what the sector will look like. A lot depends on whether businesses are able to open safely and whether the Government continues to support businesses who need it."" Less than a fifth of people in the UK were thinking of booking a holiday for the summer, compared with 43% in Italy. Ideas for the eventual reopening of overseas tourism are also being mooted. At present, popular European destinations including France, Spain and Portugal all impose a 14-day quarantine for visitors, the length of a typical holiday break. The UK is also planning a two-week quarantine period for those entering the country. On Monday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, said thegovernment was looking at so-called ""airbridges"" with countriesthat have low infection rates, which would mean easier entry for certain countries.

"Care homes in England were planning their response to the coronavirus pandemic ""with their hands tied"" because data about outbreaks in the sector were not published until the end of April, an industry body has said. Public Health England had counted,externalmore than 4,500 Covid-19 outbreaks in care homes before it issued its findings, figures reveal. The National Care Forum voiced concerns at the data not being shared but PHE said it was used by health protection teams and to brief ministers. Gary Lemin, whose father Roger died from Covid-19 in Cornish care home Roseland Court,told BBC Radio 4's File on 4that a lack of data meant care homes have been ""fighting a losing battle"". He added: ""It makes it very difficult to understand the problem. It's almost as if their lives don't matter as much as anybody else's. ""It's a kind of an indictment of the way that the care system has been seen over this crisis."" More than 11,000 virus deaths in care homes When did care homes go into lockdown? How big is the epidemic in care homes? It comes as figures from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Irelandsuggest more than 11,600 people have died with coronavirusin care homes across the UK since the start of the pandemic. Roger Lemin died with Covid-19 on 6 April - in the same week there were nine outbreaks in Cornwall PHE has been collecting data on the number of both suspected and confirmed outbreaks in English care homes since 9 March. The data shows there were more than 500 Covid-19 outbreaks in care homes in the week beginning 23 March - with this figure increasing to almost 800 the week after. In the week beginning 13 April, there were nearly 1,000 outbreaks in English care homes. The South East region recorded a more than five-fold increase in outbreaks within one week in early March, at a time when other regions' homes had barely registered cases. By the time PHE published the information - on 29 April - there had been more than 4,500 outbreaks in care homes. Vic Rayner, executive director of the National Care Forum, which represents more than 120 not-for-profit care organisations, said: ""The consequences of not having that data are huge. ""It has affected our ability to plan, prioritise, identify early outbreaks and bring in the right level of medical and health expertise. ""Having that overall picture of knowing what's going on is absolutely critical.  I think it's impossible to operate effectively without that."" ""We're now in a terrible game of catch up.""

But the Local Government Association (LGA) confirmed it had not received the data and told the BBC that directors of public health have said it has been ""difficult"" to get postcode level data - and that real-time data sharing has been a problem both nationally and locally. The LGA added: ""Data on testing, deaths and better surveillance will be required as we move into contact tracing and case finding."" James Bullion, director of the Association of Directors of Social Care, said he was not aware of the PHE outbreak figures. He added: ""We were all, as directors, wanting greater distribution, greater understanding and transparency of the data around outbreaks and indeed, around incidents."" PHE said it only published the data in late April after introducing detail about the number of outbreaks at local authority level in order to help support government. A PHE spokesman added: ""PHE's health protection teams play a vital role locally in responding to any outbreak in care homes, providing tailored infection control advice to allow staff to protect themselves and their residents."" The Department for Health and Social Care said: ""The government's daily figure now includes deaths that have occurred in England in all settings where there has been a positive Covid-19 test, including hospitals, care homes and the wider community.""

"The boss of the UK's national tourism agency has thrown her weight behind setting up so-called air bridges with countries with low coronavirus rates. Visit Britain chief executive Patricia Yates told MPs it was an ""interesting"" idea and indicated the US could be open to agreeing a deal. Air bridges would allow visitors from low-risk countries into the UK without having to quarantine for 14 days. A government spokesperson said air bridges were ""not an agreed policy."" He said: ""Work on this is continuing... ultimately we will be guided by the science and the health of the public must come first."" Ryanair: Air passenger quarantine plans 'idiotic' UK airlines warn quarantine will 'kill air travel' Transport secretary Grant Shapps suggested on Monday that the government's plan to quarantine people arriving in the UK for two weeks could include exceptions. He said: ""We should indeed consider further improvements, for example, things like air bridges enabling people from other countries who have themselves achieved lower levels of coronavirus infection to come to the country."" Ms Yates told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that the US may be interested in reopening travel links with the UK. ""Our American regional director is telling us sort of America is ready to go, American business is ready to go. So, possibly, an air bridge between the UK and America might be one that would be valuable to us."" She added that other valuable markets for mutual arrangements also include France, Germany and Italy. Airlines have objected to the government's 14 day quarantine plan which they say will put people off from travelling. Mr Shapps said the quarantine measure, which is set to ""come in early next month"", would initially be a ""blanket situation"". But he said the government was in ""active discussions"" about other options. Number 10 said the two week quarantine measure would be reviewed every three weeks once it is introduced. But Airlines UK, which represents the industry, said reviews need to be done on a more regular basis. ""If the government does insist on doing this, with minimal exemptions in place, we need strict rolling reviews to be enforced so that this policy is not in place a second longer than it needs to be,"" it said.

"""It's almost been a blessing in disguise. I was stuck in the same role for a number of years, but now I can work for myself and hopefully secure a better future for my family,"" says Jay Lee. The 32-year-old from Surrey recently lost his job at a large UK bank as a mortgage adviser, where he also helped customers with fraud investigations. ""Even when the pandemic started getting more serious, we were told not to worry about our contracts. We were given full reassurance that our jobs were safe."" A couple of weeks into lockdown, a conference call was organised for the team who were all working from home. Jay says that by the end of that day, 40 of them had been told they would lose their jobs. Jay then decided to take the plunge and set up a business, uAcademy, which offers online courses for aspiring mortgage advisers. ""It's something I had been thinking about doing for a year or two, and this gave me a push to do it. I suddenly had a lot of free time, so I managed to set everything up and create the content in about two weeks."" The business has got off to a solid start, he says. ""There's a lot of interest in online learning at the moment. People want to learn new skills, maybe something to help them with a new career."" This video can not be played Four young people who set up businesses in lockdown While he's now generating enough income to cover bills and expenses, Jay recognises he's in a fortunate position. Of the 209 of his new students surveyed,external, Jay says that most had been furloughed or made redundant due to the pandemic. ""Ideally, I hope that this is something I can take on for the future, which is great. But I do have really mixed feelings, and wish my colleagues weren't in this situation too."" As large parts of the economy have been shut down to battle Covid-19, many workers, like Jay, have been laid off. More than 6.5 million jobs in total could be lost due to the economic fallout from the UK's coronavirus lockdown,one study by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex suggests.,external Millions of others at risk of redundancyhave been furloughed, often on reduced pay, which is subsidised by the government. This video can not be played 'I'm vulnerable but have to go out and look for work' Emma Timberlake from Thurrock was one of those workers. When lockdown measures were introduced, her employer in the construction sector told her to stay at home. She is living with multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurological condition which prevents the immune system from working properly. She was furloughed, and later received a letter one day priorto the government's job retention scheme being extended. It said that she would be made redundant from her job as a sales administrator as of 30 June. ""I'm absolutely devastated that I've lost not just a job, but a family,"" Emma says. ""Colleagues that I would speak to on a daily basis have vanished from my life with one simple A4 piece of paper."" Emma is now applying for a range of different jobs, from supermarket work to van driver positions. ""To me, a job is a job and I'd rather sweep the streets than not be doing anything, but I do worry about who can guarantee my safety."" In the meantime, she has had to rely on volunteer services for food deliveries. But she's also contributing to them herself while isolating. During isolation Emma has received food deliveries by volunteers from her local authority in Essex Over the past few weeks, she has taken part in a volunteer ""buddy scheme"", calling other people who are feeling lonely during lockdown. ""Obviously, I am very disappointed. I adored my job. But I know we're going to come out of this so strong. If you can keep a positive mindset, it gets so much better."" Olivia was set to start a graduate role in the aviation sector prior to lockdown Olivia, 21, from Warwickshire is graduating from university this summer. Having completed her studies in law, she had travelling plans and a graduate job lined up in the aviation sector in the coming months. ""I was so looking forward to starting, it was basically my dream to work with this particular company, utilising the degree I love,"" she says. But in April, Olivia was told the company no longer had a graduate position for her. She says they cited a lack of funding, and uncertainty around how to train people online. 'We feel so lost' - Young face job despair New research from The Prince's Trust suggests that Olivia isn't alone. In a survey of more than 1,000 young people, one in 10 said they have had the job or training they were about to start cancelled due to the impact of the coronavirus. Olivia has decided to carry on with her studies as a result. She plans to start a master's degree in aviation law later in the year. ""I was incredibly disappointed, but believe that everything happens for a reason and a new door will be opened instead.""

"EasyJet has admitted that a ""highly sophisticated cyber-attack"" has affected approximately nine million customers. It said email addresses and travel details had been stolen and that 2,208 customers had also had their credit and debit card details ""accessed"". The firm has informed the UK's Information Commissioner's Office while it investigates the breach. EasyJet first became aware of the attack in January. It told the BBC that it was only able to notify customers whose credit card details were stolen in early April. ""This was a highly sophisticated attacker. It took time to understand the scope of the attack and to identify who had been impacted,"" the airline told the BBC. ""We could only inform people once the investigation had progressed enough that we were able to identify whether any individuals have been affected, then who had been impacted and what information had been accessed."" Stolen credit card data included the three digital security code - known as the CVV number - on the back of the card itself. EasyJet added that it had gone public now in order to warn the nine million customers whose email addresses had been stolen to be wary of phishing attacks. It said that it would notify everyone affected by 26 May. It did not provide details about the nature of the attack or the motives, but said its investigation suggested hackers were targeting ""company intellectual property"" rather than information that could be used in identity theft. ""There is no evidence that any personal information of any nature has been misused, however, on the recommendation of the ICO, we are communicating with the approximately nine million customers whose travel details were accessed to advise them of protective steps to minimise any risk of potential phishing. ""We are advising customers to be cautious of any communications purporting to come from EasyJet or EasyJet Holidays."" In response to the breach, the ICO  said that it was investigating. ""People have a right to expect that organisations will handle their personal information securely and responsibly. When that doesn't happen, we will investigate and take robust action where necessary."" It also warned people to be on the lookout for phishing attacks and directed them to itsadvice on its website,externalon how to spot such scams. Phishing attempts - which see criminals sending emails with links to fake web pages that steal personal data - have risen exponentially during the coronavirus crisis. Google isblocking more than 100 million phishing emails every dayto Gmail users. It is likely that hackers will take advantage of the fact people are cancelling flights because of the uncertainty related to the spread of Covid-19, said Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy. ""Anybody who has ever purchased an EasyJet flight is advised to be extremely wary when opening emails from now on,"" he said. ""Phishing emails that leverage data stolen during the attack could be used as an attack vector at any point in the future. ""As a result, it is important for customers to be vigilant whenever they receive unsolicited emails or emails that appear to be from EasyJet, as these could be fake emails which link to cloned websites designed to steal your data."" The coronavirus pandemic has meant an end to much global travel, leaving airlines struggling financially. ""These are already turbulent times for all companies within the aviation industry but the situation has just got significantly worse for EasyJet,"" said Mike Fenton, chief executive of threat detection firm Redscan. ""To add to the company's woes, it is now has to explain how the personal records of nine million customers were able to be accessed. ""When it comes to cyber security, the airline industry doesn't have a great record.The British Airways breach in 2018should have been a wake-up call and passenger confidence is likely to be at an all-time low after this."" British Airways was fined a record Â£183m over a large data breach in 2018 British Airways announced that the personal details of more than half a million of its customers had been harvested by hackers in September 2018. Initially it said that only 380,000 transactions were affected and that the data did not include travel or passport details. The ICO later issued a record Â£183m fine over the breach. Compensation pay-outs to customers could see that reach Â£3bn. Under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), if EasyJet is found to have mishandled customer data, it could face fines of up to 4% of its annual worldwide turnover. ""It is impossible to determine yet whether or not there has been negligence but, if so, consumers could be eligible to claim compensation, raising the financial penalty imposed on the airline significantly,"" said Aman Johal from law firm Your Lawyers. Millions of EasyJet customers' details of some sort or another have been accessed by hackers - but even more people now need to be vigilant. Generally, personal details can be used by fraudsters to access bank accounts, open accounts and take out loans in the innocent victims' names, make fraudulent purchases, or sell on to other criminals. The risks to those whose card details have been compromised are clear. Their provider should already have stopped the card, a new one will be issued, and they will need to sort out any regular payments coming from that card. Following a similar data breach at British Airways in 2018, some found this a frustrating and time-consuming task. Millions of people whose email addresses and travel details have been accessed will need to change passwords, and be wary of any unexpected transactions. Everyone else, particularly EasyJet customers whose details have not been affected, must be alert to other unsolicited emails and messages. Fraudsters will no doubt pose as EasyJet, banks, or the authorities and claim to be dealing with this latest breach. They are simply trying to steal personal details themselves.

"Daily global emissions of CO2 fell by 17% at the peak of the shutdown because of measures taken by governments in response to Covid-19, say scientists. Themost comprehensive account,externalyet published says that almost half the record decrease was due to fewer car journeys. But the authors are worried that, as people return to work, car use will soar again. They fear CO2 emissions could soon be higher than before the crisis. They are urging politicians to grasp the moment and make real, durable changes on transport and personal mobility. Coronavirus: Five charts about the biggest carbon crash Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external Can coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery? In the UK, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has pledged Â£250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure. Other countries are also looking at similar plans. The lockdowns that most governments have implemented in response to Covid-19 have had a significant impact on the carbon-producing activities that are embedded in almost everything we do. Road transport has declined hugely, as has aviation. However, now that the UK is beginning to return to work, Mr Shapps said people should drive to work rather than use public transport, should walking or cycling not be an option. ""If you can't walk or cycle but you do have access to a car, please use it rather than travelling by bus, train or tram,"" he said. Industry has temporarily closed down and demand for energy all over the world has crashed. Now in detailed analysis, researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our emissions of CO2. They've calculated the fall off in carbon based on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 countries that between them account for 97% of global emissions. During the peak of the crisis in early April, daily emissions dropped by 17% compared to the previous year, meaning around 17 million tonnes less CO2 were emitted every day. The key to the fall has been cars. Surface transport emissions have declined by 43%, the same amount as the drop from industry and power generation combined. What is climate change? Climate-related words and phrases explained How much warmer is your city? What is your diet's carbon footprint? Where we are in seven charts While the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the economic impact, it only accounts for 10% of the decrease during the pandemic. China has been responsible for the biggest drop, followed by the US, Europe and India. If some restrictions on economic activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the year, then global emissions will likely drop by 7%. If pre-pandemic levels of transport and economic activity return by mid-June, the annual fall would be around 4%. But the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound, especially on the roads, could see a carbon surge. Lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants, too. One of the UK's leading experts, Prof Frank Kelly, from King's College London, said he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised - fully two years before US authorities exposed the scandal. He told Radio 4's The Life Scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between emissions declared by the car firms and real readings on the road. Prof Kelly said he reported it to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), but they didn't publish his findings. He said work undertaken subsequently in the US led to legal action against car makers that had installed ""defeat devices"" to fool regulators. The government didn't deny the account. A spokesperson said: ""We are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our Clean Air Strategy has been commended by the World Health Organization as an 'example for the rest of the world to follow'"". Meanwhile, on the Covid-19 crisis, he said levels of the pollutant NO2 had fallen by up to 60% in London since the fall in traffic under lockdown. Levels of another pollutant, sooty particles, remained at harmful concentrations. ""A big worry that people will naturally want to go back to their cars to go to work, and that could rebound the emissions to the same level or even higher than before, once everybody goes back,"" said Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ© from the University of East Anglia, who led the analysis. The researchers say that fundamental, systemic change is needed if the emissions curve is to be flattened in a way that would limit the very worst impacts of climate change. When it comes to transportation, there are huge opportunities, according to Prof Le QuÃ©rÃ©. She says that after the global financial crisis in 2008, some governments like China, US and Germany made significant investments in wind and solar energy and this drove down the prices of these renewables. Airlines have been hit hard economically, but the slowdown in flying hasn't hugely impacted emissions ""Here now in 2020 we're very close to the same situation in electric mobility,"" she told BBC News. ""Battery prices have come down, we have lots of models and governments are going to try to boost their economies."" ""So if these two things can align, then it could make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow."" UK warned over coronavirus climate trap Government to urge us all to walk and cycle more Study pours cold water on oil firm net zero claims Grabbing the opportunity that the virus has presented is also at the forefront of corporate thinking on climate change. Aletter signed by 155 major companies,external, representing $2.4 trillion (Â£1.96 trillion) in market capitalisation, calls for a net-zero emissions response to the covid crisis. Corporations including Carlsberg, Iberdrola, EDF and Coca Cola Europe say they want governments to ""prioritise a faster and fairer transition from a grey to a green economy"". Electric cars may be the best way forward for transportation, scientists believe The authors of the latest analysis on carbon emissions agree that now is the moment for action. They point to the fact that while emissions of CO2 may be temporarily reduced, all the while CO2 concentrations are lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet. It will take a a dramatic shift to change that. ""I think very much that we are at a crossroads. And at this point, like the UK prime minister Boris Johnson said, it could go either way."" ""He was talking about his own health, but here we're talking about the health of the planet."" ""It could go either way.""

"The head of the organisation which represents care homes in England has strongly criticised the government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Professor Martin Green, of Care England, said people who were most at risk of dying of Covid-19 should have been prioritised from the beginning. He told MPs there were still problems with testing and PPE in care homes. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the care sector had received unprecedented levels of support during the crisis. It comes as an industry body has said care homes in England were planning their response to the coronavirus pandemic""with their hands tied""because data about outbreaks in the sector were not published until the end of April. Meanwhile, the latest figures suggestmore than 11,600 peoplehave died from coronavirus in UK care homes since the start of the pandemic. But for the second week running, the review of death certificates by statisticians showed the number of new deaths in care homes had fallen. The overall UK death toll now stands at 35,341 after the Department of Health recorded another 545 deaths of people in the UK following a positive coronavirus test. How big is the epidemic in care homes? When did care homes go into lockdown? Data delay saw care homes âfighting losing battleâ Giving evidence to the Health and Social Care Committee, Prof Green said pandemic planning had been completely inadequate and the government had focused on the NHS while discharging infected patients into care homes. He told MPs that despite promises from ministers, there were still huge issues with testing, with results lost and staff waiting eight to 10 days to find out if they have coronavirus. Answering an urgent question in the House of Commons, Mr Hancock insisted people were sent to care homes when community transmission rates were low. However, a Public Health England survey of London care homes found that agency workers doing shifts in different homes were a source of transmission. The study, which was carried out over the Easter weekend, looked at tests of staff and residents and the results were passed to the Department of Health and Social Care before the end of the month. PHE said the results suggested there were ""high numbers of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases among staff and residents"" and that ""infection may be being imported into the homes by staff"". It added it was possible that the usual staff may be off work self-isolating and the infection was introduced by the ""bank staff"" sent in as cover. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Prof Green told MPs there would need to be a ""forensic examination"" in the future to prevent a crisis in care homes from happening again. ""We should have been focusing on care homes from the start of this pandemic,"" he said. ""What we saw at the start was a focus on the NHS which meant care homes often had their medical support from the NHS withdrawn. ""We also had the disruption of our supply chains for PPE [personal protective equipment]. ""We also saw people being discharged from hospital when we didn't have the testing regime up and running. ""So despite what's been said, there were cases of people who either didn't have a Covid-19 status, or who were symptomatic, who were discharged into care homes."" He added: ""Given that care homes are full of people with underlying health conditions, I think we should've looked at focusing on where the people at most risk were, rather than thinking about a particular organisation."" Prof Green said a lot of care homes had not had the right set-up for isolating patients coming from hospitals, while other countries used separate quarantine facilities for infected patients. And he said some test results for staff or residents in care homes had been lost, while others waited so long that it was unclear if they were still valid. He insisted that PPE across care homes was still inadequate and called for testing ""two or three times a week"" to get on top of the virus. However, he said there were indications of a downward trend in cases, telling MPs: ""I think we are probably at the top of the curve and hopefully heading downwards."" James Bullion from the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services in England also gave evidence, and said both the lack of PPE and testing still remain a problem. ""The care workforce is 1.6 million. We are nowhere near the level of testing that is required,"" he said. Mr Hancock has claimed ministers have done everything they can to protect care homes. He said a ""protective ring"" has been thrown around care homes, adding that nearly two-thirds of care homes had not seen outbreaks. In the Commons on Tuesday, shadow social care minister Liz Kendall accused government ministers of being ""too slow"" to tackle the spread of coronavirus in care homes. She asked Mr Hancock to explain why guidance saying care homes were very unlikely to be infected was not withdrawn until 12 March. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'We've been able to protect the majority of care homes' Mr Hancock said the guidance to care homes that was in place until 13 March ""was in place whilst community transmission was low and said it would be updated as soon as transmission went broader and that's exactly what we did"". In early March, the government's chief medical adviser Professor Chris Whitty warned MPs it was ""highly likely"" community transmission of coronavirus in the UK was already happening. On discharging hospital patients to care homes, Mr Hancock said it was ""important to remember that hospital can be a dangerous place for people"". He stood by the principle of discharging patients to care homes, saying it was ""appropriate"" and ""safer"" in many cases. ""What's important is that infection control procedures are in place in that care home, and those infection control procedures were put in place at the start of this crisis and have been strengthened.""

"Mr Trump accuses the UN agency of having an ""alarming lack of independence"" from China. US President Donald Trump has sent a letter to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) threatening to pull US funding permanently over Covid-19.

"EasyJet has admitted that a ""highly sophisticated cyber-attack"" has affected approximately nine million customers. It said email addresses and travel details had been stolen and that 2,208 customers had also had their credit and debit card details ""accessed"". The firm has informed the UK's Information Commissioner's Office while it investigates the breach. EasyJet first became aware of the attack in January. It told the BBC that it was only able to notify customers whose credit card details were stolen in early April. ""This was a highly sophisticated attacker. It took time to understand the scope of the attack and to identify who had been impacted,"" the airline told the BBC. ""We could only inform people once the investigation had progressed enough that we were able to identify whether any individuals have been affected, then who had been impacted and what information had been accessed."" Stolen credit card data included the three digital security code - known as the CVV number - on the back of the card itself. EasyJet added that it had gone public now in order to warn the nine million customers whose email addresses had been stolen to be wary of phishing attacks. It said that it would notify everyone affected by 26 May. It did not provide details about the nature of the attack or the motives, but said its investigation suggested hackers were targeting ""company intellectual property"" rather than information that could be used in identity theft. ""There is no evidence that any personal information of any nature has been misused, however, on the recommendation of the ICO, we are communicating with the approximately nine million customers whose travel details were accessed to advise them of protective steps to minimise any risk of potential phishing. ""We are advising customers to be cautious of any communications purporting to come from EasyJet or EasyJet Holidays."" In response to the breach, the ICO  said that it was investigating. ""People have a right to expect that organisations will handle their personal information securely and responsibly. When that doesn't happen, we will investigate and take robust action where necessary."" It also warned people to be on the lookout for phishing attacks and directed them to itsadvice on its website,externalon how to spot such scams. Phishing attempts - which see criminals sending emails with links to fake web pages that steal personal data - have risen exponentially during the coronavirus crisis. Google isblocking more than 100 million phishing emails every dayto Gmail users. It is likely that hackers will take advantage of the fact people are cancelling flights because of the uncertainty related to the spread of Covid-19, said Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy. ""Anybody who has ever purchased an EasyJet flight is advised to be extremely wary when opening emails from now on,"" he said. ""Phishing emails that leverage data stolen during the attack could be used as an attack vector at any point in the future. ""As a result, it is important for customers to be vigilant whenever they receive unsolicited emails or emails that appear to be from EasyJet, as these could be fake emails which link to cloned websites designed to steal your data."" The coronavirus pandemic has meant an end to much global travel, leaving airlines struggling financially. ""These are already turbulent times for all companies within the aviation industry but the situation has just got significantly worse for EasyJet,"" said Mike Fenton, chief executive of threat detection firm Redscan. ""To add to the company's woes, it is now has to explain how the personal records of nine million customers were able to be accessed. ""When it comes to cyber security, the airline industry doesn't have a great record.The British Airways breach in 2018should have been a wake-up call and passenger confidence is likely to be at an all-time low after this."" British Airways was fined a record Â£183m over a large data breach in 2018 British Airways announced that the personal details of more than half a million of its customers had been harvested by hackers in September 2018. Initially it said that only 380,000 transactions were affected and that the data did not include travel or passport details. The ICO later issued a record Â£183m fine over the breach. Compensation pay-outs to customers could see that reach Â£3bn. Under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), if EasyJet is found to have mishandled customer data, it could face fines of up to 4% of its annual worldwide turnover. ""It is impossible to determine yet whether or not there has been negligence but, if so, consumers could be eligible to claim compensation, raising the financial penalty imposed on the airline significantly,"" said Aman Johal from law firm Your Lawyers. Millions of EasyJet customers' details of some sort or another have been accessed by hackers - but even more people now need to be vigilant. Generally, personal details can be used by fraudsters to access bank accounts, open accounts and take out loans in the innocent victims' names, make fraudulent purchases, or sell on to other criminals. The risks to those whose card details have been compromised are clear. Their provider should already have stopped the card, a new one will be issued, and they will need to sort out any regular payments coming from that card. Following a similar data breach at British Airways in 2018, some found this a frustrating and time-consuming task. Millions of people whose email addresses and travel details have been accessed will need to change passwords, and be wary of any unexpected transactions. Everyone else, particularly EasyJet customers whose details have not been affected, must be alert to other unsolicited emails and messages. Fraudsters will no doubt pose as EasyJet, banks, or the authorities and claim to be dealing with this latest breach. They are simply trying to steal personal details themselves.

"More than 11,600 people have died from coronavirus in care homes across the UK since the start of the pandemic, figures suggest. But for the second week running, the review of death certificates by statisticians showed the number of new deaths has fallen. In the week to 8 May, there were 1,940 care home deaths linked to coronavirus  - down from 2,800 the week before. Overall, care home deaths account for over a quarter of the virus fatalities. How big is the epidemic in care homes? When did care homes go into lockdown? The head of the organisation which represents care homes in England has strongly criticised the government's approach to dealing with coronavirus among elderly residents. Giving evidence to the Health and Social Care Committee, Professor Martin Green criticised the lack of personal protection equipment, poor organisation and constantly changing guidance - and suggested some care homes could now ""go under"". But speaking in the House of Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the care sector had received unprecedented levels of support during the crisis. Meanwhile, the total number of deaths from all causes across society has fallen too, according to the Office for National Statistics  and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland. These are seen as the best measure of the impact of the lockdown as it takes into account both deaths linked to coronavirus and other deaths that could be a result of the lockdown. There were 14,400 deaths during the week - around a third of which were linked to coronavirus. This is down from a weekly peak of nearly 25,000 at the height of the pandemic - although it is still above what would be expected at this time of year. It means since the pandemic started there have now been 55,000 extra deaths. The daily figures released by the government just look at deaths among people with a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The government has been receiving heavy criticism for the impact of coronavirus in care homes. Alongside the coronavirus deaths, there are significant numbers of unexplained fatalities. Across Great Britain, you would normally expect to see around 2,800 deaths a week. But at the peak of the pandemic in care homes in the second half of April there were around three times as many deaths. Only around half the increase was attributed to coronavirus. The other deaths could be related to the indirect costs of the pandemic, such as not getting care for other conditions like heart disease and strokes. Another factor could be that the true number of coronavirus deaths have been under-reported as the lack of testing available to care homes may have meant doctors were not able to identify the presence of the virus. Answering an urgent question in the House of Commons, Mr Hancock claimed ministers have done everything they can to protect care homes. The health secretary said a ""protective ring"" has been thrown around care homes, adding that nearly two-thirds of care homes had not seen outbreaks. But the sector has questioned the support, criticising the lack of protective equipment and testing available - despite the expansion of testing it will still be another three weeks before all staff and residents will have been tested. James Bullion, from the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said both issues still remain a problem. ""The care workforce is 1.6 million. We are nowhere near the level of testing that is required."" Jennifer Dixon, of the Health Foundation think tank, said action by the government had come ""too late"". ""The approach to social care stands in contrast to the NHS which saw a much fuller and swifter response to the pandemic."" Mike Padgham, of the Independent Care Group, which represents care homes, said ""serious questions"" needed to be asked, calling for a public inquiry once the pandemic is over. Responding to reports care homes had felt pressured to take patients from hospital and that had contributed to the spread of the virus, Downing Street said that ""no care home should be forced to take back recovering coronavirus patients"" if they feel they cannot provide appropriate care. The prime minister's spokesman added the NHS was now testing all people leaving hospital in advance of their discharge to care homes.

"The boss of the UK's national tourism agency has thrown her weight behind setting up so-called air bridges with countries with low coronavirus rates. Visit Britain chief executive Patricia Yates told MPs it was an ""interesting"" idea and indicated the US could be open to agreeing a deal. Air bridges would allow visitors from low-risk countries into the UK without having to quarantine for 14 days. A government spokesperson said air bridges were ""not an agreed policy."" He said: ""Work on this is continuing... ultimately we will be guided by the science and the health of the public must come first."" Ryanair: Air passenger quarantine plans 'idiotic' UK airlines warn quarantine will 'kill air travel' Transport secretary Grant Shapps suggested on Monday that the government's plan to quarantine people arriving in the UK for two weeks could include exceptions. He said: ""We should indeed consider further improvements, for example, things like air bridges enabling people from other countries who have themselves achieved lower levels of coronavirus infection to come to the country."" Ms Yates told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that the US may be interested in reopening travel links with the UK. ""Our American regional director is telling us sort of America is ready to go, American business is ready to go. So, possibly, an air bridge between the UK and America might be one that would be valuable to us."" She added that other valuable markets for mutual arrangements also include France, Germany and Italy. Airlines have objected to the government's 14 day quarantine plan which they say will put people off from travelling. Mr Shapps said the quarantine measure, which is set to ""come in early next month"", would initially be a ""blanket situation"". But he said the government was in ""active discussions"" about other options. Number 10 said the two week quarantine measure would be reviewed every three weeks once it is introduced. But Airlines UK, which represents the industry, said reviews need to be done on a more regular basis. ""If the government does insist on doing this, with minimal exemptions in place, we need strict rolling reviews to be enforced so that this policy is not in place a second longer than it needs to be,"" it said.

"Care homes in England were planning their response to the coronavirus pandemic ""with their hands tied"" because data about outbreaks in the sector were not published until the end of April, an industry body has said. Public Health England had counted,externalmore than 4,500 Covid-19 outbreaks in care homes before it issued its findings, figures reveal. The National Care Forum voiced concerns at the data not being shared but PHE said it was used by health protection teams and to brief ministers. Gary Lemin, whose father Roger died from Covid-19 in Cornish care home Roseland Court,told BBC Radio 4's File on 4that a lack of data meant care homes have been ""fighting a losing battle"". He added: ""It makes it very difficult to understand the problem. It's almost as if their lives don't matter as much as anybody else's. ""It's a kind of an indictment of the way that the care system has been seen over this crisis."" More than 11,000 virus deaths in care homes When did care homes go into lockdown? How big is the epidemic in care homes? It comes as figures from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Irelandsuggest more than 11,600 people have died with coronavirusin care homes across the UK since the start of the pandemic. Roger Lemin died with Covid-19 on 6 April - in the same week there were nine outbreaks in Cornwall PHE has been collecting data on the number of both suspected and confirmed outbreaks in English care homes since 9 March. The data shows there were more than 500 Covid-19 outbreaks in care homes in the week beginning 23 March - with this figure increasing to almost 800 the week after. In the week beginning 13 April, there were nearly 1,000 outbreaks in English care homes. The South East region recorded a more than five-fold increase in outbreaks within one week in early March, at a time when other regions' homes had barely registered cases. By the time PHE published the information - on 29 April - there had been more than 4,500 outbreaks in care homes. Vic Rayner, executive director of the National Care Forum, which represents more than 120 not-for-profit care organisations, said: ""The consequences of not having that data are huge. ""It has affected our ability to plan, prioritise, identify early outbreaks and bring in the right level of medical and health expertise. ""Having that overall picture of knowing what's going on is absolutely critical.  I think it's impossible to operate effectively without that."" ""We're now in a terrible game of catch up.""

But the Local Government Association (LGA) confirmed it had not received the data and told the BBC that directors of public health have said it has been ""difficult"" to get postcode level data - and that real-time data sharing has been a problem both nationally and locally. The LGA added: ""Data on testing, deaths and better surveillance will be required as we move into contact tracing and case finding."" James Bullion, director of the Association of Directors of Social Care, said he was not aware of the PHE outbreak figures. He added: ""We were all, as directors, wanting greater distribution, greater understanding and transparency of the data around outbreaks and indeed, around incidents."" PHE said it only published the data in late April after introducing detail about the number of outbreaks at local authority level in order to help support government. A PHE spokesman added: ""PHE's health protection teams play a vital role locally in responding to any outbreak in care homes, providing tailored infection control advice to allow staff to protect themselves and their residents.""

"This video can not be played Trump: ""If it's not good, I'll tell you right, I'm not going to get hurt by it"" US President Donald Trump has said he is taking hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus, despite public health officials warning it may be unsafe. Speaking at the White House, he told reporters he started taking the malaria and lupus medication recently. ""I'm taking it for about a week and a half now and I'm still here, I'm still here,"" was his surprise announcement. There is no evidence hydroxychloroquine can fight coronavirus, and regulators warn the drug may cause heart problems. Dr Marcos Espinal, director of the Pan American Health Organization - part of the World Health Organization (WHO) - has also since stressed that no clinical trials have recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus. The 73-year-old president was hosting a meeting devoted to the struggling restaurant industry on Monday, when he caught reporters unawares by revealing he was taking the drug. ""You'd be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers before you catch it, the frontline workers, many, many are taking it,"" he told reporters. ""I happen to be taking it."" Asked what was his evidence of hydroxychloroquine's positive benefits, Mr Trump said: ""Here's my evidence: I get a lot of positive calls about it."" What's known about anti-malarial drugs and Covid-19? The unproven 'corona drug' US is threatening India for Coronavirus: Where are cases still rising? He added: ""I've heard a lot of good stories [about hydroxychloroquine] and if it's not good, I'll tell you right I'm not going to get hurt by it."" Though some people in the White House have tested positive for coronavirus, the president said again on Monday he had ""zero symptoms"" and was being tested frequently. He added that he had been taking a daily zinc supplement and received a single dose of azithromycin, an antibiotic meant to prevent infection. When asked whether the White House physician had recommended he start taking the disputed remedy, Mr Trump said he himself had requested it. Dr Sean Conley, physician to the president, said in a statement issued through the White House later on Monday that Mr Trump was in ""very good health"" and ""symptom-free"". The US Navy officer added: ""After numerous discussions he and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks."" The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last month issued an advisory saying that hydroxychloroquine has ""not been shown to be safe and effective"". It cited reports that the drug can cause serious heart rhythm problems in Covid-19 patients. The FDA warned against use of the medication outside hospitals, where the agency has granted temporary authorisation for its use in some cases. Clinical trials of the drug are also under way. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says there are no approved drugs or therapeutics to prevent or treat Covid-19, which is confirmed to have infected more than 1.5 million people in the US, killing more than 90,000 patients. I'll have what President Trump's having. No thanks - or rather, not yet. Currently there is no convincing evidence that hydroxychloroquine helps fight the virus and it can cause unpleasant and harmful side effects in some people. In theory, repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus is a very good and sound idea (unlike Mr Trump's previous ones about injecting disinfectant or hitting the body with ""tremendous"" UV light). It may be our only hope, at least in the short term, until a vaccine can be found. The UK government has been stockpiling some medicines that might be useful against coronavirus.That includes 16m hydroxychloroquine tablets,external. Clinical trials are under way in the UK and the US to assess the drug's worth. The human guinea pigs taking part include frontline healthcare workers at high risk of exposure to the virus, as well as patients. Experts agree that this work is worth doing, but they are concerned about advocating more general use of these experimental treatments before the proof is in. Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds, told me: ""People that follow the president's example might not only endanger themselves but could also deprive patients with chronic autoimmune conditions of their much-needed medication."" Dismissing reports of severe side effects from hydroxychloroquine, the president said: ""All I can tell you is, so far I seem to be OK."" He said the ""only negative"" he had heard was from a ""very unscientific report"" conducted by ""people that aren't big Trump fans"". Mr Trump was apparently referring to a preliminary study from April of Covid-19 patients in US government-run hospitals for military veterans that suggested hydroxychloroquine had no benefit and may have even caused a greater rate of deaths. ""I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy,"" the president told reporters, adding: ""What do you have to lose?"" According to doctors, the drug has the potential to cause symptoms including heart failure, suicidal thoughts and signs of liver disease. This video can not be played What's it like to fast for Ramadan as a healthcare worker during the pandemic? Mr Trump's most powerful elected antagonist, the Democratic Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, could not resist taking a dig at his age and weight when asked on CNN about him taking the malaria medication. ""He's our president and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group - morbidly obese, they say,"" she said. Last year, the White House physician noted in Mr Trump's annual medical exam that he weighed 243lb (110kg) and was 6ft 3in, which would score his body mass index at a technically obese 30.4. Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called Mr Trump's decision ""reckless"" but added: ""Who knows if it's true?"" ""He may not have been taking it for all we know. He just likes to make a splash,"" he told MSNBC. ""Maybe he's really not taking it,"" he continued, ""because the president lies about things characteristically-like.""

"Young people are most likely to have lost work or seen their income drop because of Covid-19, a report suggests. More than one in three 18 to 24-year-olds is earning less than before the outbreak, research by the Resolution Foundation claims. It said younger workers risk their pay being affected for years, while older staff may end up involuntarily retired. The number of people in the UKclaiming and receiving unemployment benefit soared last month. The figure went up by 856,500 to 2.097 million in April, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Separate ONS figures showed UK unemployment rose by 50,000 to 1.35 million in the three months to March. Jonathan Athow, from the ONS, said employment ""held up well"" in March, but hours worked ""fell sharply"" towards the end of the month - particularly in areas like hospitality and construction. Young people tend to be hardest hit by economic slumps. University of Portsmouth student Emily Isaacs, 20, was working at a kennels near her family home in Ashford, Kent, during the holidays before lockdown began. But with the business temporarily closed, she says the ""future is unclear"" and she worries the loss of income could have a knock-on effect on her business studies degree. ""Having the job meant I didn't have to stress about money and I could focus on my studies,"" she said. ""I don't really want to be worrying in my final year - which is stressful enough with my dissertation coming up. ""I'm still paying for my student accommodation and will have to next year as well, even if they continue with non-contact teaching. The deposit and first month's rent is due next month. ""I've moved back with my parents to try and save and I'm looking for work but a lot of jobs out there aren't the sort I can apply for because some of my family are vulnerable [to Covid-19]. ""I'm just hopeful I can find something when I'm back in Portsmouth."" Around a quarter of 18 to 24-year-oldshave been furloughed- meaning they do not work but their firms keep them on their books and the government covers 80% of their wages. A further 9% have lost their jobs altogether - the highest figure out of all age groups. Industries that traditionally employ younger staff such as pubs, restaurants and leisure centres have remained shut throughout the UK's eight-week lockdown, as have many shops. Huge rise in people claiming unemployment benefit A visual guide to the economic impact 'Losing my job pushed me to set up a business' Six money-saving ideas for lockdown Employees across all age groups were found to be more likely to earn less than they did in January than earn more. Those aged 35 to 44 were the least likely to have been furloughed or lost their jobs, with around 15% experiencing this since the outbreak began. Ms Coffey told the BBC's Today programme that the UK should be prepared for the unemployment rate to ""increase significantly"". She said the government is focusing on the younger generation as part of efforts to get people back into work. Asked about the claim that their incomes could be scarred for years to come, she said: ""I think it's too early to say anything like that at all."" She added that there are still vacancies available in areas such as retail and agricultural work, but that opportunities will vary around the country.

""In the coming months, many thousands of people will be needed to bring in the crops. It will be hard graft but is hugely important,"" he said. The video was recorded in the vegetable garden of Prince Charles' home in Scotland The Resolution Foundation, which studies earnings of lower and middle income-workers, surveyed more than 6,000 UK adults at the beginning of May. The Health Foundation, the charity which funded the research, says it was concerned that the current crisis is magnifying already-precarious employment conditions young people face. However, the report found the scale of pay reductions during the crisis would have been greater were it not for the government's job retention scheme. The furlough scheme covers 80% of workers' pay up to Â£2,500 per monthand was recently extended to October. Latest government figures show eight million jobs have been furloughed so far - at a cost of about Â£11bn. However,campaigners said it has made ""no difference""to the thousands of people who initially fell through the cracks.

"The government is considering introducing an extra bank holiday, possibly in October around the time of half-term. The idea was put forward by the UK's tourism agency Visit Britain. Its acting head, Patricia Yates, told MPs on Tuesday the industry had lost the benefit of two bank holidays in May because of the coronavirus lockdown. The government did, however, warn that having an extra break could have an economic downside. Downing Street said the government was supporting the tourism industry through this ""challenging period"" and would ""respond in due course"" to the proposal by Visit Britain. A spokesman said it was ""worth acknowledging that extra bank holidays do come with economic costs"". Ms Yates said an extra day in October would enable the UK tourism sector to extend the season. She said the industry could not keep up with developments and it was very difficult to estimate the amount that would be lost because of the coronavirus lockdown. She told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee: ""Every time we do the modelling the figures get worse. So for inbound, I mean we were looking at the beginning of this year at about Â£26.6bn coming from inbound tourism, we reckon a Â£15bn drop on that."" She said ordinarily, the domestic tourists contributed some Â£80bn a year, but she was expecting that to be down by Â£22bn. Ms Yates was one of a number of representatives from Britain's tourism industry appearing before the committee. She told the committee: ""To get British tourism up and running this summer is hugely important as we need that domestic audience."" Currently, overnight stays are not allowed in the UK. Hotels will not be opened until July at the earliest under the Government's lockdown plans. Ms Yates said a survey showed confidence was very low, and 74% of those who have a holiday booked between July and September did not think that holiday would take place. UK Hospitality the trade group that represents leisure businesses from bars to hotels, approve of the move, but struck a note of caution. Its chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said: ""A bank holiday in October may provide a welcome boost for hospitality businesses, not least at a time when consumer confidence will hopefully be returning to healthy levels. ""However, we are still some way from knowing what the sector will look like. A lot depends on whether businesses are able to open safely and whether the Government continues to support businesses who need it."" Less than a fifth of people in the UK were thinking of booking a holiday for the summer, compared with 43% in Italy. Ideas for the eventual reopening of overseas tourism are also being mooted. At present, popular European destinations including France, Spain and Portugal all impose a 14-day quarantine for visitors, the length of a typical holiday break. The UK is also planning a two-week quarantine period for those entering the country. On Monday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, said thegovernment was looking at so-called ""airbridges"" with countriesthat have low infection rates, which would mean easier entry for certain countries. Greece, which has low coronavirus numbers, has been pressing for easier entry for Greeks, and offered reciprocal arrangements for UK residents.

"The number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits in Wales leapt in April, the first full month of the coronavirus lockdown. There were 103,869 claimants compared with 58,576 in March. It took the claimant rate from 3.9% of the Welsh workforce to 6.8%, compared with 5.8% across the UK. The UK total soared to 2.1 million in April, an increase of 856,500, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Economy Minister Ken Skates said: ""This crisis has placed incredible challenges on our economy, and around the world there are signs of record contractions and significant unemployment."" Figures for January to March also showed unemployment at 3.2%, compared with 3.9% across the UK, an increase in Wales of 4,000 more than between October and December. The three-month figures only cover the first week of the lockdown and the total is likely to worsen sharply in the coming months. Welsh manufacturers expect âgradualâ return 'I set up a business in lockdown' They show that that there were 44,000 fewer people working in Wales in the first three months of this year compared with the same period in 2019. The benefit claimant count from the Office of National Statistics does not include everyone who is out of work, since not everyone is entitled to claim assistance, but it does indicate the trend in the employment market. Apart from Northern Ireland, Wales has the highest proportion of 16-64 year olds (23%) who are not working and not able to work, for instance because of ill health, caring for someone or being a student. Student Alaw Davies (right) said employer graduation schemes have been cancelled due to Covid-19 School leavers and university graduates will find it harder to find work this year, according to the Institute for Student Employers (ISE) which said almost a quarter (23%) of entry-level jobs had been cut across Britain as a result of Covid-19. Alaw Davies, 22, from Cardiff, who is in her final year at University College London, said she had applied for a number of graduate schemes which have since been cancelled. ""I was hoping to enter the working sector as soon as possible after finishing my studies in May, so I've applied for many roles, all without luck, which I was expecting to some extent,"" she said. ""I think most people find the period after graduation a bit uncertain, but this pandemic has definitely increased this uncertainty."" Student Dan Clarke and apprentice Gwern Rowlands share their experiences The situation is also difficult for people like 19-year-old Cardiff gap year student Dan Clarke who had to return from Japan due to the pandemic. ""With school and universities shut there are a lot of young people looking for jobs at the moment, therefore it's very competitive and I've had trouble finding a job in Cardiff,"" he said. 'Losing my job pushed me to set up a business' Young people 'most likely to lose job' in lockdown Apprentice woodworker Gwern Rowlands, 18 from Llanuwchllyn in Gwynedd, has had to stop his college training due to social distancing rules. ""I'm still young so, hopefully, I've still got plenty of time to learn,"" he said. ""Hopefully when I'm starting out on my own coronavirus will be gone."" Today's claimant count statistics show what happened in the labour market 10 days after lockdown. They are the most dramatic figures we have had so far about the economic impact of strategies to combat coronavirus. Additionally, they are actual numbers of people in Wales who are getting benefits because they are out of work whereas unemployment figures are based on a survey. It must be remembered that they are a short-term snapshot and could be reversed. However, what is not known is how many of the workers presently furloughed and paid 80% to stay at home will be taken back into work, and how many will lose their jobs when the furlough scheme is reduced or comes to an end. Figures also published today by the ONS show a steep fall in the number of job vacancies across the UK. Between February and April they fell 170,000 to 637,000, a record fall across three months. While today's unemployment figures for the first three months of 2020 showed an increase of 4,000 in the total for Wales, and a rate of 3.2%, the same set of statistics published next month are likely to see a greater increase.

"It is ""not obvious there will be an immediate bounceback"" for the UK economy, once lockdown restrictions are eased, the chancellor has warned. Rishi Sunak said he hoped for a swift recovery, but it could take time for the UK economy to get back to normal. ""It takes time for people to get back to the habits that they had, there are still restrictions in place,"" he said. His warning came as figures showed the number of people claiming unemployment benefit soared to 2.1 million in April. The jump of 856,500 claims in April reflected the impact of the first full month of lockdown, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The government has made some changes to who can claim work-related benefits during the pandemic, but this figure is one of a series that show the stress Covid-19 is putting on the jobs market. Speaking to the Lords Economic Affairs Committee, Mr Sunak said figures from around the world where countries were progressively easing and lifting restrictions, suggested a full recovery could take time. He said the ""question that occupies"" his mind was ""what degree of long-term scarring is there on the economy"" and that once restrictions begin to be lifted there will be the case of ""what do we return to"" and on that the ""jury's out"". But he admitted he felt ""all economic forecasters and economists would agree the longer the recession is, it is likely the degree of that scarring will be greater"". He said that even if the government can reopen retail in England as planned on the 1 June, there will still be restrictions on how people can shop. This will have an impact on how much they spend, and on how many people go out, Mr Sunak said. ""I think in all cases it will take a little bit of time for things to get back to normal, even once we've reopened currently closed sectors,"" Mr Sunak added. Seven charts on the coronavirus jobs market 'Losing my job pushed me to set up a business' When quizzed on unemployment by the committee, Mr Sunak said he did not have a precise estimate for what the numbers would be at the end of the year. However, he said: ""Obviously, the impact [of the coronavirus pandemic] will be severe."" Before the lockdown began, employment had hit a record high. In another indication of the bleak employment landscape, the number of job vacancies fell by nearly a quarter to 637,000 in the three months to April. Meanwhile, claims for universal credit - the benefit for working-age people in the UK - hita record monthly levelin the early weeks of lockdown. Unemployed HR worker Jon Ellis-Fleming, of Keighley in West Yorkshire, had been with an outsourcing company for more than four years when he was made redundant. He left the firm on 8 March, hoping to spend some time at home with his partner Julia Paterson and their eight-month-old daughter Daisy while looking for a new job. ""The week after I officially left the company, Covid hit,"" he told the BBC. That meant that several promising job offers just evaporated as firms put their recruitment plans on hold. Jon applied for universal credit and jobseeker's allowance. He is due to receive his first payment of Â£600 later this month, while his partner receives Â£650 a month on maternity leave. That leaves them with less than half of their former income - and with another mouth to feed as well. ""I've not been out of work in 10 years,"" he said. ""I've never had any intention of being out of work that long. ""I can't help but wonder, if I'd been with the company two weeks longer, would furloughing have been an option?"" The unemployment rate was estimated at 3.9%, slightly down on the previous quarter,the ONS said.,external The jobless figures only cover the first week of the lockdown and they are expected to worsen sharply in the coming months. Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, told the BBC: ""We can reasonably expect unemployment to rise very quickly to something over 10% - something we haven't seen since the early 1990s."" Estimates based on returns for individual weeks suggest that the fall in the unemployment rate was mostly caused by the decrease in hours in the last week of March, with a much smaller decrease in the previous week, the ONS said. In the final week of March, the total number of hours worked was about 25% fewer than in other weeks within the quarter. The government's jobs schemes succeeded in keeping the headline jobs numbers high, and jobless data still quite low up until the end of March. But there is evidence of the pandemic crisis impact starting to hit in the latest ONS jobs market release. The number of job vacancies from February to April tumbled by 170,000 to 637,000 - a record quarterly fall. The claimant count jumped in April, while the average hours worked in a week fell sharply at the end of March. So the signs of a significant downturn in the normal jobs market are there, but as is the impact of the extraordinary government support package. Unemployment would have shot through the roof without this support. However, these numbers will get worse with next month's figures. The vacancy drop shows there are fewer jobs out there for those who do lose work. And there are real concerns as to what happens when the support starts to be phased away in August.

It took the claimant rate from 3.9% of the Welsh workforce to 6.8%, compared with 5.8% across the UK. The UK total soared to 2.1 million in April, an increase of 856,500, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Economy Minister Ken Skates said: ""This crisis has placed incredible challenges on our economy, and around the world there are signs of record contractions and significant unemployment."" Figures for January to March also showed unemployment at 3.2%, compared with 3.9% across the UK, an increase in Wales of 4,000 more than between October and December. The three-month figures only cover the first week of the lockdown and the total is likely to worsen sharply in the coming months. Welsh manufacturers expect âgradualâ return 'I set up a business in lockdown' They show that that there were 44,000 fewer people working in Wales in the first three months of this year compared with the same period in 2019. The benefit claimant count from the Office of National Statistics does not include everyone who is out of work, since not everyone is entitled to claim assistance, but it does indicate the trend in the employment market. Apart from Northern Ireland, Wales has the highest proportion of 16-64 year olds (23%) who are not working and not able to work, for instance because of ill health, caring for someone or being a student. Student Alaw Davies (right) said employer graduation schemes have been cancelled due to Covid-19 School leavers and university graduates will find it harder to find work this year, according to the Institute for Student Employers (ISE) which said almost a quarter (23%) of entry-level jobs had been cut across Britain as a result of Covid-19. Alaw Davies, 22, from Cardiff, who is in her final year at University College London, said she had applied for a number of graduate schemes which have since been cancelled. ""I was hoping to enter the working sector as soon as possible after finishing my studies in May, so I've applied for many roles, all without luck, which I was expecting to some extent,"" she said. ""I think most people find the period after graduation a bit uncertain, but this pandemic has definitely increased this uncertainty."" Student Dan Clarke and apprentice Gwern Rowlands share their experiences The situation is also difficult for people like 19-year-old Cardiff gap year student Dan Clarke who had to return from Japan due to the pandemic. ""With school and universities shut there are a lot of young people looking for jobs at the moment, therefore it's very competitive and I've had trouble finding a job in Cardiff,"" he said. 'Losing my job pushed me to set up a business' Young people 'most likely to lose job' in lockdown Apprentice woodworker Gwern Rowlands, 18 from Llanuwchllyn in Gwynedd, has had to stop his college training due to social distancing rules. ""I'm still young so, hopefully, I've still got plenty of time to learn,"" he said. ""Hopefully when I'm starting out on my own coronavirus will be gone."" Today's claimant count statistics show what happened in the labour market 10 days after lockdown. They are the most dramatic figures we have had so far about the economic impact of strategies to combat coronavirus. Additionally, they are actual numbers of people in Wales who are getting benefits because they are out of work whereas unemployment figures are based on a survey. It must be remembered that they are a short-term snapshot and could be reversed. However, what is not known is how many of the workers presently furloughed and paid 80% to stay at home will be taken back into work, and how many will lose their jobs when the furlough scheme is reduced or comes to an end. Figures also published today by the ONS show a steep fall in the number of job vacancies across the UK. Between February and April they fell 170,000 to 637,000, a record fall across three months. While today's unemployment figures for the first three months of 2020 showed an increase of 4,000 in the total for Wales, and a rate of 3.2%, the same set of statistics published next month are likely to see a greater increase.

"Wales lockdown rules are stricter than other parts of the UK Wales' health minister is considering whether people should be able to meet loved ones who are not already in their household outdoors. The next review of the Welsh Government's lockdown rules is due next week, on 28 May. It comes as new advice said the virus is ""very likely to decay very quickly"" when exposed to sunlight. Vaughan Gething said ministers were having a ""very real debate"". In Northern Ireland, groups of up to six people who do not share a household are being allowed to meet outdoors - in England people can meet one other person from outside their household outdoors. It is not expected any decision would be made before the lockdown review is completed. Meanwhile Mr Gething admitted that a new testing system is experiencing ""teething problems"" - after Wales joined a UK-wide scheme allowing members of the public with symptoms to have tests at home. Use common sense to see loved ones â Raab Jump in number claiming out-of-work benefits Arts groups 'losing Â£1.4m a week' The Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (TAC), in a paper published on Tuesday and dated 12 May, said coronavirus ""is very likely to decay very quickly (a few minutes) in air and on surfaces when exposed to sunlight. ""This adds to the evidence that outdoor environments are highly likely to be a lower risk for transmission,"" it says. The same paper, however, said the rate at which coronavirus is reproducing in Wales ""increased slightly"" last week. TAC said the consensus view was that R in Wales was between 0.7 and 1 - up from between 0.7 and 0.9. The Welsh Government has said it wants to keep R below one. The paper adds that while R is ""almost certain to be under 1, it could be close to it"". Explaining the increase, it said it is because ""the number of cases in the community is decreasing while the number in, or seeded by, care homes or hospitals remains broadly flat"". ""As a result, hospital or care home cases represent a higher proportion of total cases. This means that the rate at which the overall epidemic is shrinking has slowed."" Vaughan Gething spoke at the daily Welsh Government press conference People in Wales are not currently permitted to travel to see friends or family that do not live in their household. Asked at the daily Welsh Government press conference if the advice was a reason to allow the public to meet loved ones outdoors, Mr Gething said the evidence was ""developing"". ""So we need to think about what that then means, not just about being outside, but who you are outside with and the level of contact you have,"" he said. They are ""active considerations"", he said. Mr Gething said TAC's evidence helps to inform the ""very real debate that ministers are having with our advisors on how we continue to take a deliberately cautious approach"". He added he did not want to risk ""the health and safety of the people of Wales"" or throw away ""the hard won gains the people of Wales have delivered"". The original 'stay home' advice in Wales has been maintained On Monday the Welsh Government joined a UK-wide testing portal and home testing scheme, allowing people aged five and over to be tested if they have symptoms. But on Tuesday morning the portal showed no testing kits were available - although that changed by the evening. Testing sites in Wales could also not be booked for the general public, but could for key workers. Mr Gething said they would seek to understand ""teething problems"" in the system. ""We anticipate there will be a high level of demand for home testing kits over the first few days."" ""The UK government has confirmed priority will be given to home testing kits for critical workers and it will be working to increase home testing capacity for the public."" Home testing is a key part of the Welsh Government's plans for tracing coronavirus contacts, so people can be isolated if they are infected. Mr Gething announced the system will be piloted in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg, Powys, Betsi Cadwaladr and Hywel Dda health board areas. ""Each pilot will be delivered by a local authority and their staff,"" the minister said. Mr Gething said the trials would run for two weeks and would be ""small scale"".

"Clothes shops are ramping up plans to reopen with potentially big discounts. In England, some non-essential retailers will be able to begin reopening next month. One of the UK's biggest fashion retailers, Marks and Spencer, said: ""We are working towards reopening more space from June."" But analyst Richard Lim of Retail Economics said stores ""will have to discount heavily"" to sell excess stock that may now be out of season. ""Many clothing retailers have been sitting there with stores full of stock which they haven't be able to shift,"" he said. ""One of the most pressing issues for retailers is working capital and there is a huge overhang of inventory at fashion stores."" Fashion retailers have been badly hit by the coronavirus crisis. Even those with robust online offerings have reported huge drops in sales. Next, for instance, saw online sales decline by 32% in the three months to the end of April. Like others, it is keen to re-open stores, as soon as it is deemed safe to do so. Next said: ""We have plans in place for the re-purposing of our stores ready to reopen in a socially-distanced world."" Its measures include installing screens at tills, placing sanitisation stations in stores and managing the number of customers that are allowed to enter its shops. M&S has kept its food stores open during the crisis, including almost 300 shops that sell fashion as well, although these areas have been blocked off. But it says they're ready to be reopened as soon as the government gives it the green light. ""Our 290 stores that sell both clothing and food are led by a single manager - so it means they already have a brilliant working knowledge of the necessary hygiene measures, how to manage social distancing and the flow of our customers in and out of their store,"" M&S said. Last week the government said its strategy was to ""open non-essential retail when and where it is safe to do so"", and subject to those retailers being able to follownew guidelines,external. It said the intention was for this to happen in phases from 1 June, although it added that it would issue further guidance on which businesses will be allowed to open and when. That guidance can't come soon enough, according to Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC). ""Retailers desperately need clarity in the rules regarding when and how they can open - details that are still lacking,"" she said. She warned that safety must be the primary concern in the decisions, rather than size or type of shop. The retail experience is going to be turned on its head when clothes stores reopen,"" predicted Mr Lim from Retail Economics. ""Retailers are having to reinterpret government guidelines and have to invest heavily to make sure they can create a safe environment."" He said consumers will remain incredibly anxious and cautious about returning to fashion retailers. Changing rooms are expected to remain closed while customers will be encouraged to avoid touching merchandise. ""Staff will potentially have to walk around spraying shelves,"" Mr Lim said. There are likely to be one-way systems through stores with clear floor markings and signage, while customer entry will be limited and consumers will be encouraged to shop alone. Next said it will ""prioritise the opening of our larger out-of-town stores first"". Their bigger size makes them easier to adapt and they have large car parks and outside spaces to manage queues, it said. There have been long queues at B&Q, which has already opened stores ""Retailers have started to plan how they can open stores and follow safety guidelines, with some hinting at sales when they do open their doors, such as Next,"" said Dan Plant, savings expert at Hotukdeals. ""Other popular stores, like Primark, lack online sales space, so we'd expect to see plenty of fashion offers when retailers reopen."" But while fashion stores may reopen with deep discounts to clear old stock, most online retailers have already been offering sales to encourage shoppers. M&S, for instance, launched its ""rainbow sale"" on Friday with up to 50% off and 10% of takings going to NHS charities. Boohoo, Fat Face, French Connection, Gap, JD Sports , Next, Superdry and Topshop have offered similar 50%-off deals. The likes of Asos, Clarks, Dune, Debenhams, John Lewis, Karen Millen, New Look, Office and Quiz have also been offering cut-price deals.

The British Veterinary Association (BVA) said urgent action was needed to avert practice closures. A survey by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons found half of practices had seen turnover drop by 50% or more, with a quarter losing 75% of business, although these figures did improve in the most recent figures from mid-May. Meleri Wyn Tweed, a vet who cares for small animals in Swansea, has been on the furlough scheme since the lockdown: ""Out of six vets, there are only two working in the practice at the moment, and the turnover has dropped dramatically."" The Welsh Government said it recognised the difficulties and was working with vets to outline support available. Meleri Wyn Tweed has been furloughed but worries about her regular patients Fewer than 10% of childrenat risk of abuse and neglecthave been attending hub schools during lockdown, according to NSPCC Cymru. The Welsh Parliament's Children, Young People and Education Committee was told just 1,000 out of 16,000 vulnerable children have attended school, half of whom are at risk of abuse or neglect. NSPCC Cymru's Vivienne Laing told the committee it was ""very important for vulnerable children to attend these hubs"". ""What we do know is that home is not a safe place for too many children,"" she said. The Welsh Government accepted ""there is still more to do to encourage take-up"", but a spokesman said attendance had improved in recent weeks. All schools in Wales were closed in March in response to the coronavirus pandemic, with hub schools open only for vulnerable children and the children of keyworkers.

Care homes should assume all their residents have Covid-19 if there has been an outbreak, according to government advisors. A report for ministers says it is not always possible to isolate residents with symptoms âwithout causing harm or distressâ. âTherefore, if an outbreak already exists in a care home, there is a need to assume that everyone has the virus and act accordingly, regardless of whether mass testing is applied,â it says. The advice comes from the panel of scientists advising the Welsh Government on how to respond to coronavirus. In a report on care homes, submitted the day before a blanket testing policy was announced, the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) says there is âstrong evidenceâ to support testing all residents and staff in homes with new outbreaks. But it says âthe value of this testing will decrease over time from the point of the outbreak being identifiedâ. It also says it would be âvaluable to test in selected homesâ that appear to be free of the virus, to find out if anyone has been infected without displaying symptoms. Ministers have promised to go further than that, saying on 16 May that swabs will be available for residents and staff at all homes. The TAG report, dated 15 May, says mobile testing units should visit care homes. 

It also says: âThere is some evidence that staff working in more than one care home at a time will increase the risk of infection.â All 60Members of the Senedd(MS) will be able to take part in virtual sittings from June, the Welsh Parliament has said. Only limited numbers have been able to join the Zoom conference calls that have replaced face-to-face meetings in Cardiff Bay. It comes as calls grew for the Senedd to move to the âhybrid modelâ used by the House of Commons, where some MPs go to Parliament and others call-in over the internet. Mandy Jones, Brexit Party MS, said living in a rural part of north Wales âmeans that my internet connection isnât always strong enough to conduct all my work from home"". She said other MSs have also had issues. Former Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies has also called for hybrid sittings. A Senedd spokesman said it will contact Ms Jones to offer any support needed, and added that its IT support team âhas not received any issues relating to broadband from MSsâ. A 19-year-old woman was been jailed for six months for breaching coronavirus laws after she coughed at a police officer. Kelsey Gouldie, of Holyhead, pleaded guilty to breaching Covid-19 regulations and assault of an emergency worker while in custody in Caernarfon. After Mold magistrates sentenced Gouldie, one union called for tougher sentences on what it describes as a ""frankly, filthy and despicable"" crime. ""We are continuing to see a growing trend of these types of incidents so clearly the message isnât getting through,"" said North Wales Police Federation general secretary Mark Jones ""We implore the government and judiciary to work on introducing sentences that actually act as a deterrent to would be offenders."" The total number of coronavirus deaths in Wales is now 1,224. The Aneurin Bevan health board is the Welsh health board with the highest number - 260, while Cwm Taf is second with 256.

""We anticipate there will be a high level of demand for home testing kits over the first few days."" ""The UK government has confirmed priority will be given to home testing kits for critical workers and it will be working to increase home testing capacity for the public."" Home testing is a key part of the Welsh Government's plans for tracing coronavirus contacts, so people can be isolated if they are infected. Mr Gething announced the system will be piloted in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg, Powys, Betsi Cadwaladr and Hywel Dda health board areas. ""Each pilot will be delivered by a local authority and their staff,"" the minister said. Mr Gething said the trials would run for two weeks and would be ""small scale"".

"The Labour government has announced a series of measures to get more people into jobs, arguing that it has inherited a country that ""isn't working"". Its plans, announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, include overhauling the health and disability benefits system and improving mental health support. About a quarter of the working age population - those aged 16 to 64 - do not currently have a job. That's about 11 million people. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS),4.3% of people were unemployed in the period between July and September 2024,external, which is about 1.5 million people. While this figure has risen over the last two years, unemployment remains relatively low by historical standards. However, the unemployed represent only a small part of the nearly 11 million working-age people who don't have a paid job. About 9.3 million of them are not called ""unemployed"". That is because they are not actively looking for work, or available to start a job. Insteadpeople in this group are called ""economically inactive"",external. In fact, more of them say they want a job - 1.9 million people - than are officially unemployed - 1.5 million. That means there are far more people who say they are available to or want to work than there are vacancies - 0.8 million. And thenumber of vacancies,externalhas been falling consistently for the last two years. It varies according to age. ONS figures for 2023 show that most of the 2.7 million ""inactive"" under-25s were students. The majority of them did not want a job. You can see that in the graphic below. Click on the darker border surrounding any age group to see the spilt between men and women. Your device may not support this visualisation Things are different in other age groups. Among 25- to 49-year-olds, 1.1 million people did not work because of caring responsibilities, about a million of whom are women. Nearly one million people in this age group were not working because of illness - more evenly split between men and women. The main reasons that 3.5 million over-50s were out of the job market were illness and early retirement. Almost nobody who retired early said they wanted to return to work. Aroundhalf of people with disabilities,externaldid not have a paid job, a rate that is more than double the rest of the working-age population. Less than a quarter of those who were sick or caring said they wanted a job. Sick people leaving workforce at record highs Many people are not looking for work because they are studying, caring or have retired. Some people want to work but cannot, either becausechildcare is too expensiveor they are not well enough. As the chart below shows, caring responsibilities and ill-health are the most common reasons for inactivity given by those who would like a paid job. Chart on the reason inactive people wanting to work don't The number of people not working has a broader effect. A smaller workforce means the government raises lessincome tax and National Insurance, which it uses to pay for services like the NHS. It may also spend more on benefits. Since people on benefits generally have less money than those in work, it also means less spending on the high street. That in turn is bad for businesses, and can affect how many people they employ, which can mean there are fewer jobs for those who do want to work. During the Covid pandemic, all major countries saw their workforce shrink. But while many other leading economies have since recovered, the UK still has more people out of its workforce than it did in 2019. There is a debate about how much of this is down toproblems with how we work out how many people are inactive,external. Before Covid, the UK's ""inactivity rate"" was the second lowest inthe G7 club of leading economies, behind Japan. The increase in the inactive population since then, if accurate, would now place the UK behind the US, France and Italy. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility,external- which assesses how well the UK economy is doing - has suggested that ill-health has consistently been a bigger factor in the UK than in other advanced economies. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hasset out a plan to get two million more people into work. The proposals include: overhauling the health and disability benefits system to better support people to get jobs and stay in work rebranding job centres as the National Jobs and Careers Service offering every 18 to 21-year-old in England an apprenticeship, training or education opportunities or help to find a job as part of a new ""Youth Guarantee"" an independent review of what UK employers are doing to promote health and inclusive workplaces providing more money for the North East, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire to stop people leaving work because of ill health expanding mental-health support and efforts to tackle obesity. The prime minister said the reforms would ""put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven't been getting the support they need to get back to work"". But many details of what they will mean in practice have not been confirmed, and a review of sickness benefits will not begin until 2025. The proposals follow widespread criticism from businesses thatthe increase in National Insurance announced in the Budget, coupled withthe rise in the minimum wage, will make it harder for them to create new jobs. Companies warn this will undermine the government's goal of increasing the working population.

"The government's ability to test people for coronavirus has been ""inadequate"" throughout the pandemic, a committee of MPs has said. The Science and Technology Committee said capacity had not been increased ""early or boldly enough"". It said a lack of capacity had driven initial decisions in mid-March to scale back contact tracing and largely restrict tests to hospital patients. No 10 said testing had since been expanded on ""an unprecedented scale"". Committee chairman Greg Clark said ministers would need to ""apply the lessons"" from the ""slowness"" of increases to testing to other areas. In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Conservative MP added that capacity ""drove strategy, rather than strategy driving capacity"". But Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the government could look on the ramp up of testing capacity ""with pride"". Five and overs in UK now eligible for virus test Who is being tested in the UK? Scientists publish coronavirus advice to ministers The UK significantly increased its testing capacity throughout April, although it has previously faced criticism it was initially too slow to do so. A target for 100,000 daily tests was initially met on 1 May, but then missed for eight consecutive days after that before being met again on 10 May. On Monday, after 100,678 tests were provided in the previous 24 hours, ministers  announced another expansion in eligibility, with everyone aged five and over now able to get tested if they show symptoms. Increasing testing capacity has also been seen as crucial in allowing a mass programme to track infected people using an NHS app, which ministerswant to launch UK-wide""in the coming weeks"".

AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash In his letter, Mr Clark laid out several recommendations to ministers. He accused Public Health England (PHE) of initially opting to ""concentrate"" tests in a limited number of its own laboratories and only expanding capacity ""gradually"". He said that had led to the decision to initially abandon contact-tracing as a strategy on 12 March, and meant care home residents could not be tested when the virus was spreading at its fastest rate. He added that evidence taken by his committee from experts in South Korea, Hong Kong and Germany had shown the need for mass testing was ""identifiable from the beginning"". Mr Clark told BBC News: ""There are going to be mistakes made as we are operating in a fog on uncertainty, and they will be made by ministers, by officials and by scientists. ""The crucial thing now is there will be decisions to be taken in the weeks and months ahead - for example, the roll-out of antibody tests and we hope a vaccine - and we have to be able to learn the lessons so far."" In response to the letter, PHE said it was ""not responsible"" for the UK's testing strategy, which ""has been led by the Department of Health and Social Care"". Its chief executive Duncan Selbie added that ""any testing facility with the right technology and containment"" could conduct the test it approved after security restrictions were lowered on 3 March. ""PHE did not constrain or seek to control any laboratory either public, university or commercial from conducting testing,"" he added. Ms Coffey said she recognised there was ""little capacity"" for testing at the beginning of the outbreak as it was ""solely based"" on the PHE's reach. But she told BBC Breakfast: ""From pretty much a standing start... to get to a capacity and actual tests being done of 100,000 within about six weeks, I think is pretty full-on and actually I think something we can look on with pride."" The committee also said the transparency of scientific advice to ministers needed to be improved, and called for summaries of advice to be published ""now and regularly"". It added that while some scientific papers discussed by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) had been published, 92 out of the current total of 120 had yet to be made public. A statement from Downing Street said that testing rates had increased ""on an unprecedented scale"" from 2,000 per day at the start of March to more than 100,000 in May. ""Now everyone aged five and over who has symptoms and needs a test can get one - and we will continue to build this capacity,"" it added. ""This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided at all times by the best scientific advice.""

"More than 11,600 people have died from coronavirus in care homes across the UK since the start of the pandemic, figures suggest. But for the second week running, the review of death certificates by statisticians showed the number of new deaths has fallen. In the week to 8 May, there were 1,940 care home deaths linked to coronavirus  - down from 2,800 the week before. Overall, care home deaths account for over a quarter of the virus fatalities. How big is the epidemic in care homes? When did care homes go into lockdown? The head of the organisation which represents care homes in England has strongly criticised the government's approach to dealing with coronavirus among elderly residents. Giving evidence to the Health and Social Care Committee, Professor Martin Green criticised the lack of personal protection equipment, poor organisation and constantly changing guidance - and suggested some care homes could now ""go under"". But speaking in the House of Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the care sector had received unprecedented levels of support during the crisis. Meanwhile, the total number of deaths from all causes across society has fallen too, according to the Office for National Statistics  and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland. These are seen as the best measure of the impact of the lockdown as it takes into account both deaths linked to coronavirus and other deaths that could be a result of the lockdown. There were 14,400 deaths during the week - around a third of which were linked to coronavirus. This is down from a weekly peak of nearly 25,000 at the height of the pandemic - although it is still above what would be expected at this time of year. It means since the pandemic started there have now been 55,000 extra deaths. The daily figures released by the government just look at deaths among people with a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The government has been receiving heavy criticism for the impact of coronavirus in care homes. Alongside the coronavirus deaths, there are significant numbers of unexplained fatalities. Across Great Britain, you would normally expect to see around 2,800 deaths a week. But at the peak of the pandemic in care homes in the second half of April there were around three times as many deaths. Only around half the increase was attributed to coronavirus. The other deaths could be related to the indirect costs of the pandemic, such as not getting care for other conditions like heart disease and strokes. Another factor could be that the true number of coronavirus deaths have been under-reported as the lack of testing available to care homes may have meant doctors were not able to identify the presence of the virus. Answering an urgent question in the House of Commons, Mr Hancock claimed ministers have done everything they can to protect care homes. The health secretary said a ""protective ring"" has been thrown around care homes, adding that nearly two-thirds of care homes had not seen outbreaks. But the sector has questioned the support, criticising the lack of protective equipment and testing available - despite the expansion of testing it will still be another three weeks before all staff and residents will have been tested. James Bullion, from the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said both issues still remain a problem. ""The care workforce is 1.6 million. We are nowhere near the level of testing that is required."" Jennifer Dixon, of the Health Foundation think tank, said action by the government had come ""too late"". ""The approach to social care stands in contrast to the NHS which saw a much fuller and swifter response to the pandemic."" Mike Padgham, of the Independent Care Group, which represents care homes, said ""serious questions"" needed to be asked, calling for a public inquiry once the pandemic is over. Responding to reports care homes had felt pressured to take patients from hospital and that had contributed to the spread of the virus, Downing Street said that ""no care home should be forced to take back recovering coronavirus patients"" if they feel they cannot provide appropriate care. The prime minister's spokesman added the NHS was now testing all people leaving hospital in advance of their discharge to care homes.

"Some imams have broadcast their sermons after mosques were closed during the lockdown Muslims in the UK have been urged to celebrate the Islamic festival of Eid at home under lockdown this weekend. Traditionally the festival at the end of the fasting month of Ramadan is marked with communal prayers in mosques, visits to friends and family. But the Muslim Council of Britain says people should celebrate virtually due to social-distancing measures brought in during the coronavirus pandemic. Guidelines for those celebrating have been drawn up by the council. The special Eid al-Fitr prayers are typically among the best attended of the year, and people also mark the occasion by holding parties. However, due to the pandemic, mosques have been closed for nine weeks. Fasting for Ramadan safely during coronavirus Advice issued for spending Ramadan in lockdown Miqdaad Versi, head of public affairs at the MCB - an umbrella organisation of various UK Muslim bodies - says there was ""real sadness"" at the prospect of not being able to celebrate communally. ""Normally Muslims will be at the mosque, mosques will be thronging with people from the morning and households will not be just be [full] of individuals, but families, extended families and friends all coming together,"" he said. ""So from a religious perspective, that's really difficult. Every single year people get dressed up and go to the mosque and take part in this really important, obligatory for some, part of the faith. And that just won't be possible."" Qari Muhammad Asim, senior imam at the Makkah Masjid in Leeds and chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, said it was the first time in British Muslim history that there will no Eid prayer. ""This is something that was unthinkable six months ago, but today unthinkable has become reality,"" he said. ""The Eid prayer is something that people look forward to all day long,"" he said. ""This is extremely challenging and distressing for us. We have had to make a lot of spiritual sacrifices during Ramadan and that will continue on the day of celebration."" Ramadan, the Islamic holy month, is a special time for nearly two billion Muslims all over the world. In a normal year, it is a time of communal prayer and of daytime fasting from all food and drink. It is also accompanied by night-time feasting and acts of generosity and charity as Muslims reaffirm their faith in God. Sajjad Amin, from the Khizra Mosque in Cheetham Hill, north Manchester, said that while the prospect of Eid al-Fitr under lockdown ""will be difficult, it was probably harder not going to the mosque during Ramadan"". He said: ""It is something we have all done since we were children - whether going to the mosque during the evening to break the fast, or for the regular prayers. All that has been taken away from us. ""So although it is a big disappointment for Eid to be under lockdown, it is something we have gone through with Ramadan. It is difficult but we're kind of used to it."" The MCB has issued separate guidance for Muslims living in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales reflecting the different government advice in each nation. But across Britain, Muslims have been asked to celebrate virtually and share the traditional gifts by posting them in advance. MCB secretary general, Harun Khan, said: ""Whilst Eid away from the mosques and from our loved ones is unprecedented and will be a source of great sadness in communities across the country, Muslim communities will adapt and find the best way to still celebrate this holy day whilst aligning to the latest guidance."" At the beginning of Ramadan, Health Secretary Matt Hancock thanked the British Muslim community for suspending congregational worship and abiding by the lockdown.

"The coronavirus outbreak has left many people in the UK unsure about their income and how they'll get money while we're in lockdown. So BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat has been speaking to experts at Citizens Advice England to find out what you can do if you're worried about paying your bills. If you're unable to pay a utility bill - like gas or electric - you should contact the provider as soon as possible, says Graham O'Malley, debt expert at Citizens Advice. ""Depending on the type of bill, they may be able to arrange a payment plan, or have schemes in place for people in financial hardship,"" he says. If you're struggling to pay more than one bill, you need to prioritise, because the immediate consequences of not keeping up with some bills are more serious. Graham says priorities should include ""arrears on your mortgage, energy bills or council tax."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash New mortgage applications in the UKhave gone into ""partial lockdown""- meaning most won't be processed - and some of the UK's big lenders are allowing borrowers todefer payments by up to three monthson existing mortgages. Energy UK, which represents Energy suppliers, told Newsbeat the industry ""is fully committed to providing all the help and support it can"". And in terms of broadband bills, the Internet Service Provider's Association urged ""any customers who may have trouble paying bills as a result of Covid-19 to speak with their internet service provider."" Sky Sports customers are able topause their subscription,externalfor free, as cancellations havebrought the sporting world to a standstill. ""If you have to take time off work and are not paid, or receive sick pay that is less than your usual wages, you might be entitled to claim benefits,"" says Citizens Advice senior welfare expert Kate Smith. If you're already claiming benefits, these might go up. If you don't get benefits already, you might be able to claim universal credit - a payment that covers things such as housing benefit and jobseeker's allowance. Nearlya million people have appliedfor universal credit benefits in the last two weeks. What is universal credit? Eight ways to manage the financial fallout These BBC Advice pages might be able to help ""If you have paid national insurance contributions regularly for the last couple of years you could qualify for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA),"" Kate adds. ""The government says new claimants suffering from coronavirus, or who are required to stay at home, can be paid from day one of the absence from work."" Yes, talk to your landlord as soon as possible, says Amy Hughes, housing expert at Citizens Advice. ""You should explain the situation and could ask for more time to pay or ask to catch up any missed payments by instalments. ""If you can't come to an agreement with your landlord, it's a good idea to pay what you can afford and keep a record of what you offered. ""You should get advice if you can't reach an agreement because there is a risk that your landlord might try to evict you. In most cases, they'd have to give you notice and get a court order in order to make you leave."" The government has passeda new lawwhich means landlords have to give three months notice to end certain tenancy types from 26 March. ""The court service has suspended all possession action for 90 days from 27 March, which means that even if you have been served a notice for eviction it can't be enforced during this time,"" says Amy. People who live with their landlord might still get evicted, and there are a few other exceptions where a court order isn't required. Tenants 'should get a rent break' ""If you are employed, can't work from home and are following NHS guidance to stay at home because of coronavirus, then you'll be considered unfit for work,"" says Kate Smith, Citizen's Advice's senior welfare expert. ""You will qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) if you usually get it when off work sick."" SSP is currently Â£94.25 a week - that's the minimum amount you can get paid while off sick. ""It's also worth checking your contract - your employer might have its own sickness policy so you could get your usual pay when you're off sick,"" says Kate. ""You're not eligible for statutory sick pay if you are self-employed, but may be able to claim benefits."" There's more advice on sick pay here too.

"Police Scotland has been reported to the Health and Safety Executive by the body which represents rank-and-file officers over the use of breath tests. The Scottish Police Federation (SPF) said it was concerned that officers could be exposed to Covid-19 while conducting drink drive tests. The federation claims testing urine samples would be a ""safer alternative"". But Police Scotland said it is ""meeting, and often exceeding, the relevant guidelines"". The force said it was following the advice and direction of bodies including the HSE and Health Protection Scotland (HPS), and applying a ""comprehensive operational policing risk assessment"". Among the guidelines issued to officers is to conduct all roadside breath tests outside whilst wearing masks and gloves, with the option to use tougher protective equipment if there are concerns a person might have coronavirus. In aletter to SPF members,external, Calum Steele, the body's general secretary, said: ""Police Scotland operational guidance in respect of breath test procedures neither reflects best risk management practices, or properly mitigates risk to officers. ""Colleagues will know from their own experiences that suspects often take several attempts to generate enough lung capacity and technique to be able to successfully comply. ""We are clear that alternative approaches in no way hinder the ability of the police to respond to and detect those who drink and drive, or introduce greater risk to the system of work."" Call for tests for frontline police officers Police record more than 100 coronavirus-related attacks Recorded crime in Scotland down by a quarter since lockdown The SPF, which represents 98% of all officers, said it issued a health and safety improvement notice about the issue to Police Scotland on 30 April. The union claims the force failed to properly engage with the concerns and it was forced to take the ""extraordinary step"" of reporting Scotland's single police force to the HSE. There have been more than 100 coronavirus-related attacks on police officers since the start of the pandemic The SPF wants urine samples used instead of breath tests but added that if this was not deemed possible then full protective equipment, including face masks and goggles, should be worn at all times in the test process. The body's stance is backed by its panel of scientific and medical experts, which includes Scotland's former chief medical officer Sir Harry Burns. Deputy Chief Constable Fiona Taylor said: ""We follow the advice and direction of HPS, the HSE and the National Police Chief's Council and apply a comprehensive operational policing risk assessment when developing guidance for officers and staff. ""Police Scotland is meeting, and often exceeding, the relevant guidelines.""

"Young people are most likely to have lost work or seen their income drop because of Covid-19, a report suggests. More than one in three 18 to 24-year-olds is earning less than before the outbreak, research by the Resolution Foundation claims. It said younger workers risk their pay being affected for years, while older staff may end up involuntarily retired. The number of people in the UKclaiming and receiving unemployment benefit soared last month. The figure went up by 856,500 to 2.097 million in April, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Separate ONS figures showed UK unemployment rose by 50,000 to 1.35 million in the three months to March. Jonathan Athow, from the ONS, said employment ""held up well"" in March, but hours worked ""fell sharply"" towards the end of the month - particularly in areas like hospitality and construction. Young people tend to be hardest hit by economic slumps. University of Portsmouth student Emily Isaacs, 20, was working at a kennels near her family home in Ashford, Kent, during the holidays before lockdown began. But with the business temporarily closed, she says the ""future is unclear"" and she worries the loss of income could have a knock-on effect on her business studies degree. ""Having the job meant I didn't have to stress about money and I could focus on my studies,"" she said. ""I don't really want to be worrying in my final year - which is stressful enough with my dissertation coming up. ""I'm still paying for my student accommodation and will have to next year as well, even if they continue with non-contact teaching. The deposit and first month's rent is due next month. ""I've moved back with my parents to try and save and I'm looking for work but a lot of jobs out there aren't the sort I can apply for because some of my family are vulnerable [to Covid-19]. ""I'm just hopeful I can find something when I'm back in Portsmouth."" Around a quarter of 18 to 24-year-oldshave been furloughed- meaning they do not work but their firms keep them on their books and the government covers 80% of their wages. A further 9% have lost their jobs altogether - the highest figure out of all age groups. Industries that traditionally employ younger staff such as pubs, restaurants and leisure centres have remained shut throughout the UK's eight-week lockdown, as have many shops. Huge rise in people claiming unemployment benefit A visual guide to the economic impact 'Losing my job pushed me to set up a business' Six money-saving ideas for lockdown Employees across all age groups were found to be more likely to earn less than they did in January than earn more. Those aged 35 to 44 were the least likely to have been furloughed or lost their jobs, with around 15% experiencing this since the outbreak began. Ms Coffey told the BBC's Today programme that the UK should be prepared for the unemployment rate to ""increase significantly"". She said the government is focusing on the younger generation as part of efforts to get people back into work. Asked about the claim that their incomes could be scarred for years to come, she said: ""I think it's too early to say anything like that at all."" She added that there are still vacancies available in areas such as retail and agricultural work, but that opportunities will vary around the country.

""In the coming months, many thousands of people will be needed to bring in the crops. It will be hard graft but is hugely important,"" he said. The video was recorded in the vegetable garden of Prince Charles' home in Scotland The Resolution Foundation, which studies earnings of lower and middle income-workers, surveyed more than 6,000 UK adults at the beginning of May. The Health Foundation, the charity which funded the research, says it was concerned that the current crisis is magnifying already-precarious employment conditions young people face. However, the report found the scale of pay reductions during the crisis would have been greater were it not for the government's job retention scheme. The furlough scheme covers 80% of workers' pay up to Â£2,500 per monthand was recently extended to October. Latest government figures show eight million jobs have been furloughed so far - at a cost of about Â£11bn. However,campaigners said it has made ""no difference""to the thousands of people who initially fell through the cracks.

"This video can not be played Trump: ""If it's not good, I'll tell you right, I'm not going to get hurt by it"" US President Donald Trump has said he is taking hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus, despite public health officials warning it may be unsafe. Speaking at the White House, he told reporters he started taking the malaria and lupus medication recently. ""I'm taking it for about a week and a half now and I'm still here, I'm still here,"" was his surprise announcement. There is no evidence hydroxychloroquine can fight coronavirus, and regulators warn the drug may cause heart problems. Dr Marcos Espinal, director of the Pan American Health Organization - part of the World Health Organization (WHO) - has also since stressed that no clinical trials have recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus. The 73-year-old president was hosting a meeting devoted to the struggling restaurant industry on Monday, when he caught reporters unawares by revealing he was taking the drug. ""You'd be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers before you catch it, the frontline workers, many, many are taking it,"" he told reporters. ""I happen to be taking it."" Asked what was his evidence of hydroxychloroquine's positive benefits, Mr Trump said: ""Here's my evidence: I get a lot of positive calls about it."" What's known about anti-malarial drugs and Covid-19? The unproven 'corona drug' US is threatening India for Coronavirus: Where are cases still rising? He added: ""I've heard a lot of good stories [about hydroxychloroquine] and if it's not good, I'll tell you right I'm not going to get hurt by it."" Though some people in the White House have tested positive for coronavirus, the president said again on Monday he had ""zero symptoms"" and was being tested frequently. He added that he had been taking a daily zinc supplement and received a single dose of azithromycin, an antibiotic meant to prevent infection. When asked whether the White House physician had recommended he start taking the disputed remedy, Mr Trump said he himself had requested it. Dr Sean Conley, physician to the president, said in a statement issued through the White House later on Monday that Mr Trump was in ""very good health"" and ""symptom-free"". The US Navy officer added: ""After numerous discussions he and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks."" The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last month issued an advisory saying that hydroxychloroquine has ""not been shown to be safe and effective"". It cited reports that the drug can cause serious heart rhythm problems in Covid-19 patients. The FDA warned against use of the medication outside hospitals, where the agency has granted temporary authorisation for its use in some cases. Clinical trials of the drug are also under way. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says there are no approved drugs or therapeutics to prevent or treat Covid-19, which is confirmed to have infected more than 1.5 million people in the US, killing more than 90,000 patients. I'll have what President Trump's having. No thanks - or rather, not yet. Currently there is no convincing evidence that hydroxychloroquine helps fight the virus and it can cause unpleasant and harmful side effects in some people. In theory, repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus is a very good and sound idea (unlike Mr Trump's previous ones about injecting disinfectant or hitting the body with ""tremendous"" UV light). It may be our only hope, at least in the short term, until a vaccine can be found. The UK government has been stockpiling some medicines that might be useful against coronavirus.That includes 16m hydroxychloroquine tablets,external. Clinical trials are under way in the UK and the US to assess the drug's worth. The human guinea pigs taking part include frontline healthcare workers at high risk of exposure to the virus, as well as patients. Experts agree that this work is worth doing, but they are concerned about advocating more general use of these experimental treatments before the proof is in. Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds, told me: ""People that follow the president's example might not only endanger themselves but could also deprive patients with chronic autoimmune conditions of their much-needed medication."" Dismissing reports of severe side effects from hydroxychloroquine, the president said: ""All I can tell you is, so far I seem to be OK."" He said the ""only negative"" he had heard was from a ""very unscientific report"" conducted by ""people that aren't big Trump fans"". Mr Trump was apparently referring to a preliminary study from April of Covid-19 patients in US government-run hospitals for military veterans that suggested hydroxychloroquine had no benefit and may have even caused a greater rate of deaths. ""I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy,"" the president told reporters, adding: ""What do you have to lose?"" According to doctors, the drug has the potential to cause symptoms including heart failure, suicidal thoughts and signs of liver disease. This video can not be played What's it like to fast for Ramadan as a healthcare worker during the pandemic? Mr Trump's most powerful elected antagonist, the Democratic Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, could not resist taking a dig at his age and weight when asked on CNN about him taking the malaria medication. ""He's our president and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group - morbidly obese, they say,"" she said. Last year, the White House physician noted in Mr Trump's annual medical exam that he weighed 243lb (110kg) and was 6ft 3in, which would score his body mass index at a technically obese 30.4. Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called Mr Trump's decision ""reckless"" but added: ""Who knows if it's true?"" ""He may not have been taking it for all we know. He just likes to make a splash,"" he told MSNBC. ""Maybe he's really not taking it,"" he continued, ""because the president lies about things characteristically-like.""

Prince Charles has urged people to help support Britain's fruit and vegetable growing industry during lockdown, amid fears restrictions will limit farmers' ability to employ seasonal staff. Thousands of people are being sought to help harvest crops as part of the government's Pick for Britain campaign. The prince likened the movement to the Land Army, which saw women work in agriculture so men could join the military during World War Two. In a video message on his official Instagram account, he said: ""Many thousands of people will be needed to pick the crops. It will be hard graft but hugely important."" Colleagues lined the corridors to applaud as he was discharged. An NHS worker ran a marathonincluding stops at nine care homes to deliver speakers so residents can ""stay connected"" with friends and family. Fay Sibley completed the 26.2-mile (42 km) distance around Essex, after the race she had been training for was postponed. Along the route she dropped off smart speakers donated by charity The Cares Family, which she has raised Â£2,000 for. ""It was an absolutely amazing experience,"" the 33-year-old said.

The Grenfell Tower Inquirywill not resume until July at the earliest, organisers have said. The second phase of the probe into the west London tower block fire was halted in March over coronavirus restrictions. Hearings will be resumed with limited attendance when social restrictions are partially lifted, the inquiry said. The fire at the 24-storey tower killed 72 people in June 2017. Sheffield Wednesday boss Garry Monk sayshe would understand if any of his players or staffhad concerns about returning to training. Championship teams arehoping to begin small group training from 25 Mayafter English Football League guidance. Premier League teams are starting non-contact training from Tuesday. Monk says he thinks all managers in the second tier want to see the campaign completed on the pitch, but some details still need to be ironed out. BBC Radio Leicester A council which launched a scheme offering bicycles to key workers for free fears there may be a shortage as hundreds have applied. Leicester City Council said 360 people had requested a bike through its Bike Aid scheme to help them commute to work. But project manager Andy Salkeld said more unused bikes were needed to meet demand. Any donations need to be in working condition and will be checked before they are loaned. More than 400 key workers have been helped so far either by being loaned a bike or by having their own bikes fixed. BBC Business News The government isconsidering introducing an extra bank holiday, possibly in October, around the time of half-term. The idea was put forward by the UK's tourism agency Visit Britain. Its acting head, Patricia Yates, told MPs the industry had lost the benefit of two bank holidays in May because of the coronavirus lockdown. The government did, however, warn that having an extra break could have an economic downside. Downing Street said the government was supporting the tourism industry through this ""challenging period"" and would ""respond in due course"" to the proposal by Visit Britain. Â© 2025 BBC.

So what can you do to find, save, or free up some extra cash in these uncertain times? We asked some experts for their top tips. Money blogger Andy Webb says anyone who uses price comparison sites once a year for car insurance or energy bills should think about using online price search sites more widely. There are various websites, easily found via a search engine, that track and compare prices at thousands of shops, as well as displaying reviews. For you, that can mean finding the cheapest price in a couple of clicks. ""Shopping around for the best price is really easy when you're doing it online,"" says Andy, who writes theBe Clever With Your Cash blog,external.Â ""There are some you can use day in, day out to saveÂ money on everything from TVs to trainers. ""An extra feature of these sites is the price history tool. You'll be able to see if the current price is higher or lower than usual - a handy guide to work out if the lowest price is actually the best price too."" The gym membership is even more idle than you during lockdown, as are subscriptions to restaurant clubs and many other services. ""Know your rights and stick up for them,"" says Iona Bain, founder of theYoung Money blog,external. ""Consumers who can no longer use products or services due to the lockdown are fully entitled to cash refunds - no ifs, no buts."" Gyms remain closed owing to the coronavirus outbreak The regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, will take complaints if you are unsuccessful. ""Be polite, patient but persistent, but know that ultimately there's a last resort that's got your back,"" she says. She also suggests talking to your bank, insurers, utility companies, mobile network and landlord if you are struggling. ""Don't bottle up your problems or cancel any payments without consultation, as this will do more harm than good,"" she says. Financial support from the government may be there for you, but you probably need to claim it. There are benefits such as statutory sick pay, employment and support allowance, jobseekers' allowance, and personal independence payments. There are also others that top up your income, such as universal credit, where the amount you receive depends on what you have already. Applying for universal credit can stop other benefits such as tax credits, so it is worth checking before you claim. ""Council tax support is available. If you're struggling to stay afloat look into any available grants. Talk to your energy and water supplier to see what help they can provide,"" says Lee Healey, ofmoney advisers IncomeMax,external. ""There are schemes to help parents of children that normally receive free school meals. Students should contact their college or university to see what help is available.""

If you are struggling, talk to a debt adviser, but good budgeting will help millions of people to cope, says adviser Sara Williams, who writesthe Debt Camel blog,external. ""A good approach isa money detox,externalto reduce spending and simplify your finances - including tracking down unwanted direct debits, cutting utility bills and building a small emergency fund,"" she says. ""If your main aim is to clear a credit card or catalogue debt but you can't afford large payments, my tip is to set up a standing order for the current minimum payment (or round it up). This clears the card many years sooner and saves a lot of interest.""Â If you already have savings, don't just leave them in an old account, but check the best buy tables to see if a bank or building society will give you a better return, says Anna Bowes, fromcomparison service Savings Champion,external By reviewing regularly over time, this can make a big difference to how much is in these accounts - even though interest rates are not very generous in general at the moment. ""Those who do have savings but have not reviewed them, or have left cash in their bank, could actually see an increase to their interest if they switch to one of the best paying accounts,"" she says. ""After this is over and hopefully your income recovers, remember to keep saving. Just a little bit each month can make a difference. There may be a luxury that you can do without, and save instead."" In financial terms, the current crisis is more of a downpour than a rainy day - a time when you may have to fall back on this sort of savings to avoid racking up huge debts. ""This situation illustrates the need for everyone to try and put away something,"" Ms Bowes says. Helen Dewdney, who blogs under the nameThe Complaining Cow,external, points out you are entitled to return an item that you bought from a store if it is faulty, if it's not as described when sold, or has not lasted a reasonable length of time But the store may be closed. She advises having a record of informing the company of your complaint. You will need to do this in writing, not by phone, so that you have an evidence trail. Email customer services and explain the situation. ""Offer them the option of picking up the item safely and providing you with a replacement or to take it away for a repair. If the item is less than 30 days old then you are entitled to a refund. It would still be prudent to email the company and state that you want the refund,"" she says.

"It is ""not obvious there will be an immediate bounceback"" for the UK economy, once lockdown restrictions are eased, the chancellor has warned. Rishi Sunak said he hoped for a swift recovery, but it could take time for the UK economy to get back to normal. ""It takes time for people to get back to the habits that they had, there are still restrictions in place,"" he said. His warning came as figures showed the number of people claiming unemployment benefit soared to 2.1 million in April. The jump of 856,500 claims in April reflected the impact of the first full month of lockdown, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The government has made some changes to who can claim work-related benefits during the pandemic, but this figure is one of a series that show the stress Covid-19 is putting on the jobs market. Speaking to the Lords Economic Affairs Committee, Mr Sunak said figures from around the world where countries were progressively easing and lifting restrictions, suggested a full recovery could take time. He said the ""question that occupies"" his mind was ""what degree of long-term scarring is there on the economy"" and that once restrictions begin to be lifted there will be the case of ""what do we return to"" and on that the ""jury's out"". But he admitted he felt ""all economic forecasters and economists would agree the longer the recession is, it is likely the degree of that scarring will be greater"". He said that even if the government can reopen retail in England as planned on the 1 June, there will still be restrictions on how people can shop. This will have an impact on how much they spend, and on how many people go out, Mr Sunak said. ""I think in all cases it will take a little bit of time for things to get back to normal, even once we've reopened currently closed sectors,"" Mr Sunak added. Seven charts on the coronavirus jobs market 'Losing my job pushed me to set up a business' When quizzed on unemployment by the committee, Mr Sunak said he did not have a precise estimate for what the numbers would be at the end of the year. However, he said: ""Obviously, the impact [of the coronavirus pandemic] will be severe."" Before the lockdown began, employment had hit a record high. In another indication of the bleak employment landscape, the number of job vacancies fell by nearly a quarter to 637,000 in the three months to April. Meanwhile, claims for universal credit - the benefit for working-age people in the UK - hita record monthly levelin the early weeks of lockdown. Unemployed HR worker Jon Ellis-Fleming, of Keighley in West Yorkshire, had been with an outsourcing company for more than four years when he was made redundant. He left the firm on 8 March, hoping to spend some time at home with his partner Julia Paterson and their eight-month-old daughter Daisy while looking for a new job. ""The week after I officially left the company, Covid hit,"" he told the BBC. That meant that several promising job offers just evaporated as firms put their recruitment plans on hold. Jon applied for universal credit and jobseeker's allowance. He is due to receive his first payment of Â£600 later this month, while his partner receives Â£650 a month on maternity leave. That leaves them with less than half of their former income - and with another mouth to feed as well. ""I've not been out of work in 10 years,"" he said. ""I've never had any intention of being out of work that long. ""I can't help but wonder, if I'd been with the company two weeks longer, would furloughing have been an option?"" The unemployment rate was estimated at 3.9%, slightly down on the previous quarter,the ONS said.,external The jobless figures only cover the first week of the lockdown and they are expected to worsen sharply in the coming months. Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, told the BBC: ""We can reasonably expect unemployment to rise very quickly to something over 10% - something we haven't seen since the early 1990s."" Estimates based on returns for individual weeks suggest that the fall in the unemployment rate was mostly caused by the decrease in hours in the last week of March, with a much smaller decrease in the previous week, the ONS said. In the final week of March, the total number of hours worked was about 25% fewer than in other weeks within the quarter. The government's jobs schemes succeeded in keeping the headline jobs numbers high, and jobless data still quite low up until the end of March. But there is evidence of the pandemic crisis impact starting to hit in the latest ONS jobs market release. The number of job vacancies from February to April tumbled by 170,000 to 637,000 - a record quarterly fall. The claimant count jumped in April, while the average hours worked in a week fell sharply at the end of March. So the signs of a significant downturn in the normal jobs market are there, but as is the impact of the extraordinary government support package. Unemployment would have shot through the roof without this support. However, these numbers will get worse with next month's figures. The vacancy drop shows there are fewer jobs out there for those who do lose work. And there are real concerns as to what happens when the support starts to be phased away in August.

"A charity has changed the way it works to keep sex workers at home during the coronavirus pandemic. Safer Wales has been running the StreetLife project since 2005, aimed at helping woman trapped in prostitution. Chief executive Bernie Bowen-Thomson said: ""We recognised that the essential outreach work we do shouldn't come to an abrupt halt because of Covid-19, but had to move to a virtual form."" The Cardiff-based charity has seen a 69% rise in its dealings with women. Safer Wales said the introduction of lockdown measures left clients faced with the difficult choice of self-distancing with no income or continuing to carry out sex work at a risk to their own and others' safety. Ms Bowen-Thomson said: ""This is a heartbreaking choice for women to have to make, it's essential that these women get the support they need to stay at home."" Bernie Bowen-Thomson said it was vital women could still access support In the first four weeks of lockdown, Safer Wales delivered 60 individually prepared meals and 10 mobile phones, with a further 13 on order. The charity said this was vital to ensure women could access support and information and also helped women to know ""they are not alone, even though we may not be physically close."" One woman based in south Wales has been doing this kind of work for a year. It is her only source of income. She is now offering her services online only, but said men still pressure her to meet her in person. ""They still ask if I'm doing meet-ups, and when I say 'no' they just say 'please, it'll only take a few minutes'. But in those few minutes, they could still give you the virus."" She carries out a fetish called financial domination, which involves taking money from men as a form of sexual domination. She also sometimes carries out physical acts. She said depending on the week, she could meet about two men a day. Offline sex workers forced to start again online Sex workers 'should have access to support fund' But during the lockdown she is urging other women in her position not to meet clients for these kind of services. ""Stop. Please just look after yourself, you don't know how clean they are, you just don't know them. Just be careful. Please."" She is now using online platforms, including a site where users can sell explicit photos and videos. In a statement, the website said it had seen a big increase in people using the platform during lockdown. ""We welcomed over 140,000 content creators during February and March 2020. This is more than five times the amount than during the same period in 2019."" One Cardiff escort agency, which has temporarily closed, said it still received daily enquiries from new prospective clients. It said a ""minority of professional full-time escorts are still working independently in Cardiff"". It added: ""I can assure you that most of these escorts will not stop working during the pandemic as without income from escort work they would simply be unable to survive i.e. food, bills, rent etc."" Is testing in Wales following the science? What am I allowed to do now? BBC Wales has found evidence of some men and woman advertising online to meet during lockdown for sexual services. We found adverts online that specifically highlighted it would be during the lockdown period in Wales. Safer Wales hands out supplies to those in the sex industry One man based in Cardiff told us he was looking for sex with someone outside of his marriage. We asked the man, who wanted to stay anonymous, if was looking to meet someone during lockdown. He told us: ""If they have been sensible with distancing I would consider meeting them - but only after a lengthy chat/vetting period."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We recognise people exploited by the sex industry may be forced to continue to work on the streets and the risks may be higher as the streets are emptier. ""There is help available for those who wish to leave the industry, including support from a number of Welsh charities. ""We urge those supporting sex workers to continue to do so, but to ensure they maintain social distancing and hygiene measures.""

Rishi Sunak gave evidence to an online session of the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak says ""it will take time"" for people to resume their economic habits ""even once we have reopened"" and there will not therefore be an ""immediate bounce back"" for the economy. He tells a House of Lords committee: ""We're likely to face a severe recession the likes of which we have not seen and, of course, that will have an impact on unemployment."" Mr Sunak also warns that there could be permanent scarring to the economy, with output down on pre-lockdown levels for a prolonged period. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg suggests Mr Sunak's ""tone today is a lot less enthusiastic than early talk about a quick bounce back for the economy"". The Scottish government says a report that criticises its response to the Covid-19 crisis in care homes ""paints a wholly misleading picture"".

But a government spokeswoman says ""firm action"" was taken from the outset to protect care home staff and residents and that initial guidance for care homes, setting out
the clinical and practical steps to be taken, was updated on 26 March and 15 May. ""Each iteration is a
reflection of our growing understanding of the virus and of the situation on
the ground,"" she says. The spokeswoman also highlights First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's announcement of ""enhanced outbreak investigations"" in care
homes on 1 May. ""We have taken a number of other steps, such as direct delivery
of personal protective equipment (PPE), a stepped increase in testing, with the
introduction from next week of testing for all care home staff, and emergency
legislation to ensure continuity of care in the event of a care home failing,"" it concludes.

But he tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""Politicians are more interested in investing in sections of the population where they are likely to get some kind of return on that, whether economically or politically. ""Landlords are worthy of support, renters aren't worthy of support. Self-employed people and entrepreneurs are worthy of support, people who are being laid off aren't worthy of support. As a demographic, young people are one of the most easily disposable groups. ""They are not that economically active, they are not classed as skilled, by definition they lack experience, they don't tend to own things, they don't have a lot of bargaining power in the wage market.""

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland It took the Scottish government two months to react properly to the Covid-19 crisis in care homes, leading to unnecessary deaths from the virus, a report for the Common Weal think tank claims. ""I think it is a whole system failure, but we are not just talking here about unnecessary deaths but we are talking here about how people died,"" Nick Kempe, the former head of services for older people in Glasgow, tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""We know that people haven't necessarily been given the right prescriptions and we have policies about palliative care, about dying well - I don't think they have been implemented. ""But, as well as the deaths from Covid, we obviously have the deaths from other reasons in care homes where people haven't received appropriate medical treatment and we have the impact on the lives of those who are still living."" Mr Kempe says privatisation of the care home sector, the lack of planning for a pandemic despite warnings from the 2016 Cygnus  Exercise and the fact it took eight weeks for the Scottish government to provide ""very good"" guidance to care homes all contributed to the crisis. Scottish fruit farmer James Porter has said he needs to find hundreds of pickers UK Environment Secretary George Eustice says only ""around a third"" of migrant workers normally expected for the harvest are currently in the country. He says this means Britons will be required to ""lend a hand"" in bringing in this summer's fruit and vegetables.

time when just under half of the country's 3,200 deaths from the coronavirus
have been in care homes. ""The care sector has basically been run down for the last
20 years or so,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""That's not a common picture across Scotland - in
some places there are some good providers - but there are a lot of providers
who have just been in it for the money and what has happened is that staffing
standards, staff training on matters like infection control has been totally
run down. ""We now basically have an untrained workforce who were
sitting there at the time when Covid-19 broke totally unprepared for what was
about to come to them. As soon as Covid-19 broke, it was very clear that our
care homes were totally unprepared for the crisis and that this was a crisis
waiting to happen and it has happened.""

"A law to introduce a new post-Brexit immigration system for the UK has been given initial approval by MPs. The immigration bill repeals EU freedom of movement and introduces the new framework - though not exact details - for who can come to live in the UK. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government's plans will lead to a ""high skill"" economy. But critics said the coronavirus pandemic has changed public attitudes towards those considered ""unskilled"". The House of Commons approved the general principles of the law by 351 votes to 252 on Monday. It will now go on to receive further scrutiny. The legislation will put EU and European Economic Area (EEA) citizens on an equal footing to immigrants from outside the bloc. It also paves the way for the government to introduce a new points-based system, which some say will affect the ability of care workers to come to the UK. Eight ways new immigration laws will affect industry What's a skilled worker? And other immigration questions No visas for low-skilled workers, government says The government announced proposals for the new system, suggesting points will be awarded for being able to speak English to a certain standard, having a job offer from an approved employer, and meeting a salary threshold of Â£25,600. Other points could be awarded for certain qualifications and if there is a shortage in a particular occupation. Speaking in the Commons, shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the earnings of frontline workers do not reflect their contribution to society. ""Those who clapped [for carers] on Thursday are only too happy to vote through a bill that will send a powerful message to those same people - that they are not considered by this government to be skilled workers,"" he said. ""Are shop workers unskilled? Are refuse collectors? Are local government workers? Are NHS staff? Are care workers? Of course they are not,"" he said. The Scottish government's immigration minster, Ben Macpherson, has also written to Ms Patel, asking her to ""pause and reconsider"" the plans, saying the coronavirus outbreak has highlighted the need for immigration in frontline services. Introducing the bill in the Commons, the home secretary said: ""The current crisis has shone a light on how we value those who provide compassionate care across health and social care."" Ms Patel said the changes in the bill ""will play a vital role in our recovery plans for the future"". ""It will end free movement and pave the way for a firmer, fairer and simpler system and will attract people we need to drive our country through the recovery stage of coronavirus, laying the foundation of a high wage, high skill productive economy,"" she said. The legislation, the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill was first introduced in December 2018, but stalled amid a series of defeats for then PM Theresa May's minority government. The bill is now being reintroduced to the Commons with Boris Johnson's 80-seat majority, meaning it is likely to pass. The plan for a new points-based system will need to be separately approved by Parliament, and it is not clear how soon the formal changes to the current rules will come before MPs. Karolina Gerlich arrived in UK from Poland 12 years ago and has been working in the social care sector ever since. She now works as the executive director of the Care Workers Charity, but says the points-based system the government plans to bring in would have ruled her out from coming to the country ""and supporting as many people as I have"". Ms Gerlich tells the BBC she is ""angry"" about the proposals, saying: ""I think it's terribly heart-breaking that there is this level of misunderstanding about the importance of what care workers do, and the contribution that social care makes, both to the economy and to society in general."" She says the sector is ""quite heavily dependent"" on foreign workers, and limiting who can come to the UK based on their wages could be ""disastrous"", especially after the coronavirus outbreak. ""We've had over 130 care workers die because they were working on the front line,"" says Ms Gerlich. ""And it is going to be more difficult for the sector to recruit after the crisis. With so many people dying, why would anybody dream of going into work in care now?"" In February, Ms Patel said people applying to come to the UK under the proposed system will need to meet strict skills criteria. ""We will no longer have the routes for cheap, low-skilled labour that obviously has dominated immigration and our labour market for far too long in this country,"" she said. This video can not be played Priti Patel: No more routes for cheap, low-skilled labour A YouGov opinion poll commissioned by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) suggests 54% of people now support looser immigration controls for workers regarded as essential during the pandemic. The government list of critical workers during the crisis includes care staff, food processing staff, supermarket workers, and delivery drivers. JCWI's Satbir Singh said such workers ""are not 'unskilled' or unwelcome, they are the backbone of our country and they deserve the security of knowing that this place can be their home too"". Former immigration minister and Tory MP Caroline Nokes called for ""a more nuanced and intelligent discussion about immigration in this country"". She told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We need to understand [immigration legislation] needs to be done with compassion and understandingâ¦and we need to move away from the really blunt 'skilled' and 'unskilled' terms. ""To be quite frank, they are meaningless and actually really rude to those people who we have been so reliant on, not just in the last eight weeks, but for a very, very long time in this country. "" SNP immigration spokesman Stuart C McDonald criticised the bill, claiming it would ""split even more families apart"". ""It's a bill that will result in many thousands of EU nationals losing their rights in this country overnight and which will extend the reach of the hostile environment still further,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Trump: ""If it's not good, I'll tell you right, I'm not going to get hurt by it"" US President Donald Trump has said he is taking hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus, despite public health officials warning it may be unsafe. Speaking at the White House, he told reporters he started taking the malaria and lupus medication recently. ""I'm taking it for about a week and a half now and I'm still here, I'm still here,"" was his surprise announcement. There is no evidence hydroxychloroquine can fight coronavirus, and regulators warn the drug may cause heart problems. Dr Marcos Espinal, director of the Pan American Health Organization - part of the World Health Organization (WHO) - has also since stressed that no clinical trials have recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus. The 73-year-old president was hosting a meeting devoted to the struggling restaurant industry on Monday, when he caught reporters unawares by revealing he was taking the drug. ""You'd be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers before you catch it, the frontline workers, many, many are taking it,"" he told reporters. ""I happen to be taking it."" Asked what was his evidence of hydroxychloroquine's positive benefits, Mr Trump said: ""Here's my evidence: I get a lot of positive calls about it."" What's known about anti-malarial drugs and Covid-19? The unproven 'corona drug' US is threatening India for Coronavirus: Where are cases still rising? He added: ""I've heard a lot of good stories [about hydroxychloroquine] and if it's not good, I'll tell you right I'm not going to get hurt by it."" Though some people in the White House have tested positive for coronavirus, the president said again on Monday he had ""zero symptoms"" and was being tested frequently. He added that he had been taking a daily zinc supplement and received a single dose of azithromycin, an antibiotic meant to prevent infection. When asked whether the White House physician had recommended he start taking the disputed remedy, Mr Trump said he himself had requested it. Dr Sean Conley, physician to the president, said in a statement issued through the White House later on Monday that Mr Trump was in ""very good health"" and ""symptom-free"". The US Navy officer added: ""After numerous discussions he and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks."" The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last month issued an advisory saying that hydroxychloroquine has ""not been shown to be safe and effective"". It cited reports that the drug can cause serious heart rhythm problems in Covid-19 patients. The FDA warned against use of the medication outside hospitals, where the agency has granted temporary authorisation for its use in some cases. Clinical trials of the drug are also under way. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says there are no approved drugs or therapeutics to prevent or treat Covid-19, which is confirmed to have infected more than 1.5 million people in the US, killing more than 90,000 patients. I'll have what President Trump's having. No thanks - or rather, not yet. Currently there is no convincing evidence that hydroxychloroquine helps fight the virus and it can cause unpleasant and harmful side effects in some people. In theory, repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus is a very good and sound idea (unlike Mr Trump's previous ones about injecting disinfectant or hitting the body with ""tremendous"" UV light). It may be our only hope, at least in the short term, until a vaccine can be found. The UK government has been stockpiling some medicines that might be useful against coronavirus.That includes 16m hydroxychloroquine tablets,external. Clinical trials are under way in the UK and the US to assess the drug's worth. The human guinea pigs taking part include frontline healthcare workers at high risk of exposure to the virus, as well as patients. Experts agree that this work is worth doing, but they are concerned about advocating more general use of these experimental treatments before the proof is in. Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds, told me: ""People that follow the president's example might not only endanger themselves but could also deprive patients with chronic autoimmune conditions of their much-needed medication."" Dismissing reports of severe side effects from hydroxychloroquine, the president said: ""All I can tell you is, so far I seem to be OK."" He said the ""only negative"" he had heard was from a ""very unscientific report"" conducted by ""people that aren't big Trump fans"". Mr Trump was apparently referring to a preliminary study from April of Covid-19 patients in US government-run hospitals for military veterans that suggested hydroxychloroquine had no benefit and may have even caused a greater rate of deaths. ""I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy,"" the president told reporters, adding: ""What do you have to lose?"" According to doctors, the drug has the potential to cause symptoms including heart failure, suicidal thoughts and signs of liver disease. This video can not be played What's it like to fast for Ramadan as a healthcare worker during the pandemic? Mr Trump's most powerful elected antagonist, the Democratic Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, could not resist taking a dig at his age and weight when asked on CNN about him taking the malaria medication. ""He's our president and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group - morbidly obese, they say,"" she said. Last year, the White House physician noted in Mr Trump's annual medical exam that he weighed 243lb (110kg) and was 6ft 3in, which would score his body mass index at a technically obese 30.4. Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called Mr Trump's decision ""reckless"" but added: ""Who knows if it's true?"" ""He may not have been taking it for all we know. He just likes to make a splash,"" he told MSNBC. ""Maybe he's really not taking it,"" he continued, ""because the president lies about things characteristically-like.""

"Testing will be rolled out to everyone over the age of five with symptoms of coronavirus Everyone aged five and over in the UK with symptoms can now be tested for coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced. He was speaking in Parliament after theloss of taste or smell was added to the list of Covid-19 symptoms, alongside a fever and a new persistent cough. Mr Hancock said the government was ""expanding eligibility for testing further than ever before"". He added 100,678 tests had been conducted on Sunday. Testing in England and Scotland has been limited to people with symptoms who are key workers and their families, hospital patients, care home residents, over-65s and those who need to leave home to work. In Wales and Northern Ireland it was just key workers, hospital workers and care home residents. Mr Hancock said that priority for testing would still be given to NHS staff and care home workers and residents to ""protect our most vulnerable"". A further 160 coronavirus deaths have been recorded in the UK as of 17:00 BST on Sunday taking the official total to 34,796 - the highest figure in Europe. Who is being tested in the UK? What symptoms should I now look out for? How long does it take to recover from coronavirus? Earlier, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the extension of testing thereas she revealed lockdown measures would be eased from 28 May. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland has also announced an easing of lockdownincluding new rules to allow groups of four to six people who do not share a household to meet outdoors. The UK government has ramped up testing and made it part of its five goals to meet in order to leave lockdown. The prime minister has set a target for a daily capacity of 200,000 by the end of the month and last week the UK had reached a capacity of 150,000 a day. So far the most tests done in a day is 136,000, on Friday, but this included kits posted out and not necessarily returned. Health professionals haveraised concerns about the accuracy of some testsas well as the time it takes for results to be returned to patients. NHS Providers, the association of NHS trusts in England, said the average test return was five days with the longest wait being 13 days. Chief executive Chris Hopson said the testing regime was ""still a very long way from being fit for purpose"" and said that the gap between the tone struck in public statements and the reality on the ground was ""painfully wide"". One person who had been tested at Lea Valley in north London, Michael Saunders, told the BBC's Hugh Pym it was ""disappointing"" that he had been waiting for five days for his result. ""If you are going to make testing a central part of how we deal with this virus you have got to make it right,"" he said. Shadow health and social care secretary Jonathan Ashworth pressed the government on the time taken for results to be received on whether someone had Covid-19 or not. He also asked if facilities could be set up to allow poorer people to be able to self-isolate if they are required to do so and whether those in insecure work would be guaranteed sick pay if they were asked to isolate. The expansion of the testing programme may grab the headlines. It is a significant milestone - in less than two months the UK has gone from only being able to test hospital patients and health and care staff to offering it more or less population-wide. But it should not mask the difficulties that remain getting the test, track and trace system up-and-running. This will be essential to contain local outbreaks as we ease ourselves out of lockdown. Tests are still taking too long to turnaround for some - significant numbers are thought to be waiting several days - while thepiloting of the tracking app on the Isle of Wightis not yet finished. One particular concern is that the app does not yet let users know if the person they have had contact with ends up testing positive. Instead, it has only let them know if the contact has developed symptoms. That is a major problem. It means people have been left in limbo and incorporating that feature into the app will be important. Progress is being made, but getting a workable and efficient system in place soon is still a monumental challenge. Mr Hancock also said the government is in the ""closing stages"" of negotiations to purchase new Covid-19 antibody tests. A test developed by Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche was approved for use by Public Health England last week. Mr Hancock said developments in tracking and tracing meant England was on course to meet the requirements for the next stage of easing lockdown restrictions on 1 June. He told parliament 21,000 people had been recruited to conductcontact-tracingin England, including 7,500 healthcare workers. This is when people who have come into contact with someone with the virus are tracked down and potentially asked to self-isolate. The new recruits will be trained to identify people and advise them on whether to isolate. Speaking at the Downing Street press briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the government's record on testing and the development of the test and trace app. He said: ""We are learning all the way as we go through this pandemic, not just on the scientific side but on the innovation that we need to get a grip on it. ""We are making good progress on the testing and on the tracing and on the pilot in the Isle of Wight in relation to the app."" The foreign secretary said the app would be ready in ""the coming weeks"" but could not confirm it would be ready before children start returning to school. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told Monday's press briefing that only once there was a vaccine ""really capable of suppressing disease levels"" will the country be ""out of this"". ""So from that perspective we may have to live, and learn to live, with this virus in the long-term, certainly for many months to come if not several years,"" he said. He added it was unclear if there was seasonality to the virus and whether it would come back in autumn and winter. On Sunday the government announced it had an agreement for 30 million doses of a vaccine if a trial at the University of Oxford was successful. The first hints that a vaccine can train people's immune system to fight coronavirushave been reported by a US company. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron discussed the fund via video link France and Germany are proposing a â¬500bn ($545bn; Â£448bn) European recovery fund to be distributed to EU countries worst affected by Covid-19. In talks on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed that the funds should be provided as grants. The proposal represents a significant shift in Mrs Merkel's position. Mr Macron said it was a major step forward and was ""what the eurozone needs to remain united"". ""I believe this is a very deep transformation and that's what the European Union and the single market needed to remain coherent,"" Mr Macron said following discussions via video link. Mrs Merkel, who had previously rejected the idea of nations sharing debt, said the European Commission would raise money for the fund by borrowing on the markets, which would be repaid gradually from the EU's overall budget. Grants provided by the proposed recovery fund should also be used to help finance the bloc's investment in a greener future, the two leaders said. Politics and PR: Behind the scenes of the plan Spain set for basic income to ease crisis pain Coronavirus 'could cost global economy $8.8tn' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the proposal ""acknowledges the scope and the size of the economic challenge that Europe faces"". European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said the plan was ""ambitious, targeted and welcome"". Other EU countries must agree with the proposal, however, and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz later insisted that his country backed providing loans to member nations hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, rather than grants. ""Our position remains unchanged,"" Mr Kurz wrote in a tweet, adding: ""We expect the updated [EU budget] to reflect the new priorities rather than raising the ceiling."" In EU political terms this is huge. Chancellor Merkel has conceded a lot. She openly agreed with the French that any money from this fund, allocated to a needy EU country, should be a grant, not a loan. Importantly, this means not increasing the debts of economies already weak before the pandemic. President Macron gave ground, too. He had wanted a huge fund of a trillion or more euros. But a trillion euros of grants was probably too much for Mrs Merkel to swallow on behalf of fellow German taxpayers. The resulting compromise: a win-win for the two leaders. They hope. They got to demonstrate that the famed Franco-German motor of Europe still has some va-va-voom. Mr Macron badly needs to polish his European credentials at home. He already has an eye on his re-election bid and so far the self-styled Mr Europe's attempt at European reform has failed rather spectacularly to take off. Chancellor Merkel, meanwhile, is in her last term of office. She's clocked the headlines predicting the EU's demise in view of the bickering and a lack of EU solidarity during the pandemic. She has her political legacy in mind.

"Kevin Mayer is stepping down as the head of Disney streaming services to run TikTok. Disney's head of streaming Kevin Mayer is stepping down to become the boss of social media platform TikTok. He has been named the chief executive officer of TikTok and chief operating officer of ByteDance, the platform's Chinese parent company. TikTok, an app where users post short videos, has seen an explosion of growth since its US launch. But that increased popularity has led to scrutiny by the US government over its ties to China. Mr Mayer will be responsible for ByteDance's ""global development"" including emerging business, gaming and music. ""I'm excited to help lead the next phase of ByteDance's journey as the company continues to expand its breadth of products across every region of the world,"" Mr Mayer said in the release. He will be the first CEO of TikTok. TikTok has been downloaded more than 2 billion times on iOS and Android since it was launched globally in 2017.  The app allows users to make videos up to 15-seconds long with music in the background. The coronavirus pandemic has helped boost its popularity further with many users making comical or musical videos of their quarantine experiences. What is TikTok? TikTok apologises and reinstates banned US teen Coronavirus: UK's first 'TikTok house' opens during outbreak But having a Chinese parent company has worried US politicians. Some of them have raised concerns about ByteDance allowing Chinese government censorship or data collection on TikTok users. Both are charges ByteDance denies. At Disney, Mr Mayer oversaw the successful launch of the firms streaming service, Disney Plus in November of 2019. The service had over 54 million subscribers by May. He also managed the firms other streaming investments including Hulu, Hotstar, and sports streaming services ESPN plus. He was also considered a key figure in the company's acquisitions of Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel. Before Disney's former chief executive Bob Iger stepped down from that role in February, Mr Mayer was viewed as a possible candidate to replace him. However, the role was given to Bob Chapek, head of parks, experiences and products. Mr Mayer will be joining ByteDance on 1 June.

On Monday, Trump said hewas usingthe
malaria and lupus medication despite public health officials warning it may be
unsafe to do so. Elaborating further at an on-camera cabinet meeting on
Tuesday, he said: ""Somebody fairly close to me, a very nice young gentleman,
tested positive. ""Plus I deal with Mike [Pence, the vice-president] a lot, and somebody
very close to him, who I also see, tested positive. So I thought, you know,
from my standpoint, not a bad time to take it because we had that combination."" Trump also confirmed that he is considering imposing a ban on
travel to the US from Brazil, which has the world's thirdhighest number,externalof reported cases. ""I don't want people coming over here and infecting our
people,"" he said. ""I don't want people over there sick either. We're helping
Brazil with ventilators. Brazil is having some trouble, no question about it."" Temperature screening is being introduced globally including in airports, workplaces, and restaurants Governments globally are experimenting with ways to detect and trace coronavirus symptoms. The technology used to do that varies from country to country, and often depends on how willing citizens are to be monitored and to give up personal data. On Tuesday, the prominent civil rights group the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) publisheda report warning about the use of temperature screening technology,external. It suggests that new products are flooding markets globally. Forcing citizens to have their temperature recorded risks violating their right to privacy, the ACLU suggests. It could also lead to wider health data being collected and potentially used by private healthcare companies, it adds. Casting doubt on the efficacy of temperature checks in tracing the virus, the group advises that ""temperature screening should not be deployed unless public health experts say that it is a worthwhile measure notwithstanding the technologyâs problems"".

will be no ""face-to-face lectures"" in the 2020-21 academic year. Lectures will continue virtually while smaller teaching groups in person may be possible if they ""conform to social
distancing requirements"". A university spokesperson said: ""Given that it is likely
that social distancing will continue to be required, the university has decided
there will be no face-to-face lectures during the next academic year."" The University said it will review the decision should official advice
change. A university watchdog hasasked institutionsto provide clarity over
how courses will be taught before students applying for places make their choices for

BBC OS spoke to Max Bryan of Southwest Times Record, who went to the Arkansas show. Concert-goers were required to buy seats in clusters, branded ""fan pods"", and large areas were roped off. ""We've been deprived of things we took for

population, will not reopen schools until September. ""Iâm just not going to risk it,"" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said. Schools have been closed across the province since 13 March. Private schools and licensed childcare centres will also remain closed. As of Tuesday, there were 23,384 coronavirus cases in Ontario, and 1,919
deaths, according to provincial health officials. When it comes to face masks in US Congress, there have been a wide variety of choices. From the practical medical-style to Republican Don Bacon's ""bacon mask"", here are some of the styles snapped on Capitol Hill. First up is the classic - the traditional face mask seen around the world and worn by many in Congress including Senator Kelly Loeffler Now on to more fun masks: Here's the national pride option, worn by Republican Senator Tim Scott - a red, white and blue face mask House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern is one of many to represent their sports team of choice, in this New England Patriots mask Very much the joker's choice, Republican Don Bacon wears a face mask befitting his name And finally, there is Senator Tim Kaine wearing... a bandana. Believe it or not, the Democrat has taken to wearing bandanas in lieu of the traditional face mask US Homeland Security chief Chad Wolf says the Trump
administration is ""likely"" to extend non-essential travel
restrictions at US land borders with Canada and Mexico. Border restrictions imposed on 21 March to help combat the pandemic were due to expire on Wednesday. Speaking at a US Chamber of Commerce event Wolf said: ""We really have to see what is the health care situation like
in Mexico and Canada, how are their cases, have they hit their
curve?"" ""What we
don't want to do is try to open up parts of our economy and have
a lot of folks coming across the border that we haven't seen in
the past 50 or 60 days."" Earlier on Tuesday, Canada's Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau described an agreement to extend the closure of the US border by a further 30 days as ""an important decision that will keep people in both countries safe"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has held a video call with US billionaires Bill and Melinda Gates this afternoon where they discussed the international response to coronavirus. A Downing Street statement said they talked about the UK's contribution to helping countries around the world tackle the virus and the work of the Gates Foundation in this area. âBoth parties expressed their hope that a viable vaccine will be found as soon as possible,"" it added. The conversation comes ahead of of the Global Vaccine Summit, which is being hosted by the UK on 4 June. Wide-ranging security flaws have been flagged in the NHS's contact-tracing app being piloted in the Isle of Wight. Security researchers involved argue that the problems pose risks to users' privacy and could be abused to prevent contagion alerts being sent. GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre told the BBC it was already aware of most of the issues raised and is in the process of addressing them. But the researchers suggest a more fundamental rethink is required. They suggest the NHS considers shifting from its current ""centralised"" model - where contact-matching happens on a computer server - to a ""decentralised"" version - where the matching instead happens on people's phones.

Samba CyuzuzoBBC Great Lakes Five humanoid robots have been delivered to Rwanda where they will assist in coronavirus screening and deliver food and drugs to patients - as well as act as video-conferencing links between patients and doctors. Each robot has been given a Rwandan name - Akazuba, Ikizere, Mwiza, Ngabo and Urumuri. Their main purpose is to reduce health workers' exposure to Covid-19 patients, Rwanda's Health Minister Daniel Ngamije told the BBC. ""We need additional robots for
other duties like disinfection in public space and we are working to get them,"" he added. The robots are manufactured by a Belgium-based company. Rwanda's health ministry says the units have a number of abilities, including:  Rwanda has two Covid-19 treatment facilities - one is on the outskirts of the capital, Kigali, and the other in the south-eastern town of Nyamata. The health ministry says there are 297 confirmed cases in the country, 203 recoveries and no deaths. Relatives mourn the loss of loved ones during a mass burial of coronavirus victims at the Parque Taruma cemetery in Manaus, Brazil The coronavirus is threatening vulnerable indigenous communities in the Amazon region shared by Brazil, Colombia and Peru, the Pan American Health Organisation has warned. ""Protecting vulnerable groups is critical,"" Dr Carissa Etienne, director of the organisation, said, adding: ""We can't stop the spread of the virus if we don't focus on all those affected by it, including vulnerable populations."" The group has called for special measures to protect remote communities that have historically been decimated by infections introduced by outsiders. The Amazonian cities of Manaus in Brazil, Iquitos in Peru, and Leticia in Colombia have already been badly affected by Covid-19, which health experts say is now threatening to reach more remote regions.

With ongoing disputes between the US and China about the origins of the coronavirus, and a further attack on the World Heath Organization (WHO), it's another busy day globally.

This video can not be played Eating and drinking while wearing a mask BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Khabib Nurmagomedov (right) with his father Abdulmanap, who is in hospital Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov has described the
coronavirus situation in his native Dagestan, a republic in Russiaâs
south, as ""distressing"", and urged locals to follow doctorsâ advice. Speaking in anInstagram video,,externalhe said more than 20 of his relatives had
spent time in intensive care during the pandemic, and that some of them had
died. He said his father - who is
also his coach - remained in hospital in ""a very serious"" condition,
having suffered complications after contracting the virus. Nurmagomedov is one of Russia's most popular personalities on
Instagram with 20.1 million followers, and his video has been viewed more than 3.5 million times. ""The hospitals are running over capacity, a lot of people have got
sick, and a lot of people have died,"" Nurmagomedov said. âWe must listen
to our doctors and their demands. They know better.â Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent ""Blame game"" is an ugly phrase, but it sums up
the narrative that has played out at Westminster throughout the day. Who was responsible for limiting testing for
coronavirus to hospitals early on in the crisis? This morning, MPs on the Science and Technology Committee accused Public Health
England. But PHE said the Department of Health made the call, and one cabinet
minister suggested the scientific advice could have been ""wrong"". At this evening's testy news conference, one
frank answer from Angela McLean, the deputy chief scientific adviser, was telling. ""The advice that we gave certainly took
account of what testing was available,"" she told reporters. Perhaps thatâs not surprising. Scientists
have to advise, just as ministers have to decide, in the real world, not an
ideal one. But for all ministers' talk of a rapid and
significant increase in testing capacity, it does lend weight
to the claim made by MPs that capacity
""drove strategy, rather than strategy driving capacity"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.91553885

""There was a failure by this organisation to obtain the information that the world needed,"" US Health Secretary Alex Azar said on Monday. Mr Azar made the comments in an address to the UN's World Health Assembly. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier agreed to a review over the agency's handling of the pandemic.

US President Donald Trump, who faces re-election this year and has been criticised for his handling of the pandemic, has blamed China for trying to cover up the outbreak and has accused the WHO of failing to hold Beijing to account. ""I chose not to make a statement today,"" Mr Trump said on Monday about the event, while describing the body as ""China-centric"" and ""a puppet of China"".

Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has defended China's actions during the outbreak, said at Monday's virtual meeting that his country had acted ""with openness and transparency"" and insisted that any investigation should happen after the pandemic was brought under control. China says calls for an investigation are a distraction from fighting the coronavirus He added that China would provide $2bn (Â£1.6bn; â¬1.8bn) over two years in aid to nations around the world in the wake of the pandemic and offered to share any vaccine as soon as one became available. White House National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot described the move as ""a token to distract from calls... demanding accountability for the Chinese government's failure to meet its obligations"". Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the WHO must be given more legal powers to ensure that countries report outbreaks and share data. ""A novel infectious disease could emerge at any time and we must be able to respond more quickly and effectively,"" he said. More than 4.5 million people have been infected and more than 300,000 have died since the virus emerged in China in December. Analysis by Tulip Mazumdar, BBC global health correspondent After a good four hours of countries pledging their support for the WHO, the US took just three minutes to launch a scathing attack on the UN's health agency. The US didn't specifically name China, but talked about ""at least one member state's apparent attempt"" to ""conceal this outbreak"", and said the WHO ""must become far more transparent and far more accountable"". Meanwhile, South Korea and Australia said the assembly should consider giving the WHO more powers, with Australia specifically pointing to greater ""inspection powers"". There have been calls for the agency to be mandated to go into countries very early in outbreaks, to carry out independent investigations. China has said it supports a ""comprehensive evaluation"" of the global response, but only after the virus is contained. That could take months - or even years. The European Union, alongside countries including the UK, Australia and New Zealand, has been pushing for an inquiry into how the pandemic has been handled and what lessons can be learned. EU spokeswoman Virginie Battu-Henriksson said several key questions needed to be answered as part of any review. ""How did this pandemic spread? What is the epidemiology behind it?

Separately, member states agreed on Monday to delay discussions over granting Taiwan observer status for assembly meetings, with Taipei saying that it would defer its demand until later in the year. China, which says Taiwan is part of its territory, has blocked Taiwan's attendance since 2016. In recent weeks, the US, EU, Japan and several other nations have backed Taiwan's bid to attend the meeting. During Monday's talks, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said excluding Taiwan ""further damages"" the credibility of the WHO. The outbreak first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and was widely reported to have originated in a food market. Since then, however, some senior US politicians have suggested that the source was a research facility in Wuhan that had been carrying out research on bat coronaviruses. China has dismissed the idea. Mr Pompeo said earlier this month that there was ""a significant amount of evidence"" that the virus came from a laboratory in Wuhan. However, in a TV interview with Breitbart on Saturday he appeared to step back, saying ""we know it began in Wuhan, but we don't know from where or from whom"".

"Aya Hachem was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead a short time later A young woman shot dead near a supermarket was not the intended target, officers have said. Aya Hachem was found with fatal injuries in King Street in Blackburn, close to Lidl, on Sunday. The 19-year-old law student, described as ""truly remarkable"", was going to the shop at about 15:00 BST when she was shot from a passing car, police said. Three men, aged 33, 36, and 39 from Blackburn have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are in custody. A Toyota Avensis, believed to have been used in the killing, was later found abandoned on Wellington Road. A number of occupants were in the car, which has the registration number SV53 UBP, as it passed Ms Hachem, police said. Detectives have urged ""anyone with information to search their consciences and come forward"". ""There is no evidence to suggest Aya was the intended target of this attack and every indication is that she was an innocent passerby,"" the force said. Police believe a Toyota Avensis was used to commit the offence Ms Hachem's parents have paid tribute to the ""most loyal devoted daughter"" who ""dreamed of becoming a solicitor"". ""We are absolutely devastated by her death and would like to take this opportunity to plead with any members of the public who may have any information however small that may bring those responsible to justice,"" they said. Ms Hachem was one of four siblings and lived in Blackburn after travelling to the UK about nine years ago, her cousin Hassan told the BBC. Her family was waiting for the investigation to finish so they could take her body back to Lebanon to be buried in her home village Qlaileh, he said. Ms Hachem, who was a young trustee for the Children's Society, was described as a ""truly remarkable young woman, and an inspiring voice for children and young people"" by its chief executive Mark Russell. Dr Janice Allan, Dean of Salford Business School, said Ms Hachem was ""a very popular and promising second year student whose contribution went beyond the classroom"". The Asylum and Refugee Community, a charity working with asylum seekers and refugees in the Blackburn and Darwen area, said Ms Hachem had been the victim of ""a horrific senseless attack"". ""It is with great sadness and heartache we have to share with you that we have lost Aya, beloved eldest daughter of Samar and Ismael from Lebanon,"" it added. Ms Hachem was found with fatal injuries in King Street at about 15:00 BST on Sunday The family of Yousef Makki, who wasstabbed to death in Hale Barns in 2019,have also paid tribute to the 19-year-old. ""Another act of senseless violence that has ripped apart another family, our hearts and thoughts go out to Aya and her family at this heart-breaking time,"" said the Makki family, who were friends with Ms Hachem's family. Police said the force was not treating the killing as a terror-related incident and also did not believe it was racially-motivated.

"Testing will be rolled out to everyone over the age of five with symptoms of coronavirus Everyone aged five and over in the UK with symptoms can now be tested for coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced. He was speaking in Parliament after theloss of taste or smell was added to the list of Covid-19 symptoms, alongside a fever and a new persistent cough. Mr Hancock said the government was ""expanding eligibility for testing further than ever before"". He added 100,678 tests had been conducted on Sunday. Testing in England and Scotland has been limited to people with symptoms who are key workers and their families, hospital patients, care home residents, over-65s and those who need to leave home to work. In Wales and Northern Ireland it was just key workers, hospital workers and care home residents. Mr Hancock said that priority for testing would still be given to NHS staff and care home workers and residents to ""protect our most vulnerable"". A further 160 coronavirus deaths have been recorded in the UK as of 17:00 BST on Sunday taking the official total to 34,796 - the highest figure in Europe. Who is being tested in the UK? What symptoms should I now look out for? How long does it take to recover from coronavirus? Earlier, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the extension of testing thereas she revealed lockdown measures would be eased from 28 May. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland has also announced an easing of lockdownincluding new rules to allow groups of four to six people who do not share a household to meet outdoors. The UK government has ramped up testing and made it part of its five goals to meet in order to leave lockdown. The prime minister has set a target for a daily capacity of 200,000 by the end of the month and last week the UK had reached a capacity of 150,000 a day. So far the most tests done in a day is 136,000, on Friday, but this included kits posted out and not necessarily returned. Health professionals haveraised concerns about the accuracy of some testsas well as the time it takes for results to be returned to patients. NHS Providers, the association of NHS trusts in England, said the average test return was five days with the longest wait being 13 days. Chief executive Chris Hopson said the testing regime was ""still a very long way from being fit for purpose"" and said that the gap between the tone struck in public statements and the reality on the ground was ""painfully wide"". One person who had been tested at Lea Valley in north London, Michael Saunders, told the BBC's Hugh Pym it was ""disappointing"" that he had been waiting for five days for his result. ""If you are going to make testing a central part of how we deal with this virus you have got to make it right,"" he said. Shadow health and social care secretary Jonathan Ashworth pressed the government on the time taken for results to be received on whether someone had Covid-19 or not. He also asked if facilities could be set up to allow poorer people to be able to self-isolate if they are required to do so and whether those in insecure work would be guaranteed sick pay if they were asked to isolate. The expansion of the testing programme may grab the headlines. It is a significant milestone - in less than two months the UK has gone from only being able to test hospital patients and health and care staff to offering it more or less population-wide. But it should not mask the difficulties that remain getting the test, track and trace system up-and-running. This will be essential to contain local outbreaks as we ease ourselves out of lockdown. Tests are still taking too long to turnaround for some - significant numbers are thought to be waiting several days - while thepiloting of the tracking app on the Isle of Wightis not yet finished. One particular concern is that the app does not yet let users know if the person they have had contact with ends up testing positive. Instead, it has only let them know if the contact has developed symptoms. That is a major problem. It means people have been left in limbo and incorporating that feature into the app will be important. Progress is being made, but getting a workable and efficient system in place soon is still a monumental challenge. Mr Hancock also said the government is in the ""closing stages"" of negotiations to purchase new Covid-19 antibody tests. A test developed by Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche was approved for use by Public Health England last week. Mr Hancock said developments in tracking and tracing meant England was on course to meet the requirements for the next stage of easing lockdown restrictions on 1 June. He told parliament 21,000 people had been recruited to conductcontact-tracingin England, including 7,500 healthcare workers. This is when people who have come into contact with someone with the virus are tracked down and potentially asked to self-isolate. The new recruits will be trained to identify people and advise them on whether to isolate. Speaking at the Downing Street press briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the government's record on testing and the development of the test and trace app. He said: ""We are learning all the way as we go through this pandemic, not just on the scientific side but on the innovation that we need to get a grip on it. ""We are making good progress on the testing and on the tracing and on the pilot in the Isle of Wight in relation to the app."" The foreign secretary said the app would be ready in ""the coming weeks"" but could not confirm it would be ready before children start returning to school. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told Monday's press briefing that only once there was a vaccine ""really capable of suppressing disease levels"" will the country be ""out of this"". ""So from that perspective we may have to live, and learn to live, with this virus in the long-term, certainly for many months to come if not several years,"" he said. He added it was unclear if there was seasonality to the virus and whether it would come back in autumn and winter. On Sunday the government announced it had an agreement for 30 million doses of a vaccine if a trial at the University of Oxford was successful. The first hints that a vaccine can train people's immune system to fight coronavirushave been reported by a US company. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Testing eligibility, like lockdown measures, is devolved for individual nations to set their own rules. Mr Hancock made his announcement on the extension of testing across the UK after all four nations agreed to the change.
