"Former Top Gear host Richard Hammond has been flown to hospital after a crash while filming in Switzerland. The 47-year-old was on a practice run for a race in an electric car for Amazon Prime show The Grand Tour. Mr Hammond ""climbed out of the car himself before the vehicle burst into flames"", the show said in a statement. Co-host Jeremy Clarksontweeted,externalthat it was the ""most frightening"" accident he had ever seen but said Mr Hammond, who fractured a knee, was ""mostly OK"". The show's statement said Mr Hammond had been involved in a ""serious crash"" after completing the Hemberg Hill Climb in Switzerland, where a race takes place on Sunday. He had been driving a ""Rimac Concept One, an electric super car built in Croatia, during filming for The Grand Tour Season 2 on Amazon Prime, but very fortunately suffered no serious injury"". Mr Hammond was ""conscious and talking"" after the crash, the show said, and had been flown to hospital in St Gallen ""to be checked over"". ""Nobody else was in the car or involved in the accident, and we'd like to thank the paramedics on site for their swift response. ""The cause of the crash is unknown and is being investigated,"" the statement added. The Hemburg organisers said the official race would take place as planned on Sunday. A statement said: ""The vehicle left the track and landed in the meadow."" They added that rescuers had been ""very fast"" to reach the scene. Richard Hammond was nearly killed in a crash in 2006 The crash comes 11 years after Mr Hammond nearly died when he lost control of a Vampire dragster while filming for Top Gear. He was in a coma for two weeks after the accident at Elvington Airfield, near York. Mr Hammond, who had been driving at speeds of up to 288mph (463km/h), suffered brain injuries but made a full recovery. Richard Hammond spent a fortnight in a coma in 2006 after this crash A ""catastrophic disintegration"" of the jet car's front tyre, probably caused by an object like a nail, caused the crash,a BBC report later concluded,external. In early March 2017, Mr Hammond said he had fallen off a motorbike ""many times"" while filming an episode of The Grand Tour in Mozambique and ""banged my head"". But he also said he was ""fine"", although Mr Clarkson told the Sun newspaper that Mr Hammond had ""hurt himself quite badly"".

"Theresa May's Conservatives are seeking a deal with Arlene Foster's DUP Downing Street and the Democratic Unionist Party say they are still in discussions over a possible deal to secure support for a minority Conservative government. On Saturday, Downing Street announced a deal had been agreed in principle - but both sides then issued statements saying talks were ongoing. The Tories need the support of the DUP's 10 MPs for a Commons majority. No 10 described it as a ""confidence and supply"" deal rather than a coalition. Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure after Thursday's general election left her without a majority. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told theSunday Mirrorhe could still be prime minister. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, meanwhile, dismissed reports of a Tory party leadership bid as ""tripe"". Live: Corbyn among Sunday political interviewees Who are the DUP? Can a Conservative-DUP pact work? Q&A: What is a hung parliament? The agreement being discussed between the DUP and the Tories, who fell eight seats short of a majority in Thursday's election, is not a full coalition, but an agreement which sees the smaller party support the larger one in key votes such as on the Budget. Downing Street and the DUP issued separate statements overnight, emphasising that the deal between them had not yet been finalised. The tone of both was in contrast to Saturday evening's message from No 10, which said a deal had been agreed in principle. In a DUP statement released at midnight, the party said: ""The DUP held discussions with representatives of the Conservative Party in line with Arlene Foster's commitment to explore how we might bring stability to the nation at this time of great challenge. ""The talks so far have been positive."" The DUP also retweeted a Sky News journalist's tweet claiming Downing Street's first statement had been issued in error. Within an hour, Downing Street said the details would be put forward by both parties ""as and when"" they were finalised. It added: ""We will welcome any such deal being agreed, as it will provide the stability and certainty the whole country requires as we embark on Brexit and beyond."" No explanation has been given for the change by Downing Street. In response to the earlier Downing Street statement, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called on Mrs May to make public immediately the details of the deal ""stitched up behind closed doors"". Sinn FÃ©in's leader in Northern Ireland Michelle O'Neill said the DUP had ""betrayed the interests of the people"" and the new arrangement would ""end in tears"". Mr Corbyn said the government did not have any credibility to go forward and the Labour Party would do what it could to stop it, including by voting down the Queen's Speech. Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? What does result mean for Brexit? Sinn FÃ©in has said the deal will ""end in tears"" The DUP are pro-union in UK terms, pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party's 2017 manifesto outlined calls for increases in the personal tax allowance, continued rises in the national living wage, renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent and revisiting terrorism laws - all similar to Conservative policy. But they differ in areas including abolishing air passenger duty, cutting VAT for tourism businesses and maintaining a triple lock on pensions. Why Queen's Speech is a big test for May What you want to know about the election result Tory chief whip Gavin Williamson met DUP chiefs in Belfast on Saturday. Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said the DUP and Conservatives had been ""looking at the full range of possibilities"" during Mr Williamson's visit. The parties had discussed everything from just an informal undertaking to a full coalition agreement. He added: ""I am told that what the DUP are looking at is securing benefits. So keep the pension triple lock and preserve universal benefits such as the winter fuel allowance for pensioners. ""That would allow the DUP to say 'we are not just acting in the interests of Northern Ireland, we are true unionists, we are acting in the interest of the whole of the United Kingdom'."" Meanwhile,the Mail on Sunday,externalreported a ""close ally"" of Mr Johnson as saying it was ""go-go-go"" to get him to take over the party from Mrs May. But Mr Johnsontweeted,external: ""Mail on Sunday tripe - I am backing Theresa May. Let's get on with the job."" This deal would see the DUP promise to back the government in votes of no confidence and supply - or Budget - issues. In return, the government would support or fund some of the DUP's policies. These deals tend to be loose and a long way short of a formal coalition. Minority governments like this are not uncommon. John Major survived without a majority in the dying days of his Tory administration in the mid-1990s. Labour's Harold Wilson and James Callaghan governed with minorities for much of the 1970s. But these governments can be quite constrained in what they can do, passing as little legislation as possible to avoid defeat. They can also be unstable and short lived, if the deal between the parties breaks down and fresh elections have to be called.

"Anders Behring Breivik murdered 77 people in bomb and gun attacks Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik has changed his name to Fjotolf Hansen, his lawyer has confirmed. The move came a day after the country's Supreme Court refused to hear the neo-Nazi'sappeal over ""inhumane"" prison conditions. Breivik murdered 77 people in 2011 in two terror attacks that shocked Norway. Lawyer Oeystein Storrvik refused to share Breivik's reasons for choosing the name Hansen, one of Norway's most common surnames, or the rarer Fjotolf. ""He told me some reasons but I don't want to talk about what he told me,"" Mr Storrvik told Reuters. Profile: Anders Behring Breivik Killer Breivik wins human rights case Just how cushy are Norwegian prisons? Under Norwegian law, people can change their names in the official register, as long as they will not cause offence, or harm the person concerned. It is not known when Breivik decided to change his name. However, the Norwegian business register shows that Breivik Geofarm, an agricultural firm the killer used to obtain bomb-making materials, is now registered to Fjotolf Hansen. According toNorway's Statistics Bureau,external, there are more than 52,000 people with the surname Hansen in a population of five million. It says that ""fewer than four people, or no-one"" use the first name Fjotolf. The mass killer is being held at Telemark prison in Skien, Norway Breivik, a far-right extremist, killed eight people in Oslo with a bomb, and then gunned down 69 others - many of them teenagers - at a summer youth camp on the island of Utoya. Before carrying out the attacks he circulated a 1,500-page manifesto signed ""Andrew Berwick"" - the Anglicised version of his name. Breivik was convicted of terrorism and premeditated murder, and given the maximum sentence of 21 years' imprisonment, which can be extended indefinitely. He has never expressed any remorse for committing Norway's worst peace-time atrocity.

"Luke Pollard said he wanted to know ""why and who is responsible"" for what happened Thousands of votes were not included in the result for a newly-elected Labour MP, Plymouth City Council has said. Luke Pollard won Plymouth Sutton and Devonport with 23,808 votes. However, the actual figure including the missed votes cast in his favour was 27,283. Mr Pollard said the votes from the Efford and Lipson ward were counted in his constituency, but they were not included in the result. He would still have won comfortably over Conservative Oliver Colvile. Mr Colvile's official result on Thursday was 17,806 votes.  However, with Efford and Lipson added in he won 20,476 votes. The Electoral Commission has said it will investigate. It isalready probing claims about missing postal votesin Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, in addition to South West Devon and Plymouth Moor View. A spokesperson said: ""The commission is aware of reports of electoral administrative problems in Plymouth and is in contact with the electoral officers who are responsible for delivering the election in these areas. ""We will be reporting on the administration of the polls after the election and will carefully consider these reports as part of that process."" The city council said an ""error in a spreadsheet"" meant that more than 6,100 votes from Efford and Lipson ""were not included in the final declaration sheet for the Plymouth Sutton and Devonport constituency"". A spokesman said: ""We are very sorry that this error has happened. We are making all paperwork and data available to the Electoral Commission and to candidates and agents to inspect."" Mr Pollard said the votes from the Efford and Lipson ward were counted in his constituency but not included in the result Mr Pollard said: ""It's just another thing to add to the catalogue of mistakes by the council.

"Four men - believed to be in their 20s - were in the car when it crashed in west London A man has died after the car he was travelling in crashed into the basement of a home in west London, ignoring police attempts to flag it down. It had been speeding and crashed at about 03:10 BST on West Cromwell Road, Kensington. The Met Police has referred the case to the police watchdog. Two men freed themselves from the vehicle while another two were released with the help of firefighters. One of the men died at the scene and another is in a critical condition. The other two men have been arrested and the Met Police's Directorate of Professional Standards has been informed as a matter of course. All four of the men were believed to be in their 20s and the deceased man's next of kin have been told. Police said officers lost sight of the car as it sped away along the A4 Tolgarth Road. They then saw it had crashed into the property. A woman who lived in the house which was hit by the car said: ""You could hear them screaming. ""They cut them out but one didn't make it."" Another witness said: ""There was a massive bang. He hit the traffic light and span round and round. He ended up in the basement. ""There is a massive cracking in the wall of the basement. ""The police were chasing him."" The incident has been referred to the police watchdog.

"David Manning, 64, voted Labour in Plymouth despite usually supporting the Conservatives Theresa May remains prime minister despite disappointing election results for the Conservatives. After calling the election in search of an increased majority, the Conservativeshave emerged with 13 fewer seatsthan they held at the start of the campaign. Labour - widely expected to lose seats to the Tories - made a net gain of 30 seats. Of those seats it won, 28 came from the Conservatives, while of those it lost, six went in the other direction. The BBC has spoken to former Tory voters in some of those lost seats to find out why they changed their minds. David Manning, 64, has supported the Conservatives for most of his life. Living in thePlymouth Sutton and Devonport constituency, he was among the voters who helped Labour candidate Luke Pollard take the seat from Conservative Oliver Colvile - increasing Labour's share of the vote by 16.7%. A retired teacher, he says the idea that he would have voted for Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party was laughable at the beginning of the campaign. ""I was even ridiculing him,"" he told the BBC. ""At the start of the campaign I was totally against Jeremy Corbyn. My switch from blue to red was a surprise even to myself. ""However, as the campaign progressed I warmed to him and cooled to Mrs May."" Explore the full general election results David has voted for Labour only once before, when Tony Blair was leading the party. ""Mrs May was wooden and lacked charisma,"" he said. ""And having witnessed first hand the way education has been dismantled by the Tories, I concluded that the alternative Labour was offering was far better for the country. ""I've watched my partner's school become an academy and have the money sucked out of it. ""I read every manifesto and asked myself an honest question: 'What do I think is best for the country?' ""I believe in Labour's manifesto."" David believes there has been a shift in public opinion and he thinks that is a trend which could continue. Labour's victory in Canterbury- achieved with a majority of just 187 but representing a 21% swing from 2015 - suggests he could be right. The Kent seat had been held by the Conservatives since 1918.  Sir Julian Brazier - the sitting Conservative MP - had represented the area since 1987. New York based Financial Times columnist John Authersdescribed Labour's victory,externalthere as the ""rough equivalent, in US terms, of Democrats taking Texas"". Sharon and Michael Dawson both voted for Labour candidate Rosie Duffield in Canterbury, Kent. Sharon Dawson and her husband Michael voted for Labour. In the past they have voted for both the main parties. Sharon voted Labour in 2015 while Michael plumped for the Conservatives. ""We are pleased but very surprised,"" Sharon said. ""With such a big majority we didn't really think it would happen."" Sharon is a teacher, while Michael is a microbiologist working in the NHS. Both said that austerity played a key role in their decision to support Labour. ""To lose more funding for us would basically mean losing teachers,"" Sharon said. ""You can only save so much in the NHS before you have to start making cutbacks to critical services,"" Michael added. ""The cuts have to stop."" Explore the full general election results Kent is one of the few parts of the country where a grammar school system still operates. Though popular with some, a Conservative commitment to expanding the selective school system - reaffirmed in the manifesto - has also drawn significant criticism,not least from within the Conservative Party itself. ""I don't think having more grammar schools will improve education for all,"" Sharon said. ""In a fair system all students should be offered the same level of education and educational experiences."" ""The Tory manifesto wasn't for the people,"" Michael said. ""It was for the rich, the upper class. You look at the Tory potential spend on the NHS and compare it to what Labour were proposing and the Labour plans are much more viable. The NHS is in crisis."" Election 2017: Follow the latest news live Who are the Democratic Unionist Party? Analysis: May stays, for now Sharon says that in the week leading up to the election, rumours circulating on social media pointed to a tight result in Canterbury. But they were still caught off guard when the ballots had been counted. ""Did I think Labour could win Canterbury? Hell no!"" said Michael. ""People are sick of austerity. I thought there might be a swing to Labour but to win was a shock."" In Kensington, London, the result was perhaps even more dramatic. After several recounts, Labour candidateEmma Dent Coad was declared the winner, defeating Conservative Victoria Borwick by just 20 votes. Ms Borwick's share of the vote dropped by more than 10% while Ms Dent Coad saw Labour's vote climb by more than 11%. Explore the full general election results Kensington and Chelsea voted overwhelmingly to remain in the 2016 EU referendum, with almost 69% of voters opting to maintain Britain's EU membership. Some social media users have declared the electoral upset in Kensington, where the Liberal Democrats also increased their vote share by close to 7%, the ""revenge of the remainers,external"". Lorna, 58, voted against the Conservatives for the first time in her life. ""Victoria Borwick is particularly pro-Brexit so doesn't represent her constituency,"" she said. ""I think Brexit is nuts."" Lorna did not vote for Labour, but instead opted for a pro-remain independent. A number of the voters the BBC spoke to in the area told similar stories. One 54-year-old man, who did not want to be named, said that he had voted for the Conservatives in the last eight elections but switched to the Liberal Democrats because ""I am a remainer and I didn't like Theresa May's rhetoric"". Labour voter Gabriela Sexton said she was ""delighted"" with the result. ""The borough of Kensington was incredibly complacent,"" she said. ""No one ever came to see us from the Tory party [during the campaign]."" Briony Jones has lived in Kensington for 50 years. Briony Jones normally votes for the Green Party, but chose to opt for Labour in this election. ""I think change is good because we have never had a MP of a different complexion to the council,"" she said. ""I thought actually who had the most chance [of winning] and I read up on Emma Dent Coad and I liked what I read. ""I'm jolly pleased."" By Chris Bell, UGC and Social News team.

"Adam West and Burt Ward as Batman and Robin in the 1960s TV series Adam West, the US actor best known as the star of the 1960s hit TV series Batman, has died aged 88. West died peacefully in Los Angeles after a ""short but brave battle"" with leukaemia, a family spokesperson said. His tongue-in-cheek portrayal of Batman and the superhero's alter ego Bruce Wayne won a cult following. He later struggled to find big acting roles, but won a new generation of fans in more recent times after joining the cast of Family Guy. First appearing in season two in 2002, he voiced Quahog's eccentric Mayor Adam West, described by series creator Seth MacFarlane as an ""alternate universe"", satirised version of the actor. MacFarlane paid tribute to the star on Twitter, saying he had ""lost a friend"" and described West as ""irreplaceable"". West's family said in a statement: ""Our dad always saw himself as The Bright Knight, and aspired to make a positive impact on his fans' lives. He was and always will be our hero."" The Batman TV series, with its onscreen fight-scene graphics of Wham! and Pow! became an unexpected hit. West and his co-star Burt Ward, who played Batman's sidekick Robin, won widespread acclaim for their kitsch portrayal of the Dynamic Duo.

""I will miss him in the physical world and savour him always in the world of imagination and creativity,"" she said. Adam West remained closely associated with the Batman character throughout his career In a 2010 interview with the website Slice of SciFi, West said the TV series had benefitted from very good writers. ""They saw the craziness, the comedy. You know, just as he's about to put her in (jail), Batman says to Catwoman, 'You give me curious stirrings in my utility belt.' That's funny stuff."" When the series ended, West struggled to break free from the character, but over a long career appeared in nearly 50 films including Drop Dead Gorgeous, An American Vampire Story and Nevada Smith.

"This video can not be played Theresa May's former director of communications, Katie Perrior, explains how the inner circle operates Prime Minister Theresa May's two closest advisers have quit after the Conservatives failed to win a majority of MPs in the general election. The BBC understands the PM was warned she faced a leadership challenge unless she sacked Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill. Labour said the pair had ""taken the fall"" for the prime minister. Mrs May has announced that the new Downing Street chief of staff is ex-Conservative MP and former housing minister Gavin Barwell. Mr Timothy said he took responsibility for his role in the ""disappointing"" result and the widely-criticised manifesto package on social care. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the pair's departure bought the PM some ""breathing space"" following 24 hours of recriminations after the Conservatives lost their overall majority. He said the two were so close to the PM that critical MPs believed that, unless they made way, she would not be able to change her leadership style to adopt a more ""outgoing, inclusive, responsive, empathetic approach"". Mrs May has said she intends to stay as prime minister and on Saturday evening it was announced her party's chief whip had agreed an outline deal ""in principle"" with the DUP of Northern Ireland, which would see the unionist party support the Tories on key votes. Live updates and rolling coverage DUP agree 'confidence' deal with Tories No 10 was 'toxic' says former May aide Who are the DUP? Can a Conservative and DUP pact work? Q&A: What is a hung parliament? Mr Timothy and Ms Hill both stepped down amid mounting pressure on Mrs May to overhaul the way No 10 worked and broaden her circle of advisers. Announcing his resignationon the Conservative Home website,external, Mr Timothy urged Tory MPs to ""get behind"" Mrs May but said nothing should be allowed to get in the way of the process of forming a government and beginning Brexit talks. He said the Conservatives' failure to win was not due to a lack of support for Theresa May and the Conservatives but due to an ""unexpected surge"" of support for Labour. Who were the PM's special advisers? Fiona Hill:Fiercely loyal and seen as a formidable operator, Fiona Hill was at Mrs May's side for four years at the Home Office, becoming a close confidante of the then home secretary. A former Sky News and Scotsman journalist in her 40s, she led work on the Modern Slavery Act and published her own report on the subject. She was forced to resign as Mrs May's special adviser in a2014 dispute with Michael Goveover who was to blame for briefing newspapers about an increase in extremism in schools. But she was brought back into the fold when Mrs May became PM. Nick Timothy:The bearded Brummie is the son of a steelworker, who went to grammar school and joined the Conservative Party at the age of 17. He is credited with influencing the PM's views on social mobility and the need to put the Conservatives ""at the service of working people"". His ambition to be a Conservative MP was reportedly thwarted by David Cameron, following a row over special advisers being asked to canvass in a by-election. He conceded his party had failed to communicate a sufficiently ""positive"" message to voters and address their concerns over years of austerity and inter-generational divisions, including over Brexit. ""We were not talking to the people who decided to vote for Labour,"" he said. He defended the party's ""honest and strong"" manifesto, saying controversial proposals to use the value of peoples' homes to fund domiciliary care costs had been discussed in government for months and were not his own personal ""pet project"". But he added he took ""responsibility for my part in this election campaign, which was the oversight of our policy programme"" and ""I regret the decision not to include in the manifesto a ceiling as well as a floor in our proposal to help meet the increasing cost of social care"". This video can not be played Theresa May: 'Let's get to work' Ms Hill said it had been a pleasure to serve in government and she believed Mrs May would continue as prime minister. Norman Smith said he understood that senior Conservatives had warned the PM they would instigate a leadership contest at a meeting of backbenchers early next week if the pair did not leave, and were confident they could get the required 48 signatures to trigger a contest. One former minister, Anna Soubry, welcomed the clearout, saying it was the ""right thing to do"" and saying the PM must ""build a consensus"" on Brexit and other issues. But Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the PM's advisers had ""taken the fall"" for her but tweeted the PM was ""responsible for her own defeat"". Davidson: 'No plans for breakaway party' Welsh MPs wait on Tory reshuffle news Gavin Barwell once wrote a book about his narrow victory in the 2015 general election Mr Barwell lost his Croydon Central seat on Thursday - which he won in 2015 with a majority of just 165 votes - to Labour's Sarah Jones, polling 24,221 votes to Ms Jones's 29,873. He has written a book entitled How to Win a Marginal Seat: My Year Fighting For My Political Life. He was appointed Minister for Housing and Minister for London in July 2016. Earlier, Mrs May's director of communications until the election was announced, Katie Perrior, called the campaign ""pretty dysfunctional"", telling the BBC she ""needed to have a few grey hairs in there who been around a bit and could say 'don't do that'"". As the Conservative leadership begins formal negotiations with the DUP, disquiet is being expressed in some quarters about the move. Charles Tannock, a Conservative member of the European Parliament, said the DUP - which is opposed to same-sex marriage - was a ""hardline, populist, protectionist"" party and a ""poor fit"" as a partner. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, has said there are ""huge disagreements"" between the two parties on gay and women's rights but she does not believe this will stand in the way of Theresa May being able to govern. Ruth Davidson has said she will put LGBTI rights above her party Ms Davidson, who is gay and plans to marry her partner in the near future, said she had received ""categoric assurance"" from Mrs May about the sanctity of LGBTI rights in Scotland where - unlike Northern Ireland - equal marriage is legal in the event of any deal with the DUP. What does result mean for Brexit? Merkel: 'EU ready to start Brexit talks' Election winners and losers ""What is important is that we try and help, where possible, to advance these rights in Northern Ireland while making sure there is absolutely no idea of any kind of roll back here. Those are the sort of assurances I sought and received"". Speaking on Friday, the prime minister said her party had a ""strong relationship"" with the DUP and that she intended to form a government which could ""provide certainty and lead Britain forward at this critical time for our country"". This video can not be played ""The union is our guiding star"" - DUP's Arlene Foster Analysis by political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue The clock is ticking for Theresa May. She needs to conclude a deal with the DUP in the next week or so ahead of the Queen's Speech, which will set out the new government's agenda. That takes place on Monday 19 June - the same day Brexit negotiations are due to start. The DUP and its 10 MPs are in a very strong position. It's all their Christmases rolled into one and they will make sure they leverage as much as they can from their advantage. Money for Northern Ireland will undoubtedly be part of their demands, and Mrs May will expect that. But trickier will be any demands they have about the implementation of Brexit in Northern Ireland - in particular the DUP's determination to maintain a soft border with the south. Another potential problem is the planned restart of negotiations for power-sharing in the province. Typically the British government tries to act as an honest broker between Republicans and Unionists. But if Mrs May is doing a deal with the DUP, that could make it harder to reach an agreement with Sinn Fein. Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? DUP leader Arlene Foster confirmed she had spoken to Mrs May and that they would speak further to ""explore how it may be possible to bring stability to this nation at this time of great challenge"". Mrs May is expected to continue assembling her top team later after she decided to keep key figures - including Chancellor Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary Boris and Home Secretary Amber Rudd - in their current roles. David Davis will also stay on as Brexit secretary and Sir Michael Fallon will keep his role as defence secretary. There could be limited changes elsewhere in the cabinet while nine middle-ranking and junior ministers, including Ben Gummer and Jane Ellison, lost their seats at the general election and will need to be replaced. Jeremy Corbyn has said Mrs May should ""make way"" for a government that would be ""truly representative of the people of this country"". The Labour leader, who is expected to announce his shadow cabinet on Sunday, said his party was ready to form a minority government of its own, but stressed he would not enter into any ""pacts or deals"" with other parties.

"The yachts left Plymouth at the start of the race to Rhode Island A major rescue operation has taken place in the mid-Atlantic after a fleet of yachts that set out from the UK was hit by a ""once in a lifetime"" storm. Luxury ocean liner the Queen Mary 2 has rescued lone yachtsman Mervyn Wheatley after he issued a mayday. A massive storm, which saw 15m waves and 60-knot winds, left a number of yachts in trouble. The boats are competing ina transatlantic race,externalhosted by Plymouth's Royal Western Yacht Club (RWYC). A Cunard spokesman said that the QM2 was involved in a rescue operation ""at the request of the US Coastguard"". Mr Wheatley is now on board the QM2, is said to be safe and well and is now on his way to Halifax. One race yacht sank, and another lost its mast. The race began on 29 May. The Canadian Armed Forces says a fourth yacht has also declared an emergency but it is not known if this vessel is part of the race. The transatlantic race involves 22 boats made up of solo sailors and crews of two, racing race from Plymouth to Newport, Rhode Island in the US. The RWYC said it has been liaising with coastguard teams and says everyone is now safe. Mr Wheatley, 73, from Newton Ferrers near Plymouth, scuppered his yacht Tamarind after it was knocked sideways and a porthole was smashed sending water flooding into the boat. His wife Penny told the BBC the yacht was knocked over during a hurricane on Friday at about 02:00 BST. ""He was down below when the mast went under water. ""It meant everything was thrown across the cabin and he thinks some plywood went through the porthole and in came the water."" She also said he scuppered the boat so it would not be a danger to other shipping. ""He is fine, just tired. He has never lost another boat. The last 36 hours have been a nightmare, because she could have gone down with him on board. ""There's no way he would have survived on a life-raft in those conditions."" The Queen Mary 2 is on a cruise to Halifax in Canada John Lewis, race director for the RWYC, told the BBC that three race competitors gave off emergency signals, and a further two needed help from the Canadian coastguard in Halifax. ""I've been involved with these races for 25 years now, and this is the most extreme low depression going across the Atlantic at this time of year. ""So it's very unusual, but these are professional sailors, they're used to arduous conditions but not really a once in a lifetime storm like this one."" The captain of Queen Mary 2, Chris Wells, said Mr Wheatley had been found in ""big seas"" with high waves, and was brought aboard via the ship's rescue boat. Mr Wells added: ""He is very happy to be here. I think he will have a much more leisurely and luxury transit to the other side of the Atlantic than he would have done in his 38-foot boat."" A spokeswoman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said an RAF C-130 Hercules aircraft had been sent from the UK to help by providing top cover and communications assistance.

"Jeff Sessions will appear before a Senate panel on Tuesday, he has said US Attorney General Jeff Sessions says he will appear before a Senate panel in response to James Comey's testimony. He will appear before the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday, he announced in a letter. He said the decision had been made ""in light of Mr Comey's recent testimony"". Former FBI director Mr Comey told the panel this week that he had asked Mr Sessions to ""prevent any future direct communication between the president and me"". Who is Jeff Sessions? Trump-Comey row: What questions remain after testimony? The testimony made headlines around the world, as it was the first time Mr Comey had publicly given his side of the apparent fall-out between himself and US President Donald Trump in the run-up to his being fired in May. Inhis letter,externalon Saturday, Mr Sessions said, ""It is important that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum"" which he said he believed to be the Senate intelligence committee. He had been due to appear before the Senate and House appropriations subcommittees on Tuesday. He said in the letter deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein would attend instead. Mr Sessionsremoved himself from the FBI's inquiry into alleged Russian meddlingin the US election back in March after it emerged he had met Moscow's envoy during last year's White House race. This video can not be played Comey's most revealing moments Mr Comey told the Senate there were a ""variety of reasons"" why Mr Sessions's involvement in the investigation of Russia's alleged interference would be problematic. However, he said he was unable to speak about them in an open session of the hearing. Mr Comey also told the Senate that the Trump administration's comments about him and the FBI were ""lies plain and simple"". He said he was ""confused"" by the ""shifting explanations"" for his sacking, which came as he led an inquiry into any links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. President Donald Trump later said he never sought to impede the inquiry, and accusedMr Comey of saying some things that ""just weren't true"". The president has said he is ""100%"" willing to speak under oath about his conversations, denying he asked for Mr Comey's loyalty or for the inquiry into former White House aide Michael Flynn to be dropped. This video can not be played President Trump willing to testify under oath Mr Trump went on to say he was considering releasing further information about possible recordings of the conversations between himself and Mr Comey.

What is the difference between a free trade area, a single market and a customs union? Theresa May has done a deal with the DUP which means she stays as UK prime minister. Here's a guide to what's going on. Empty properties owned by the rich should be used for the homeless of Grenfell Tower, Labour's leader says. The prime minister has released a statement after meeting Northern Ireland's main parties saying agreement can be reached to restore a power-sharing executive at Stormont ""if there is good will on all sides"". ""But time is running short and the parties must come together by the 29 June for the return of a strong voice at Stormont and for a brighter future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" She said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire would keep talking to the parties ""and if no resolution is reached then we will need to consider what steps we need to take, to ensure Northern Ireland has the political stability it needs"".

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the Grenfell Tower disaster was an emergency of such gravity that it had already become a significant issue for the government, at a very volatile time. The priority was to focus on getting help to where it was needed - with the announcement that a scheme to provide extra cash for the council - before getting on with a full public inquiry, which would get going ""pretty soon"". But the handling of such an awful situation was very risky for politicians and uncomfortable truths could emerge from the public inquiry. ""Potentially, some people expect, it may well show that not just this government but previous governments have simply not done enough to make sure this kind of housing is safe,"" she said.

He said all parties in Northern Ireland ""need to be consulted on all of this"".

Dodds says the setting of a date for the Queen's Speech is separate and not
relevant to his party's discussions over a deal with the Conservatives. Questioned about whether a deal
would be announced before the Queen's speech next Wednesday, Mr Dodds said
there's no deadline for the discussions. Mr Dodds reiterated that the DUP
wants to strengthen the UK, deliver Brexit in a proper and sensible manner for
Northern Ireland and spread prosperity around the UK. Asked if the Treasury was ""nitpicking"" over the
financial details, Mr Dodds said he'd seen the reports in the newspapers but
wouldn't comment on speculation. More on the Brexit talks. Formal negotiationswill begin on Monday, the UK and EU say. The announcement by Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier follows preliminary talks in Brussels between officials. The formal negotiations were already due to start on Monday but doubt was cast by the general election result and ongoing talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists. The UK is due to leave by the end of March 2019. Labour MP Harriet Harman has been speaking to the BBC after the Westminster Hall session earlier. The former party deputy leader is an MP in the London borough of Southwark, where the 2009 Lakanal House fire killed six people. She said tower blocks needed to be fitted with sprinklers and questions needed to be asked about whether refurbishing blocks could compromise fire safety - and whether the official ""stay put"" advice for people in burning buildings should be changed. Of the public inquiry, she said: There doesn't have to be a delay. It's wrong if there is a delay because people are living in thousands of tower blocks all around the country and they need to know the lessons are going to be learned quickly.""  She also said it was up to opposition parties to make sure the government ""doesn't slip off the hook"" in terms of providing resources to make sure buildings are safe. BBC political editor tweets...

"The prime minister met the Queen on Friday to discuss forming a government The first big parliamentary test for Theresa May's minority government will come at the end of the month when MPs vote on the Queen's Speech. The Queen will open the new parliament on Monday 19 June and announce the government's legislative programme - a list of all the laws the prime minister hopes to get through parliament in the coming year. MPs will spend six days debating these plans before a vote on 27 June. This, in effect, will be a vote of confidence in Theresa May's government and the first test of any deal with the DUP. The firstQueen's Speechfollowing a general election would normally reflect the winning party's election manifesto. Typically, it would contain more proposals than in later years as victorious ministers seize the day. This time things are a little different. Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? What do they stand for? Can a Conservative and DUP pact work? Theresa May leads a minority government which means she will need the support of the DUP to win key votes in the Commons and may have to offer policy changes in return for that backing. The Conservatives are still the largest party in Westminster and saw their share of the vote increase but - inthe wake of the election result- unhappy Tory MPs and candidates have criticised the party's manifesto calling it a ""disaster"" and ""shockingly bad"". That lack of enthusiasm combined with a minority government could lead to a shorter, less ambitious Queen's Speech, as the government seeks to avoid parliamentary defeats. The Speech, which is written by the government, varies in length every year Soplans to rethink the triple lock, which guarantees the state pension, could be shelved along with theproposal to means test winter fuel payments. The most controversial part of the Tory manifesto turned out to be the policy on social care whichcritics were quick to label a ""dementia tax"". During the election campaign, Mrs May said there would be a consultation on the plans to allow charities and others to give their views - an indication that there's unlikely to be an early change in the law. Theresa May's enthusiasm for new grammar schools in England isn't shared by all Conservatives but would she risk a rebellion over the policy? The lack of a parliamentary majority could also put a question mark over plans for athird runway at Heathrow. Election 2017: Live updates and coverage Full UK results breakdown Her announcement during the election that she planned to giveMPs a free vote on repealing the fox hunting bantook many people by surprise. As MPs would vote with their conscience rather than along party lines, the lack of a government majority shouldn't be a factor. But the promise was also included in the previous two Conservative manifestos without making it into the Queen's Speech. The lack of a Commons majority might also make it difficult to get controversial policies through the House of Lords where peers could rewrite or reject legislation. One proposal that we can expect to be included in the Queen's Speech is the so-calledGreat Repeal Billwhich will transfer thousands of EU laws and regulations into UK law ahead of Brexit.

"Afghan forces (above) are facing a resurgent Taliban in Helmand province Three US special forces soldiers have been shot dead by an Afghan colleague during an operation in eastern Afghanistan, US officials say. A spokesman for the governor in Nangahar province said an Afghan commando had opened fire on the US troops during a joint operation in Achin. He was shot dead in return fire. Another US soldier was reportedly wounded in the attack. A spokesman for the Taliban said it had carried out the attack. Islamic State militants also operate in the area. Earlier, at least two Afghan policemen were killed by US forces in a so-called friendly fire incident in southern Afghanistan. The deaths are said to have occurred when a US aircraft returned fire during a joint operation in the restive province of Helmand. It is reported to be the first friendly fire incident in Helmand since US Marines returned there in May. Taliban insurgents have made widespread gains in the province. In a statement, the US military apologised for the incident and said that an investigation had been launched. It happened as police were on patrol in volatile Nad Ali district. The dead were members of the Afghan Border Police. Life in Afghanistan under the militants Afghan forces face 'decisive' battle in Helmand Snipers and green tea on Helmand's front line Afghan officials told AFP news agency that the policemen were patrolling too close to a Taliban base prior to the attack. They say a number of militants were also killed in the strike. The Taliban are now putting pressure on Afghan forces - seen here clearing improvised explosive devices - in Nad Ali In recent months, the Taliban have captured several districts in Helmand and put provincial capital Lashkar Gah under pressure. The arrival of hundreds of US Marines - following the withdrawal of US troops three years ago - is part of the Nato-led effort to train and assist Afghan forces. They include special forces who conduct separate counter-terrorism operations. Why Sangin's fall to the Taliban matters World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' Air strikes by US warplanes have risen significantly over the last few months as President Donald Trump and other foreign leaders come under pressure to commit more troops.

"Theresa May is back in Downing Street but many of her MPs are not happy The atmosphere in Downing Street under Theresa May is ""pretty toxic"" and its operation ""dysfunctional"", a former aide of the prime minister has said. Katie Perrior, who served as director of communications for 10 months, said she and others were not able to ""speak freely"" and her advice was not heeded. She accused the PM's chiefs of staff Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy of treating ministers with a lack of respect. The PM is being urged to make changes after losing her majority. The BBC understands Mrs May has been warned she faces a leadership challenge on Monday unless she sacks her two closest advisers. Election: Live updates and rolling coverage May to finalise cabinet amid DUP talks Mrs May, who is seeking to form a government with the support of the DUP, has said she will look at ""personnel issues"" amid anger in Tory circles about the role of Mr Timothy and Ms Hill in the drafting of the party's manifesto and the overall conduct of the election campaign. Ms Perrior said Mrs May was a ""good person"" who would take personal responsibility for the campaign but suggested the set-up in No 10 was not working. ""Being in the Home Office for such a long time with her top team, she became accustomed to that being it and of course running the Home Office is very different from running the country,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today. This video can not be played Theresa May's former director of communications, Katie Perrior, explains how the inner circle operates ""She needed to broaden her circle of advisers and have a few grey hairs in there who had been around the block a bit in politics who could say 'don't do that and don't make enemies when you don't need to'."" She suggested that Mr Timothy and Ms Hill - the PM's ""gatekeepers"" who worked for her in the Home Office - were too protective of the prime minister and had a negative influence on how No 10 functioned, often ""bellowing"" at other staff. ""We would be able to speak freely if they weren't around and if they were, you don't speak,"" she said. ""Sometimes we would sit there and hear Fiona come up with things which, quite frankly, were crazy and say nothing."" Asked if the two aides treated cabinet ministers badly, as has been reported in the newspapers, she replied ""There was not enough respect shown to people who had spent 20 years in office. I felt sending people rude text messages was unacceptable. ""What the PM needs when you are going through a tough time like negotiating Brexit is diplomats, not street fighters. They only know one way to operate and that is to have enemies. I am sure I am one of these this morning."" Ms Perrior, a PR specialist who previously worked on Boris Johnson's 2008 mayoral campaign, said she had expressed her concerns before leaving in April about how things were done and ""that did not go down very well, as you can imagine"". Although she had never intended to stay in the role for more than two years, she said she concluded that remaining was ""pointless"" as former journalist Ms Hill had made it ""pretty clear"" she wanted to be communications director during the campaign. ""If you feel you are actually not being listened to then there is not point you being there... in communications, you don't have a dog and bark yourself. If you don't want to hire someone for their advice, you should not be hiring them."" She suggested the PM could have been better advised during the campaign, in which she declined to take part in the leaders debates, and also in its aftermath. The PM made a defiant statement outside Downing Street before giving an interview hours later in which expressed regret for the Conservative candidates who had lost and promised to ""reflect"" on the result. It has been reported that the second statement came after being told to do so by senior MPs. Ms Perrior added: ""If you are not this great communicator who is on to the phone this morning telling candidates 'I am sorry or I want to work with you in future, come with me' then you hire people who do that for you."" ""I am afraid she did not have those qualities herself but she did not hire people who had them either."" Neil Carmichael, one of the Tories to lose their seats at the election, said there needed to be a ""thorough shake-up"" at Downing Street. ""You can't really run a government from an ivory tower situation,"" he told BBC News. ""I do think Theresa May requires a more broadly based set of advisers.""

"Theresa May's Conservatives are seeking a deal with Arlene Foster's DUP Downing Street and the Democratic Unionist Party say they are still in discussions over a possible deal to secure support for a minority Conservative government. On Saturday, Downing Street announced a deal had been agreed in principle - but both sides then issued statements saying talks were ongoing. The Tories need the support of the DUP's 10 MPs for a Commons majority. No 10 described it as a ""confidence and supply"" deal rather than a coalition. Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure after Thursday's general election left her without a majority. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told theSunday Mirrorhe could still be prime minister. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, meanwhile, dismissed reports of a Tory party leadership bid as ""tripe"". Live: Corbyn among Sunday political interviewees Who are the DUP? Can a Conservative-DUP pact work? Q&A: What is a hung parliament? The agreement being discussed between the DUP and the Tories, who fell eight seats short of a majority in Thursday's election, is not a full coalition, but an agreement which sees the smaller party support the larger one in key votes such as on the Budget. Downing Street and the DUP issued separate statements overnight, emphasising that the deal between them had not yet been finalised. The tone of both was in contrast to Saturday evening's message from No 10, which said a deal had been agreed in principle. In a DUP statement released at midnight, the party said: ""The DUP held discussions with representatives of the Conservative Party in line with Arlene Foster's commitment to explore how we might bring stability to the nation at this time of great challenge. ""The talks so far have been positive."" The DUP also retweeted a Sky News journalist's tweet claiming Downing Street's first statement had been issued in error. Within an hour, Downing Street said the details would be put forward by both parties ""as and when"" they were finalised. It added: ""We will welcome any such deal being agreed, as it will provide the stability and certainty the whole country requires as we embark on Brexit and beyond."" No explanation has been given for the change by Downing Street. In response to the earlier Downing Street statement, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called on Mrs May to make public immediately the details of the deal ""stitched up behind closed doors"". Sinn FÃ©in's leader in Northern Ireland Michelle O'Neill said the DUP had ""betrayed the interests of the people"" and the new arrangement would ""end in tears"". Mr Corbyn said the government did not have any credibility to go forward and the Labour Party would do what it could to stop it, including by voting down the Queen's Speech. Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? What does result mean for Brexit? Sinn FÃ©in has said the deal will ""end in tears"" The DUP are pro-union in UK terms, pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party's 2017 manifesto outlined calls for increases in the personal tax allowance, continued rises in the national living wage, renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent and revisiting terrorism laws - all similar to Conservative policy. But they differ in areas including abolishing air passenger duty, cutting VAT for tourism businesses and maintaining a triple lock on pensions. Why Queen's Speech is a big test for May What you want to know about the election result Tory chief whip Gavin Williamson met DUP chiefs in Belfast on Saturday. Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said the DUP and Conservatives had been ""looking at the full range of possibilities"" during Mr Williamson's visit. The parties had discussed everything from just an informal undertaking to a full coalition agreement. He added: ""I am told that what the DUP are looking at is securing benefits. So keep the pension triple lock and preserve universal benefits such as the winter fuel allowance for pensioners. ""That would allow the DUP to say 'we are not just acting in the interests of Northern Ireland, we are true unionists, we are acting in the interest of the whole of the United Kingdom'."" Meanwhile,the Mail on Sunday,externalreported a ""close ally"" of Mr Johnson as saying it was ""go-go-go"" to get him to take over the party from Mrs May. But Mr Johnsontweeted,external: ""Mail on Sunday tripe - I am backing Theresa May. Let's get on with the job."" This deal would see the DUP promise to back the government in votes of no confidence and supply - or Budget - issues. In return, the government would support or fund some of the DUP's policies. These deals tend to be loose and a long way short of a formal coalition. Minority governments like this are not uncommon. John Major survived without a majority in the dying days of his Tory administration in the mid-1990s. Labour's Harold Wilson and James Callaghan governed with minorities for much of the 1970s. But these governments can be quite constrained in what they can do, passing as little legislation as possible to avoid defeat. They can also be unstable and short lived, if the deal between the parties breaks down and fresh elections have to be called.

What is the difference between a free trade area, a single market and a customs union? Theresa May has done a deal with the DUP which means she stays as UK prime minister. Here's a guide to what's going on. Empty properties owned by the rich should be used for the homeless of Grenfell Tower, Labour's leader says. The prime minister has released a statement after meeting Northern Ireland's main parties saying agreement can be reached to restore a power-sharing executive at Stormont ""if there is good will on all sides"". ""But time is running short and the parties must come together by the 29 June for the return of a strong voice at Stormont and for a brighter future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" She said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire would keep talking to the parties ""and if no resolution is reached then we will need to consider what steps we need to take, to ensure Northern Ireland has the political stability it needs"".

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the Grenfell Tower disaster was an emergency of such gravity that it had already become a significant issue for the government, at a very volatile time. The priority was to focus on getting help to where it was needed - with the announcement that a scheme to provide extra cash for the council - before getting on with a full public inquiry, which would get going ""pretty soon"". But the handling of such an awful situation was very risky for politicians and uncomfortable truths could emerge from the public inquiry.

Dodds says the setting of a date for the Queen's Speech is separate and not
relevant to his party's discussions over a deal with the Conservatives. Questioned about whether a deal
would be announced before the Queen's speech next Wednesday, Mr Dodds said
there's no deadline for the discussions. Mr Dodds reiterated that the DUP
wants to strengthen the UK, deliver Brexit in a proper and sensible manner for
Northern Ireland and spread prosperity around the UK. Asked if the Treasury was ""nitpicking"" over the
financial details, Mr Dodds said he'd seen the reports in the newspapers but
wouldn't comment on speculation. More on the Brexit talks. Formal negotiationswill begin on Monday, the UK and EU say. The announcement by Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier follows preliminary talks in Brussels between officials. The formal negotiations were already due to start on Monday but doubt was cast by the general election result and ongoing talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists.

The former party deputy leader is an MP in the London borough of Southwark, where the 2009 Lakanal House fire killed six people. She said tower blocks needed to be fitted with sprinklers and questions needed to be asked about whether refurbishing blocks could compromise fire safety - and whether the official ""stay put"" advice for people in burning buildings should be changed. Of the public inquiry, she said: There doesn't have to be a delay. It's wrong if there is a delay because people are living in thousands of tower blocks all around the country and they need to know the lessons are going to be learned quickly.""

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn tells well-wisher: We're not far off are we Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has told a well-wisher that ""we are not far off, are we"" in the wake of general election results that saw the party make gains. Mr Corbyn made the comment after a supporter shook his hand in the street and said: ""Unlucky."" But one of his critics, former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, said the result was ""not good enough"" and should not be seen as a ""famous victory"". Labour gained 30 seats in the election, enough to prevent a Tory majority. Mr Corbyn seemed to be in good spirits on Saturday as he walked with a posse of media from his house to a nearby meeting, later posing with Times columnist Giles Coren for a selfie at a children's football session. Conservative leader Theresa May was not seen on Saturday, as talks continued about forming a government with the support of the DUP. Mr Leslie told BBC Radio 4's Today programme about Labour's performance: ""We shouldn't pretend that this is a famous victory. It's good as far as it's gone, but it's not going to be good enough."" Labour secured 262 seats in the election and boosted its vote share to 40%. The Conservatives won 318 seats - eight fewer than they needed in order to secure a majority. Live election updates Corbyn hails 'incredible result' Why were young voters drawn to Corbyn? Mr Leslie said Labour missed an ""open goal"" as he had ""never known"" a more beatable prime minister than Theresa May. The Labour MP for Nottingham East refused to say whether he thought Mr Corbyn was a credible prime minister. ""I will never apologise for my view which is, yes of course you've got to inspire people, and we haven't done that well enough in the past. ""But you've got to convince them of your credibility and that you can move from protesting about the government to being in government."" This video can not be played Chris Leslie told Today that Labour had been looking at ""an open goal"" Mr Leslie said Labour MPs were ""working in this together"" but he would not commit to serving in a shadow cabinet. He said he feared an issue would arise that would go against his principles and he would have to resign. ""I'm never going to give in arguing for what I believe is a pathway to a majority Labour government,"" he added. Nia Griffith serves in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet However, shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith hascalled on Theresa May to step asideto allow Labour a chance to form a minority government. She told BBC Radio Wales: ""We're still saying quite clearly that we would be ready to take over if Theresa May cannot cobble something together, and we're very doubtful that she can. ""We don't really think she has a mandate to now, she's really made a fool of herself and really, quite frankly, she should step aside and let us have a go.""

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn tells well-wisher: We're not far off are we Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has told a well-wisher that ""we are not far off, are we"" in the wake of general election results that saw the party make gains. Mr Corbyn made the comment after a supporter shook his hand in the street and said: ""Unlucky."" But one of his critics, former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, said the result was ""not good enough"" and should not be seen as a ""famous victory"". Labour gained 30 seats in the election, enough to prevent a Tory majority. Mr Corbyn seemed to be in good spirits on Saturday as he walked with a posse of media from his house to a nearby meeting, later posing with Times columnist Giles Coren for a selfie at a children's football session. Conservative leader Theresa May was not seen on Saturday, as talks continued about forming a government with the support of the DUP. Mr Leslie told BBC Radio 4's Today programme about Labour's performance: ""We shouldn't pretend that this is a famous victory. It's good as far as it's gone, but it's not going to be good enough."" Labour secured 262 seats in the election and boosted its vote share to 40%. The Conservatives won 318 seats - eight fewer than they needed in order to secure a majority. Live election updates Corbyn hails 'incredible result' Why were young voters drawn to Corbyn? Mr Leslie said Labour missed an ""open goal"" as he had ""never known"" a more beatable prime minister than Theresa May. The Labour MP for Nottingham East refused to say whether he thought Mr Corbyn was a credible prime minister. ""I will never apologise for my view which is, yes of course you've got to inspire people, and we haven't done that well enough in the past. ""But you've got to convince them of your credibility and that you can move from protesting about the government to being in government."" This video can not be played Chris Leslie told Today that Labour had been looking at ""an open goal"" Mr Leslie said Labour MPs were ""working in this together"" but he would not commit to serving in a shadow cabinet. He said he feared an issue would arise that would go against his principles and he would have to resign. ""I'm never going to give in arguing for what I believe is a pathway to a majority Labour government,"" he added. Nia Griffith serves in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet However, shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith hascalled on Theresa May to step asideto allow Labour a chance to form a minority government. She told BBC Radio Wales: ""We're still saying quite clearly that we would be ready to take over if Theresa May cannot cobble something together, and we're very doubtful that she can. ""We don't really think she has a mandate to now, she's really made a fool of herself and really, quite frankly, she should step aside and let us have a go."" Mr Corbyn had given the party ""confidence"" about selling party policies such as public ownership of the railways, she added.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the move had opened up a second front inside the Syrian city. They entered the eastern part earlier this week. Its fighters were engaged in fierce clashes with the jihadists, it said. The SDF, supported by US-led coalition air strikes, has spent months encircling the city. ""The SDF captured the western half of the Al-Sabahiya neighbourhood and are reinforcing their positions there,"" the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group, Rami Abdel Rahman, told AFP news agency on Saturday. ""They then advanced north to the adjacent district of Al-Romaniya and are fighting IS there.""

"Love Island contestants (l-r) Jessica, Marcel, Olivia, Dominic and Amber are hoping to find romance this year Falling in love isn't easy - let alone falling in love on national television. But that's what 13 ""sexy singletons"" are hoping to do on Love Island, which has just begun its third series on ITV2. If you've never seen it before, the premise is to couple up and convince the public to keep you on the island in order to win Â£50,000 - all while trying to find your perfect match. Think Big Brother but with board shorts, bikinis and more under-the-sheets shenanigans than you can shake a stick at, as the couples chop and change throughout the series. If you have seen it before, it's likely to be one of your guilty pleasure programmes you've agreed to dedicate the next seven weeks of your life to. Or you may throw it in your trash TV basket. Caroline Flack presents the rebooted version of the reality show You may remember Love Island in its previous life as Celebrity Love Island, which ran from 2005-06 and featured the likes of Jayne Middlemiss, Callum Best and Strictly Come Dancing's Brendan Cole trying to find love. It was revived two years ago with average Joes taking part and was met with relatively modest success, watched by an average of 595,000 people - but still a hit for ITV2. Last year it exploded, with an average of 1.4 million fans tuning in daily to watch. The show became must-see viewing amongst mainly female (67.4%) viewers and under 35s (63.6%). Scheduled against Channel 5's Big Brother, about 1.2 million people are currently tuning into the sunny island escapes in Mallorca - 200,000 more than those watching the action in rainy Borehamwood. So what's all the fuss about? Predominantly aged 20-23 - with the oldest a positively ancient 31 - this year's contestants have clearly been cast for today's social media and millennial audience. They all have very active Instagram pages (which was likely a pre-requisite to appear), but here are a few that stand out. Executive assistant Chloe, 22, says she's come on the programme ""looking for the love of my life"". If you're a fan of Noughties pop you might recognise Marcel, who used to be in Blazin' Squad - but more on him later. Oil rig worker Sam, 21, introduced himself by saying: ""I pull birds for a living."" But don't think it's all glamour models and wannabe celebrities - 27-year-old Camilla works in explosive ordnance disposal, going into countries after conflicts and getting rid of landmines so they don't injure civilians. Oh, and she apparently dated Prince Harry. The Twitter commentary that accompanies each episode is of epic proportions, which gives viewers all the more reason to watch it live to be part of the conversation. #LoveIsland trended every night in its first week, with viewers keen to share their views on the villa's antics. The first episode was full of memes on how Marcel was trying to keep his Blazin' Squad past a secret, but then told a bunch of his housemates. Unfortunately as the group's first hit was in 2002 and most of the contestants are in their early 20s, Marcel's claim to fame was met with mostly tumbleweed. After the third episode there was a lot of debate over whether Camilla was too ""boring"" because she failed to kiss or fall in love with anyone in the first 48 hours. Viewers this year will be hoping for a similar sort of scandal that last year's series produced. Miss Great Britain Zara Hollandlost her crownafter scenes showing her performing a sex act with a fellow contestant were screened. Miss GB organisers said they couldn't promote her ""as a positive role model moving forward"", adding she ""simply did not uphold the responsibility expected of the title"". But it all happened without the model knowing as she was in the villa without access to the outside world. A week latershe quit the showafter her mother fell ill. The show attracted further controversy after it broadcast islanders Emma-Jane Woodham and Terry Walsh having sex 10 minutes after the watershed. Seven people complained to Ofcom, but the watchdogcleared ITV2, saying the broadcaster had given viewers enough warning. Like most reality TV shows these days, contestants hope their appearance will be a launch pad for other things. For some, it's led to... more reality TV. Series one's Jon Clark and series 2 winners Cara De La Hoyde and Nathan Massey (pictured above) have appeared in The Only Way Is Essex, and fellow series contestant Rykard Jenkins moved on to Ibiza Weekender. First series hopeful Josh Ritchie went on to star in Ex On the Beach. But there have been other more lucrative successes - last year's runner-up Olivia Buckland launched her own clothing range earlier this year. She also secured a number of endorsement deals with her Love Island partner, Alex Bowen, including Christmas pudding flavoured condoms. Yes they do apparently, although most haven't. Despite promising to stay together forever on the show, Cara and Nathan managed to last a year before splitting up in April. Last month Cara announced she was pregnant with Nathan's baby, but they would not be reuniting. Alex Bowen popped the question to Olivia Buckland in New York on New Year's Eve More happily, Olivia and Alex announced their engagement after a New Year's Eve proposal and are set to get married next summer. Fellow series two couple Scott (brother of Emmerdale star Adam) Thomas and Kady McDermott are still going strong, living together in Manchester. And there has also been the first Love Island baby this year - after 2016 contestants Cally Jane Beech and Luis Morrison welcomed baby Vienna in May.

"This video can not be played Ruth Davidson wants a Brexit deal with economic development at its heart Ruth Davidson has said she will argue Scotland's case ""forcefully"" to the prime minister after major Tory gains north of the border. The Scottish Conservative leader said she wanted to build consensus around a Brexit deal that put economic advancement at its heart. She also dismissed reports that Scots Tories might ""break away"" from the main UK party. The Scottish Conservatives won an extra 12 seats in Thursday's election. Theresa May's top aides resign Davidson given DUP gay rights assurance Sturgeon will reflect on SNP losses The performance of Scottish Tories was in marked contrast to that in England and Wales where Prime Minister Theresa May lost her majority in the House of Commons. Ms Davidson spoke to reporters in Stirling as she showed off the 13 Scottish Conservatives who will now take their seats at Westminster. Ruth Davidson showed off the new group of Scottish Tory MPs at an event in Stirling She said: ""I'm going to make sure that along with the 13 MPs we're sending to Westminster, we put Scotland's case forcefully and make sure that we deliver for Scotland and make sure that the union delivers for Scotland too."" She added: ""I want to ensure that we can look again at issues like Brexit which we know we are now going to have to get cross-party support for - and move to a consensus within the country about what it means and what we seek to achieve as we leave."" Asked what she meant with her call for an ""open Brexit"" she said: ""I've never believed in the terms of hard or soft Brexit. ""I want to talk about open or closed - and as someone who believes in open politics, that's about making sure we tear down barriers rather than put them up. ""It's about making sure we put free trade and economic advancement at the heart of the Brexit deal as we leave."" She also said she had received assurances from Theresa May that any deal with the Democratic Unionist Party would not erode LGBTI rights in Northern Ireland, and that the UK government would use its influence to ""advance"" those rights. Ms Davidson issued a robust denial on Twitter to reports of plans for a breakaway party Earlier she had taken to Twitter to dismiss a report in the Daily Telegraph that she wanted to""tear her Scottish party away from English control"",external. The paper, which stands by its report, said there were tensions during the campaign, and that Ms Davidson's aides were working on a deal to set up a separate organisation in Scotland. Pressed on the issue in Stirling, she said: it had been decided when she became leader that ""we would have complete autonomy over policy, candidates, campaigning, finance, which is what we have... but we would take the Conservative whip at Westminster and that is exactly what is going to happen"". Ms Davidson also  confirmed she had given her ""full support"" to Mrs May staying on as prime minister. Derek Mackay insisted the SNP had won the election in Scotland Earlier the SNP's cabinet secretary for finance and the constitution, Derek Mackay, insisted his party had won the election in Scotland, despite seeing its number of MPs fall from 56 to 35. He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""The 2015 result was incredible, very difficult to repeat - but we won more seats than all the other parties put together."" He said it was too early to say whether the SNP would now ""park"" its demand for a second independence referendum after 60% of Scottish voters backed pro-union parties. ""Of course we will listen and reflect. It's too premature to say what we would do next around that,"" he said. ""We will continue to deliver good governance for Scotland, stand up for Scotland in the Westminster parliament, make sure we can get the best possible deal for Scotland in terms of the negotiations on Brexit."" Scottish Labour demanded Nicola Sturgeon ditch plans for a second independence referendum. James Kelly, who was the party's election campaign manager, said: ""Nicola Sturgeon has some very serious questions to answer now. ""She must categorically drop her plans for a divisive second independence referendum and get back to the day job. ""Across the UK, the election showed there is huge support for Labour's vision for investment in our public services, and Nicola Sturgeon needs to accept that she has been too distracted by the constitution for too long.""

"Police searched the stadium prior to Michael Carrick's testimonial game last Sunday Four men breached security at Manchester United's stadium by getting on the roof and pitch before a match. The ""urban climbers"" were chased by the ground's security staff after they broke into Old Trafford in the early hours of Sunday 4 June, the club said. It happened hours before Michael Carrick's testimonial game and less than two weeks after a terror attack killed 22 people at Manchester Arena. The club condemned their actions as ""stupid and irresponsible"". The group managed to avoid capture and police said no arrests were made. Sir Alex Ferguson and Michael Carrick laid wreaths in memory of the Manchester attack victims at Sunday's game A Manchester United spokesman said: ""Their stupid and irresponsible actions, especially at such a sensitive time, put last Sunday's game at risk and occupied both club staff and, more importantly, police officers in hours of work to make sure that the stadium was safe to stage the match. ""Such efforts appear to be motivated by a trend for similar actions on social media."" He said the group targeted the stadium shortly after getting on to the roof of a hotel in Manchester city centre. The Man United incident happened just hours before the One Love Manchester concert at the nearby Old Trafford cricket ground on Sunday evening, and after the London Bridge and Borough Market terror attack on Saturday - with security forces on high alert across the country. ""With over 130,000 people coming into the Old Trafford area on Sunday, the last thing [police] needed was to have their time wasted in this way,"" the Man United spokesman said. Officers later searched the stadium to confirm it was safe to hold the match, he added. Last year, United's home match with Bournemouth had to be cancelled after adummy bomb used in a security exercisewas discovered close to kick-off.

"Four men - believed to be in their 20s - were in the car when it crashed in west London A man has died after the car he was travelling in crashed into the basement of a home in west London, ignoring police attempts to flag it down. It had been speeding and crashed at about 03:10 BST on West Cromwell Road, Kensington. The Met Police has referred the case to the police watchdog. Two men freed themselves from the vehicle while another two were released with the help of firefighters. One of the men died at the scene and another is in a critical condition. The other two men have been arrested and the Met Police's Directorate of Professional Standards has been informed as a matter of course. All four of the men were believed to be in their 20s and the deceased man's next of kin have been told. Police said officers lost sight of the car as it sped away along the A4 Tolgarth Road. They then saw it had crashed into the property. A woman who lived in the house which was hit by the car said: ""You could hear them screaming. ""They cut them out but one didn't make it."" Another witness said: ""There was a massive bang. He hit the traffic light and span round and round. He ended up in the basement. ""There is a massive cracking in the wall of the basement.

"Saturday's papers will do little to lighten the mood in Downing Street. The Guardian pictures a sombre-looking Theresa May entering No 10 under the headline: ""From hubris to humiliation."" ""May stares into the abyss"" says the Times, while the Financial Times talks of her clinging on to power as pro-EU Tories prepare to pounce. She is also ""clinging on"" in the Daily Express in order to ""save Brexit"", while the Daily Star tells readers: ""Teflon Tezza toughs it out"". The Daily Telegraph has her ""fighting to remain PM"" amid concerns among senior Conservatives that she lacks the authority to negotiate a successful exit from Europe. ""Tories turn on Theresa"", says the Daily Mail. The newspaper talks of ""reshuffle mayhem"" with the party ""plunged into civil war"". Tory MPs want her out in months, it says, and they insist she dumps her advisers now. The Sun calls Mrs May a ""lame duck PM"". The newspaper says Tory chiefs have given her a stay of execution amid fears a bitter leadership contest could make Jeremy Corbyn prime minister. But she is ""mortally wounded"", it says, with her ""authority in pieces"" and she will have to go after Christmas - within 12 months at the most. The Daily Mirror says ""the knives are out"" for the PM. And it dismisses her link-up with what it calls the ""hard right, anti-gay DUP"" as a ""coalition of crackpots"". The Sun has a picture of Theresa May with the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, under the headline: ""The odd coupling"". The editor of the i, Oliver Duff, writes: ""In a reversal of fortunes, Arlene Foster can entertain herself with the idea of imposing direct rule on Westminster from Stormont."" But Mrs May is not the only party leader whose future is in doubt, according to the Daily Telegraph. It reports that Liberal Democrat ""big beasts"" who reclaimed their former seats are being urged to mount a challenge against Tim Farron. Tim Farron may face a bigger challenge than Mr Fish Finger Former ministers Sir Vince Cable and Jo Swinson are apparently being touted as potential candidates amid what are said to be fears that the current Lib Dem leader ""lacks vision and drive"". One leader smiling in all the papers is Jeremy Corbyn. According to the Daily Mirror, the veteran socialist was ""vindicated by a brilliant campaign"", which means Labour's shift to the left under his leadership may now be permanent. Columnist Kevin Maguire calls him ""the accidental hero"" who could yet find himself in No 10, while in the Daily Mail, Peter Oborne says Mr Corbyn's new brand of politics has put Labour modernisers out of business for good. And the Sun highlights the difference between Mr Corbyn and Mrs May, with a picture of the prime minister looking glum outside No 10, captioned ""the winner"", and a beaming Labour leader giving a double thumbs up, captioned ""the loser"". It is smiles all round for Jeremy Corbyn and his team Another happy face is that of the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson. With talk of a leadership contest already under way, says the Times, many Tories would love her to be in the mix. The Daily Express hails her as ""the woman who delivered results"". And the Daily Telegraph says there is a growing clamour among senior Tories for Ms Davidson to be given a top position in the UK party. But, it says, she intends to defy Mrs May by breaking the Scottish Conservatives off into a separate organisation.

What is the difference between a free trade area, a single market and a customs union? Theresa May has done a deal with the DUP which means she stays as UK prime minister. Here's a guide to what's going on. Empty properties owned by the rich should be used for the homeless of Grenfell Tower, Labour's leader says. The prime minister has released a statement after meeting Northern Ireland's main parties saying agreement can be reached to restore a power-sharing executive at Stormont ""if there is good will on all sides"". ""But time is running short and the parties must come together by the 29 June for the return of a strong voice at Stormont and for a brighter future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" She said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire would keep talking to the parties ""and if no resolution is reached then we will need to consider what steps we need to take, to ensure Northern Ireland has the political stability it needs"".

there's no deadline for the discussions. Mr Dodds reiterated that the DUP

The announcement by Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier follows preliminary talks in Brussels between officials. The formal negotiations were already due to start on Monday but doubt was cast by the general election result and ongoing talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists.

The former party deputy leader is an MP in the London borough of Southwark, where the 2009 Lakanal House fire killed six people. She said tower blocks needed to be fitted with sprinklers and questions needed to be asked about whether refurbishing blocks could compromise fire safety - and whether the official ""stay put"" advice for people in burning buildings should be changed. Of the public inquiry, she said: There doesn't have to be a delay. It's wrong if there is a delay because people are living in thousands of tower blocks all around the country and they need to know the lessons are going to be learned quickly.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May's former director of communications, Katie Perrior, explains how the inner circle operates Prime Minister Theresa May's two closest advisers have quit after the Conservatives failed to win a majority of MPs in the general election. The BBC understands the PM was warned she faced a leadership challenge unless she sacked Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill. Labour said the pair had ""taken the fall"" for the prime minister. Mrs May has announced that the new Downing Street chief of staff is ex-Conservative MP and former housing minister Gavin Barwell. Mr Timothy said he took responsibility for his role in the ""disappointing"" result and the widely-criticised manifesto package on social care. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the pair's departure bought the PM some ""breathing space"" following 24 hours of recriminations after the Conservatives lost their overall majority. He said the two were so close to the PM that critical MPs believed that, unless they made way, she would not be able to change her leadership style to adopt a more ""outgoing, inclusive, responsive, empathetic approach"". Mrs May has said she intends to stay as prime minister and on Saturday evening it was announced her party's chief whip had agreed an outline deal ""in principle"" with the DUP of Northern Ireland, which would see the unionist party support the Tories on key votes. Live updates and rolling coverage DUP agree 'confidence' deal with Tories No 10 was 'toxic' says former May aide Who are the DUP? Can a Conservative and DUP pact work? Q&A: What is a hung parliament? Mr Timothy and Ms Hill both stepped down amid mounting pressure on Mrs May to overhaul the way No 10 worked and broaden her circle of advisers. Announcing his resignationon the Conservative Home website,external, Mr Timothy urged Tory MPs to ""get behind"" Mrs May but said nothing should be allowed to get in the way of the process of forming a government and beginning Brexit talks. He said the Conservatives' failure to win was not due to a lack of support for Theresa May and the Conservatives but due to an ""unexpected surge"" of support for Labour. Who were the PM's special advisers? Fiona Hill:Fiercely loyal and seen as a formidable operator, Fiona Hill was at Mrs May's side for four years at the Home Office, becoming a close confidante of the then home secretary. A former Sky News and Scotsman journalist in her 40s, she led work on the Modern Slavery Act and published her own report on the subject. She was forced to resign as Mrs May's special adviser in a2014 dispute with Michael Goveover who was to blame for briefing newspapers about an increase in extremism in schools. But she was brought back into the fold when Mrs May became PM. Nick Timothy:The bearded Brummie is the son of a steelworker, who went to grammar school and joined the Conservative Party at the age of 17.

""We were not talking to the people who decided to vote for Labour,"" he said. He defended the party's ""honest and strong"" manifesto, saying controversial proposals to use the value of peoples' homes to fund domiciliary care costs had been discussed in government for months and were not his own personal ""pet project"".

Davidson: 'No plans for breakaway party' Welsh MPs wait on Tory reshuffle news Gavin Barwell once wrote a book about his narrow victory in the 2015 general election Mr Barwell lost his Croydon Central seat on Thursday - which he won in 2015 with a majority of just 165 votes - to Labour's Sarah Jones, polling 24,221 votes to Ms Jones's 29,873. He has written a book entitled How to Win a Marginal Seat: My Year Fighting For My Political Life. He was appointed Minister for Housing and Minister for London in July 2016. Earlier, Mrs May's director of communications until the election was announced, Katie Perrior, called the campaign ""pretty dysfunctional"", telling the BBC she ""needed to have a few grey hairs in there who been around a bit and could say 'don't do that'"". As the Conservative leadership begins formal negotiations with the DUP, disquiet is being expressed in some quarters about the move. Charles Tannock, a Conservative member of the European Parliament, said the DUP - which is opposed to same-sex marriage - was a ""hardline, populist, protectionist"" party and a ""poor fit"" as a partner. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, has said there are ""huge disagreements"" between the two parties on gay and women's rights but she does not believe this will stand in the way of Theresa May being able to govern. Ruth Davidson has said she will put LGBTI rights above her party Ms Davidson, who is gay and plans to marry her partner in the near future, said she had received ""categoric assurance"" from Mrs May about the sanctity of LGBTI rights in Scotland where - unlike Northern Ireland - equal marriage is legal in the event of any deal with the DUP. What does result mean for Brexit? Merkel: 'EU ready to start Brexit talks' Election winners and losers ""What is important is that we try and help, where possible, to advance these rights in Northern Ireland while making sure there is absolutely no idea of any kind of roll back here. Those are the sort of assurances I sought and received"". Speaking on Friday, the prime minister said her party had a ""strong relationship"" with the DUP and that she intended to form a government which could ""provide certainty and lead Britain forward at this critical time for our country"". This video can not be played ""The union is our guiding star"" - DUP's Arlene Foster Analysis by political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue The clock is ticking for Theresa May. She needs to conclude a deal with the DUP in the next week or so ahead of the Queen's Speech, which will set out the new government's agenda. That takes place on Monday 19 June - the same day Brexit negotiations are due to start. The DUP and its 10 MPs are in a very strong position. It's all their Christmases rolled into one and they will make sure they leverage as much as they can from their advantage. Money for Northern Ireland will undoubtedly be part of their demands, and Mrs May will expect that. But trickier will be any demands they have about the implementation of Brexit in Northern Ireland - in particular the DUP's determination to maintain a soft border with the south. Another potential problem is the planned restart of negotiations for power-sharing in the province. Typically the British government tries to act as an honest broker between Republicans and Unionists. But if Mrs May is doing a deal with the DUP, that could make it harder to reach an agreement with Sinn Fein. Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? DUP leader Arlene Foster confirmed she had spoken to Mrs May and that they would speak further to ""explore how it may be possible to bring stability to this nation at this time of great challenge"". Mrs May is expected to continue assembling her top team later after she decided to keep key figures - including Chancellor Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary Boris and Home Secretary Amber Rudd - in their current roles. David Davis will also stay on as Brexit secretary and Sir Michael Fallon will keep his role as defence secretary. There could be limited changes elsewhere in the cabinet while nine middle-ranking and junior ministers, including Ben Gummer and Jane Ellison, lost their seats at the general election and will need to be replaced. Jeremy Corbyn has said Mrs May should ""make way"" for a government that would be ""truly representative of the people of this country"". The Labour leader, who is expected to announce his shadow cabinet on Sunday, said his party was ready to form a minority government of its own, but stressed he would not enter into any ""pacts or deals"" with other parties.

The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, has said there are ""huge disagreements"" between the two parties on gay and women's rights but she does not believe this will stand in the way of Theresa May being able to govern. Ruth Davidson has said she will put LGBTI rights above her party Ms Davidson, who is gay and plans to marry her partner in the near future, said she had received ""categoric assurance"" from Mrs May about the sanctity of LGBTI rights in Scotland where - unlike Northern Ireland - equal marriage is legal in the event of any deal with the DUP. What does result mean for Brexit? Merkel: 'EU ready to start Brexit talks' Election winners and losers ""What is important is that we try and help, where possible, to advance these rights in Northern Ireland while making sure there is absolutely no idea of any kind of roll back here. Those are the sort of assurances I sought and received"". Speaking on Friday, the prime minister said her party had a ""strong relationship"" with the DUP and that she intended to form a government which could ""provide certainty and lead Britain forward at this critical time for our country"". This video can not be played ""The union is our guiding star"" - DUP's Arlene Foster Analysis by political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue The clock is ticking for Theresa May. She needs to conclude a deal with the DUP in the next week or so ahead of the Queen's Speech, which will set out the new government's agenda. That takes place on Monday 19 June - the same day Brexit negotiations are due to start. The DUP and its 10 MPs are in a very strong position. It's all their Christmases rolled into one and they will make sure they leverage as much as they can from their advantage. Money for Northern Ireland will undoubtedly be part of their demands, and Mrs May will expect that. But trickier will be any demands they have about the implementation of Brexit in Northern Ireland - in particular the DUP's determination to maintain a soft border with the south. Another potential problem is the planned restart of negotiations for power-sharing in the province. Typically the British government tries to act as an honest broker between Republicans and Unionists. But if Mrs May is doing a deal with the DUP, that could make it harder to reach an agreement with Sinn Fein. Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? DUP leader Arlene Foster confirmed she had spoken to Mrs May and that they would speak further to ""explore how it may be possible to bring stability to this nation at this time of great challenge"". Mrs May is expected to continue assembling her top team later after she decided to keep key figures - including Chancellor Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary Boris and Home Secretary Amber Rudd - in their current roles. David Davis will also stay on as Brexit secretary and Sir Michael Fallon will keep his role as defence secretary. There could be limited changes elsewhere in the cabinet while nine middle-ranking and junior ministers, including Ben Gummer and Jane Ellison, lost their seats at the general election and will need to be replaced. Jeremy Corbyn has said Mrs May should ""make way"" for a government that would be ""truly representative of the people of this country"". The Labour leader, who is expected to announce his shadow cabinet on Sunday, said his party was ready to form a minority government of its own, but stressed he would not enter into any ""pacts or deals"" with other parties.

"The results of the 2017 general election have put the Democratic Unionist Party in the role of kingmakers. The Conservatives fell short of a parliamentary majority of 326 seats, but can achieve it with the support of the DUP's 10 MPs. The DUP is now set to support Theresa May in forming a new government. So who are the DUP's 10 MPs? The son of long-time party leader, its founder and former Northern Ireland First Minister Ian Paisley, Mr Paisley succeeded his father as North Antrim MP in 2010. He is a member of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, which his father led. Following the resignation of the late Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness earlier this year, Mr Paisley paid tribute to the Sinn FÃ©in leader and former IRA member. He said Mr McGuinness' ""remarkable journey not only saved lives, but made the lives of countless people better"". Mr Paisley has said he has no ambition to follow in his father's footsteps to lead the party. This video can not be played The DUP: Partners in government Earlier this year, Mr Paisley said that US President Donald Trump had accepted his invitation to visit Northern Ireland for the Open golf championship at Portrush in July 2019. Last year, Mr Paisley told the BBC:  ""I first met Donald Trump, along with my father, in 2006 and I've kept that relationship going. I've met him every year, bar one, since then."" In a 2007 interview, Mr Paisley expressed his views on same sex marriages. He toldHot Press magazine,externalhe was ""pretty repulsed"" by gay people and lesbianism. Mr Paisley later went on to defend his comments on BBC Newsnight saying he was ""repulsed by many things"". A former lord mayor of Belfast, Sammy Wilson has been MP for East Antrim since 2005. Known for his often outspoken views, Mr Wilson's 2008 appointment as Northern Ireland environment minister was criticised by environmental groups and members of the NI Assembly's environment committee because of his views on climate change. He said he was sceptical that all climate change was caused by CO2 emissions and described some campaigners' views as an ""hysterical pseudo-religion"". Mr Wilson has also served as Northern Ireland finance minister. He was also an environment minister in the Northern Ireland Executive, andtold the Belfast Telegraph,externalthe world had been ""conned"" into spending billions on climate change. Mr Wilson said politicians feel under pressure from lobby groups and ""go along with the flow"". ""I don't care about CO2 emissions to be quite truthful because I don't think it's all that important,"" he was quoted as saying. Paul Girvan won the South Antrim seat at his first attempt in this general election, defeating outgoing Ulster Unionist Danny Kinahan by more than 3,000 votes. He was first elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2003, but was deselected by the DUP in South Antrim in 2007. He returned to the assembly in 2010 when he was selected to replace Rev William McCrea following his resignation. Mr Girvan is a former mayor of Newtownabbey. Nigel Dodds is the deputy leader of the DUP and its leader at Westminster. He has been North Belfast MP since 2001,  taking the seat from Ulster Unionist Cecil Walker. In 2015, Mr Dodds who studied law at Cambridge University, ruled himself out of the race to succeed former party leader Peter Robinson. In 1996, a police officer guarding Mr Dodds while he visited his critically ill son in hospital, was shot and injured by the IRA. A former Belfast lord mayor, Mr Dodds' wife Diane is one of Northern Ireland's three MEPs. Like the majority of the DUP's parliamentary party, Mr Dodds is a member of the Orange Order. The order is a Protestant cultural and religious  organisation which has attracted controversy because of parades it has held through or near some Catholic areas. Who are the Orangemen? In 2013,Mr Dodds was expelled from the Commons chamberafter accusing the Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, of ""deliberate deception"". He claimed she had been deceptive when answering questions about her powers in respect of a controversial Orange parade ruling. Gavin Robinson won back the East Belfast seat for the DUP in 2015, which former party leader Peter Robinson (no relation) had lost to the Alliance Party's Naomi Long. He was re-elected this time around, defeating Mrs Long by more that 8,000 votes. Educated at Queen's University, Belfast, Mr Robinson read Law and attained a Masters in Irish Politics before starting work as a barrister. He is another DUP MP who has served as lord mayor of Belfast. Emma Little-Pengelly bounced back from losing her Northern Ireland Assembly seat in South Belfast in March, by winning the constituency's Westminster seat in June, defeating the SDLP's Alasdair McDonnell. It marks a rapid rise for Mrs Little-Pengelly, who first stood for election for the DUP in the 2015 assembly election. She is married to Richard Pengelly, who is a top civil servant in the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. During the campaign, she received the endorsement of the three biggest loyalist paramilitary organisations. The DUP said it did not accept their support. In her acceptance speech, Mrs Little-Pengelly thanked those who came out to vote for her, singling out several loyalist working class areas such as Taughmonagh and Donegall Pass. Her father Noel Little was one of three men arrested in Paris in April 1989, along with a South African diplomat and an arms dealer. Little was given a suspended sentence and fined for his part in a loyalist intelligence plot. Mrs Little-Pengelly has said,externalshe has ""unconditional"" love for her father and that ""just because someone may have a past should not mean you cannot have a future"". From Kilkeel in County Down, Sir Jeffrey began his political career with the Ulster Unionist Party and was part of the UUP's negotiating team for the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. He announced his resignation from the party, along with current leader Arlene Foster, in December 2003 in protest against Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble's policies; both joined the DUP the following month. Sir Jeffrey was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in 2016. A former member of the Ulster Defence Regiment, two of Sir Jeffrey's cousins - police officers Alex and Sam Donaldson - were murdered by the IRA during the Troubles. Jim Shannon increased his majority in Strangford by 9,000, securing 62% of the vote. He was first elected to the constituency in 2010. Mr Shannon served in the Ulster Defence Regiment in the 1970s and earlier this year hebroke down in tears in the House of Commonsas he discussed the IRA murder of his cousin Kenneth Smith. In 2011, he laughed off a website rating naming him as the least sexy MP in the UK. In 2016 he was ordered to repay almost Â£14,000 in mileage expenses claims.,external The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority found Mr Shannon was the highest claimant for staff constituency mileage during 2015, but it put the incorrect claims down to ""a number of errors"" and said there was no fraud. David Simpson was first elected as MP for Upper Bann in 2005, taking the seat from Ulster Unionist leader and former Northern Ireland first minister David Trimble. He had lost out to Mr Trimble in 2001. In 2007, Mr Simpson used parliamentary privilege to accuse Sinn Fein's Francie Molloy - the current MP for Mid Ulster - of involvement in his cousin Frederick Lutton's murder and of being a police informer. Mr Molloy denied both allegations and challenged Mr Simpson to make them outside Parliament. Mr Simpson also spoke in the Commons against same-sex marriage, stating: ""In the garden of Eden it was Adam and Eve, it wasn't Adam and Steve."" He has lobbied to have creationism included,externalin the science curriculum in Northern Ireland. Born in Londonderry, Gregory Campbell joined the DUP in the 1970s and was first elected to Derry City Council in 1981. In 1985, theBBC Real Lives documentary At the Edge of the Union,externalfocused on Mr Campbell and Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness. The documentary showed Mr Campbell loading his legally held gun, interspersed with pictures of him addressing a rally. It was temporarily blocked by direct government intervention from then-Home Secretary Leon Brittan. This led to a one-day strike by the National Union of Journalists to defend the independence of the BBC. Mr Campbell initially contested the Foyle constituency held by SDLP leader John Hume, but in 1997 was transferred to the more unionist East Londonderry. He was elected there in his second attempt in 2001, defeating sitting MP William Ross of the Ulster Unionist Party. In 2014, Mr Campbell was barred from addressing the Northern Ireland Assembly for a day for failing to apologise for parodying the Irish language during an address to the assembly. Mr Campbell has previously supported the reintroduction of the death penalty, during a 2009 Commons debate on a world-wide ban on capital punishment. When the Commons voted on the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill in 2013, DUP MPs Gregory Campbell, David Simpson, Jim Shannon, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Ian Paisley Jnr, Sammy Wilson and Nigel Dodds all voted against it. The bill was eventually passed 400 votes to 175. Kuenssberg: Can May survive? May: Country needs stability.

"The Hawaiian pizza, surprisingly, has roots in Ontario Sam Panopoulos, who has died aged 83, leaves a legacy that has delighted, confused and appalled diners worldwide. Often at the same time. Panopoulos is the Canadian man who invented Hawaiian pizza, a dish so divisive it led to a presidential outburst this year. He passed away in hospital suddenly on Thursday. Panopoulos emigrated to Canada from Greece in 1954 when he was 20, eventually going on to own and operate several successful restaurants with his two brothers. It was in one of those restaurants in 1962 that Panopoulos was inspired to add canned pineapple to pizza. It was invented by Sam Panopoulos, who moved to Canada from Greece aged 20 In February, Panopoulos recounted to the BBC how he and his brothers came up with the idea for the pizza, topped with pineapple and ham. How the Hawaiian was created - in Canada They were then owners of the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, a southwestern Ontario town about 290km (180 miles) from Toronto and 80km from Detroit. ""We just put it on, just for the fun of it, see how it was going to taste,"" Panopoulos told the BBC. ""We were young in the business and we were doing a lot of experiments."" Customers ended up loving the savoury sweetness of the dish. The creation also capitalised on the mid-century tiki trend, which popularised Polynesian culture in North America. Its tropical name - ""Hawaiian""- came from the can of pineapples used in the first creation Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is a fan of the dish and came out on #teampineapple on Twitter earlier this year Chef Gordon Ramsey isnot,externalon #teampineapple Some Germans have laid claim to the invention, saying it is based on their pineapple-cheese-ham sandwich, the Toast Hawaii, popular in the 1950s Media often sought out Panopoulos after learning that the origins of the controversial tropical-flavoured pizza topping had actually hailed from Canada. He was back in the spotlight earlier this year after Iceland's president, Guoni Johannesson, created an online uproar by announcing to a group of schoolchildren that he was ""fundamentally opposed"" to pineapple on pizza and suggested it should be banned. Panopoulos said at the time he did not understand the president's opposition to the pineapple topping, which he thought gave the dish a ""refreshing"" bite. Panopoulos' obituary describes him as ""unforgettable personality"" whose ""candid and frank sense of humour, his booming laugh and blunt honesty will be missed by his family, friends, former employees and customers"".

What is the difference between a free trade area, a single market and a customs union? Theresa May has done a deal with the DUP which means she stays as UK prime minister. Here's a guide to what's going on. Empty properties owned by the rich should be used for the homeless of Grenfell Tower, Labour's leader says. The prime minister has released a statement after meeting Northern Ireland's main parties saying agreement can be reached to restore a power-sharing executive at Stormont ""if there is good will on all sides"". ""But time is running short and the parties must come together by the 29 June for the return of a strong voice at Stormont and for a brighter future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" She said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire would keep talking to the parties ""and if no resolution is reached then we will need to consider what steps we need to take, to ensure Northern Ireland has the political stability it needs"".

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the Grenfell Tower disaster was an emergency of such gravity that it had already become a significant issue for the government, at a very volatile time. The priority was to focus on getting help to where it was needed - with the announcement that a scheme to provide extra cash for the council - before getting on with a full public inquiry, which would get going ""pretty soon"". But the handling of such an awful situation was very risky for politicians and uncomfortable truths could emerge from the public inquiry. ""Potentially, some people expect, it may well show that not just this government but previous governments have simply not done enough to make sure this kind of housing is safe,"" she said.     The Grenfell Tower block disaster has again been dominating the news agenda.

He said all parties in Northern Ireland ""need to be consulted on all of this"". ""A little side bargain to keep Theresa May in power - a temporary little arrangement - won't have any integrity and certainly isn't as important as the needs of the people who live in Ireland and particularly in the north of Ireland,"" he said.

Dodds says the setting of a date for the Queen's Speech is separate and not
relevant to his party's discussions over a deal with the Conservatives. Questioned about whether a deal
would be announced before the Queen's speech next Wednesday, Mr Dodds said
there's no deadline for the discussions. Mr Dodds reiterated that the DUP
wants to strengthen the UK, deliver Brexit in a proper and sensible manner for
Northern Ireland and spread prosperity around the UK. Asked if the Treasury was ""nitpicking"" over the
financial details, Mr Dodds said he'd seen the reports in the newspapers but
wouldn't comment on speculation. More on the Brexit talks. Formal negotiationswill begin on Monday, the UK and EU say. The announcement by Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier follows preliminary talks in Brussels between officials. The formal negotiations were already due to start on Monday but doubt was cast by the general election result and ongoing talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists. The UK is due to leave by the end of March 2019. Labour MP Harriet Harman has been speaking to the BBC after the Westminster Hall session earlier. The former party deputy leader is an MP in the London borough of Southwark, where the 2009 Lakanal House fire killed six people. She said tower blocks needed to be fitted with sprinklers and questions needed to be asked about whether refurbishing blocks could compromise fire safety - and whether the official ""stay put"" advice for people in burning buildings should be changed. Of the public inquiry, she said: There doesn't have to be a delay. It's wrong if there is a delay because people are living in thousands of tower blocks all around the country and they need to know the lessons are going to be learned quickly.""

"German chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU was ready to negotiate Angela Merkel has said she sees no obstacles in the way of beginning Brexit talks as scheduled after Theresa May failed to win a majority in Thursday's UK election. The German chancellor said she believed Britain would stick to the timetable, adding the European Union was ""ready"". Mrs Merkel added she hoped Britain would remain a good partner following the talks, due to begin on 19 June. It is her first comment since Mrs May's Conservative party lost 13 seats. The loss left the Conservatives eight MPs short of a majority in parliament, plunging negotiations into uncertainty. Mrs May called the snap election in order to secure a clear mandate for her vision of Brexit. A spokesman for Mrs Merkel had previously refused to be drawn on the issue out of ""politeness and respect"" while the process of forming a new UK government was under way. Mrs May says she will form a government with the Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland, which won 10 seats. Can Theresa May stay as PM? Live updates as May completes team What the election result means for Brexit Brexit delays over UK hung parliament? British PM Theresa May called an election to strengthen her mandate Mrs Merkel, who is meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to discuss trade, told reporters gathered in Mexico City on Friday: ""I assume that Britain, from what I heard from the prime minister today, wants to stick to its negotiating plan. ""We want to negotiate quickly, we want to stick to the time plan, and so at this point I don't think there is anything to suggest these negotiations cannot start as was agreed."" Mrs Merkel, the EU's most powerful politician, went on to say she hoped the UK would remain a good partner. ""Britain is part of Europe, even if it will no longer be part of the European Union."" However, she added the EU countries would be ""asserting the interests of the 27 member states that will make up the European Union in future"" during negotiations. Mrs May failed to get the majority she had sought Meanwhile, Michael Fuchs, senior economic adviser to the German chancellor, told the BBC the result meant it was time for Mrs May ""to face realities"" and soften her approach. ""Her wish and will was not really too much accepted by the British people,"" he said. ""I have the feeling, because otherwise they would have given her a better vote. ""Maybe, this is a chance that we can come up to a more reasonable Brexit negotiations because in the last time (recently) I really had the feeling that everything was just being very tough and it doesn't make sense to be tough. ""We want to have a fair deal with Britain and we want to have a fair final Brexit negotiations."" European media see bleak future for May Other EU leaders have expressed concerns the failure to win a majority may make negotiations even more difficult. Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, who is president of the Alliance of Liberals & Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament, had caustic words for Mrs May.

"Jacee also got to spend time with her brother in more relaxed circumstances A 12-year-old girl in Mississippi had a rare bonding experience with her new baby brother - delivering him herself. Jacee Dellapena was upset during her mother's labour because, she said, she was too short to see her brother born. So the doctor suggested she suit up and take part - delivering her baby brother under the doctor's supervision, and even cutting the umbilical cord. She later told US media: ""I was nervous I was going to mess up... but it was the best moment of my life."" ""I started crying because I thought I wasn't going to get to see him be born, because I was too short,"" Jacee told WBTV. ""He let me actually push down and pull the baby out... I was like, wow, like I've played fake doctor before, but this is, like, the real thing, this is is the real deal,"" she said. The doctor handed Jacee a medical gown to ""scrub up"" before the procedure Cayson Carraway was born safely at 7lb 6oz (3.3kg). Mother Dede Carraway said the emotions on her daughter's face brought her to tears. ""It was just a good moment for me,"" she said. Would you let your children watch you give birth? Family friend Nikki Smith shared the photos of Jaycee's emotional experience on Facebook, where they wereshared more than 170,000 times,external. Some Facebook comments questioned the doctor's decision, or suggested Jacee may have been distressed, despite her own words about the experience. ""This beautiful moment will always be remembered by both her mother and herself,"" Nikki said in response. ""There is absolutely nothing wrong with allowing her daughter to witness this beautiful moment. It's not for everyone but jacee was a rockstar and helped deliver a newborn!"" The increasing popularity of having siblings attend the delivery room became a subject of debate last year, when TV chef Jamie Oliver revealed his two eldest daughters had watched his new son be born. At the time, one family psychologist told the BBC that if all goes well, ""it can be a fantastic experience"".
