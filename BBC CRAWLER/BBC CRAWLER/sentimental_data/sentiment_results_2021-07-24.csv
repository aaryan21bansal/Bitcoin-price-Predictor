"Parkrun welcomes runners, walkers and even dogs to events There were jubilant scenes as thousands of joggers and walkers took part in the first Parkrun events in England since Covid restrictions ended. The free 5km events resumed in more than 500 parks and green spaces - 16 months since they weresuspended due to Covid measures. Parkrun's Tom Williams said organisers had been ""incredibly moved"" by the public support for the events. Organisers hope Parkruns can restart in Scotland and Wales by mid-August. Events in Northern Ireland resumed at the end of last month. Under the latest easing of almost all Covid legal restrictions that happened on Monday, outdoor running events including the London Marathon and the Great North Run can also resume. The Parkrun events, usually held every Saturday, are billed as a chance for people - regardless of age, gender or ability - to regularly run, jog or walk together and enjoy their local park. Runner, 88, completes 400th Parkrun Parkrun events suspended across UK English councils urged to allow Parkrun events Thousands of people took part in runs across England earlier, with large numbers running the course in south-west London's Bushy Park - home to the first ever Parkrun in 2004. A runner takes part with a buggy in the Bushy Park event - the largest and oldest event in the UK Rochelle Bisson, 29, in Bexley, south-east London, said despite being nervous about coronavirus, it was a ""really nice feeling"" being able to run with other people again. She said: ""It was really fun. I was a little apprehensive because I'm still being a bit careful after all the Covid restrictions. ""I'm a keen runner but I'm quite slow and it was nice to hang back and avoid the crowd and that helped me feel a lot safer."" Ms Bisson, who runs to help her anxiety and mental health, added: ""It was a really nice feeling running with other people. I've done some running during lockdown but it's not the same. ""It's nice to run with other people who support you and can cheer you on."" Rochelle says she is still being careful but had fun and felt safe at Parkrun Bob Emmerson, 88, became the oldest person to complete 400 Parkrunswhen he crossed the finish line at the Northampton event. Mr Emmerson, who ran with his 67-year-old son, also called Bob, said fellow runners and supporters cheered for him as he finished the run. He told the BBC it had been a ""really pleasant morning that was not too hot or cold"" and that his next milestone would be to complete 500 Parkruns. ""If Covid hadn't have happened, I would have been on 470 by now,"" he said. ""The target is going to be 500 but I will be 90 by that time I think. ""I will just have to take it one week at a time, I can't give it up. If I don't turn up it will be a big event."" Bob Emmerson said fellow runners and supporters stood and clapped him as he crossed the finish line In south-east London, Paul Williams, 63, was cheered on by fellow runners as he became one of the last 293 finishers at the Southwark Parkrun. Mr Williams, who has learning disabilities and a bad leg, first began attending the event in 2015 and said he had ""missed"" it during the pandemic. On finishing his 78th event after an hour and 16 minutes walk, Mr Williams, who has volunteered at more than 30 Parkruns, said: ""I have been stuck indoors for about a year because I have got diabetes and I wasn't allowed to go out. ""There was no exercise. I have been meeting everyone again and seeing everybody. It gives me exercise, helps me lose weight. I like to keep myself fit and to talk to people."" Paul Williams, 63, who was the last of the 293 finishers at the Southwark Parkrun in south-east London Runners took part in the Victoria Park Parkrun in east Belfast after the events resumed in Northern Ireland last month Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick and England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam were also among those running at a Parkrun in Newark, Nottinghamshire. Mr Jenrick tweeted a photograph of the pair elbow bumping, with the caption ""Jenrick v JVT"", adding: ""Great to see Parkrun back, across the country and especially here in Newark.""

"BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson tries out go-karting on a track in a former Debenhams beauty hall I'm taking a spin on a go-kart track with a difference.  It's the old beauty hall of the Debenhams store in south-west London. The escalators are the only trace of the former department store which remain. All four floors are now being transformed into a high-tech entertainment venue. As we filmed, shoppers stopped to take photos when the shutters briefly opened giving a glimpse of the flashing lights and builders beavering away inside. ""We're creating a department store of fun,"" says Michael Harrison, the co-founder of Gravity which is due to open on 1 August. ""We have three bars, two restaurants, go-karting, a bowling alley, huge screens to watch sporting events and adventure golf. This is the future of the High Street. It's about experience,"" he says. Michael has no shortage of retail landlords now ringing him up offering him potential new locations. They're grappling with the need to rethink, or repurpose, empty shops. Latest figures suggest one in seven stores, on average, are lying vacant. And in some places the number is far higher. The UK's biggest property company, Landsec, owns the Southside shopping mall where Gravity is based. Its other centres include Bluewater in Kent and Trinity in Leeds. Gravity co-founder Michael Harrison says commercial landlords are keen for him to set up more entertainment venues Landsec boss Mark Allan thinks a quarter of what is currently retail space will need to be turned into something else. ""For me, it's really difficult to think of an example where you have 25% of something that it exists in the UK that is no longer required. And so you're not going to solve that sort of a problem by tinkering around the edges,"" he says. The pain won't be evenly spread either, says Mr Allan: ""Some places are going to be virtually empty and they are not going to survive as retail in any shape or form. ""Some are going to be absolutely fine - rents are lower, sales are lower and they're worth less than they were but fundamentally they've got a role to play longer term and some places are going to be in the middle where they are going to survive but they need some investment."" Some industry experts think the amount of redundant retail space is even higher. So how did we get here? We've seen a huge proliferation of shops over the last 40 years. Retail has just been growing and growing, from out of town retail parks and shopping centres to so called clone towns dominated by chains, who were willing to pay higher rents. That retail property boom is now over. Many of our town centres will have to find a new purpose. Landsec chief executive Mark Allan says people need to come together to reshape their town centres in new ways We've been talking about how to save the High Street for more than a decade but the pandemic has turbo charged the problems now. Mr Allan says it's time to act. ""Covid has been a tipping point. If we don't tackle it over the next couple of years together then there's a real risk some of this redundant retail property sits there for decades empty and that would be a disaster for the communities where that property is located."" And he says there's no single party that can solve the problem: ""This needs people to come together. I think it's a significant moment and a really big opportunity, particularly for those centres and high streets where there is no future for retail, for radical, bold, thinking. I think it could be exciting."" Stockton-on Tees has one of the boldest plans to reshape its entire town centre. It has decided to demolish a large part of its high street. The local council bought Stockton's two shopping centres and plans to knock one of them down, creating a new riverside park to make the town a greener, nicer place. The Â£37m project is largely being funded with money from the Tees Valley Combined Authority and the Government's Future High Streets Fund. The Castlegate mall was built in the 1970s, an era when local authorities were falling over themselves to attract big retail development. This video can not be played Former staff reminisce about life at their town's Debenhams branch ""Retail is still very important, but we now need to consolidate it to meet the demand,"" says councillor Nigel Cooke, cabinet member for regeneration. Businesses who want to stay will eventually move into the other shopping centre further up the street. The scheme is part of a wider masterplan to market Stockton as an events town. The main high street, the widest in the UK, has been spruced up with new paving, lighting and a big water fountain. The council is also paying for the renovation of the town's Grade II-listed art deco Globe Theatre. ""I think it is money well spent and I am convinced it's the right thing to do. We need to get people back onto the high street either to live, to work or to enjoy themselves,"" insists Mr Cooke. ""It would be easy to hide under my desk and say guys, we can't do anything, let's just wait for the good times to come back. But we have to do something.. nothing is risk free, it's about managing the risk."" But Stockton has now got a large, empty Debenhams to contend with, too. Town centre regeneration is often complicated stuff, with a myriad of owners, stakeholders and issues to solve. It's taken Stockton 13 years to get this far and it's only a third of the way through. But given the magnitude of the challenges now, doing nothing is no longer an option.

"People have been warned to take extra care swimming in open water after dozens drowned during recent hot weather. The Royal Life Saving Society (RLSS) described this week's deaths as ""devastating"" and urged people to choose supervised spots to cool off. A 19-year-old man in Lancashire became the latest to die aftergetting into difficulty near St Anne's Pier. Earlier, a boy aged 16 diedafter going swimming at Loch Lomondin Scotland. The family of a 21-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent who died after being pulled from the sea at Crosby beach, Merseyside, on Tuesdaydescribed him as ""amazing"" and ""always smiling"". Lee Heard, charity director of the RLSS, told the BBC he was aware of 28 people who had died in water, both inland and at the coast, across the UK since 14 July, as temperatures soared in many places. He said water deaths often peaked between May and August. ""After the last week, I think the message is that anybody who does not have substantial experience of swimming in cold open water to not go in,"" he said. ""If people do wish to cool off in water, we advise they do so in supervised settings. Local authorities are putting on lifeguards around inland lakes, and there are aqua parks."" This video can not be played Float to live: ""Rest and relax in the water"" Mr Heard added that while wild swimming had become more popular in recent years, those partaking in the sport were often more experienced and took more precautions than casual swimmers. HM Coastguard said on Friday there had been nine deaths at the coast in the previous 10 days. Coastguard officer Fran Wilkins warned there were ""a lot of dangers and risks"" on beaches and at the coastline and swimmers could ""very quickly get into a situation where you may need help"". People can experience problems in open water when they underestimate how cold the water is, find themselves submerged unexpectedly, or get caught in a strong current at sea. This video can not be played 'I can't say how much I miss him' The RLSS has launched its""summer water safety"" campaign,externalwarning about cold water shock, which can affect people's ability to breathe normally, even in warm summer weather. It advises people to keep their mouths away from the water until their breathing returns to normal by rolling on their back. Then it says those in water should immediately swim towards an exit before their muscles cool - or find something to help them float - and call for help. Sunday 25 July is World Drowning Prevention Day - the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) describes drowning as a worldwide epidemic that claims an estimated 235,000 lives every year. The Coastguard and RNLI have jointly called for families to take care at the coast during the school holidays, after revealing RNLI lifeguards saved the lives of 54 children and teenagers last summer. Of those, 64% (35) were aged 12 or under, while RNLI lifeguards also came to the aid of another 12,344 under-18s between June and September 2020. Early long-range weather forecasts from the Met Office suggest there may be a period of high pressure bringing above-average temperatures in some parts of the UK in mid-August.

"The UK government spent a record Â£8.7bn in interest on repaying its debts last month, official figures show. The figure was more than three times as much as the Â£2.7bn in interest payments seen in June 2020. The reason was a surge in inflation, which raised the value of index-linked government bonds. Overall borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was Â£22.8bn, which was Â£5.5bn lower than June last year. However, the figure was the second-highest for June since records began. Borrowing has been hitting record levels, with billions being spent on measures such as furlough payments. But the cost of servicing all that borrowing has been rising too. Government gilts, for instance, are uprated in line with Retail Price Index inflation, which is higher than the headline consumer inflation rate. However, analysts stressed that despite the record payment, debt servicing costs as a share of GDP remain low by historic standards. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""While debt servicing costs will stay higher than the [Office for Budget Responsibility] expects over the next few years, the public finances should reap the benefits of a fuller recovery in GDP than the OBR expects, meaning that the deficit will still fall faster."" The huge amount of borrowing over the past year has now pushed government debt up to more than Â£2.2 trillion, or about 99.7% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned that the lower-than-expected borrowing seen in recent months was likely to prove only temporary, leaving Chancellor Rishi Sunak with ""very little room for manoeuvre"" in his forthcoming Spending Review. Where does the government borrow billions from? The Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) now estimates that the government borrowed a total of Â£297.7bn in the financial year to March. That was 14.2% of the UK's GDP and the highest level since the end of World War Two. The ONS said the cost of measures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic meant that day-to-day spending by the government rose by Â£204.3bn to Â£942.7bn last year. In response to the latest figures, the chancellor said he was ""proud of the unprecedented package of support we put in place to protect jobs and help thousands of businesses survive the pandemic"". He added: ""However, it's also right that we ensure debt remains under control in the medium term, and that's why I made some tough choices at the last Budget to put the public finances on a sustainable path."" According to the IFS, those tough choices will persist, even though the economy is recovering more quickly than expected at the time of the Budget. ""We now forecast that borrowing in 2021-22 could come in some Â£30bn lower than the Â£234bn forecast in the March Budget,"" the IFS said. ""But this near-term improvement in the outlook is not expected to persist. ""Permanent economic damage done by the pandemic and rising debt interest costs mean that, under our forecast, the chancellor has little, if any, additional headroom against his stated medium-term target of current budget balance (borrowing only to invest, not to fund day-to-day spending)."" That would leave Mr Sunak with virtually no additional room for permanent giveaways in this year's Spending Review, the IFS added. How you view the state of the public finances depends on which measure you pick. If you compare the amount of borrowing that the government needed to do in June to plug the gap between its income from taxes and the amount it spent, it's the second-highest on record. But then you remember that records only go back to 1993. Compared to last June, it's down by Â£5.5bn. Similarly with the overall debt (simply put, all the borrowings over the years added up). It's risen - to 99.7% of the size of the economy as measured by gross domestic product, its highest on that measure since 1961. But then you look further back and realise public debt was larger than the size of the economy for 40 of the last 100 years. Given that the pandemic has put the economy on something like a war footing, it's worth noting that after World War Two, it was 2.5 times the size. The reaction of the government then was not to cut spending, but to embark on the biggest expansion of state spending in history. Sixteen years later, in 1961, prosperity was secure, taxes rolled in and both borrowing and debt dropped rapidly. As a proportion of the economy, it's businesses' debts, rather than government debts, that are now larger - a consequence of the fact that many small and medium-sized businesses have been given no choice but to borrow their way through the pandemic. Arguably it's that debt, rather than the government ""debt"" (mostly ""borrowed"" from itself by issuing currency), which needs the most urgent policy attention in the wake of the pandemic. Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics said the government had borrowed less in June than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, which had expected it to be Â£25.2bn. She said higher tax receipts and stronger GDP growth were further signs that the strong economic recovery was starting to feed through into lower government borrowing. However, she cautioned that higher taxes were still in the offing as Mr Sunak attempts to rebalance the books after the cost of the pandemic. ""We suspect the chancellor will 'bank' any improvement in the deficit rather than scale back the planned tax hikes and spending cuts set to hit the economy. At least by 2022-23, the economy should be strong enough to cope with it,"" she said. How does the government borrow money? Can countries pay back pandemic debt?

"Governments borrow to fund ""day-to-day"" spending, as well as long-term infrastructure projects like the Elizabeth Line The UK government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest. The government gets most of its income from taxes. For example, workers payincome tax and national insurance, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on profits. It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and that sometimes happens. But, if it can't, the government covers the gap by raising taxes, cutting spending or borrowing. Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax. So, governments often decide to borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects, like new railways and roads. How the government raises and spends Â£1 trillion a year The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds. A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments. UK government bonds - known as ""gilts"" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. The government sells short and long-term gilts to let it borrow money over different time periods, with varying interest rates. The amount the government borrows fluctuates from month to month. For instance, it tends to borrow less in January, when many people pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go. So, it is more helpful to look across a whole year, or the year-to-date. In the last full financial year, to March 2024, the government borrowed Â£125.1bn. The most recent monthly figures show thegovernment borrowed Â£11.2bn in November 2024,which was Â£3.4bn lower than in the same month the previous year, and the lowest November figure since 2021. Borrowing since March stands at Â£113.2bn, which is the third highest financial year-to-November borrowing total since monthly records began in 1993. The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about Â£2.8 trillion - or Â£2,800,000,000,000. That is roughly the same asthe value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP. The current level is more than double that seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008. The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up. But, in relation to the size of the economy, UK debt figures are still low compared with much of the last century. They are also less than the equivalent figures for some other leading economies. The larger the national debt, the more interest the government pays. That cost was not as great when interest rates were low during the 2010s, but became more noticeable after the Bank of England started raising interest rates in 2021. The amount of interest the government pays on national debt also varies from month to month. It was Â£3bn in November 2024, the lowest November figure for five years. However, interest rates for long-term borrowing have risen to theirhighest levels this century., with the government paying 5.25% on 30-year gilts. If the government has to set aside more cash for paying debts, it may mean it has less to spend on public services. Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost. Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax in the long run. The increase in long-term interest rates seen in January prompted some economists to warn that the government is ""on course"" to miss its own borrowing targets. Labour decided to stick to a rule followed by the previous government that the total amount of money owed must have fallen as a proportion of the UK economy in five years' time. In October's Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeveschanged the definition of debt that the government would use in the target to enable her to raise more money for investment. It will now track a different, broader measure of debt called public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL). This includes, for example, the money the government gets from people repaying their student loans. Downing Street said there was ""no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability"", and that ""meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable"". The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR)- which monitors the government's financial performance - will present its latest economic forecast to Parliament in late March. It has previously warned that public debt could soar as the population ages and tax income falls. In an ageing population, the proportion of people of working age drops, meaning the government takes less in tax while paying out more in pensions. Budget 2024: Key points at a glance Rachel Reevesâ tax-raising Budget will affect you for years Debtis the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. Thedeficitis the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends. When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus. Debt rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.

"Taxpayers will bear the costs of Covid ""for decades"" - and an inquiry will not come soon enough to learn lessons from the pandemic, MPs have said. In two new reports, the Public Accounts Committee said No 10's response to the crisis has exposed UK taxpayers to""significant financial risks"",external. The MPs also attacked government spending on unusable protective kit. The Department of Health said there were ""processes"" to ensure spending gives taxpayers value for money. In the cross-party reports published on Sunday, the PAC said the taxpayer would be exposed to ""significant financial risks for decades to come"" with the estimated cost of the government's measures having already hit Â£372bn in May. UK government debt is now over Â£2.2 trillion, or about 99.7% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s. In June alone,debt interest cost Â£8.7bn. In one example of future Covid costs, the PAC says taxpayers could be liable for an estimated Â£26 billion of bad loans, out of a total Â£92 billion of loans guaranteed by the government. The report states: ""While we acknowledge that there was a need to relax the usual rules surrounding major spending decisions... we are concerned that this has created serious risks that may require managing for years."" PAC chairwoman Dame Meg Hillier said: ""With eye-watering sums of money spent on Covid measures so far, the government needs to be clear, now, how this will be managed going forward, and over what period of time."" The MPs also said they are ""concerned that despite spending over Â£10bn on supplies, the [personal protective equipment] stockpile is not fit for purpose"". Out of 32 billion items of PPE ordered by the Department of Health and Social Care, the committee said 11 billion had been distributed, while 12.6 billion are stored in the UK as central stock. But some 8.4 billion items on order from other countries have still not arrived in the UK. The stockpile, MPs added, is costing about Â£6.7m a week to store, with potential waste levels ""unacceptably high"". According to the report, there were 10,000 shipping containers of PPE still to be unpacked as of May this year - but that it had already been determined that 2.1 billion PPE items were unusable in medical settings. The MPs said this equated to more than Â£2bn of taxpayers' money - and was over five times the estimate of PPE found to be unfit for purpose given to MPs by DHSC in January. How much is Covid costing and how will we pay? Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged there will be anindependent public inquiry into government's handling of the pandemic- with an expected start date of Spring 2022. The PAC said it was ""clear that government cannot wait for the review before learning important lessons"" and must instead present a Covid recovery plan in the autumn spending review. Dame Meg added: ""If coronavirus is with us for a long time, the financial hangover could leave future generations with a big headache."" A DHSC spokeswoman said: ""There are robust processes in place to ensure that government spending always provides value for money for the taxpayer. ""We have worked tirelessly to source life-saving PPE to protect health and care staff, and we have delivered over 12.7 billion items to the frontline at record speed."" Do doctors and nurses have enough protective gear? PPE price rises cost taxpayers Â£10bn, report says Meanwhile, an analysis by the Labour party suggests that the holiday plans of nearly six million Britons could be ruined if Spain and Greece are added to the ""amber plus"" list alongside France. The party said an estimated 5,857,558 people faced last-minute quarantine requirements after booking trips over the ""summer of chaos"". Since 19 July, fully vaccinated adults returning to the UK from amber list countries have not needed need to complete the 10-day quarantine period. Butministers removed the exemption for France amid fears over the Beta Covid variant, creating what critics say is an ""amber plus"" category on government's traffic light system for international travel. Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: ""Not only have they failed to protect our borders, allowing Covid cases to rocket - they also refuse to be straight with the public and give them the information they need to book travel with confidence."" A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""The travel list allocations have not changed for Spain or Greece."" He added that officials were ""closely monitoring the data"" and would take ""swift action"" should the data reveal a change in risk to England from these countries.

"A scheme allowing key workers to avoid Covid self-isolation in England has been significantly expanded following criticism it did not go far enough. Police, fire, Border Force, transport and freight staff will now be able to join a daily workplace test scheme, whether they are vaccinated or not. Some 10,000 supermarket depot and food factory workers will also be eligible. Testing is expected to start next week. Several sectors have warned of staff shortages in recent days. Transport for London warned of line closures and cancellations this weekend as more than 300 members of staff are self-isolating. AndThameslink tweeted,externalthat fewer trains were able to run ""due to unavailability of train crew having an impact across the network"" and told the BBC ""coronavirus has been affecting our business and colleagues"". Southern and Avanti West Coast said they would also have slimmed down services from Monday. Currently, most people identified as close contacts of someone with coronavirus have to self-isolate for 10 days. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak are among those self-isolatingafter Health Secretary Sajid Javid tested positive last week. Mr Javidtweeted,externalthat he had made a ""full recovery"" and but faced criticism after he added that people should get vaccinated ""as we learn to live with, rather than cower from, this virus"". Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy accused Javid of having ""insulted"" people who followed the rules to protect others and Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Munira Wilson said Mr Javid's tweet was ""outrageous"" and said he owed the millions who were shielding an apology. Which workers don't have to self-isolate? Check the latest rules in your area Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said the government needed to ""give clear guidance"" on self-isolation rules or ""risk making this summer of chaos and confusion even worse"". Police forces, local authorities, transport providers and supermarkets have been among those calling for a review of the rules to avoid crippling shutdowns or skeleton operations. Home Secretary Priti Patel said daily testing would keep frontline teams safe while they continued to serve the public and communities. From 16 August anyone in England who is fully vaccinated - and unvaccinated under-18s - will be able to take daily tests instead of self-isolating. Similar rules come into force in Scotland from 9 August - and in Wales from 7 August. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has joined leading business figures in urging Prime Minister Boris Johnsonto bring this date forward and end self-isolation for close contactsif they are fully vaccinated. Growing numbers of people have been told to self-isolate, with almost 608,000 contact tracing alerts sent from the NHS Covid-19 app in the week to 15 July - a record high. The number having to self-isolate has been blamed for shortages of some products in supermarkets and staffing problems for frontline services. The daily test scheme means eligible workers who are alerted by the app in England - or contacted by NHS Test and Trace - will be able to continue working if they test negative each day, whatever their vaccination status. Ports, airports, rail infrastructure and haulage workers, alongside frontline police, fire and Border Force staff will now be eligible. The government has announced an extra 200 testing sites to help screen these workers - but these will not open until Monday at the earliest. By Lewis Goodall, BBC Newsnight correspondent Confusion, if not some chaos, has reigned in Whitehall over the past 24 hours as ministers and officials grapple with the large numbers of people being told to self-isolate. Departments have expressed concern about their ability to maintain key public services. Ministers have now announced an expansion of workplace testing sites to include staff at the Border Force, police and fire services and key transport sectors. The same measure was introduced on Thursday for food distribution workers. However, a government official told me that they would be expected to leave self-isolation only for work. Critics are already questioning how realistic or fair an idea that can be. A separate scheme in England allows employers to apply in advance for exemptions for named fully vaccinated critical workers in a small number of industries, such as the energy sector. In Scotland, critical workers in the health, food and transport sectors can apply to be exempt from self-isolation. GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? QUARANTINE:Will I need to self-isolate in a hotel? Meanwhile, England manager Gareth Southgate is urging younger people to get vaccinated, saying it is a chance to""get your freedom back"". About 34% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England - about three million people - have not been vaccinated at all. In Scotland, about 30% are not yet vaccinated. A total of 83,239,491 vaccines have been given in the UK, 46,476,845 first doses and 36,762,646 second doses,according to the latest government figures.,external Saturday's daily figures showed Covid caseswere down for the fourth consecutive day,externalin the UK, with 31,795 new infections, a fall of almost 5,000 from the previous day. However, it is too soon to say whether cases have peaked given that the statistics do not capture the impact of unlocking that happened on 19 July. The latest estimate of R - which measures how quickly the virus is spreading - is unchanged from the previous week at 1.2 to 1.4. It means that on average, every 10 people infected with coronavirus goes on to infect between 12 and 14 others.

"Rescuers have moved tens of thousands of people to safety Rescuers are scouring devastated parts of western India for survivors after heavy rains caused deadly floods. Tens of thousands of people have been moved out of affected areas, with record-breaking rainfall reported along parts of the coast. The states of Goa and Maharashtra have been badly affected, with many feared missing near the financial hub Mumbai. At least 136 people have died in Maharashtra, while in neighbouring Goa hundreds of homes have been damaged. Many factors contribute to flooding, but experts say climate change caused by global warming makes extreme rainfall more likely. Heavy rains and flooding have also hit western Europe and parts of China in recent weeks, while North America has grappled with scorching heatwaves. The monsoon season in India lasts from June to September each year. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Parkrun welcomes runners, walkers and even dogs to events There were jubilant scenes as thousands of joggers and walkers took part in the first Parkrun events in England since Covid restrictions ended. The free 5km events resumed in more than 500 parks and green spaces - 16 months since they weresuspended due to Covid measures. Parkrun's Tom Williams said organisers had been ""incredibly moved"" by the public support for the events. Organisers hope Parkruns can restart in Scotland and Wales by mid-August. Events in Northern Ireland resumed at the end of last month. Under the latest easing of almost all Covid legal restrictions that happened on Monday, outdoor running events including the London Marathon and the Great North Run can also resume. The Parkrun events, usually held every Saturday, are billed as a chance for people - regardless of age, gender or ability - to regularly run, jog or walk together and enjoy their local park. Runner, 88, completes 400th Parkrun Parkrun events suspended across UK English councils urged to allow Parkrun events Thousands of people took part in runs across England earlier, with large numbers running the course in south-west London's Bushy Park - home to the first ever Parkrun in 2004. A runner takes part with a buggy in the Bushy Park event - the largest and oldest event in the UK Rochelle Bisson, 29, in Bexley, south-east London, said despite being nervous about coronavirus, it was a ""really nice feeling"" being able to run with other people again. She said: ""It was really fun. I was a little apprehensive because I'm still being a bit careful after all the Covid restrictions. ""I'm a keen runner but I'm quite slow and it was nice to hang back and avoid the crowd and that helped me feel a lot safer."" Ms Bisson, who runs to help her anxiety and mental health, added: ""It was a really nice feeling running with other people. I've done some running during lockdown but it's not the same. ""It's nice to run with other people who support you and can cheer you on."" Rochelle says she is still being careful but had fun and felt safe at Parkrun Bob Emmerson, 88, became the oldest person to complete 400 Parkrunswhen he crossed the finish line at the Northampton event. Mr Emmerson, who ran with his 67-year-old son, also called Bob, said fellow runners and supporters cheered for him as he finished the run. He told the BBC it had been a ""really pleasant morning that was not too hot or cold"" and that his next milestone would be to complete 500 Parkruns. ""If Covid hadn't have happened, I would have been on 470 by now,"" he said. ""The target is going to be 500 but I will be 90 by that time I think. ""I will just have to take it one week at a time, I can't give it up. If I don't turn up it will be a big event."" Bob Emmerson said fellow runners and supporters stood and clapped him as he crossed the finish line In south-east London, Paul Williams, 63, was cheered on by fellow runners as he became one of the last 293 finishers at the Southwark Parkrun. Mr Williams, who has learning disabilities and a bad leg, first began attending the event in 2015 and said he had ""missed"" it during the pandemic. On finishing his 78th event after an hour and 16 minutes walk, Mr Williams, who has volunteered at more than 30 Parkruns, said: ""I have been stuck indoors for about a year because I have got diabetes and I wasn't allowed to go out. ""There was no exercise. I have been meeting everyone again and seeing everybody. It gives me exercise, helps me lose weight. I like to keep myself fit and to talk to people."" Paul Williams, 63, who was the last of the 293 finishers at the Southwark Parkrun in south-east London Runners took part in the Victoria Park Parkrun in east Belfast after the events resumed in Northern Ireland last month Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick and England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam were also among those running at a Parkrun in Newark, Nottinghamshire. Mr Jenrick tweeted a photograph of the pair elbow bumping, with the caption ""Jenrick v JVT"", adding: ""Great to see Parkrun back, across the country and especially here in Newark.""

"Passengers reported long queues and a lack of information at Stansted Airport Airlines and airports say they are having their busiest weekend since the pandemic began as schools close and the summer holidays begin for millions. Heathrow Airport expects 60,000 passengers to depart daily, while Gatwick says it expects 250 flights a day - up from a low of just 15. But the numbers are still far below pre-pandemic levels. Spain is the top destination for UK travellers, followed by Greece. What are the rules for foreign holidays this summer? Holiday bookings surge after quarantine relaxation Heathrow to trial fast-tracking vaccinated arrivals After 18 months in which the travel industry has been devastated by the pandemic, companies including EasyJet, TUI and Jet2, as well as major airports, said they would have more passengers this weekend than at any time since the pandemic began. Air travel companies said the decision to let fully vaccinated travellers visit amber list countries without quarantining on their return had encouraged people to consider more destinations. Travellers at London Stansted Airport in Essex reported snaking queues at check-in and security - with one passenger telling the BBC they felt it was ""chaos"" with staff overwhelmed. Camilla McMyn said some passengers were upset after missing flights due to the long queues. ""I haven't been crammed up next to so many people for a long time,"" she added. Some 1,330 flights were due at Stansted between Friday and Monday, up from 735 during the same weekend in 2020. Gatwick Airport is back up to 250 flights a day, but still well short of its usual 950 daily flights before the pandemic Manchester Airport said it was ""an encouraging but tentative step towards recovery"", but it said the government's ""chaotic and unpredictable"" approach to international travel had damaged confidence. EasyJet suggested the vaccination programme had given the travel industry a boost, with many Britons saying they were much more likely to want to travel once they had been double-vaccinated and that travel had been a major motivation for getting jabbed for many of them.

"This video can not be played Gareth Southgate, speaking on Twitter in a 10 Downing Street message: ''Go and get it (your Covid vaccine) done'' England manager Gareth Southgate is urging younger people to get vaccinated, saying it is a chance to ""get your freedom back"". It comes after it was revealed the proportion of people aged 20 to 29 testing positive for Covid in England had hit record levels. In the message, released by 10 Downing Street, he said vaccination was ""our best route out of this problem"". Many young adults have not received a first vaccine dose yet. Covid cases at record levels for 20 to 29-year-olds Two jabs needed to enter nightclubs from September What do under-30s need to know about the vaccine? About 34% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England - about three million people - have not been vaccinated at all. In Scotland, about 30% are not yet vaccinated. But half of all under-30s in England - more than four million people - received a first dose in the three weeks after the vaccination programme was opened to people in their 20s in June. And the vaccination rate is still climbing for this group in England and Scotland. Southgate started by thanking fans for their support of the England team at Euro 2020, before saying: ""We know the last 18 months have been incredibly difficult for everybody. ""And there's no doubt that the vaccination programme is our best route out of this problem, not only for us as a country but across the world. ""So I just wanted to say how important it is, if you haven't had your vaccine yet, to go and get it done."" He said ""oldies"" like him could now ""crack on"" with their lives if they were fully vaccinated, adding that ""for you younger ones especially, it's the chance for everything to open up, to get your freedom back"". The former England player continued: ""So much of that is going to rest on you having the vaccine. ""So, don't put it off any longer, go and get it done, we can open everything up, we can protect the people we need to protect and you guys will get your freedom back."" The video has been shared widely on social media. Gareth Southgate thanked England fans for supporting the team Public Health England'sfigures show,external, in the last week, 1,155 people in their 20s tested positive for every 100,000 in the population. That is the highest rate of cases in any age group since mass-testing began, experts said, urging everyone in this group to get both jabs.

"Cardiff University is one of four in Wales which will meet the full cost of students' quarantine It is ""unacceptable"" some international students face studying remotely until they can afford to pay quarantine costs, a students' group has said. Some universities in Wales have offered to pay the Â£1,750 costs for students coming from red list countries. Hundreds travelling from countries including India, Egypt and Kenya must spend 10 days at a quarantine hotel in England, under the current rules. The Welsh government urged students to ask their universities about support. The National Union of Students (NUS) Wales said it was wrong that support varied, despite all international students paying the ""same high fees"" - often between Â£10,000 and Â£20,000 per year, depending on the course. Wales' eight universities have more than 25,000 overseas students. Bangor University, Cardiff University, the University of South Wales and Swansea University have all said they would fund the costs of quarantine in full for red list students. What are the rules for travelling to green, amber and red list countries? Stressed at uni? There's a cat for that Anger over 'junk' food isolation parcels Aberystwyth University has offered to pay up to Â£1,000 per student, but Cardiff Metropolitan University and the University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD) have only offered remote learning until students can pay themselves. Cardiff Met said it was ""considering all options"" to support students. But UWTSD has not commented. Wrexham GlyndÅµr University has not revealed its policy on quarantine fees. ""International students already pay far higher tuition fees, without which universities would face financial collapse,"" said NUS Wales president Becky Ricketts. ""It is also wrong that some international students will have their quarantine paid for, some will have to pay, and others will have to wait and learn online, all the while paying the same high fees as students in the classroom. ""Financial support should not be dependent on which institution you choose to attend."" She wants the Welsh government to pay the costs, saying if it failed ""to do the right thing"" then universities must ""step up"". Goretti Njagi said it was ""a setback"" when Kenya was added to the red list Goretti Njagi, 31, a postgraduate student at Swansea University, opted to start her psychology course online from home in Kenya last year, because of concerns over travelling in the pandemic. ""I decided to start my learning in my country first, but one month into it, I realised that I may have to do this for a long period, so I decided just to come anyway. ""I was looking forward to face-to-face learning, but I ended up actually completing almost my entire course online. ""Sometimes it kind of makes you wonder whether you made the correct decision."" Kenya hassince been placed on the UK's red list. Ms Njagi said if she was looking to travel from Kenya this year, she would consider studying online for longer. ""I have never relied on the internet, WhatsApp and Zoom calls so heavily as I have this year. It does get quite lonely and you need sometimes to get the reassurance from your family, but it's not the same as having them there with you. ""It was quite a setback when Kenya was red-listed for us. You think that you might get at least a break to visit home, even for your mental health it's quite important. ""But now with Kenya being on the red list it means that you cannot take a break and visit your family."" Cara Aitchison said universities had become ""adept"" at online teaching Cardiff Metropolitan University's vice-chancellor Cara Aitchison said: ""There will be students arriving from red list countries. That's obviously much more complicated. ""Not least because they'll be arriving into England and then coming on to Wales [after quarantine]."" Prof Aitchison said it had to be left up to individual students to decide when they wanted to travel to Wales, with many facing unique and changing circumstance in their home countries. She said the UK government had now given permission for international students to delay their journey until April 2022, if they felt it necessary, and would start their course online from their home country. ""I think we're now pretty adept at this hybrid way of working, so that will be a distinction between international students and some of the home students that we absolutely want to see on campus come September."" The Welsh government said: ""We understand the cost of quarantine may be a financial burden for some students and they should speak to their university about what support is available. ""Welsh universities are considering how they can support international students to start their courses remotely to allow them to delay travel while case rates and risks in their home countries are high.""

"Parkrun welcomes runners, walkers and even dogs to events There were jubilant scenes as thousands of joggers and walkers took part in the first Parkrun events in England since Covid restrictions ended. The free 5km events resumed in more than 500 parks and green spaces - 16 months since they weresuspended due to Covid measures. Parkrun's Tom Williams said organisers had been ""incredibly moved"" by the public support for the events. Organisers hope Parkruns can restart in Scotland and Wales by mid-August. Events in Northern Ireland resumed at the end of last month. Under the latest easing of almost all Covid legal restrictions that happened on Monday, outdoor running events including the London Marathon and the Great North Run can also resume. The Parkrun events, usually held every Saturday, are billed as a chance for people - regardless of age, gender or ability - to regularly run, jog or walk together and enjoy their local park. Runner, 88, completes 400th Parkrun Parkrun events suspended across UK English councils urged to allow Parkrun events Thousands of people took part in runs across England earlier, with large numbers running the course in south-west London's Bushy Park - home to the first ever Parkrun in 2004. A runner takes part with a buggy in the Bushy Park event - the largest and oldest event in the UK Rochelle Bisson, 29, in Bexley, south-east London, said despite being nervous about coronavirus, it was a ""really nice feeling"" being able to run with other people again. She said: ""It was really fun. I was a little apprehensive because I'm still being a bit careful after all the Covid restrictions. ""I'm a keen runner but I'm quite slow and it was nice to hang back and avoid the crowd and that helped me feel a lot safer."" Ms Bisson, who runs to help her anxiety and mental health, added: ""It was a really nice feeling running with other people. I've done some running during lockdown but it's not the same. ""It's nice to run with other people who support you and can cheer you on."" Rochelle says she is still being careful but had fun and felt safe at Parkrun Bob Emmerson, 88, became the oldest person to complete 400 Parkrunswhen he crossed the finish line at the Northampton event. Mr Emmerson, who ran with his 67-year-old son, also called Bob, said fellow runners and supporters cheered for him as he finished the run. He told the BBC it had been a ""really pleasant morning that was not too hot or cold"" and that his next milestone would be to complete 500 Parkruns. ""If Covid hadn't have happened, I would have been on 470 by now,"" he said. ""The target is going to be 500 but I will be 90 by that time I think. ""I will just have to take it one week at a time, I can't give it up. If I don't turn up it will be a big event."" Bob Emmerson said fellow runners and supporters stood and clapped him as he crossed the finish line In south-east London, Paul Williams, 63, was cheered on by fellow runners as he became one of the last 293 finishers at the Southwark Parkrun. Mr Williams, who has learning disabilities and a bad leg, first began attending the event in 2015 and said he had ""missed"" it during the pandemic. On finishing his 78th event after an hour and 16 minutes walk, Mr Williams, who has volunteered at more than 30 Parkruns, said: ""I have been stuck indoors for about a year because I have got diabetes and I wasn't allowed to go out. ""There was no exercise. I have been meeting everyone again and seeing everybody. It gives me exercise, helps me lose weight. I like to keep myself fit and to talk to people."" Paul Williams, 63, who was the last of the 293 finishers at the Southwark Parkrun in south-east London Runners took part in the Victoria Park Parkrun in east Belfast after the events resumed in Northern Ireland last month Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick and England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam were also among those running at a Parkrun in Newark, Nottinghamshire.

"This video can not be played Video from New South Wales Police showed clashes in Sydney Demonstrations have taken place in Australian cities against tight restrictions imposed to tackle a rise in Covid cases. Thousands gathered in Sydney, with smaller protests held in Melbourne and Brisbane. People chanted ""freedom"" as they marched through the centre of Sydney. Officers said they had made 57 arrests. Australian governments have re-imposed lockdowns across the country amid a surge in new infections. The arrival of the highly contagious Delta variant has challenged the country's previous strategy of border closures, quarantine programmes and snap lockdowns which helped keep cases low. Vaccination rates remain the lowest among developed nations, with fewer than 14% of people jabbed. On Saturday thousands of people marched to the centre of Sydney through the suburb of Haymarket. New South Wales (NSW) health authority had moments ago declared the area a Covid hotspot, public broadcaster ABC News reports. Some held placards reading ""Drop your mask, raise your voice"" and ""Wake Up Australia"". Protesters blocked roads and gathered outside Sydney's town hall. One group threw bottles at mounted officers. ""The NSW Police Force recognises and supports the rights of individuals and groups to exercise their rights of free speech and peaceful assembly, however, today's protest is in breach of the current Covid-19 Public Health Orders,""a statement from the force read,external. How Delta burst Australia's Covid bubble What's gone wrong with Australia's vaccine rollout? Smaller events also took place in Melbourne, where people lit flares outside Parliament House, and in Brisbane, at the Botanic Gardens. Some 13 million Australians - about half its population - are now back in lockdown. Sydney has now been under lockdown for four weeks, but continues to see cases rise. NSW officials announced a record increase of 163 new infections on Saturday. State health minister Brad Hazzard echoed calls by premier Gladys Berejiklian for other states to send extra vaccine doses to NSW. ""If it gets worse here in New South Wales, it could actually create massive problems for the whole country,"" Mr Hazzard reportedly said. ""New South Wales is the gateway to the rest of Australia."" According to Johns Hopkins University data, the country has overall recorded 32,594 cases and 916 deaths.

"Passengers reported long queues and a lack of information at Stansted Airport Airlines and airports say they are having their busiest weekend since the pandemic began as schools close and the summer holidays begin for millions. Heathrow Airport expects 60,000 passengers to depart daily, while Gatwick says it expects 250 flights a day - up from a low of just 15. But the numbers are still far below pre-pandemic levels. Spain is the top destination for UK travellers, followed by Greece. What are the rules for foreign holidays this summer? Holiday bookings surge after quarantine relaxation Heathrow to trial fast-tracking vaccinated arrivals After 18 months in which the travel industry has been devastated by the pandemic, companies including EasyJet, TUI and Jet2, as well as major airports, said they would have more passengers this weekend than at any time since the pandemic began. Air travel companies said the decision to let fully vaccinated travellers visit amber list countries without quarantining on their return had encouraged people to consider more destinations. Travellers at London Stansted Airport in Essex reported snaking queues at check-in and security - with one passenger telling the BBC they felt it was ""chaos"" with staff overwhelmed. Camilla McMyn said some passengers were upset after missing flights due to the long queues. ""I haven't been crammed up next to so many people for a long time,"" she added. Some 1,330 flights were due at Stansted between Friday and Monday, up from 735 during the same weekend in 2020. Gatwick Airport is back up to 250 flights a day, but still well short of its usual 950 daily flights before the pandemic Manchester Airport said it was ""an encouraging but tentative step towards recovery"", but it said the government's ""chaotic and unpredictable"" approach to international travel had damaged confidence. EasyJet suggested the vaccination programme had given the travel industry a boost, with many Britons saying they were much more likely to want to travel once they had been double-vaccinated and that travel had been a major motivation for getting jabbed for many of them.

"Rescue teams worked 12-hour shifts to clear the rubble Firefighters say their search for bodies in the rubble of the collapsed Florida apartment block has finally ended, but one victim remains unaccounted for. At least 97 people were killed when the 12-storey Champlain Towers South fell in the early hours of 24 June. But the remains of 54-year-old Estelle Hedaya are yet to be identified. Her family say the official end of the search has left them feeling helpless and worried she will be forgotten. Nobody has been pulled alive from the rubble since the first hours after the disaster, and officials formally switched from a search-and-rescue mission to a recovery effort on 7 July. Battling tropical storms and the risk of unstable debris, rescuers worked through more than 13,000 tonnes of broken concrete. The Surfside site has mostly been cleared, with the rubble moved to a state warehouse for further inspection. What do we know about the Miami collapse victims? After the search ended, officials thanked firefighters who worked 12-hour shifts while camping out at the site. ""It's obviously devastating. It's obviously a difficult situation across the board,"" Fire Chief Alan Cominsky said at a ceremony on Friday. ""I couldn't be prouder of the men and women that represent Miami-Dade Fire Rescue."" The mission had to be been halted several times, due to instability in the mound of rubble as well as Tropical Storm Elsa. Officials had to order the part of the building that remained standing be demolished on 4 July. Why is the Miami rescue effort taking so long? Estelle Hedaya's relatives are devastated to hear the search has officially ended Officials say there are no more bodies to be found at the site, but the conclusion has come as devastating news to friends and relatives of Estelle Hedaya, believed to be the disaster's 98th victim. Her younger brother Ikey has given DNA samples and visited the site twice to see the search efforts for himself. ""As we enter month two alone, without any other families, we feel helpless,"" he told the Associated Press news agency. Another friend Leah Sutton, who had known Ms Hedaya since birth, told the agency: ""They seem to be packing up and congratulating everyone on a job well done. And yes, they deserve all the accolades, but after they find Estelle. "" This video can not be played Miami-Dade Fire Rescue shared a video to show how they're working to clear the rubble Other victims of the disaster include the seven-year-old daughter of a Miami firefighter, a 92-year-old grandmother and the sister of Paraguay's first lady. The site - which is being treated as a crime scene - is now under the control of police. What caused the 40-year-old building to fall to the ground while its residents slept remains unknown. What could have caused Miami building collapse? But a 2018 report that found structural problemshas prompted several inquiries, including a grand jury investigation. The building association's board said it would appoint an ""independent receiver... to oversee the legal and claims process"". The tragedy has led authorities to check housing blocks across southern Florida for similar issues. Miami collapse: What happened?

"Former striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scored the winning goal for Manchester United in the 1999 Champions League final Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has signed a new deal with the club until 2024, with an option for a further year. The Norwegian, 48, took over permanently in March 2019, having been put in interim charge when Jose Mourinho departed three months earlier. He led United to second place in the Premier League last season and the Europa League final, which they lost. Solskjaer said he was ""delighted"" at signing the new contract. Jadon Sancho completes Â£73m move to Manchester United ""We are more confident than ever that, under Ole's leadership, we are heading in the right direction,"" said United's executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward. ""Ole and his staff have worked tirelessly putting the foundations in place for long-term success on the pitch. ""The results of that have become increasingly visible over the past two seasons and we are all looking forward to seeing this exciting team develop further in the years ahead. ""What is especially pleasing is the way this progress has been achieved with a blend of young, homegrown talent and top-class recruits, playing attacking football in the best traditions of Manchester United."" Solskjaer spent 11 seasons as a United player, scoring the winning goal in the 1999 Champions League final. He became United's fourth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 when he signed a three-year contract in March 2019. Solskjaer led the Old Trafford club to third in his first full season when they also got to the semi-finals of the Europa League before losing to Sevilla. In the last campaign, United finished 12 points behind champions Manchester City in claiming the runners-up spot, while they were beaten by Villareal on penalties in the Europa League final. The news of Solskjaer's new deal follows the confirmation of the clubsigning England winger Jadon Sanchofor Â£73m from Borussia Dortmund. ""Everyone knows the feeling I have for this club,"" said Solskjaer. ""It is an exciting time for Manchester United. We have built a squad with a good balance of youth and experienced players that are hungry for success. ""I have a fantastic coaching team around me and we are all ready to take that next step on our journey. ""Manchester United wants to be winning the biggest and best trophies and that's what we are all striving for. We have improved, both on and off the pitch, and that will continue over the coming seasons."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone Should Ole Gunner Solskjaer get to the end of his new contract, since Ernest Mangnall between 1903 and 1912, only Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson will have been in charge for more games as Manchester United manager than the Norwegian. That in itself underlines the faith the club have in Solskjaer. The arrival of Jadon Sancho less than 24 hours earlier is a signing very much in the United traditions, which is what the manager was tasked with returning to Old Trafford when he answered the SOS call from Ed Woodward to replace Jose Mourinho in December 2018. In truth, this news is not really a surprise. United could not have allowed Solskjaer's contract to run into its final season because of the uncertainty it would bring. And, in fairness to him, it has taken longer to put together a squad capable of challenging for the biggest prizes. However, if, as appears likely, Raphael Varane arrives from Real Madrid and the Paul Pogba situation can be resolved satisfactorily - if he leaves a top-class midfield signing is essential - then, at the very least, United must compete. They looked like doing that in the Premier League in January, but eventually fell behind Manchester City. Solskjaer also needs to deliver a trophy. It is clear there is a bond between manager and club - and a shared desire for success. But, like every manager, Solskjaer will be judged on results. United have improved, but the safety net that existed during his first two-and-a-half years in charge will not stay in place forever.

"Passengers reported long queues and a lack of information at Stansted Airport Airlines and airports say they are having their busiest weekend since the pandemic began as schools close and the summer holidays begin for millions. Heathrow Airport expects 60,000 passengers to depart daily, while Gatwick says it expects 250 flights a day - up from a low of just 15. But the numbers are still far below pre-pandemic levels. Spain is the top destination for UK travellers, followed by Greece. What are the rules for foreign holidays this summer? Holiday bookings surge after quarantine relaxation Heathrow to trial fast-tracking vaccinated arrivals After 18 months in which the travel industry has been devastated by the pandemic, companies including EasyJet, TUI and Jet2, as well as major airports, said they would have more passengers this weekend than at any time since the pandemic began. Air travel companies said the decision to let fully vaccinated travellers visit amber list countries without quarantining on their return had encouraged people to consider more destinations. Travellers at London Stansted Airport in Essex reported snaking queues at check-in and security - with one passenger telling the BBC they felt it was ""chaos"" with staff overwhelmed. Camilla McMyn said some passengers were upset after missing flights due to the long queues. ""I haven't been crammed up next to so many people for a long time,"" she added. Some 1,330 flights were due at Stansted between Friday and Monday, up from 735 during the same weekend in 2020. Gatwick Airport is back up to 250 flights a day, but still well short of its usual 950 daily flights before the pandemic Manchester Airport said it was ""an encouraging but tentative step towards recovery"", but it said the government's ""chaotic and unpredictable"" approach to international travel had damaged confidence. EasyJet suggested the vaccination programme had given the travel industry a boost, with many Britons saying they were much more likely to want to travel once they had been double-vaccinated and that travel had been a major motivation for getting jabbed for many of them.

"This video can not be played Gareth Southgate, speaking on Twitter in a 10 Downing Street message: ''Go and get it (your Covid vaccine) done'' England manager Gareth Southgate is urging younger people to get vaccinated, saying it is a chance to ""get your freedom back"". It comes after it was revealed the proportion of people aged 20 to 29 testing positive for Covid in England had hit record levels. In the message, released by 10 Downing Street, he said vaccination was ""our best route out of this problem"". Many young adults have not received a first vaccine dose yet. Covid cases at record levels for 20 to 29-year-olds Two jabs needed to enter nightclubs from September What do under-30s need to know about the vaccine? About 34% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England - about three million people - have not been vaccinated at all. In Scotland, about 30% are not yet vaccinated. But half of all under-30s in England - more than four million people - received a first dose in the three weeks after the vaccination programme was opened to people in their 20s in June. And the vaccination rate is still climbing for this group in England and Scotland. Southgate started by thanking fans for their support of the England team at Euro 2020, before saying: ""We know the last 18 months have been incredibly difficult for everybody. ""And there's no doubt that the vaccination programme is our best route out of this problem, not only for us as a country but across the world. ""So I just wanted to say how important it is, if you haven't had your vaccine yet, to go and get it done."" He said ""oldies"" like him could now ""crack on"" with their lives if they were fully vaccinated, adding that ""for you younger ones especially, it's the chance for everything to open up, to get your freedom back"". The former England player continued: ""So much of that is going to rest on you having the vaccine. ""So, don't put it off any longer, go and get it done, we can open everything up, we can protect the people we need to protect and you guys will get your freedom back."" The video has been shared widely on social media. Gareth Southgate thanked England fans for supporting the team Public Health England'sfigures show,external, in the last week, 1,155 people in their 20s tested positive for every 100,000 in the population.

"People have been warned to take extra care swimming in open water after dozens drowned during recent hot weather. The Royal Life Saving Society (RLSS) described this week's deaths as ""devastating"" and urged people to choose supervised spots to cool off. A 19-year-old man in Lancashire became the latest to die aftergetting into difficulty near St Anne's Pier. Earlier, a boy aged 16 diedafter going swimming at Loch Lomondin Scotland. The family of a 21-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent who died after being pulled from the sea at Crosby beach, Merseyside, on Tuesdaydescribed him as ""amazing"" and ""always smiling"". Lee Heard, charity director of the RLSS, told the BBC he was aware of 28 people who had died in water, both inland and at the coast, across the UK since 14 July, as temperatures soared in many places. He said water deaths often peaked between May and August. ""After the last week, I think the message is that anybody who does not have substantial experience of swimming in cold open water to not go in,"" he said. ""If people do wish to cool off in water, we advise they do so in supervised settings. Local authorities are putting on lifeguards around inland lakes, and there are aqua parks."" This video can not be played Float to live: ""Rest and relax in the water"" Mr Heard added that while wild swimming had become more popular in recent years, those partaking in the sport were often more experienced and took more precautions than casual swimmers. HM Coastguard said on Friday there had been nine deaths at the coast in the previous 10 days. Coastguard officer Fran Wilkins warned there were ""a lot of dangers and risks"" on beaches and at the coastline and swimmers could ""very quickly get into a situation where you may need help"". People can experience problems in open water when they underestimate how cold the water is, find themselves submerged unexpectedly, or get caught in a strong current at sea. This video can not be played 'I can't say how much I miss him' The RLSS has launched its""summer water safety"" campaign,externalwarning about cold water shock, which can affect people's ability to breathe normally, even in warm summer weather. It advises people to keep their mouths away from the water until their breathing returns to normal by rolling on their back. Then it says those in water should immediately swim towards an exit before their muscles cool - or find something to help them float - and call for help. Sunday 25 July is World Drowning Prevention Day - the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) describes drowning as a worldwide epidemic that claims an estimated 235,000 lives every year. The Coastguard and RNLI have jointly called for families to take care at the coast during the school holidays, after revealing RNLI lifeguards saved the lives of 54 children and teenagers last summer. Of those, 64% (35) were aged 12 or under, while RNLI lifeguards also came to the aid of another 12,344 under-18s between June and September 2020. Early long-range weather forecasts from the Met Office suggest there may be a period of high pressure bringing above-average temperatures in some parts of the UK in mid-August.

"A scheme allowing key workers to avoid Covid self-isolation in England has been significantly expanded following criticism it did not go far enough. Police, fire, Border Force, transport and freight staff will now be able to join a daily workplace test scheme, whether they are vaccinated or not. Some 10,000 supermarket depot and food factory workers will also be eligible. Testing is expected to start next week. Several sectors have warned of staff shortages in recent days. Transport for London warned of line closures and cancellations this weekend as more than 300 members of staff are self-isolating. AndThameslink tweeted,externalthat fewer trains were able to run ""due to unavailability of train crew having an impact across the network"" and told the BBC ""coronavirus has been affecting our business and colleagues"". Southern and Avanti West Coast said they would also have slimmed down services from Monday. Currently, most people identified as close contacts of someone with coronavirus have to self-isolate for 10 days. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak are among those self-isolatingafter Health Secretary Sajid Javid tested positive last week. Mr Javidtweeted,externalthat he had made a ""full recovery"" and but faced criticism after he added that people should get vaccinated ""as we learn to live with, rather than cower from, this virus"". Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy accused Javid of having ""insulted"" people who followed the rules to protect others and Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Munira Wilson said Mr Javid's tweet was ""outrageous"" and said he owed the millions who were shielding an apology. Which workers don't have to self-isolate? Check the latest rules in your area Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said the government needed to ""give clear guidance"" on self-isolation rules or ""risk making this summer of chaos and confusion even worse"". Police forces, local authorities, transport providers and supermarkets have been among those calling for a review of the rules to avoid crippling shutdowns or skeleton operations. Home Secretary Priti Patel said daily testing would keep frontline teams safe while they continued to serve the public and communities. From 16 August anyone in England who is fully vaccinated - and unvaccinated under-18s - will be able to take daily tests instead of self-isolating. Similar rules come into force in Scotland from 9 August - and in Wales from 7 August. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has joined leading business figures in urging Prime Minister Boris Johnsonto bring this date forward and end self-isolation for close contactsif they are fully vaccinated. Growing numbers of people have been told to self-isolate, with almost 608,000 contact tracing alerts sent from the NHS Covid-19 app in the week to 15 July - a record high. The number having to self-isolate has been blamed for shortages of some products in supermarkets and staffing problems for frontline services. The daily test scheme means eligible workers who are alerted by the app in England - or contacted by NHS Test and Trace - will be able to continue working if they test negative each day, whatever their vaccination status. Ports, airports, rail infrastructure and haulage workers, alongside frontline police, fire and Border Force staff will now be eligible. The government has announced an extra 200 testing sites to help screen these workers - but these will not open until Monday at the earliest. By Lewis Goodall, BBC Newsnight correspondent Confusion, if not some chaos, has reigned in Whitehall over the past 24 hours as ministers and officials grapple with the large numbers of people being told to self-isolate. Departments have expressed concern about their ability to maintain key public services.

"Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and business leaders have urged Boris Johnson to end self-isolation for contacts of Covid cases if they are fully vaccinated. The PM is under growing pressure to replace the 10-day quarantine with daily testing for those alerted by the NHS Covid-19 app or Test and Trace. It comes amid concerns of staffing shortages across sectors - including hospitality and the food supply chain. The government plans to end isolation for those double-jabbed by 16 August. But business leaders and cross-party politicians want the prime minister to bring forward the date - saying businesses are being put at risk by the ""pingdemic"". In a letter to Mr Johnson, Mr Khan joined UK Hospitality, the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the capital's branch of the Federation of Small Businesses to demand change. Nearly 608,000 contact tracing alerts were sent in England in the week between 8 and 15 July - a record high. More testing sites for workers to avoid isolation What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Food isolation exemption scheme delayed by 3 days Hospitality businesses, such as pubs and restaurants, are struggling with staff shortages, causing some to close temporarily, the letter says. ""The summer months are crucial for many businesses' recovery and their ability to recover must not be put in jeopardy,"" it reads. ""We are therefore calling on you to ensure that the necessary testing is in place to enable people who have been double vaccinated for longer than two weeks and pinged by the NHS Covid app, to immediately return to work, following a negative PCR test, rather than having to self-isolate."" This would help employers and employees to retain faith in the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales, the signatories say. Hospitality firms aren't the only industries to suffer staff shortages due to self-isolation - a number of railway companies haveannounced reduced timetables for the weekend or beyond. Bin collections,the police, and thefood supply chainhave also been affected, among other sectors. The prime minister himselfis isolating, as is the leader of the oppositionSir Keir Starmer. Meanwhile, police, firefighters, Border Force staff, transport and freight workerswill be able to join the daily contact workplace testing scheme, meaning they can avoid self-isolation if they are a contact of a Covid case. The scheme was announced by the government on Thursday, initially for supermarket depots and food manufacturers. But - separately to the mayor's letter - some in the food industry say the plan isn't enough. British Frozen Food Federation chief executive Richard Harrow said workers may be freed up in some areas, such as factories, but not others, such as supermarkets. ""It shows that yet again government does not understand how connected the food supply chain is,"" he told the PA news agency. ""Only opening part is unlikely to solve the overall issue. Plus, who is in and who is out, who decides and how do they decide? ""Confusion continues to pervade and I have been advised no list until Monday. This is worse than useless."" Iceland managing director Richard Walker said he was ""deeply disappointed to see supermarket store workers omitted from the list [of sectors that wouldn't need to isolate]"". Friday's daily figures showed Covid cases were down for the third consecutive day in the UK, with 36,389 new infections.

"A scheme allowing key workers to avoid Covid self-isolation in England has been significantly expanded following criticism it did not go far enough.

"Rescue teams worked 12-hour shifts to clear the rubble Firefighters say their search for bodies in the rubble of the collapsed Florida apartment block has finally ended, but one victim remains unaccounted for. At least 97 people were killed when the 12-storey Champlain Towers South fell in the early hours of 24 June. But the remains of 54-year-old Estelle Hedaya are yet to be identified. Her family say the official end of the search has left them feeling helpless and worried she will be forgotten. Nobody has been pulled alive from the rubble since the first hours after the disaster, and officials formally switched from a search-and-rescue mission to a recovery effort on 7 July. Battling tropical storms and the risk of unstable debris, rescuers worked through more than 13,000 tonnes of broken concrete. The Surfside site has mostly been cleared, with the rubble moved to a state warehouse for further inspection. What do we know about the Miami collapse victims? After the search ended, officials thanked firefighters who worked 12-hour shifts while camping out at the site. ""It's obviously devastating. It's obviously a difficult situation across the board,"" Fire Chief Alan Cominsky said at a ceremony on Friday. ""I couldn't be prouder of the men and women that represent Miami-Dade Fire Rescue."" The mission had to be been halted several times, due to instability in the mound of rubble as well as Tropical Storm Elsa. Officials had to order the part of the building that remained standing be demolished on 4 July. Why is the Miami rescue effort taking so long? Estelle Hedaya's relatives are devastated to hear the search has officially ended Officials say there are no more bodies to be found at the site, but the conclusion has come as devastating news to friends and relatives of Estelle Hedaya, believed to be the disaster's 98th victim. Her younger brother Ikey has given DNA samples and visited the site twice to see the search efforts for himself. ""As we enter month two alone, without any other families, we feel helpless,"" he told the Associated Press news agency. Another friend Leah Sutton, who had known Ms Hedaya since birth, told the agency: ""They seem to be packing up and congratulating everyone on a job well done. And yes, they deserve all the accolades, but after they find Estelle. "" This video can not be played Miami-Dade Fire Rescue shared a video to show how they're working to clear the rubble Other victims of the disaster include the seven-year-old daughter of a Miami firefighter, a 92-year-old grandmother and the sister of Paraguay's first lady. The site - which is being treated as a crime scene - is now under the control of police. What caused the 40-year-old building to fall to the ground while its residents slept remains unknown. What could have caused Miami building collapse? But a 2018 report that found structural problemshas prompted several inquiries, including a grand jury investigation. The building association's board said it would appoint an ""independent receiver... to oversee the legal and claims process"". The tragedy has led authorities to check housing blocks across southern Florida for similar issues. Miami collapse: What happened?

Those targeted include former US Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross. The counter-sanctions come days before US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman is due to visit China. The US sanctions on Chinese officials in Hong Kong were because of their role in the security crackdown in the territory. Washington also warned its business community of the growing risks of operating in Hong Kong. China introduced the National Security Law in Hong Kong last year in response to massive pro-democracy protests. It criminalises secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces and carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. China's foreign ministry said on Friday that the recent US sanctions were designed to ""groundlessly smear Hong Kong's business environment"" and ""gravely violate international law and basic norms governing international relations"". It said it would impose sanctions on seven US individuals and entities including Mr Ross. As commerce secretary under former President Donald Trump, Mr Ross expanded the number of firms that could not trade with American firms without a prior license, including Chinese telecom giants like Huawei and ZTE. Others sanctioned by China include Sophie Richardson, Human Rights Watch's China director; Carolyn Bartholomew, chair of US-China Economic and Security Review Commission; and Adam King of the International Republican Institute. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the US was ""undeterred"" by China's retaliation. ""These actions are the latest examples of how Beijing punishes private citizens, companies and civil society organisations as a way to send political signals,"" she said. BACKGROUND: China brings in new law to fight Trump's sanctions The relationship between Beijing and Washington became even more strained under the Trump administration. They remain sour on issues including the origins of Covid-19, human rights and cybersecurity. This weekend, Ms Sherman will travel to China in an effort to address deteriorating ties. It will be the most senior official visit under President Joe Biden. Mr Ross is just the latest former member of the Trump administration to be hit with sanctions by China. In January, it announced sanctions against outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and 27 other top Trump officials. The Biden administration called that move ""unproductive and cynical"".
