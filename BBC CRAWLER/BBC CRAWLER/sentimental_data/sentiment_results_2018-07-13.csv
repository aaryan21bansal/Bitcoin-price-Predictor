"Baddiel (left) tweeted a photo of himself with Skinner earlier this week After a heart-breaking week for English football fans, Three Lions is number one on this week's official singles chart. It's the first time in chart history a song has scored four spells at number one with the same artist line-up. The original 1996 version had two one-week stints whilst the 1998 re-work had a three-week spell. With over 1.6 million copies sold since its release, the anthem is also one of the UK's best-selling singles ever. 'It's Coming Home': The song that defines England England World Cup defeat seen by 26.5m Radio 1's chart show host Scott Mills said: ""England gave us everything at this World Cup. The whole country got swept away with it. ""Three Lions being the official number one shows how we really got behind our amazing team."" ""Three Lions killed off the football anthem quite conclusively,""David Baddiel told metwo years ago. ""There were a few attempts after 1996 but no-one managed it. And that's because it is the best football anthem of all time."" But even the comedian was taken aback by the sheer success of Three Lions this week, 22 years after it first topped the charts.

And it's hard to stress how difficult it was for the song to reach the summit again. Recently-introduced chart rules penalise songs that are more than three years old; meaning they have to be streamed twice as many times to achieve the same ""sales"" as current hits. But Three Lions smashed through those restrictions - a testament to how its message of hope-against-the-odds is reflected in every international England ever play. Baddiel was right. We don't need another football anthem... unless we win. This video can not be played Why do we chant 'Football's coming home?' The song was written for Euro 96 by Ian Broudie of The Lightning Seeds together with comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner.

"Elaine Douglas and Tommy Brooks claimed they lived on the 19th floor of Grenfell Tower Two illegal immigrants have been jailed for fraudulently claiming Â£125,000 in relief costs by falsely posing as victims of the Grenfell Tower fire. Elaine Douglas and Tommy Brooks were put up in hotels after claiming they lived on the 19th floor of the block. They were caught when council workers discovered their flat did not exist, Isleworth Crown Court heard. The pair, both aged 51, pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation. They also admitted one count of obtaining leave to remain in the UK by deception. Brooks was sentenced to three years and three months in jail, while Douglas was sentenced to three years. Seventy-one people died in the west London tower block fire on 14 June last year The court heard the two Jamaican nationals, of no fixed address, were put up in hotels for almost a year and handed pre-paid credit and travel cards, all paid for by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Douglas and Brooks were also both housed in the Radisson Blu hotel in Kensington. Douglas claimed a total Â£67,123.35 of relief intended for victims of the fire. She spent 276 nights in the Radisson Blu in Kensington, costing the council more than Â£55,000. The 51-year-old also spent more than Â£11,000 on a pre-paid credit card she was given when she complained about the hotel's food. Brooks claimed Â£58,396.89 of relief and stayed in the Radisson Blu and another hotel for 243 nights. He also spent more than Â£9,000 of charges on a credit card. Douglas and Brooks both stayed in the Radisson Blu hotel in Kensington The court heard Brooks and Douglas had managed to avoid immigration authorities for 16 years after entering the UK illegally in the early 2000s.

"This video can not be played Husnain Rashid appeared to collapse as he was arrested at his home An Islamic State group supporter who called for an attack on Prince George has been jailed for life with a minimum of 25 years. Husnain Rashid, 32, of Leonard Street in Nelson, Lancashire, also posted messages threatening people travelling to the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia. Judge Andrew Lees said Rashid made it clear the prince ""and other members of the Royal family should be viewed as potential targets"". Rashid admitted four terrorism charges. Rashid brought his trial at Woolwich Crown Court to a halt in May after two weeks of evidence with a dramatic change of plea at the end of the prosecution opening. The court previously heard Rashid posted a photograph on a Telegram chat group of the prince at his school, super-imposed with silhouettes of two masked jihad fighters. Husnain Rashid had had admitted four terrorism charges Sentencing Rashid, Judge Andrew Lees said: ""The message was clear - you were providing the name and address of Prince George's school, an image of Prince George's school and the instruction or threat that Prince George and other members of the Royal family should be viewed as potential targets."" The judge added: ""You provided what you regarded as inspiration for suitable targets for lone wolf terror attacks. ""Attacks in Western countries were in your eyes the only suitable acceptable alternative to jihad itself."" Husnain Rashid shared Prince George's photograph in tips for would-be attackers Rashid's trial heard that on 13 October he called on supporters via Telegram to target the four-year-old Prince George, who had started school at Thomas's Battersea in south-west London a month earlier. He also posted suggestions of which British football stadiums terrorists could strike following the deadly attack outside Besiktas's ground in Turkey, and plotted to inject supermarket ice cream with poison. Rashid was given a life sentence for each of three counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. He also previously admitted one count of encouraging terrorism and was sentenced to four-and-half years imprisonment, to run concurrently. Husnain Rashid changed his plea almost two weeks into his trial A magazine Rashid was producing contained suggestions to strike the 2018 World Cup in Russia with vehicles, weapons or bombs, his trial heard. Rashid, who is said to have taught at the Muhammadi mosque, ran a ""prolific"" Telegram channel named the Lone Mujahid where he provided an ""e-toolkit for terrorism"", the prosecution said. This allegedly included a recipe for the poison ricin from the Islamist propaganda magazine Inspire, how to make Molotov cocktails and napalm. His list of targets included British Army bases, shopping centres, Jewish communities and government buildings. He also suggested he planned to flee to Syria to fight for IS. Judge Lees said Rashid's plans were ""indiscriminate"" and made no distinction between adult and child, between members of fighting forces and civilians. Police said the magazine Rashid was developing ""could be described as a sort of e-toolkit for would-be lone-wolf attackers"" and that he was a ""prolific and dangerous individual"". Ch Supt Will Chatterton, from Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said: ""Rashid had spent the past 18 months locked away in a bedroom of his parents' house where he had made links with known Isis members and spent hours making online posters and propaganda encouraging would-be terrorists to carry out the most gruesome attacks."" Mr Chatterton said detectives believed Rashid was ""days away"" from travelling to Syria and are in no doubt that he would have continued to promote his ideology. He added: ""He will no longer be able to spread hate and encourage senseless harm and killing. Today the world is just that little bit safer."" The offences spanned from October 2016 to April this year. Two further charges of disseminating a terrorist publication were laid on file.

"Johnson & Johnson says the safety of its talcum powder is supported by decades of scientific evidence Johnson & Johnson has been ordered to pay $4.7bn (Â£3.6bn) in damages to 22 women who alleged that its talc products caused them to develop ovarian cancer. A jury in the US state of Missouri initially awarded $550m in compensation and added $4.1bn in punitive damages. The verdict comes as the pharmaceutical giant battles some 9,000 legal cases involving its signature baby powder. J&J said it was ""deeply disappointed"" and plans to appeal. In the six-week trial, the women and their families said they developed ovarian cancer after using baby powder and other talc products for decades. Of the 22 women represented in this case, six have died from ovarian cancer. Their lawyers alleged the company knew its talc was contaminated with asbestos since the 1970s but failed to warn consumers about the risks. Talc is a mineral and can sometimes be found in the ground in close proximity to asbestos. J&J denied that its products ever contained asbestos and insisted that they do not cause cancer. The pharmaceutical giant added that several studies have shown its talc to be safe and said the verdict was a product of a ""fundamentally unfair process"". The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioned a study of a variety of talc samples, including J&J, from 2009 to 2010. It found no asbestos in any of them. The prosecution lawyer told the Missouri court that the FDA and Johnson & Johnson had used flawed testing methods. Philippa Roxby, BBC health reporter There have been concerns for years that using talcum powder, particularly on the genitals, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer - but the evidence is not conclusive.The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc used on the genitals as ""possibly carcinogenic"",externalbecause of the mixed evidence. The mineral talc in its natural form does contain asbestos and does cause cancer, however, asbestos-free talc has been used in baby powder and other cosmetics since the 1970s. But the studies on asbestos-free talc give contradictory results. It has been linked to a cancer risk in some studies,,externalbut there are concerns that the research may be biased as they often rely on people remembering how much talc they used years ago.Other studies have argued there is no link at all,externalandthere is no link between talc in contraceptives,externalsuch as diaphragms and condoms (which would be close to the ovaries) and cancer. Also there does not seem to be a ""dose-response"" for talc, unlike carcinogens like tobacco for example, where the more you smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer. The charityOvacome says the evidence for a link is weak,externalbut even if talc does increase the risk of ovarian cancer, studies suggest it would be only by around a third. It stresses this is a small increase in risk and, because ovarian cancer is a relatively rare disease, the increase in risk is small too. Also, ovarian cancer risk is affected by many different factors - inherited and environmental ones - not just talc alone. The charity adds: ""So even if talc does increase the risk slightly, very few women who use talc will ever get ovarian cancer. Also, if someone has ovarian cancer and used talc, it seems unlikely that using talc was the reason they developed the cancer."" The verdict is the largest payout J&J has faced over the allegations. Punitive damages are often reduced by the trial judge or on appeal, and J&J has succeeded in having several jury verdicts overturned, some of them on technical grounds. A previous ruling in 2017 by a California jury awarded $417m (Â£323.4m)to a woman who said she developed ovarian cancer after using the firm's products, including baby powder. However, a judge later overturned that verdict and several other legal challenges by J&J are yet to be decided. The majority of the 22 women were from outside the state of Missouri.

"N Logeswari died after she was forced to jump off a building as part of a safety drill Indian police have arrested a training instructor in the southern state of Tamil Nadu after a 19-year-old college student died in a safety exercise. Police said N Logeshwari died after she was forced to jump off a building into a safety net held by fellow students. They say the instructor pushed her as she was reluctant to jump. She suffered injuries after hitting the roof of the first floor. Police have also registered a case against the college. ""The college didn't apply for permission for any such training. This is against the law. Any school or college has to get prior permission from the government before conducting an exercise like this. Police are investigating the issue and the trainer has been arrested,"" senior government official Hariharan told BBC Tamil.

"It is the deadliest militant attack in Pakistan since 2014 A suicide bomber has killed at least 128 people at a campaign rally in south-western Pakistan - the deadliest attack in the country since 2014. A local candidate was among the dead in the Mastung town, police say. So-called Islamic State (IS) claimed the attack. Earlier, a bomb attack on a similar rally in the northern town of Bannu killed four people. The attacks come ahead of general elections on 25 July. Meanwhile, former PM Nawaz Sharif was arrested after flying home from the UK. Sharif and his daughter Maryam were taken into custody by officials from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) after landing in the northern city of Lahore. They were then put on a chartered plane bound for Pakistan's capital Islamabad. They were later transferred to a local prison. The three-term PM was ousted last year after a corruption investigation. Last week he was sentenced in absentia to 10 years in prison. He has accused Pakistan's powerful security establishment of conspiring against him ahead of the elections. The assault on Pakistan media ahead of vote Bhutto seeks 'progressive Pakistan' votes Imran Khan in 'new Pakistan' vote pitch More than 150 people were injured in Mastung, officials say. The bomb was detonated inside a crowded compound in Mastung Among those killed was Baluchistan provincial assembly candidate Siraj Raisani, his family said. He was a candidate for the Balochistan Awami party. Local officials say the attacker detonated a bomb inside a crowded compound where the campaign rally was being held. ""Human remains and red bloody pieces of flesh were littered everywhere in the compound,"" local journalist Attah Ullah was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. ""Injured people were crying in pain and fear,"" the journalist said. IS militants later used their news outlet to claim the group carried out the attack. IS has carried out a number of attacks in the region bordering Afghanistan in recent years. However, security has improved since the military managed to clear large swathes of territory. Friday's bombing was the deadliest attack sincemilitants from the Pakistani Taliban assaulted an army-run school in Peshawar in December 2014, killing 141 people, 132 of them children. Earlier in the day, a campaign convoy of another candidate was attacked in Bannu. Akram Khan Durrani, who represents the MMA party, was unhurt, officials say. No group has so far claimed responsibility for that attack. By BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad These attacks are unexpected as they come amid claims by the army that militants have been cleared from Pakistan's western regions on the Afghan border, which have become a sanctuary for the Taliban. Before the 2013 elections, militants had issued early warnings, resulting in a muted campaign by targeted secular parties. Those parties lost the poll by wide margins. Those same parties and groups appear to be targets again. These latest attacks may also trigger a new set of tensions ahead of an election already marred by controversy. Significantly, the attacks come in the aftermath of the conviction of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by an anti-corruption court. Friday's attacks came just hours before Sharif flew in from the UK to Lahore, and the city is under a lockdown ordered by authorities to prevent his supporters from staging a huge welcome for him. On Tuesday, a suicide bomber hit a campaign gathering in the northern city of Peshawar, killing 22 people - including a provincial candidate. The Pakistani Taliban said it had carried out that attack. Tensions across Pakistan have been rising ahead of the former prime minister's arrival in Lahore. Clashes are reported to have broken out between Sharif supporters and security forces at the main highway entry-point to the city. Nawaz Sharif has been arrested after flying home from the UK Thousands of police officers were earlier deployed and shipping containers placed on some main roads. On Thursday, Sharif's PML-N party said hundreds of activists in Lahore had been detained ahead of Sharif's return. Sharif's lawyers hope that his return to Pakistan will enable him to file an appeal against his conviction. Nawaz Sharif: Three-time PM A war of nerves between Pakistan's military and Sharif Voters will elect candidates for the 342-seat Pakistan National Assembly The main parties are Nawaz Sharif's PML-N, former cricketer Imran Khan's PTI and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's PPP It will mark the second time that one civilian government has handed power to another after serving a full term The run-up to the vote has been marred by what observers say is a crackdown on political activists, journalists and critics of the powerful military More than 371,000 troops will be deployed to protect the election and ensure it is ""free and fair"", the army says Pakistan's king of comebacks looks set to win again Pakistan ex-PM given 10-year jail term A war of nerves between Pakistan's military and Sharif The assault on Pakistan media ahead of vote LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"The US Department of Justice has charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democratic officials in the 2016 US elections. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the dozen accused used spear phishing emails and malicious software. He said the hackers also stole data on half a million voters from a state election board website. The Kremlin said there was no evidence linking the 12 to military intelligence or hacking. The claims were ""an old duck"" and a ""heap of conspiracy schemes"", said Moscow's foreign ministry in a statement. Friday's indictment was the first by US officials to directly charge Russia's government with meddling in the US vote two years ago. Four intriguing lines in Mueller charges Who's who in Russia-Trump drama? The 11-count indictment names,externalthe Russians defendants, alleging they began cyber-attacks in March 2016 on the email accounts of staff for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Mr Rosenstein said the defendants corresponded with several Americans during the alleged conspiracy, but added there is no allegation that any US citizen committed a crime. The deputy attorney general said the conspirators used fictitious online personas, including ""DCLeaks"" and ""Guccifer 2.0"", to release thousands of stolen emails beginning in June 2016. They also plotted to hack into the computers of state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and voter software, according to the indictment. Mr Rosenstein said: ""We know that the goal of the conspirators was to have an impact on the election."" The deputy attorney general said all 12 defendants were in the Russian intelligence service, the GRU. A guide to US legalese All you need to know about Mueller inquiry The DNC leak showed that top Democrats preferred Mrs Clinton for the presidential nomination, which confirmed the worst fears among supporters of her liberal challenger, Bernie Sanders. Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's emails were also hacked, which contained details of infighting and aides' disparaging remarks about Mrs Clinton. 18 revelations from Wikileaks emails Why US fears Russia is hacking election Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News If the Russian military had dropped a bomb on the headquarters of a US political party, it would be an act of war. Same if it had launched a missile at the home of the chair of a US presidential campaign. This isn't what happened, of course, but make no mistake, what the US Department of Justice is alleging - a cyber-attack by Russian military officers against a US political party and its leaders - is, or at least should be, equally inflammatory. The wreckage of what Robert Mueller's team says were Russian strikes on the US can be measured in damaged reputations and disrupted politics. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein denies that Friday's announcement had anything to do with Donald Trump's upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin - but they will cast a shadow over the summit nevertheless. After days of sharply criticising US allies, the world will closely watch how the president handles allegations of ""virtual"" warfare against the US when he sits down with the man whose military is accused of being behind it all. President Donald Trump was briefed about the indictments earlier in the week. He is currently in the UK, from where he once again dismissed the investigation as a ""rigged witch hunt"". During a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, Mr Trump also said the Russia collusion allegations dogging his presidency were ""pure stupidity"". Next week he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki, Finland. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has urged the president to cancel that meeting, in light of the indictment. This video can not be played Putin laughs at political chaos in US Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating US intelligence findings that Russians conspired to tilt the election in Mr Trump's favour, and whether any of his campaign aides colluded. As of Friday, the inquiry has indicted 32 people - mostly Russian nationals in absentia - as well as three companies and four former Trump advisers. None of the charges allege Trump advisers colluded with Russia to interfere with the presidential campaign. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser, have pleaded guilty to making false statements about their contacts with Russians. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates were charged with money laundering relating to their political consultancy work in Ukraine.

"Luka Modric (left) was on the losing side in the final but claimed player of the tournament Luka Modric was the player of the tournament, Harry Kane bagged the most goals, Thibaut Courtois had the safest hands and Kylian Mbappe was the breakthrough star. But did they impress you more than Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi? Were you blown away by their performances? With captivating games, superb individual performances and huge shocks, Russia 2018 was a classic. You supported the underdogs, praised the superstars and were unimpressed with the champions. Here are the players you rated most highly in Russia... Where are all the France players?! France may have won the World Cup, but no member of Didier Deschamps' squad made it into the Player Rater team of the tournament, which is compiled from the highest-rated player in each position to have made at least four appearances in Russia. We selected theteam of the group stagelast month but once the knockout rounds were taken into account the final XI sprung a few surprises. England wing-back Kieran Trippier (7.19) starts in defence alongside Uruguay's Diego Godin (6.84) and Japanese pair Maya Yoshida (6.77) and Yuto Nagatomo (6.79). This video can not be played 'Pinpoint' Trippier free-kick gives England early lead Former Tottenham playmaker Luka Modric (7.17) may have thought thatCroatia were ""underestimated"" by English journalistsbut the BBC Sport audience selected the Golden Ball winner alongside Spain's Isco (7.17) and Belgium's Kevin de Bruyne (6.90). Up front, Golden Boot winner Kane slipped out of the side after failing to score in England's last three games, meaning that Mexico's Javier Hernandez is the surprise selection to lead the line (7.11). He is flanked by compatriot Hirving Lozano (7.37) and Belgium's Eden Hazard (7.35). There was better news for Kane, though. He received more ratings of 10 than any other player in the tournament - 47,000 in total. This is 10,000 more than his nearest rival, team-mate and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford. He wasn't in the running for the Golden Ball award for the best player in the tournament but Tottenham forward Son Heung-min actually boasts the highest average rating of all players to have appeared in three or more games at the World Cup. Beating Germany seems to have carried a premium in your eyes - with all 14 South Korea players who appearedin the 2-0 winscoring over eight for that match. This video can not be played Where's Neuer gone? South Korea score second as keeper goes AWOL Japanese pair Keisuke Honda and Shinji Kagawa are also surprisingly high in the list, with both scoring highly against Colombia and in the defeat by Belgium. Completing the five are Lozano and Andre Carrillo, with the former Watford winger impressing for Peru throughout the group stage. With four goals in the tournament and one in the final, it's perhaps a surprise not to see France 19-year-old Kylian Mbappe make the first XI. The Paris St-Germain forward was marked down for his 12-minute appearance as a late substitute in the dire goalless draw with Denmark - his display gave him a score of just 3.61. How bad can you be in 12 minutes? This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Kylian Mbappe goal stretches lead However, his two-goal showing against Argentina in the last 16 gave him a score of 9.07 - the highest individual rating of the tournament and the only player to end a game with a score of over nine. South Korean goalkeeper Cho Hyun-woo was second for his display in that famous Germany victory, with Son in third place. Kane clocked 8.63 for his hat-trick against Panama, while Uruguay's Edinson Cavani earns a place on the leaderboard after scoring twice to beat Portugal. Other players to register scores over eight in matches include Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Halldorsson - when he saved a penalty from Lionel Messi, Modric, Isco and De Bruyne. Trippier was the only England player to make the team of the tournament and the only one to end the World Cup with an average of more than seven. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the players' scores dipped as England went on in the tournament. Congratulations to anyone who would have predicted that top five just a few months ago... Kane scored six times but misses out after a dismal rating of 3.16 in the play-off with Belgium but his score of 8.63 against Panama was the highest individual rating for an England player. Read more about England's ratings here This video can not be played World Cup 2018: The good, the bad, and the Neymar Russia 2018 was not the World Cup for the big names as Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar all failed to reach the semi-finals. Ronaldo did score a hat-trick in his opening game against Spain but ended the tournament with an average rating of 6.12, a score which ranked him 187th of all players in Russia to card a score. His foe and rival Messi only recorded an average of score of 5.25, including a bad day at the office with a 3.9 against Croatia in the group stage. He ended down in 426th place. And PSG forward Neymar really didn't impress you. The Brazil forward scored twice but only managed an average score of 4.47 - which left him the 542nd player on the list and below Panama's Armando Cooper. The lowest-ranked player to play more than once was Germany's midfielder Sami Khedira with 3.19. His score of 2.25 against South Korea was the lowest score awarded - though 13 Germany players scored lower than three in that match. South Korean full-back Ko Yo-han had perhaps the most remarkable World Cup from a statistical point of view. His only appearance was an 11-minute substitute cameo in the win against Germany, during which he touched the ball five times. He scored 8.37 to rank number one in the ratings of all players to have featured in that game. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Paul Pogba's curling shot puts France 3-1 up against Croatia France were champions but you didn't rate them too highly. Mbappe was the best rated player of Didier Deschamps' side, ending the tournament with an average score of 6.54, just 0.01 ahead of Manchester United's Paul Pogba. Sixteen of the squad averaged under six throughout the tournament, with Chelsea forward Olivier Giroud averaging 5.53 despite not having a single shot on target in the whole World Cup. How did the players rate in the final? We also gave you the chance to select your team of the tournament via our team selector. Unsurprisingly, more of the established superstars made the cut, although there is some crossover with the Player Rater. Modric was the most selected player, with 141,378 of the 180,000 people who took part (that's 79%) picking him in midfield. Hazard, De Bruyne and Trippier also make the cut. However, winners France are represented this time around, with defenders Raphael Varane and Benjamin Pavard, midfielder N'Golo Kante and forward Mbappe, who received the second most picks, all amongst the most selected.

"There aren't as many of these little green things as there normally are at this time of year UK pea growers are warning of shortages in supplies following the recent hot weather. Growers say the heat and lack of rain means peas are struggling to form in their pods and that crops will be 20-30% below normal levels. The pea crop is the latest casualty of the summer's unusual weather. Last month, lettuce growers warned of shortages. The UK is importing 30% of its lettuces, whereas normally it is self sufficient at this time of year. The UK is the biggest consumer of peas per head in Europe, and it is also the biggest producer of peas for freezing. Ian Keyes, director of Yorkshire-based Swaythorpe Growers - one of the biggest growers in the UK, said levels were ""dropping dramatically"". ""Each pea plant is currently yielding between three and four pods - rather than the six to seven usually seen. It's a combination of drought and heat, and peas are not standing up to that very well."" Despite being the biggest producer, the UK's demand for peas means it also imports them. Mr Keyes warned that the shortage in the UK coupled with problems in other countries would see prices could rise: ""We're very worried as an industry. For the first time we won't be able to make up the shortfall from elsewhere. ""Spain and Portugal had a poor harvest, while Hungary's was poor and Poland's a complete write-off. Those normal sources of extra supply are simply not there. There will inevitably be some price increase."" Life for the lettuce, however, has improved, says Dieter Lloyd, from the British Leafy Salad Growers Association (BLSGA): ""The temperature has dropped, which is a lovely thing for a lettuce."" Mr Lloyd said that lettuce supply had been squeezed by rising demand, which perks up as the heat rises, and production difficulties because of that same heat. He said: ""When the temperature is around 22 degrees, demand rises by about 10-20%, but when it reaches 28 degrees, as it was at the beginning of the month, demand rises by about 40%."" However, he said that the UK was still having to import lettuces from Spain, Germany and Poland, whereas normally at this time of year the UK was normally pretty much self-sufficient. Mr Lloyd said prices may rise: ""There is an impact on price - it hasn't fed through to retail prices as yet - but we are anticipating this. Wholesale prices are already up by about 20-30%."" He also warned that shortages could affect other crops, such as celery, onions, carrots, broccoli and cauliflower, which are also being affected by high temperatures.

"This video can not be played Tory MP: Tell Trump 'where to stick his dog whistle' Donald Trump's criticism of Theresa May's Brexit strategy has sparked a backlash from UK politicians - including some government ministers. The US President said the PM's plan would ""probably kill"" a UK-US trade deal. He also said Boris Johnson would make a ""great prime minister"". Some Tories are furious at his ""deeply insulting"" remarks, but backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg thought what he said was ""perfectly reasonable"". Live: The latest on Trump's visit Trump: Brexit plan could kill US trade deal Mayor 'refuses to rise' to Trump feud Plan 'delivers the Brexit UK voted for' Foreign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan said he did not think Mr Trump's remarks were rude. ""Donald Trump is in many ways a controversialist,"" he told the BBC. ""That's his style, that's the colour that he brings to the world stage."" But another Conservative minister, Sam Gyimah, whose brief covers universities and skills, did not agree, questioning the president's manners: Allow Twitter content?

Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said Mr Trump had been ""deeply insulting"" and criticised his ""dog whistle politics about immigration"". ""And though of course Theresa May will continue to extend a very polite welcome to him in his capacity as president of the United States, I think she should pretty much tell him where he can stick his dog whistle,"" she told the BBC. In hisinterview,externalwith The Sun, the US president said immigration had ""changed the fabric of Europe"", adding that ""unless you act very quickly, it's never going to be what it was and I don't mean that in a positive way"". He added: ""I think you are losing your culture. Look around. You go through certain areas that didn't exist 10 or 15 years ago."" Ms Wollaston also accused the president of a ""bullying approach"", with ""infantilising imagery"" of holding Theresa May's hand, saying the prime minister had shown ""great statesmanship"" in response. Another Tory MP, Anna Soubry, said the president ""diminishes the standing of the great country he is meant to lead"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Chancellor Philip Hammond was optimistic, saying the US president had been ""nodding furiously"" while Mrs May was speaking during Thursday night's dinner with Blenheim Palace and had yet to talk to her about the plans, which were published on Thursday ina White Paper,external. ""I know she's looking forward to the opportunity to discuss with the president how we can take forward the big opportunities for increasing trade and investment between the UK and the United States that she mentioned last night during the dinner at Blenheim,"" he told reporters in Brussels, where he is attending a finance ministers' meeting. But opposition parties reacted scathingly to Mr Trump's intervention. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry accused the President of ""childish behaviour of the worst sort"". She said she felt sorry for Mrs May, adding: ""Donald Trump ought to have listened to his mother. I am assuming that his mum told him that when you go to someone's house you do not insult the host."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the US president ""now chooses our leaders"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But influential Conservative backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, who opposes Mrs May's plan for post-Brexit trade with the EU, said many Conservative MPs shared his view. ""The UK wants to do a trade deal with Donald Trump, and he said if you want to do a trade deal with the United States this isn't the way to do it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""That's a matter of US foreign policy."" He said it was different to when former US president Barack Obama tried to help the Remain campaign during the 2016 EU referendum campaign bysaying the UK would be at the ""back of the queue""for a trade deal with the US if left the EU. Mr Trump's predecessor had ""interfered"" in a UK election, said Mr Rees-Mogg. Another Eurosceptic Conservative MP, Nigel Evans, told the BBC the US president ""loves our country"".

"Thousands of protesters fill Trafalgar Square to protest against Donald Trump Tens of thousands of protesters filled central London's streets on Friday to tell US President Donald Trump what they thought of his visit to the UK. Rather than a red carpet, there was a sea of people, as two large marches took place - one led by Women's March London and another by the Stop Trump Coalition. The crowds had strong messages for the president - from their problems with his policies to hair styling tips. They were determined to make their voices heard, or at least create a lot of noise to make their point - that they did not want President Trump in the country. But why did they reject a visit from the leader of the world's last superpower and one of the UK's closest allies?

Sarah Holbrook brought her sign from home in Hampshire It was also the first time for 52-year-old Martine Crowther, who felt it was her duty to join the protest.

The first was that if Prime Minister Theresa May went ahead with her Brexit plan as hammered out at Chequers last week (and which led to the resignations of two cabinet ministers), then it would ""kill"" a trade deal with the US.

"Well. However she did it, Theresa May managed to roll Donald Trump back from the outright and overt criticism of her, and her most important policy, before their press conference today. Rather in the manner of a boss telling staff who'd been caught bunking off that they would work extra hours, almost the first words out of the prime minister's mouth were that he did actually agree that the UK and the US would sign a trade deal after Brexit, and enthusiastically so. The president was not quite so effusive in his statements and betrayed frankly what many members of the public feel about the government's Brexit plans - ""I don't know what they're going to do but whatever you do is ok with me"". LIVE: Latest updates on Donald Trump's UK visit But he did, it seemed obediently, crank out the prepared line from his notes that the US was committed to doing a deal. Between now and next March you can bet you'll hear those remarks used as evidence by the prime minister of the UK's exciting future outside the EU again, and again, and again, oh and again. I'm sure you can picture the scene - whether an MP or a journalist asks, 'Prime Minister, this deal means it will be hard to do other trade deals', 'Donald Trump said the contrary, that the US was committed to work to seize the opportunities with a comprehensive deal'. That doesn't mean that's what will happen. Off script the president's doubts were pretty clear that for a trade deal to work the UK can't sign up to many restrictions. And while she denied it today, the prime minister and her colleagues well know that agreeing the 'common rule book' as we've discussed so much in the last week or so, does make the UK a less attractive trade partner for other countries. Indeed in officialese the government's own documents acknowledge as much. It is a decision that she has taken, that Donald Trump might not like much, but she has taken it for a reason. For the choreography of today though to be just awkward, not downright cringeworthy, it was important for Number 10 to pull Donald Trump back from his previous statements. He, true to form, tried to pretend that he hadn't really said what he said, even though his remarks were made on the record. 'Fake news', it was not. That is important to understand, because it means that the difficulties between our two countries over a tighter trading relationship have not disappeared. And for Theresa May, the bigger problem is that many in her party agree with him, not his world view, but the fact that her Brexit compromise could cut off some of what Leavers saw as the greatest possibilities of leaving the EU. This was a difficult day for the PM for sure, but not a disaster. But at a time when she desperately needs friends and allies, the American president is not necessarily one upon whom she can totally rely.

"This video can not be played Husnain Rashid appeared to collapse as he was arrested at his home An Islamic State group supporter who called for an attack on Prince George has been jailed for life with a minimum of 25 years. Husnain Rashid, 32, of Leonard Street in Nelson, Lancashire, also posted messages threatening people travelling to the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia. Judge Andrew Lees said Rashid made it clear the prince ""and other members of the Royal family should be viewed as potential targets"". Rashid admitted four terrorism charges. Rashid brought his trial at Woolwich Crown Court to a halt in May after two weeks of evidence with a dramatic change of plea at the end of the prosecution opening. The court previously heard Rashid posted a photograph on a Telegram chat group of the prince at his school, super-imposed with silhouettes of two masked jihad fighters. Husnain Rashid had had admitted four terrorism charges Sentencing Rashid, Judge Andrew Lees said: ""The message was clear - you were providing the name and address of Prince George's school, an image of Prince George's school and the instruction or threat that Prince George and other members of the Royal family should be viewed as potential targets."" The judge added: ""You provided what you regarded as inspiration for suitable targets for lone wolf terror attacks. ""Attacks in Western countries were in your eyes the only suitable acceptable alternative to jihad itself."" Husnain Rashid shared Prince George's photograph in tips for would-be attackers Rashid's trial heard that on 13 October he called on supporters via Telegram to target the four-year-old Prince George, who had started school at Thomas's Battersea in south-west London a month earlier. He also posted suggestions of which British football stadiums terrorists could strike following the deadly attack outside Besiktas's ground in Turkey, and plotted to inject supermarket ice cream with poison. Rashid was given a life sentence for each of three counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. He also previously admitted one count of encouraging terrorism and was sentenced to four-and-half years imprisonment, to run concurrently. Husnain Rashid changed his plea almost two weeks into his trial A magazine Rashid was producing contained suggestions to strike the 2018 World Cup in Russia with vehicles, weapons or bombs, his trial heard. Rashid, who is said to have taught at the Muhammadi mosque, ran a ""prolific"" Telegram channel named the Lone Mujahid where he provided an ""e-toolkit for terrorism"", the prosecution said. This allegedly included a recipe for the poison ricin from the Islamist propaganda magazine Inspire, how to make Molotov cocktails and napalm. His list of targets included British Army bases, shopping centres, Jewish communities and government buildings. He also suggested he planned to flee to Syria to fight for IS. Judge Lees said Rashid's plans were ""indiscriminate"" and made no distinction between adult and child, between members of fighting forces and civilians. Police said the magazine Rashid was developing ""could be described as a sort of e-toolkit for would-be lone-wolf attackers"" and that he was a ""prolific and dangerous individual"". Ch Supt Will Chatterton, from Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said: ""Rashid had spent the past 18 months locked away in a bedroom of his parents' house where he had made links with known Isis members and spent hours making online posters and propaganda encouraging would-be terrorists to carry out the most gruesome attacks."" Mr Chatterton said detectives believed Rashid was ""days away"" from travelling to Syria and are in no doubt that he would have continued to promote his ideology. He added: ""He will no longer be able to spread hate and encourage senseless harm and killing. Today the world is just that little bit safer."" The offences spanned from October 2016 to April this year. Two further charges of disseminating a terrorist publication were laid on file.

"Mr Schnatter will no longer appear on Papa John's pizza boxes and other marketing material Papa John's founder John Schnatter will be removed from the pizza chain's branding after his use of the N-word forced his exit from the company. Mr Schnatter, the company's former chairman, had used the racial slur in a conference call in May. A Papa John's spokesperson confirmed to the BBC that it will erase its founder's image from all advertising. Mr Schnatter quit as chief executive last year aftercriticising the NFLover players' national anthem protests. Shares in Papa John's were up more than 3.1% on Friday following the news of the branding overhaul, improving further on the gains made after it was announced that Mr Schnatter was departing as chairman. In a statement on Wednesday, the company said it condemned ""racism and any insensitive language"". The pizza chain later said it had accepted Mr Schnatter's resignation and that a new chairman would be appointed in the coming weeks. Mr Schnatter's resignation as chairman was announced earlier this week Papa John's is the world's third-largest pizza chain, with more than 350 outlets in the UK and 4,900 restaurants worldwide. The slur occurred during a media training conference call in May between top staff at Papa John's and a marketing agency called Laundry Service. According to Forbes,external, the call involved a role-playing exercise that was supposed to give Mr Schnatter experience in dealing with difficult issues. When discussing how he would distance himself from racist groups, Mr Schnatter said that Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC, had never faced criticism for using the N-word, Forbes reported.

"The US Department of Justice has charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democratic officials in the 2016 US elections. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the dozen accused used spear phishing emails and malicious software. He said the hackers also stole data on half a million voters from a state election board website. The Kremlin said there was no evidence linking the 12 to military intelligence or hacking. The claims were ""an old duck"" and a ""heap of conspiracy schemes"", said Moscow's foreign ministry in a statement. Friday's indictment was the first by US officials to directly charge Russia's government with meddling in the US vote two years ago. Four intriguing lines in Mueller charges Who's who in Russia-Trump drama? The 11-count indictment names,externalthe Russians defendants, alleging they began cyber-attacks in March 2016 on the email accounts of staff for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Mr Rosenstein said the defendants corresponded with several Americans during the alleged conspiracy, but added there is no allegation that any US citizen committed a crime. The deputy attorney general said the conspirators used fictitious online personas, including ""DCLeaks"" and ""Guccifer 2.0"", to release thousands of stolen emails beginning in June 2016. They also plotted to hack into the computers of state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and voter software, according to the indictment. Mr Rosenstein said: ""We know that the goal of the conspirators was to have an impact on the election."" The deputy attorney general said all 12 defendants were in the Russian intelligence service, the GRU. A guide to US legalese All you need to know about Mueller inquiry The DNC leak showed that top Democrats preferred Mrs Clinton for the presidential nomination, which confirmed the worst fears among supporters of her liberal challenger, Bernie Sanders. Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's emails were also hacked, which contained details of infighting and aides' disparaging remarks about Mrs Clinton. 18 revelations from Wikileaks emails Why US fears Russia is hacking election Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News If the Russian military had dropped a bomb on the headquarters of a US political party, it would be an act of war. Same if it had launched a missile at the home of the chair of a US presidential campaign. This isn't what happened, of course, but make no mistake, what the US Department of Justice is alleging - a cyber-attack by Russian military officers against a US political party and its leaders - is, or at least should be, equally inflammatory. The wreckage of what Robert Mueller's team says were Russian strikes on the US can be measured in damaged reputations and disrupted politics. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein denies that Friday's announcement had anything to do with Donald Trump's upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin - but they will cast a shadow over the summit nevertheless. After days of sharply criticising US allies, the world will closely watch how the president handles allegations of ""virtual"" warfare against the US when he sits down with the man whose military is accused of being behind it all. President Donald Trump was briefed about the indictments earlier in the week. He is currently in the UK, from where he once again dismissed the investigation as a ""rigged witch hunt"". During a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, Mr Trump also said the Russia collusion allegations dogging his presidency were ""pure stupidity"". Next week he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki, Finland. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has urged the president to cancel that meeting, in light of the indictment. This video can not be played Putin laughs at political chaos in US Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating US intelligence findings that Russians conspired to tilt the election in Mr Trump's favour, and whether any of his campaign aides colluded. As of Friday, the inquiry has indicted 32 people - mostly Russian nationals in absentia - as well as three companies and four former Trump advisers. None of the charges allege Trump advisers colluded with Russia to interfere with the presidential campaign. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser, have pleaded guilty to making false statements about their contacts with Russians. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates were charged with money laundering relating to their political consultancy work in Ukraine.

"To say it was a sub-optimal start to a news conference would be an understatement. In fact a huge British understatement. In fact, frankly ridiculous. Overnight, Donald Trump had given an interview to the Sun newspaper in which, given the febrile state of UK politics, contained three utterly deadly quotes. The first was that if Prime Minister Theresa May went ahead with her Brexit plan as hammered out at Chequers last week (and which led to the resignations of two cabinet ministers), then it would ""kill"" a trade deal with the US. The second zinger from the president ahead of his joint news conference was that May hadn't listened to him over how to negotiate Brexit with the EU. ""She didn't listen. No, I told her how to do it,""he told the Sun,external. And the final killer quote concerned one of those cabinet ministers who walked - Britain's blond bombshell Boris Johnson, who has long coveted the top job. The US president said he would make a very good prime minister. Ouch! Can you imagine how that made Mrs May wince? When Barack Obama came to the UK just before the EU referendum, he faced the sternest criticism over his comments that Britain would go to the back of the queue on any future trade deal if it left the EU. Mr Obama was doing that to help David Cameron. Mr Trump's intervention seemed designed to undermine the prime minister. That's quite something. What has Trump said about your country? So what would unfold when the two of them emerged onto the parched Buckinghamshire lawn at Chequers to face the press? Would Mrs May summon upher inner Hugh Grant from the film Love Actually,externaland tell the US leader that there was something terribly wrong with the special relationship? Or would she, the vicar's daughter, be much more polite and accommodating, and not dare to contradict her occasionally bullying guest? No such ""back off, Mr President"" rant from the real prime minister Well in the end she didn't have to make a choice. The US president seemed to have discovered a reverse thrust button inside his suit. ""No trade deal? We'll go along with whatever you decide. We just want to keep on trading. Not listen to my advice? Well maybe she will, and listen - this Brexit thing is a really tough deal. ""Boris? Sure, I think he would make a good prime minister, but I think Theresa is fantastic. Superb. A wonderful woman. I really got to know her last night. I felt sorry for the other people at our table. We just spoke to each other."" It was the sort of thing that leads teenagers to use the word ""euwww"". The challenges ahead for a UK/US trade deal after Brexit In Pictures: Trump's UK visit and protests But then he went into rhetorical overdrive, turbo boosters firing, uttering the words that ALL British prime ministers love to hear. Special relationship? It was incredibly special. Specialer than a special thing. More precious than the most valuable jewel. It was one of the great wonders of the world. It was 11 out of 10 special. OK, I exaggerate a touch. But not by much. This video can not be played Do Trump and May hold hands every time? And then came something rarer than hens' teeth. President Trump conceded that he had apologised to the prime minister over that Sun interview. I thought I'd misheard that bit of the news conference. It was like watching the Wacky Races. The car comes crashing off the road but somehow it splutters on, with the engine dragging along the ground, exhaust pipe belching black fumes, bodywork crumpled. At this news conference they got the wheels back on track, as Dick Dastardly and Penelope Pitstop smiled sweetly at each other.

"This video can not be played Trump on Brexit story 'fake news' US President Donald Trump insisted he did not criticise Theresa May in the interview that dominated the build-up to the two leaders' press conference. Mr Trump has sparked a backlash from UK politicians after telling The Sun the PM's Brexit plan would ""probably kill"" a UK-US trade deal. He also said Boris Johnson would make a ""great prime minister"". But after talks with Mrs May he claimed ""tremendous things"" he said about her had been left out of the Sun story. Live: Latest on Trump's visit to the UK UK MPs' anger at Trump's Brexit comments Trump: US-UK relationship indispensible He said the paper's story was ""generally fine"", but ""it didn't put in what I said about the prime minister, and I said tremendous things"". ""Fortunately, we tend to record stories now so we have it for your enjoyment if you'd like it,"" he said. ""We record when we deal with reporters, it's called fake news and we solve a lot of problems with the good old recording instrument."" The Sun'swrite-up,externalof its interview, which was recorded, quoted him describing her as a ""nice person"" and saying they get along ""very nicely"". This video can not be played Trump rows back on Sun 'fake news' claim Later in the press conference at the prime minister's country residence, Chequers, Mr Trump verbally sparred with the Sun reporter who had interviewed him, Tom Newton Dunn. Mr Newton Dunn told the president that his positive remarks about Mrs May had been included in the story. ""If you reported them that's good,"" Mr Trump told the political correspondent. ""Thank you very much for saying that."" He added: ""I didn't think they put it in, but that's all right. ""They didn't put it in the headline, I wish they put that in the headline, that's one of those things."" The Sun's Tom Newton Dunn told the US president his compliments about Theresa May had been included On Mrs May's reaction, he added: ""She's a total professional because when I saw her this morning I said 'I want to apologise because I said such good things about you'. ""She said: 'Don't worry it's only the press.' I thought that was very professional."" During the press conference, Mr Trump - who regularly accuses the US media of ""fake news"" over its coverage of him - also clashed with a reporter from the American NBC network, describing it as ""possibly worse than CNN"". He also refused to take a question from CNN, saying: ""CNN is fake news, I don't take questions from fake news. Let's take a question from a real network."" He then took a question from Fox News regarding his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Responding to Mr Trump's comments about The Sun, a spokesman for the newspaper said: ""We stand by our reporting and the quotes we used - including those where the president was positive about the prime minister, in both the paper and in our audio - and we're delighted that the president essentially retracted his original charge against the paper later in the press conference. ""To say the president called us 'fake news' with any serious intent is, well... fake news.""

"The US Department of Justice has charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democratic officials in the 2016 US elections. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the dozen accused used spear phishing emails and malicious software. He said the hackers also stole data on half a million voters from a state election board website. The Kremlin said there was no evidence linking the 12 to military intelligence or hacking. The claims were ""an old duck"" and a ""heap of conspiracy schemes"", said Moscow's foreign ministry in a statement. Friday's indictment was the first by US officials to directly charge Russia's government with meddling in the US vote two years ago. Four intriguing lines in Mueller charges Who's who in Russia-Trump drama? The 11-count indictment names,externalthe Russians defendants, alleging they began cyber-attacks in March 2016 on the email accounts of staff for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Mr Rosenstein said the defendants corresponded with several Americans during the alleged conspiracy, but added there is no allegation that any US citizen committed a crime. The deputy attorney general said the conspirators used fictitious online personas, including ""DCLeaks"" and ""Guccifer 2.0"", to release thousands of stolen emails beginning in June 2016. They also plotted to hack into the computers of state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and voter software, according to the indictment. Mr Rosenstein said: ""We know that the goal of the conspirators was to have an impact on the election."" The deputy attorney general said all 12 defendants were in the Russian intelligence service, the GRU. A guide to US legalese All you need to know about Mueller inquiry The DNC leak showed that top Democrats preferred Mrs Clinton for the presidential nomination, which confirmed the worst fears among supporters of her liberal challenger, Bernie Sanders. Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's emails were also hacked, which contained details of infighting and aides' disparaging remarks about Mrs Clinton. 18 revelations from Wikileaks emails Why US fears Russia is hacking election Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News If the Russian military had dropped a bomb on the headquarters of a US political party, it would be an act of war. Same if it had launched a missile at the home of the chair of a US presidential campaign. This isn't what happened, of course, but make no mistake, what the US Department of Justice is alleging - a cyber-attack by Russian military officers against a US political party and its leaders - is, or at least should be, equally inflammatory. The wreckage of what Robert Mueller's team says were Russian strikes on the US can be measured in damaged reputations and disrupted politics. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein denies that Friday's announcement had anything to do with Donald Trump's upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin - but they will cast a shadow over the summit nevertheless. After days of sharply criticising US allies, the world will closely watch how the president handles allegations of ""virtual"" warfare against the US when he sits down with the man whose military is accused of being behind it all. President Donald Trump was briefed about the indictments earlier in the week. He is currently in the UK, from where he once again dismissed the investigation as a ""rigged witch hunt"". During a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, Mr Trump also said the Russia collusion allegations dogging his presidency were ""pure stupidity"". Next week he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki, Finland. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has urged the president to cancel that meeting, in light of the indictment. This video can not be played Putin laughs at political chaos in US Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating US intelligence findings that Russians conspired to tilt the election in Mr Trump's favour, and whether any of his campaign aides colluded. As of Friday, the inquiry has indicted 32 people - mostly Russian nationals in absentia - as well as three companies and four former Trump advisers. None of the charges allege Trump advisers colluded with Russia to interfere with the presidential campaign. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser, have pleaded guilty to making false statements about their contacts with Russians. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates were charged with money laundering relating to their political consultancy work in Ukraine.

"History teacher James Husband raped a 16-year-old girl A former teacher at a top independent school in West Sussex has been sentenced to 17 years in jail for a string of sex offences including rape. James Husband, 68, from York, was convicted of raping a 16-year-old pupil at Christ's Hospital School in Horsham. He was also found guilty at an earlier hearing at Hove Crown Court of five indecent assault charges on the girl. During the trial, the court heard Husband told the girl: ""It's OK, I've had a vasectomy,"" before raping her. Husband, of Wigginton, is the fifth Christ's Hospital School teacher to be convicted of sexually abusing students. Over the five cases, the sexual abuse at the school spanned more than 30 years and involved 22 victims. Judge Christine Henson, who placed Husband on the sex offenders register for life, said the victim had give ""harrowing"" evidence during the trial. The judge told him: ""You put yourself in the position of her mentor in order to make her feel special and dependent on you so you could do what you wanted sexually with her. ""She viewed you as a father figure, thus rendering the abuse of trust particularly acute."" The independent school charges fees of up to Â£31,500 a year In a victim impact statement read to the court, the woman said: ""The grooming process was devious and malignant. By making me feel special for the first time in my life, I became dependent on him for my own feeling of self worth."" She said Husband moulded her into his ""plaything"" and ""puppet"" so ""he could do what he wanted to me"". ""He twisted my mind to abuse my body and made my body feel dirty and degraded until I believed this to be true."" She said she had been left with a ""life sentence"" of anorexia, suicidal thoughts and self-harm and suffered from ""unbearable"" flashbacks. Although described by the prosecution as a ""great pupil capable of achieving great things"", she said she had failed to make the grades to take up a place at Cambridge University because she had been ""worn down"" by his abuse. Gary Dobbie is yet to be sentenced Husband's co-defendant and a former head of house at the school Gary Dobbie, 66, of  Rue De La Piale in Albi, France, was convicted of 15 counts involving multiple offences against six boys and two girls as young as 12. Dobbie, formerly of Hereford, was teaching at independent Shrewsbury School, in Shropshire, at the time of his arrest in 2016. He has yet to be sentenced. Jurors heard the abuse took place between 1990 and 2001 and that both men were friends and used to laugh together about their actions. After the hearing, Det Sgt Karrie Bohanna from Sussex Police said; ""The victims of Husband and Dobbie were mainly children who should have been able to feel safe whilst in the care of their teachers. ""Instead both Husband and Dobbie exploited their positions in order to groom and sexually abuse their victims."" An NSPCC spokesman said Husband ""used and abused his position of trust in the worst possible way"". He said: ""His jailing today will hopefully give some sort of closure to his victim and at the same time encourage other people in a similar position to come forward and report what has happened to them.""

"There aren't as many of these little green things as there normally are at this time of year UK pea growers are warning of shortages in supplies following the recent hot weather. Growers say the heat and lack of rain means peas are struggling to form in their pods and that crops will be 20-30% below normal levels. The pea crop is the latest casualty of the summer's unusual weather. Last month, lettuce growers warned of shortages. The UK is importing 30% of its lettuces, whereas normally it is self sufficient at this time of year. The UK is the biggest consumer of peas per head in Europe, and it is also the biggest producer of peas for freezing. Ian Keyes, director of Yorkshire-based Swaythorpe Growers - one of the biggest growers in the UK, said levels were ""dropping dramatically"". ""Each pea plant is currently yielding between three and four pods - rather than the six to seven usually seen. It's a combination of drought and heat, and peas are not standing up to that very well."" Despite being the biggest producer, the UK's demand for peas means it also imports them. Mr Keyes warned that the shortage in the UK coupled with problems in other countries would see prices could rise: ""We're very worried as an industry. For the first time we won't be able to make up the shortfall from elsewhere. ""Spain and Portugal had a poor harvest, while Hungary's was poor and Poland's a complete write-off. Those normal sources of extra supply are simply not there. There will inevitably be some price increase."" Life for the lettuce, however, has improved, says Dieter Lloyd, from the British Leafy Salad Growers Association (BLSGA): ""The temperature has dropped, which is a lovely thing for a lettuce."" Mr Lloyd said that lettuce supply had been squeezed by rising demand, which perks up as the heat rises, and production difficulties because of that same heat. He said: ""When the temperature is around 22 degrees, demand rises by about 10-20%, but when it reaches 28 degrees, as it was at the beginning of the month, demand rises by about 40%."" However, he said that the UK was still having to import lettuces from Spain, Germany and Poland, whereas normally at this time of year the UK was normally pretty much self-sufficient. Mr Lloyd said prices may rise: ""There is an impact on price - it hasn't fed through to retail prices as yet - but we are anticipating this. Wholesale prices are already up by about 20-30%."" He also warned that shortages could affect other crops, such as celery, onions, carrots, broccoli and cauliflower, which are also being affected by high temperatures.

"Mr Schnatter will no longer appear on Papa John's pizza boxes and other marketing material Papa John's founder John Schnatter will be removed from the pizza chain's branding after his use of the N-word forced his exit from the company. Mr Schnatter, the company's former chairman, had used the racial slur in a conference call in May. A Papa John's spokesperson confirmed to the BBC that it will erase its founder's image from all advertising. Mr Schnatter quit as chief executive last year aftercriticising the NFLover players' national anthem protests. Shares in Papa John's were up more than 3.1% on Friday following the news of the branding overhaul, improving further on the gains made after it was announced that Mr Schnatter was departing as chairman. In a statement on Wednesday, the company said it condemned ""racism and any insensitive language"". The pizza chain later said it had accepted Mr Schnatter's resignation and that a new chairman would be appointed in the coming weeks. Mr Schnatter's resignation as chairman was announced earlier this week Papa John's is the world's third-largest pizza chain, with more than 350 outlets in the UK and 4,900 restaurants worldwide. The slur occurred during a media training conference call in May between top staff at Papa John's and a marketing agency called Laundry Service. According to Forbes,external, the call involved a role-playing exercise that was supposed to give Mr Schnatter experience in dealing with difficult issues. When discussing how he would distance himself from racist groups, Mr Schnatter said that Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC, had never faced criticism for using the N-word, Forbes reported.

"Another 80 Poundworld stores will be closed, resulting in 1,024 job losses, the company's administrators have said. The latest announcement means that 105 of the company's 335 stores are now earmarked for closure. Poundworld went into administration last month after failing to cope with rising costs, fewer shoppers and greater competition. The company's administrators, Deloitte, said talks to sell remaining parts of the business continue. ""Whilst we remain hopeful that a sale for part, or parts, of the business can still happen, it has not been possible to sell the business as a whole,"" said administrator Clare Boardman. The death of a Poundworld What's eating the pound shops? Six reasons behind the High Street crisis At least two potential deals have failed so far, including one from the chain's founder Chris Edwards, who was offering to buy around half of the stores. In June, Alteri investors, which specialises in buying struggling retailers, also pulled out of takeover talks. Poundworld traces its origins back to 1974 and a market stall in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. In 2015 Mr Edwards sold the chain to US private equity firm, TPG, which also controls restaurant chain, Prezzo. In 2016-17 Poundworld reported losses of Â£17.1m, which was partly the result of tough competition from rivals including Poundland and Poundstretcher.

"Seven divers who aided in the rescue returned to the UK on Friday A British diver who helped to save 12 boys and their football coach from a flooded cave in Thailand has insisted he was not a hero. Rick Stanton, from Coventry, said he was using a ""very unique skill set"" to ""give something back to the community"". He and other divers who aided in the rescue returned to Heathrow on Friday morning. Mr Stanton and John Volanthen were thefirst to reach the group, which had been trapped for nine days. How the boys were saved The heroes of the Thai cave rescue Key questions of cave rescue How would you survive in a cave? The pair are both members of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team. This video can not be played Thai cave rescue: Diver describes finding boys alive Mr Stanton told reporters: ""This was completely uncharted, unprecedented territory and nothing like this has been done. So, of course there were doubts. ""I knew that we had a good team, with good support from the Thai authorities, the caving community and rescue organisations, so we had the best we could do to make a plan work."" This video can not be played How the Thai cave boys were rescued Mr Stanton was asked how he felt when he first saw the boys alive in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave. He said: ""Initially of course excitement, relief that they were still alive. ""As they were coming down the slope we were counting them until we got to 13, unbelievable. ""We gave them a little bit of extra light, they still had light, they looked in good health. Then of course when we departed, all we could think about was how we were going to get them out. ""So, there was relief, tempered with uncertainty."" The boys are being treated in hospital after their ordeal Returning with Mr Stanton were fellow divers Chris Jewell and Connor Roe, both from Somerset, Josh Bratchley from Devon, Jim Warny from Co Clare, Mike Clayton from Shropshire and Gary Mitchell from Machynlleth in Powys. Mr Jewell said: ""The diving conditions were extremely challenging, there was poor visibility and responsibility for another human being's life. ""It was a successful outcome and we played a part in an international effort."" Mr Jewell said it was very hard to judge how close it came to being a very different outcome. ""The Thai authorities took a lot of steps to divert rivers on the mountain top which we believe bought us a lot of time to get this outcome,"" he said. This video can not be played Ben Reymenants was one of a number of foreign expert divers drafted in for the rescue Mr Stanton would not describe how his team rescued the children, describing it as ""too detailed for this point in time"". But he said: ""The most important thing to have was a full face mask which had been applied inside with positive pressure to enable them to breathe and to be relaxed enough so not to feel any anxiety during the process. ""There was a lot of chaos but we were so task-orientated, focused and we blanked that out and carried on with the job in hand, step by step, until we achieved success."" Mr Stanton declined to answer any medical questions but said: ""They were carefully handled. ""There is a lot of responsibility, that is all I am prepared to say... there is a lot of responsibility that an experienced diver could handle.""

"A massive police operation is under way around Turnberry, where Mr Trump will spend the weekend Here at Turnberry, they are ready. The preparations have all been made. The weather is looking fine and settled, albeit a fraction short of the tropical conditions of the last fortnight or so. Yes, at Trump Turnberry, all is set for the big weekend wedding. Meanwhile, the golfers are out on the famous links. I have played them myself in the past and can readily attest that they are notably challenging - with ankle-biting gorse and scarcely an accessible fairway on the course. But then my handicap is a little higher than three. What's that? You're expecting me to write about Donald Trump? Well, firstly, the foregoing tosh is what is known to the wicked media as colour. Protests planned ahead of Trump arrival Secondly, I would plead that I am merely - and metaphorically - reflecting the faintly surreal nature of the entire visit thus far. As evidence, I offer the news conference which President Trump conducted alongside a somewhat nervous prime minister. (Hey, you'd be nervous too if you were wondering each and every second what your neighbour was about to say or do.) The president offered ample and amplified reassurance about his attitude towards Theresa May - as if it had been an entirely different Donald John Trump who had trashed her Brexit deal and praised her biggest internal rival, Boris Johnson, in an interview with The Sun. At one point, he even said he had noted reports to the effect that Brexit negotiations would be difficult. Reports, perhaps, of his own comments, taped by the newspaper and used by broadcasters around the globe. At Chequers - where the Brexit deal was reached - Mr Trump was emollient, even gushing. Theresa May was a wonderful woman. Terrific. Great, altogether. They had shared breakfast, lunch and dinner. (His engagement with the Queen is a cup of tea, albeit in the best Windsor china.) And the substance? Still seemingly nervous, Mrs May repeatedly quoted President Trump as saying that talks to secure an ""ambitious"" trade deal between the UK and the US were still on. He had suggested in The Sun that such a deal might be jeopardised in that Mrs May's Brexit proposals were tantamount to requiring the US to deal with the EU. Up with which he would not put. The prime minister was visibly nervous during a joint media conference with the president In response to questions, Mrs May sidestepped the comments about Mr Johnson, deferring to the president. Mr Trump confirmed that he had indeed suggested that the erstwhile foreign secretary would make a fine prime minister. But this had been nothing to do with his views about the current incumbent. Who was, lest we had missed the point, wonderful, excellent, superbâ¦..ach, you get the concept by now. Onwards then, eventually, to Ayrshire. And Trump Turnberry. At which point the issue arises of the welcome - or otherwise - to be afforded to the president in the land of his mother's birth. Nearly every political leader has found something to criticise - although, of course, the range has varied very substantially. Huge protests against Mr Trump have been held in London, with more planned when he arrives in Scotland Labour's Richard Leonard and Patrick Harvie of the Greens have been competing in vitriol. Eventually, they combined to demand that Prestwick should be closed to Mr Trump on the grounds that it is presently owned by the public. David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, who will meet the president at the airport, disagrees. Mr Mundell says he dissents from elements of the Trump policy package, such as Iran. But he says it is important to offer a greeting to the incumbent holder of the office of US president. He notes further that the US is Scotland's largest overseas export market - and that it would scarcely enhance trade to insult the office of the presidency. Others, such as Christine Jardine of the Liberal Democrats, argue, nevertheless, that it is vital to protest against sundry elements of the Trump personality and programme. Such protests will be on the streets of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and elsewhere. Which leaves the SNP. Their leaders, their elected tribunes, have been to the fore in criticising President Trump. Decidedly to the fore. But they face an additional conundrum which liberated opposition politicians escape. Nicola Sturgeon, of course, is more than the leader of the SNP. She is the elected first minister of Scotland, required to represent this devolved nation in building and sustaining global connections. She can only go so far in criticising an individual politician. Go too far and it risks tipping over into contumely for the office of president, perhaps even for the US itself. That is why it is Keith Brown who will attend the Glasgow anti-Trump protest. Mr Brown is Ms Sturgeon's deputy - which gives him party political clout and signals the stance of the SNP. But he is now, to his intense personal regret, shorn of governmental office. Which distances him from Bute House and the Scottish Cabinet. At Turnberry, all the best to the happy couple and to those intrepid souls who venture onto the links.

"A woman has died and a man spent three weeks in hospital in Wiltshire after being exposed to the nerve agent Novichok. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley fell ill at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from Salisbury, on 30 June. Police said they were exposed after handling a contaminated container - which is now believed to have been a perfume bottle. Ms Sturgess died in hospital on 9 July and a murder inquiry has been launched. Mr Rowley was discharged on 20 July. The poisoning comes after a Russian former spy and his daughter were poisoned with Novichok in Salisbury in March. This is what we know so far. On Saturday 30 June, paramedics were called twice to a flat in Muggleton Road in Amesbury - first at 10:15 BST after Ms Sturgess, 44, collapsed, and again at 18:20 BST after Mr Rowley, 45, also fell ill. A friend of the couple, Sam Hobson, said Ms Sturgess had appeared to have a fit and was ""foaming at the mouth"". When Mr Rowley became ill, he was sweating profusely, dribbling, and his eyes were ""red, pinpricked"", he said. Wiltshire Police said it was initially believed the two patients had been using heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs. But after more tests, scientists at the UK's military research lab, Porton Down, found the couple had been exposed to the nerve agent Novichok. Police declared a major incident and counter-terror police are now leading the investigation. What are Novichok nerve agents? Muggleton Road has been cordoned off and specialist search teams are scouring the area Police say that the pair had a high concentration of Novichok on their hands, and so they believe they handled a contaminated item. A government scientist told the BBC the item was probably discovered by the couple in a contained space and was so toxic it was able to pass through the skin. Around 100 detectives from the Counter Terrorism Policing Network are working on the investigation, alongside Wiltshire Police. Forensic investigators, wearing protective suits, are working at John Baker House Multiple areas in Amesbury and Salisbury have been cordoned off and scientists and forensic teams in protective clothing are searching the sites. Swabs taken from the sites are being sent to a defence laboratory for testing. The operation could take ""weeks or months"" to complete, police say. Two bins have been removed from a cordoned-off area behind shops in Salisbury for analysis. Detectives are also undertaking precautionary testing of the ambulances used to treat the pair. Police spoke ""briefly"" to Mr Rowley after he regained consciousness and will be speaking to him more as he continues his recovery. Officers are also looking through more than 1,300 hours of CCTV footage. This video can not be played Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said the couple handled a high dose of Novichok Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in nearby Salisbury on 4 March. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head of counter-terrorism policing in the UK, said it was ""implausible"" that the cases were not linked. It has been reported thatpolice have identified several Russiansas the suspected perpetrators of the attack. Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? Dawn Sturgess, who died on 8 July, was a mother of three who lived at John Baker House in Salisbury, which offers supported accommodation. Her family described heras ""a gentle soul who was generous to a fault"". This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse Charlie Rowley is 45 and lives at the flat in Muggleton Road in Amesbury where the couple fell ill. His brother, Matthew, said: ""He's a lovely guy and would do anything for you. He's a sweetheart basically."" He said what had happened was ""heartbreaking"". This video can not be played Charlie Rowley's brother Matthew describes how he found out what had happened Police said the pair were both at John Baker House at 12:20 BST on 29 June, before visiting a number of shops in Salisbury and heading to Queen Elizabeth Gardens. They returned to the building at around 16:20 BST, before heading to Amesbury by bus at around 22:30. Police believe they were there until emergency services were called on Saturday. Sam Hobson, 29, who also knew the victims, said he spent time with them on Friday and Saturday. He said after Ms Sturgess fell unconscious and was taken to hospital, he and Mr Rowley went to a chemist in Amesbury to collect a prescription before going to an event at a nearby Baptist church. This video can not be played A friend of one of the Amesbury poisoning victims describes the symptoms he witnessed The two men returned to the flat and planned to visit the hospital but Mr Rowley ""started feeling really hot and sweaty"" and ""acting all funny"", Mr Hobson, 29, said, and an ambulance was called. Five areas the victims are believed to have visited prior to falling ill have been cordoned off: in Amesbury they are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church, while in Salisbury and John Baker House in Rolleston Street and Queen Elizabeth Gardens are being checked. Having spoken to his brother in hospital, Matthew Rowley said Charlie told him thenerve agent was contained in a perfume bottle. Prime Minister Theresa May said her thoughts were with the victims of the poisoning, adding: ""the people of Salisbury and Amesbury have shown incredible resilience"". The government has allocated additional funds to support businesses and ""to meet unexpected costs"". In total, the region has been given more than Â£7.5m to help it cope with the Novichok cases. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said that working out whether there was a connection to the attempted murders of Yulia and Sergei Skripal was ""clearly the main line of inquiry"". ""We will stand up to the actions that threaten our security,"" he added. This video can not be played Sajid Javid calls on Russia to explain ""exactly what has gone on"" The government accused Russia of being behind the poisoning of the Skripals in March, which Moscow denied, souring relations between the two countries. Russia said Mrs May's government was subjecting them ""to hell"" over the incident in Amesbury. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged police not to be led by the ""dirty political game"" and said she was confident London would have to apologise to Russia. Public Health England says the risk to the wider public is low, buthas urged,externalanyone who may have visited the locations that have been cordoned off by police to wash and clean their clothing and personal items. Although they said there was ""no immediate"" danger, anyone who was at the five areas between 22:00 BST on 29 June and 18:30 BST on 30 June should: Wash the clothing they were wearing Wipe down personal items like phones and bags with cleansing or baby wipes Double-bag any items which are dry-clean only Chief medical officer Sally Davies has also warned those in the area against picking up ""any foreign object which could contain liquid or gel"". Lorna Wilkinson, director of nursing at Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, said Mr Rowley posed no risk to the community after being discharged.

"Facebook says it will not remove fake news from its platform because it does not violate its community standards. The social network is currently running an advertising campaign in the UK that declares ""fake news is not our friend"". But it said publishers often had ""very different points of view"" and removing fabricated posts would be ""contrary to the basic principles of free speech"". Instead, it says posts that it deems to be fake news will be ""demoted"" in the news feed. Facebook has been scrutinised for its role in spreading fake news after evidence emerged that Russia tried to influence US voters using the social network. On Wednesday, the company held an event in New York where it sought to convince journalists it was tackling the problem. CNN reporterOliver Darcy asked,externalhow the company could claim to be tackling the spread of misinformation when it allowed the InfoWars page to remain on the platform. InfoWars produces live talk shows online and has more than 900,000 followers on Facebook. Its primary host, Alex Jones, has more than 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube. However, the platform has pushed demonstrably false information, such as the conspiracy theory that the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012 was faked by the US government. Alex Jones' InfoWars has pushed conspiracy theories Responding to CNN, Facebook's John Hegeman said: ""We created Facebook to be a place where different people can have a voice."" The company said it would not remove fake news that did not break its rules but would down-rank content that had been marked as false. ""We allow people to post it as a form of expression, but we're not going to show it at the top of News Feed,"" a spokeswoman told CNN. Allow Twitter content?

"Cavill, who stars as Superman, expressed confusion over dating boundaries in the #MeToo era Superman actor Henry Cavill has apologised for claiming that the #MeToo movement has left him scared to date women for fear of being ""called a rapist"". In a statement, Cavill addressed the ""confusion and misunderstanding""over his GQ interview,external. ""Insensitivity was absolutely not my intention"", he continued, confirming he holds women in ""the highest regard"". The comments sparked both empathy and anger online. The British actor made the outspoken comments during an interview with GQ Australia, as part of his promotional activities forMission Impossible: Fallout. When asked how #MeToo affected him, Cavill said that while society ""had to change"" regarding the treatment of women, the altered landscape has left him feeling unsure about ""chasing a woman"". Cavill features alongside Tom Cruise in the latest Mission Impossible film ""I think a woman should be wooed and chased, but maybe I'm old-fashioned for thinking that,"" he admitted. ""It's very difficult to do that if there are certain rules in place. Because then it's like: 'Well, I don't want to go up and talk to her, because I'm going to be called a rapist or something.' Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo Reported sex offences against men tripled ""So you're like, 'Forget it. I'm going to call an ex-girlfriend instead, and then just go back to a relationship, which never really worked,'"" he continued. ""But it's way safer than casting myself into the fires of hell, because I'm someone in the public eye, and if I go and flirt with someone, then who knows what's going to happen?"" The comments proved divisive on social media - while many were quick to attack Cavill for his ""absurd "" views, a number of men echoed Cavill's sense of confusion. Much of the criticism focused on the way he appeared to conflate asking a woman out with committing sexual assault. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Mr Trump delivered an ""astonishing political knifing"" to Mrs May, CNN said President Trump's comments to British newspaper The Sun are being described in the US as a ""Brexit bomb"" - but some White House correspondents are querying whether he really intended to rule out a trade deal with the UK. In the interview, Mr Trump saidthe UK would ""probably not"" get a trade dealwith the US if Prime Minister Theresa May's current Brexit plan went ahead. He added that Europe as a whole was ""losing its culture"" because of immigration from the Middle East and Africa. TheWashington PostsaidMr Trump had ""blasted"" Mrs May,externalwhile praising her ""archrival"", former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson who resigned earlier this week over the Brexit plan. The newspaper quoted a US official who said there was ""no way Trump will apologise"" for what he said in the interview but added ""we also don't want to blow everything up"". Another official said President Trump had been privately critical of Mrs May ""for many months"", discussing her vulnerabilities and criticising her political acumen.

White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders had told the British government about the interview in advance, ""but thought it would be somewhat more positive"", the newspaper quoted an official as saying. In a statement, Ms Sanders said: ""The President likes and respects Prime Minister May very much.

"This video can not be played Trump on Brexit story 'fake news' US President Donald Trump insisted he did not criticise Theresa May in the interview that dominated the build-up to the two leaders' press conference. Mr Trump has sparked a backlash from UK politicians after telling The Sun the PM's Brexit plan would ""probably kill"" a UK-US trade deal. He also said Boris Johnson would make a ""great prime minister"". But after talks with Mrs May he claimed ""tremendous things"" he said about her had been left out of the Sun story. Live: Latest on Trump's visit to the UK UK MPs' anger at Trump's Brexit comments Trump: US-UK relationship indispensible He said the paper's story was ""generally fine"", but ""it didn't put in what I said about the prime minister, and I said tremendous things"". ""Fortunately, we tend to record stories now so we have it for your enjoyment if you'd like it,"" he said. ""We record when we deal with reporters, it's called fake news and we solve a lot of problems with the good old recording instrument."" The Sun'swrite-up,externalof its interview, which was recorded, quoted him describing her as a ""nice person"" and saying they get along ""very nicely"". This video can not be played Trump rows back on Sun 'fake news' claim Later in the press conference at the prime minister's country residence, Chequers, Mr Trump verbally sparred with the Sun reporter who had interviewed him, Tom Newton Dunn. Mr Newton Dunn told the president that his positive remarks about Mrs May had been included in the story. ""If you reported them that's good,"" Mr Trump told the political correspondent. ""Thank you very much for saying that."" He added: ""I didn't think they put it in, but that's all right. ""They didn't put it in the headline, I wish they put that in the headline, that's one of those things."" The Sun's Tom Newton Dunn told the US president his compliments about Theresa May had been included On Mrs May's reaction, he added: ""She's a total professional because when I saw her this morning I said 'I want to apologise because I said such good things about you'. ""She said: 'Don't worry it's only the press.' I thought that was very professional."" During the press conference, Mr Trump - who regularly accuses the US media of ""fake news"" over its coverage of him - also clashed with a reporter from the American NBC network, describing it as ""possibly worse than CNN"". He also refused to take a question from CNN, saying: ""CNN is fake news, I don't take questions from fake news. Let's take a question from a real network."" He then took a question from Fox News regarding his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Responding to Mr Trump's comments about The Sun, a spokesman for the newspaper said: ""We stand by our reporting and the quotes we used - including those where the president was positive about the prime minister, in both the paper and in our audio - and we're delighted that the president essentially retracted his original charge against the paper later in the press conference. ""To say the president called us 'fake news' with any serious intent is, well... fake news.""

"The government'sBrexit White Paper,external, published this week, asserts that the UK can create a free trade area in goods with the EU, but still forge its own trade deals around the world. But Donald Trump saidin an interview with The Sun,externalthat the government's proposal for its future relationship with the EU would ""probably kill"" any US-UK free trade deal in the future. Then, in his news conference with Theresa May at Chequers, the president slightly changed his tune: ""If they're going to go a certain route, I just said I hope you're going to be able to trade with the United States"", Mr Trump said. ""I read reports where that won't be possible but I believe, after speaking with the prime minister's people and representatives and trade experts, it will absolutely be possible."" Well, the UK will be able to do some trade deals with other countries, but there's no question that the government's proposals will make the process more difficult. Let's look at goods first. The White Paper,externalsays the proposal on customs would ""enable the UK to set its own tariffs and vary them as it chooses, independently of the tariffs the EU applies."" In other words, according to the White Paper, the UK could have much lower tariffs with the US than the EU does (or no tariffs at all.) A tariff is a tax or duty paid on goods crossing borders. But there are some important caveats. First of all the customs proposal may well be rejected by the EU anyway. And, in any case, the biggest impediments to free trade are not tariffs, but what are known as 'non-tariff barriers' - the rules and regulations that govern all our economies. The government has proposeda common rulebook with the EU on goods and agri-food- which would in effect mean the UK signing up to a whole host of EU rules and regulations. Reality Check: What's the EU common rulebook? Reality Check: What does the Brexit White Paper reveal? Reality Check: Why services matter in any Brexit deal In her news conference with Mr Trump, Theresa May insisted that ""there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the rest of the world once we leave the European Union."" But the White Paper itself admits that ""in the context of trade negotiations, a common rulebook would limit the UK's ability to make changes to regulationâ¦"" And that in turn would make it far more difficult to do trade deals with other countries like the United States. It is often noted that the UK, as part of the EU, does not allow the import of genetically modified food, chlorine-washed chicken or nearly all types of hormone-injected meat - all of which are allowed in the United States. The US would push the UK to change these regulations in negotiations on a future trade deal, but the terms of the Brexit White Paper would not allow it if the UK wants to maintain frictionless trade with the EU. ""We don't currently have border checks because the French, for example, assume the UK is enforcing EU regulations,"" says Professor Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex. ""If we changed the rules for US-imported goods after Brexit, they'd want to start putting in checks."" Kinder Eggs are banned in the US because they contain toys It's not all a one-way street of course. Kinder Eggs are a popular product in Europe but under US regulations, food sales are banned if they have""partially or completely imbedded therein any non-nutritive object"",external(such as a toy). In any case, Mr Trump's remarks about possible restrictions on free trade hardly come as a surprise, because his administration has said it before. Mr Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross,speaking at the CBI conference in London last November,external, said it was important that any Brexit deal between the UK and the EU ""takes into account (Washington's) commercial interests and does not hinder the development of a closer US-UK relationship."" The UK should take steps, he added to ""avoid any unnecessary regulatory divergences"" with the United States. What about the services sector, in which the UK government has proposed a much looser relationship with the EU, even though services make up roughly 80% of the UK economy? Last year the US Secretary of Commerce said the UK should seek to avoid ""unnecessary"" divergence with the US Under the terms of the White Paper (and, again, it's important to stress that the whole thing has yet to be negotiated with the EU) the UK will be able to explore free trade deals in services around the world. But most current free trade deals barely mention services, partly because reaching agreement on common rules and regulations is so difficult. The UK would like to change that, and ""push for greater liberalisation of global services."" It's not hard to see why. In 2017 the EU was the biggest market for UK services exports around the world. But services trade outside the EU grew by more than 73% between 2007 and 2017, andaccording to the Office for National Statistics,,externalthe largest single market for UK services exports outside the EU last year was the United States. ""On the whole new technology has allowed services to trade more effectively on a global scale over the past 15 years,"" Professor Winters explains. ""But the very fact the UK is so efficient in services makes other countries cautious about agreements on services with the UK."" So the UK is looking to the future, and there are certainly opportunities out there. But under the terms of the Brexit White Paper, there will be limits on what it can achieve in trade deals, on goods in particular. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Cavill, who stars as Superman, expressed confusion over dating boundaries in the #MeToo era Superman actor Henry Cavill has apologised for claiming that the #MeToo movement has left him scared to date women for fear of being ""called a rapist"". In a statement, Cavill addressed the ""confusion and misunderstanding""over his GQ interview,external. ""Insensitivity was absolutely not my intention"", he continued, confirming he holds women in ""the highest regard"". The comments sparked both empathy and anger online. The British actor made the outspoken comments during an interview with GQ Australia, as part of his promotional activities forMission Impossible: Fallout. When asked how #MeToo affected him, Cavill said that while society ""had to change"" regarding the treatment of women, the altered landscape has left him feeling unsure about ""chasing a woman"". Cavill features alongside Tom Cruise in the latest Mission Impossible film ""I think a woman should be wooed and chased, but maybe I'm old-fashioned for thinking that,"" he admitted. ""It's very difficult to do that if there are certain rules in place. Because then it's like: 'Well, I don't want to go up and talk to her, because I'm going to be called a rapist or something.' Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo Reported sex offences against men tripled ""So you're like, 'Forget it. I'm going to call an ex-girlfriend instead, and then just go back to a relationship, which never really worked,'"" he continued. ""But it's way safer than casting myself into the fires of hell, because I'm someone in the public eye, and if I go and flirt with someone, then who knows what's going to happen?"" The comments proved divisive on social media - while many were quick to attack Cavill for his ""absurd "" views, a number of men echoed Cavill's sense of confusion. Much of the criticism focused on the way he appeared to conflate asking a woman out with committing sexual assault. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Estimates suggest there are fewer than 5,500 black rhinos in theÂ world Eight endangered black rhinos have died while being transported to a new wildlife reserve in Kenya. They died after drinking water with high concentrations of salt, the Kenyan government says. The animals were among 14 black rhinos being transported from Nairobi National Park to the country's biggest national park, Tsavo East. Estimates suggest there are fewer than 5,500 black rhinos in the world, all of them in Africa and someÂ 750 in Kenya. Kenya Wildlife Service vets believe the more the animals drank, the thirstier they became, which quickly lead to salt poisoning, although an independent investigation has been launched to confirm the cause of death. Black rhinoceros videos, news and facts The rhino wars of central Kenya The snipers trained to protect rhinos Kenyan conservationist Paula Kahumbu told AFP news agency: ""Something must have gone wrong, and we want to know what it is."" The relocation of endangered animals involvesÂ sedating them for the journey and reviving them on arrival. The process is known as translocation. The WWF conservation agency, which runs the programme with the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), described the process as ""extremely challenging"" in a statement released to Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper. ""Black rhinos are under enormous threat, so efforts to try and better protect them, such as translocation, are crucial for future generations,"" i said. Rhinos are often moved when their populations outgrow their surroundings. In the case of critically endangered black rhinos, the moves can establish new breeding habitats to boost numbers. Nine rhinos were killed in Kenya last year, according to KWS, andin March, the world's last surviving male northern white rhino died after months of poor health.

"The US-led coalition says it ""may have"" carried out an air strike in an area of eastern Syria where scores of civilians were reportedly killed on Thursday. Fifty-four people, including at least 28 civilians as well as Islamic State (IS) group militants, died in the strike on a village near the Iraqi border, a monitoring group says. The raid hit a gathering at an ice factory near the village of al-Soussa. Syria has blamed the US for the incident in Deir al-Zour province. ""The coalition or our partner forces may have conducted strikes in the vicinity of al-Soussa... yesterday,"" coalition spokesman US Army Col Sean Ryan told Reuters news agency. Why is there a war in Syria? The rise and fall of 'Islamic State' The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts The area around al-Soussa, on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river, is still under the control of IS, which still retains pockets of territory near the border with Iraq. IS militants in the area have come under attack from Syrian government forces backed by Russian air power from the west and US-supported Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) backed by US coalition air power from the east. The nearby town ofAlbu Kamal, on the western bank of the Euphrates, was retaken by Syrian government forcesin December. Iraq, which has practically expelled IS from its territory, has also recently carried out air strikes on suspected IS militants near the border in Syria. The jihadists seized control of large parts of northern and western Iraq and northern and eastern Syria in 2014 but has since lost nearly all that territory.

"J&J says it defends the safety of its baby powder product Pharmaceutical firm Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has been ordered by a US court to pay more than $110m (Â£85m) to a woman who says she developed ovarian cancer after using its talcum powder. Lois Slemp, 62, from Virginia, Missouri said she developed the cancer after four decades of using talc products. Prosecutors argued the company did not adequately warn about the cancer risks associated with the items. Experts say links with ovarian cancer are unproven. J&J says it will appeal. The verdict in a St Louis state court is the largest so far to arise out of about 2,400 lawsuits against J&J over its talc-based products, Reuters news agency reports. Ms Slemp is currently undergoing chemotherapy after her ovarian cancer initially diagnosed in 2012 returned and spread to her liver. She said the products she used included J&J's Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder. ""Once again we've shown that these companies ignored the scientific evidence and continue to deny their responsibilities to the women of America,"" said Ted Meadows, a lawyer for Ms Slemp. Blood tests spot ovarian cancer early Simpler testing 'saves lives' The verdict included $5.4m in compensatory damages and $105m in punitive damages against J&J. The company said it planned to appeal. ""We are preparing for additional trials this year and we continue to defend the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder,""it said in a statement.,external ""We deeply sympathise with the women and families impacted by ovarian cancer."" J&J lostthree jury verdicts last yearin cases related to its talc-based products, but won its first trial in March, when a jury in Missouri sided with the company. There have been concerns for years that using talcum powder, particularly on the genitals, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer. But the evidence is not conclusive. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc used on the genitals as ""possibly carcinogenic,external"" because of the mixed evidence. The mineral talc in its natural form does contain asbestos and does cause cancer, however, asbestos-free talc has been used in baby powder and other cosmetics since the 1970s. But the studies on asbestos-free talc give contradictory results. It has been linked to a cancer risk insome studies,external, but there are concerns that the research may be biased as they often rely on people remembering how much talc they used years ago. Other studies have argued there isno link at all,externalandthere is no link,externalbetween talc in contraceptives such as diaphragms and condoms (which would be close to the ovaries) and cancer. Also there does not seem to be a ""dose-response"" for talc, unlike with known carcinogens like tobacco where the more you smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer. The charityOvacome,externalsays there is no definitive evidence and that the worst-case scenario is that using talc increases the risk of cancer by a third. But it adds: ""Ovarian cancer is a rare disease, and increasing a small risk by a third still gives a small risk. So even if talc does increase the risk slightly, very few women who use talc will ever get ovarian cancer.""

"History teacher James Husband raped a 16-year-old girl A former teacher at a top independent school in West Sussex has been sentenced to 17 years in jail for a string of sex offences including rape. James Husband, 68, from York, was convicted of raping a 16-year-old pupil at Christ's Hospital School in Horsham. He was also found guilty at an earlier hearing at Hove Crown Court of five indecent assault charges on the girl. During the trial, the court heard Husband told the girl: ""It's OK, I've had a vasectomy,"" before raping her. Husband, of Wigginton, is the fifth Christ's Hospital School teacher to be convicted of sexually abusing students. Over the five cases, the sexual abuse at the school spanned more than 30 years and involved 22 victims. Judge Christine Henson, who placed Husband on the sex offenders register for life, said the victim had give ""harrowing"" evidence during the trial. The judge told him: ""You put yourself in the position of her mentor in order to make her feel special and dependent on you so you could do what you wanted sexually with her. ""She viewed you as a father figure, thus rendering the abuse of trust particularly acute."" The independent school charges fees of up to Â£31,500 a year In a victim impact statement read to the court, the woman said: ""The grooming process was devious and malignant. By making me feel special for the first time in my life, I became dependent on him for my own feeling of self worth."" She said Husband moulded her into his ""plaything"" and ""puppet"" so ""he could do what he wanted to me"". ""He twisted my mind to abuse my body and made my body feel dirty and degraded until I believed this to be true."" She said she had been left with a ""life sentence"" of anorexia, suicidal thoughts and self-harm and suffered from ""unbearable"" flashbacks. Although described by the prosecution as a ""great pupil capable of achieving great things"", she said she had failed to make the grades to take up a place at Cambridge University because she had been ""worn down"" by his abuse. Gary Dobbie is yet to be sentenced Husband's co-defendant and a former head of house at the school Gary Dobbie, 66, of  Rue De La Piale in Albi, France, was convicted of 15 counts involving multiple offences against six boys and two girls as young as 12. Dobbie, formerly of Hereford, was teaching at independent Shrewsbury School, in Shropshire, at the time of his arrest in 2016. He has yet to be sentenced. Jurors heard the abuse took place between 1990 and 2001 and that both men were friends and used to laugh together about their actions. After the hearing, Det Sgt Karrie Bohanna from Sussex Police said; ""The victims of Husband and Dobbie were mainly children who should have been able to feel safe whilst in the care of their teachers. ""Instead both Husband and Dobbie exploited their positions in order to groom and sexually abuse their victims."" An NSPCC spokesman said Husband ""used and abused his position of trust in the worst possible way"". He said: ""His jailing today will hopefully give some sort of closure to his victim and at the same time encourage other people in a similar position to come forward and report what has happened to them.""

"Care workers who had to stay overnight as part of their job will not be entitled to back pay at the minimum wage after a Court of Appeal ruling. The charity Mencap, who won the appeal, argued that a previous tribunal decision which compelled care providers to fund six years' back pay for overnight carers was unaffordable. And it said smaller employers could be forced out of business by the decision. But a union said workers should be paid what they were legally entitled to. Care workers who provide care for people with serious learning disabilities overnight used to be paid a flat fee of around Â£30, reflecting the fact that they might be sleeping during some of their shifts. But after employment tribunal rulings involving a Mencap support worker in the East Riding of Yorkshire, HM Revenue and Customs said they should be paid at least the minimum wage for every hour overnight, amounting to about Â£60. Employers were told to fund Â£400 million of back pay but care providers, including Mencap, argued that this was unaffordable. The Court of Appeal ruled today that care providers had no liability for back pay. But the union Unison is considering an appeal to the Supreme Court. Dave Prentis, Unison general secretary, said the ruling was a ""mistake"" and that the blame should be ""laid at the government's door"". ""Ministers are so consumed by Brexit that they're ignoring huge problems around them. ""Sleep-in shifts involve significant caring responsibilities, often for very vulnerable people."" But Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with two other senior judges in the Court of Appeal, said: ""For the reasons which I have given I believe that sleepers-in... are to be characterised for the purpose of the regulations as available for work... rather than actually working... and so fall within the terms of the sleep-in exception. ""The result is that the only time that counts for national minimum wage purposes is time when the worker is required to be awake for the purposes of working."" However, most employers have now started paying the minimum wage to care workers who sleep overnight while working. Mencap said it intended to continue to do so despite the court's decision. Derek Lewis, chair of the Royal Mencap Society, said: ""The prospect of having to make large unfunded back payments had threatened to bankrupt many providers, jeopardising the care of vulnerable people and the employment of their carers. ""Many hardworking care workers were given false expectations of an entitlement to back pay and they must be feeling very disappointed. ""We did not want to bring this case.""

"This video can not be played Mays greet Trumps for UK black-tie dinner We all know what it's like - having to play nice with the person you don't have very much in common with, because it's the right thing to do. Knowing that lots of people you DO like would be upset if you don't put on a show. Well, how about this: having to ""play nice"" publicly with a person you don't have very much in common with, when they have said that the way you are trying to do your job doesn't really work. Add in the embarrassment if they happen to be the leader of the free world. LIVE: Latest updates on Donald Trump's UK visit From the moment of his election, Donald Trump was an awkward friend for Theresa May. He runs towards a fight. She does everything in public to avoid one. Well, just before they were due to appear alongside each other on UK soil he publicly, and at length, gave a ""both barrels"" verdict on her most important policy. Her approach to Brexit has been to slowly, gently, incrementally, carry the Ming vase across one side of the room to another on a slippery floor. To talk about being pragmatic, to smooth over the contradictions, to do whatever it takes to get to the other side, without smashing that vase (her party and the country) to bits. In walks President Trump, to call out one of the claims that No 10 has been making of late - in essence, smashing the vase to bits. Inan interview with The Sun,external, he shoots down the chances of a trade deal with the US if she sticks to her carefully crafted compromise Brexit plan. The black tie event was held on the first day of President Trump's visit That matters because the government has been clinging to the idea of trade deals with countries outside the EU as one of the benefits of Brexit, and claiming that the choice in the Chequers deal to stay close to the EU doesn't exclude those opportunities. This isn't about what side anyone was on in the referendum. In fact, Remainers and Leavers unite in saying the Chequers deal can't live up to all it claims. For former Remainers, it's nuts to think that trade deals with non-EU countries can ever make up for what might be lost. For some Leavers, it's nuts to claim we can make the most of the world outside if we are still sticking to EU rules. And President Trump drives a bulldozer through the government's central claims about its compromise - that the UK would be able to get decent trade deals with the wider world, while sticking to the EU rules. A lot of this visit has been carefully choreographed, as the prime minister and the president dance around each other. But if the president really wanted to help her build support for her controversial compromise, this isn't the way to do it.

"This video can not be played Spoons used to thwart forced marriages A school is attempting to tackle forced marriages by handing out spoons to urge students to hide them in underwear to trigger metal detectors at airports. Pupils at the Co-operative Academy in Leeds have been told to hide the cutlery there if they fear they are being taken overseas to be married. It will trigger metal detectors at airports, allowing them to raise the alarm with security staff privately. Harinder Kaur, from the school, said the spoons can ""save lives"".

"Most inmates at Wandsworth prison were sharing cells meant for one person One of Britain's largest prisons stopped using X-ray body scanners to detect contraband for ""unclear legal reasons"", a report has revealed. HMP Wandsworth was questioned by inspectors as to why the ""effective"" technology had been removed. Inspectors said psychoactive substances and cannabis were ""too accessible"" at the south-west London prison, which is the most-overcrowded jail in England. Existing security technology was not used effectively, the assessment found. ""For example, the X-ray scanner in reception was no longer used and the CCTV cameras in visits were not monitored as a result, we were told, of a lack of staff,"" it said. The X-ray scanner had been used previously and was an effective way of identifying contraband, HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) said. HMIP said cannabis and new psychoactive substances were ""too accessible"" at the prison Inspectors were also told inmates preferred the scan, which was more dignified than strip-searching. ""However, the scanner had fallen into disuse; we were told this was for legal reasons but we remained unclear about the reasons, given that similar scanners were in use in other establishments,"" the report said. Inspectors previously highlighted encouraging results from the use of body-scanning technology at HMP Belmarsh, saying it had led to the discovery of mobile phones, drugs and weapons that would not have been detected during a strip search. The report on HMP Wandsworth, based on inspection visits in February and March, said in the previous six months, searches recovered 277 mobile phones, 65 weapons and 153 drug packages. In other findings, the watchdog said Wandsworth remainedthe most overcrowded prison in England and Wales,with most of the 1,428 men being held at the time sharing cells originally built for one. Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke said: ""In essence, there were too many prisoners, many with drug-related or mental health issues, and with not enough to do."" Calling for ""cultural change"", he noted that not all staff carried anti-ligature knives despite six self-inflicted deaths since the jail was last inspected in 2015. Prisons minister Rory Stewart acknowledged it was a ""disappointing"" report. He said the Government was putting an extra Â£16m into improving facilities at 11 prisons, including Wandsworth. A Prison Service spokesperson said:""Wandsworth took a very cautious approach to new enhanced EU regulations on body scanners. ""Their use continued as normal across other prisons with scanners and we have now advised Wandsworth how to use the scanners effectively and in line with the EU regulations.""

"History teacher James Husband raped a 16-year-old girl A former teacher at a top independent school in West Sussex has been sentenced to 17 years in jail for a string of sex offences including rape. James Husband, 68, from York, was convicted of raping a 16-year-old pupil at Christ's Hospital School in Horsham. He was also found guilty at an earlier hearing at Hove Crown Court of five indecent assault charges on the girl. During the trial, the court heard Husband told the girl: ""It's OK, I've had a vasectomy,"" before raping her. Husband, of Wigginton, is the fifth Christ's Hospital School teacher to be convicted of sexually abusing students. Over the five cases, the sexual abuse at the school spanned more than 30 years and involved 22 victims. Judge Christine Henson, who placed Husband on the sex offenders register for life, said the victim had give ""harrowing"" evidence during the trial. The judge told him: ""You put yourself in the position of her mentor in order to make her feel special and dependent on you so you could do what you wanted sexually with her. ""She viewed you as a father figure, thus rendering the abuse of trust particularly acute."" The independent school charges fees of up to Â£31,500 a year In a victim impact statement read to the court, the woman said: ""The grooming process was devious and malignant. By making me feel special for the first time in my life, I became dependent on him for my own feeling of self worth."" She said Husband moulded her into his ""plaything"" and ""puppet"" so ""he could do what he wanted to me"". ""He twisted my mind to abuse my body and made my body feel dirty and degraded until I believed this to be true."" She said she had been left with a ""life sentence"" of anorexia, suicidal thoughts and self-harm and suffered from ""unbearable"" flashbacks. Although described by the prosecution as a ""great pupil capable of achieving great things"", she said she had failed to make the grades to take up a place at Cambridge University because she had been ""worn down"" by his abuse. Gary Dobbie is yet to be sentenced Husband's co-defendant and a former head of house at the school Gary Dobbie, 66, of  Rue De La Piale in Albi, France, was convicted of 15 counts involving multiple offences against six boys and two girls as young as 12. Dobbie, formerly of Hereford, was teaching at independent Shrewsbury School, in Shropshire, at the time of his arrest in 2016. He has yet to be sentenced. Jurors heard the abuse took place between 1990 and 2001 and that both men were friends and used to laugh together about their actions. After the hearing, Det Sgt Karrie Bohanna from Sussex Police said; ""The victims of Husband and Dobbie were mainly children who should have been able to feel safe whilst in the care of their teachers. ""Instead both Husband and Dobbie exploited their positions in order to groom and sexually abuse their victims."" An NSPCC spokesman said Husband ""used and abused his position of trust in the worst possible way"". He said: ""His jailing today will hopefully give some sort of closure to his victim and at the same time encourage other people in a similar position to come forward and report what has happened to them.""

"This video can not be played Makeshift barricades were set alight on a number of roads It is only a matter of time before a police officer or a child is seriously injured over violence in Londonderry, the PSNI's chief constable has said. George Hamilton said that some police officers have sustained injuries. Police fired plastic baton rounds on Thursday night, which was one of the worst nights of violence in Derry for years. Six people were arrested, at least one for attempted murder. Seventy-five petrol bombs and two improvised explosive devices were thrown at officers during the sixth consecutive night of violence. This video can not be played George Hamilton is warning someone will be seriously injured in Londonderry violence ""We already have had police officers who have suffered injuries, thankfully not too serious. Many of them were actually back at work serving the community,"" said Mr Hamilton. ""But if this continues, it's only a matter of time before a police officer or some child or young person involved in this violence gets very seriously injured, or worse."" Hundreds of people gathered on Friday night for a rally against the violence. The crowd came together at the top of Fahan Street to say ""not in our name"". Hundreds gathered to protest against the ongoing violence in Londonderry Those in attendance included Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou MacDonald, Sinn FÃ©in vice president Michelle O'Neill and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, along with other party members. The Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown also spoke at the podium along with Jim Roddy, Derry's city centre manager. Bishop McKeown said: ""You cannot claim to love your country and at the same time cause pain and destruction to the people who live there. ""Nothing can be built with petrol bombs or stones thrown in anger."" Community workers were also there along with hundreds of residents from different parts of the city. The police said children as young as eight were involved and accused dissident republicans of being behind the attacks. The PSNI also said the six nights of violence in the city had seentwo separate attempts to murder officers. A Twelfth of July parade passed off peacefully in Derry on Thursday, although police in riot gear separated a group of nationalists from the return parade as it made its way through the Diamond in the city centre. Attacks began early in the evening and continued into the early hours of Friday morning. Petrol bombs were thrown towards police Land Rovers and at officers on the ground. A rioter throws a petrol bomb on Thursday night Makeshift barricades were built and set alight on the Lecky Road flyover and on Fahan Street, while police closed sections of the walls overlooking the Bogside. On Friday, Mr Hamilton said several officers and a public order inquiry team were viewing footage of the disorder and he expected more arrests. Senior PSNI officials said it was ""a miracle"" officers were not injured. ""I am saddened, disheartened and frustrated that yet again police officers committed to keeping this local community safe have been attacked by a small number of people within it,"" said Supt Gordon McCalmont. ""While we have seen many young people involved in these attacks over the last number of nights, it is clear that this is being orchestrated by a more sinister, adult, violent dissident republican element.

"Air China is one of the country's main carriers A co-pilot smoking an e-cigarette on an Air China flight caused the plane to start a rapid emergency descent, investigators have said. They say he tried to hide the fact that he was smoking but accidentally shut off the air-conditioning, causing oxygen levels to fall. The crew on Tuesday's flight from Hong Kong to the city of Dalian released oxygen masks and brought the plane more than 6,500m (21,000ft) lower. It later returned to cruising altitude. An initial probe by China's Civil Aviation Administration in China has shown that the co-pilot tried to turn off a fan to stop smoke reaching the passenger cabin without telling the captain, but turned off the air-conditioning unit instead. Passengers say they were told to fasten their seat belts as the plane had to descend. People posted images online of the dropped oxygen masks on the flight The regulator's safety officer Qiao Yibin said the crew had to perform emergency measures, dropping oxygen masks until they could figure out the problem. If a plane loses cabin pressure, the pilot has to bring the aircraft to a lower altitude to keep crew and passengers safe. Once they saw that the air conditioning had been turned off, they reactivated it and brought the flight back to its normal altitude. Authorities are reportedly investigating the cause ""in greater detail"", examining both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder to determine precisely what caused the incident. 'Drunk' pilot removed from BA flight 'Shuddering' flight turns back to Australia AirAsia jet turns back after mid-air scare The airline promised a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to crew misbehaviour on Chinese social media site Weibo. Chinese flight regulations prohibit all flight crew from smoking, and banned passengers from using e-cigarettes on board in 2006. But there have been accusations of pilots smoking on board other Chinese flights, including in 2015 when the state-run radio spoke to passengers on a Hong Kong-Beijing flight who claimed to smell strong smoke coming from the cockpit.

"Care workers who had to stay overnight as part of their job will not be entitled to back pay at the minimum wage after a Court of Appeal ruling. The charity Mencap, who won the appeal, argued that a previous tribunal decision which compelled care providers to fund six years' back pay for overnight carers was unaffordable. And it said smaller employers could be forced out of business by the decision. But a union said workers should be paid what they were legally entitled to. Care workers who provide care for people with serious learning disabilities overnight used to be paid a flat fee of around Â£30, reflecting the fact that they might be sleeping during some of their shifts. But after employment tribunal rulings involving a Mencap support worker in the East Riding of Yorkshire, HM Revenue and Customs said they should be paid at least the minimum wage for every hour overnight, amounting to about Â£60. Employers were told to fund Â£400 million of back pay but care providers, including Mencap, argued that this was unaffordable. The Court of Appeal ruled today that care providers had no liability for back pay. But the union Unison is considering an appeal to the Supreme Court. Dave Prentis, Unison general secretary, said the ruling was a ""mistake"" and that the blame should be ""laid at the government's door"". ""Ministers are so consumed by Brexit that they're ignoring huge problems around them. ""Sleep-in shifts involve significant caring responsibilities, often for very vulnerable people."" But Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with two other senior judges in the Court of Appeal, said: ""For the reasons which I have given I believe that sleepers-in... are to be characterised for the purpose of the regulations as available for work... rather than actually working... and so fall within the terms of the sleep-in exception. ""The result is that the only time that counts for national minimum wage purposes is time when the worker is required to be awake for the purposes of working."" However, most employers have now started paying the minimum wage to care workers who sleep overnight while working. Mencap said it intended to continue to do so despite the court's decision. Derek Lewis, chair of the Royal Mencap Society, said: ""The prospect of having to make large unfunded back payments had threatened to bankrupt many providers, jeopardising the care of vulnerable people and the employment of their carers. ""Many hardworking care workers were given false expectations of an entitlement to back pay and they must be feeling very disappointed. ""We did not want to bring this case.""

"Dwight D Eisenhower played Turnberry in 1959 while still president of the USA If Donald Trump were to have a rough time in Scotland this weekend, it wouldn't be a first for a US president - at least on the golf course. Mr Trump is expected to take to the fairways of Turnberry on Saturday as protests about his visit echo around parts of the UK. His love of the game is well documented - after all, he owns 17 clubs around the world, including two in Scotland. When he tees up on his own Trump Turnberry course, he will be the second sitting US president to do so. The first? Well, that would be golf fanatic Dwight D Eisenhower, who took on Turnberry during a weekend stay at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, in 1959 after talks in Paris with General De Gaulle. He would have been well prepared for his encounter with the course, having installed a green outside the Oval Office. But it wasn't Eisenhower's first brush with the rough in Scotland. While still a US general in 1946, he was pictured playing in military uniform at St Andrews. General Eisenhower playing a round at St Andrews in 1946 Since then, Scotland seems to have become a magnet for US presidents, with each recognising the nation's importance to the golfing world. Bill Clinton has played golf here on more than one occasion since stepping down as president in 2001. Later that year he made a surprise visit to St Andrews for a round of golf over the world-famous Old Course. Mr Clinton, who played off a handicap of 12 at the time, said shortly before he teed off: ""I am looking forward to this, it is very exciting for me. ""I have only seen it on television but I have played every one of these holes in my mind countless times."" He managed to hit an 86 on the day - 14 over par for the course. Former US President Bill Clinton in action at Loch Lomond Golf Club in May 2001 Mr Clinton has been a very keen golfer The former president had played Loch Lomond Golf Course a few days earlier, carding a 90. In December that year he was back for more,playing a round at Turnberry,external. Arriving at a hotel for an engagement that evening while still wearing casual golfing clothes, he told reporters: ""It's lovely. I'm glad to be back. ""I have had a wonderful time - it's a beautiful day. It's a little warmer than I thought it would be."" US presidents and golf All but three US presidents since William Taft (1909-1913) have been golfers - the exceptions being Herbert Hoover, Harry Truman and Jimmy Carter, according to Golf Monthly The last time a non-golfer beat a golfer to the US presidency was 1976, when Jimmy Carter defeated incumbent president Gerald Ford Woodrow Wilson played a reported 1,200 rounds of golf during his eight years in office Franklin D. Roosevelt was a keen golfer until he contracted polio in his late 30s Trump has in recent years listed a very low handicap of 3 - although it is thought he has not produced a signed scorecard as proof John F. Kennedy averaged 80 on the course despite chronic back pain Donald Trump is pictured playing golf at his golf links course in Balmedie in 2012 Barack Obama was another former president to pay homage to the home of golf after taking on the Old Course during a brief visit to the UK in May 2017. He promised to return to experience ""real"" Scottish weather after playing golf in 26C (78.8F) heat. He joked: ""I promise you I will be back because, unless it is raining and blustery, I will not feel I have got the full Scottish experience."" Barack Obama has promised to return to Scotland for a round of golf after playing St Andrews last year George W Bush, another big golf fan, also had his moment at Gleneagles 13 years ago - but it wasn't on the fairways. In 2003, he stopped playing the game in the wake of the bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad, saying later that he didn't ""want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the commander-in-chief playing golf"". George Bush visited Gleneagles in 2005 for a G8 summit But even if he'd been tempted to sneak on to the Gleneagles course, away from the prying media, events were to conspire against him. His visit to the G8 summit at Gleneagles in July 2005 coincided with the 7/7 terrorist bombing atrocity in London, in which more than 50 people died. And any chance of a swinging a club was gone afterhe collided with a police officer,externalduring a bike ride on the grounds of the hotel, which left him with scrapes on his hands and arms. Any thoughts that George Bush may have had of playing golf at Gleneagles in 2005 disappeared after he injured his hand in a bike accident It's not just presidents who have been tempted on to Scotland's fairways. Former US vice president Dan Quayle has played numerous times in Scotland, including at Carnoustie Remember Dan Quayle? The former vice-president has played numerous times in The Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, including at St Andrews and Carnoustie. In 2012, he was quoted in the Courier's Fife addition as saying: ""It's a very special place, golf in Scotland. ""I always try to be positive, with a smile on my face. ""Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's not. ""You always try to approach it thinking that the next shot is going to be the best shot you've ever hit.""

"Mr Trump's interview comes as protesters - both anti and pro-Trump - prepare to march on Friday Theresa May and Donald Trump are holding talks at her country retreat Chequers, following his controversial comments on thePM's Brexit plan. In aninterview with the Sun,,externalMr Trump said the PM's plan would ""probably kill"" any trade deal with the US. But on Friday, he said he and Mrs May had ""probably never developed a better relationship"" than during this trip - his first to the UK as president. Meanwhile, a giant blimp of Mr Trump as a baby is floating in central London. It is part of a demonstration in Parliament Square, one of many due to take place across the UK on Friday. Live: Latest on Trump's visit to the UK Kuenssberg: Trump gives May's plan both barrels How the papers are covering Trump's visit Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan In his interview with the Sun, Mr Trump also said that former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who disagrees with the PM on Brexit and resigned this week - would make a ""great prime minister"", adding ""I think he's got what it takes"". He also renewed his criticism of London Mayor Sadiq Khan over last year's terror attacks in London, saying he had done ""a terrible job"". Downing Street has not yet reacted to Mr Trump's remarks, but Chancellor Philip Hammond said the talks will be ""very positive"". Theresa Mayhas been making the casefor a US free trade deal, and says Brexit is an ""unprecedented opportunity"" to create jobs in the UK and US. The US president and his wife, Melania, were given a red carpet reception at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire on Thursday evening. This video can not be played Mays greet Trumps for UK black-tie dinner They were at a black-tie dinner with Mrs May as news broke of his interview with the newspaper, which said it was conducted while he was in Brussels. After it was published, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the president ""likes and respects Prime Minister May very much"", adding that he had ""never said anything bad about her"". Protesters near Blenheim Palace making their feelings known on Thursday Mr Trump - who has been a long-time supporter of Brexit - told The Sun that the UK's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"". He saidthe Brexit proposalsMrs May and her cabinet thrashed out at the PM's country house Chequers last week ""would probably end a major trade relationship with the United States."" ""We have enough difficulty with the European Union,"" he said, saying the EU has ""not treated the United States fairly on trading"". He also said Mrs May had not listened to his advice on how to do a Brexit deal, saying: ""I would have done it much differently. ""I actually told Theresa May how to do it but she didn't agree, she didn't listen to me. She wanted to go a different route,"" he said. Tom Newton Dunn, the Sun journalist who interviewed Mr Trump, said the US president seemed ""sensitive"" and knew about the ""Trump baby"" inflatable. ""He's really quite stung by the criticism he's been getting,"" said Mr Newton Dunn. ""He knew all about the baby blimp. I think it hurt him."" This video can not be played The Sun journalist who interviewed Donald Trump says the president ""really cares"" what people in Britain think of him. The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said Mr Trump's interview had ""driven a bulldozer"" through Mrs May's claim that the UK would be able to get decent trade deals with the wider world, while sticking to the EU rules. But Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said things had ""moved on"" since Mr Trump's interview - which was carried out before he arrived in the UK - and the mood at Thursday night's dinner was ""fantastically positive and did focus a lot on trade"". The government does not see Mr Trump's behaviour as ""rude"", said Sir Alan, adding: ""Donald Trump is a controversialist. That's his style."" Trump raises questions over Brexit plans How we're welcoming Donald Trump to the UK Queen and US presidents through history Mayor of London Sadiq Khan defended his decision to allow the giant Trump baby inflatable to fly over London, saying: ""The idea that we limit the right to protest because it might cause offence to a foreign leader is a slippery slope."" And, responding to Mr Trump's criticism of his response to terrorism, Mr Khan said it was ""interesting"" that he ""is not criticising the mayors of other cities"" which have also experienced terror attacks. This video can not be played Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London: ""It's not for me to be the censor"" Meanwhile, Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said the PM ""should be standing up to [Mr Trump]"" after he ""slagged her off"", instead of holding his hand.

"The inflatable depicting Donald Trump as a baby has been flown over Parliament Square again as part of demonstrations against the US president. Some people say it is a legitimate protest against a US president with controversial policies, while others argue it is disrespectful to a democratically elected ally of the UK with whom the government hopes to agree a free-trade deal. The protesters got permission for the helium-filled 6m (19.7ft) high balloon to fly again over Parliament Square Gardens. It was cleared by the City Operations Unit at City Hall, where the Mayor of London is based. The group needed permission from the unit because Parliament Square Gardens is controlled by the Greater London Authority (GLA).You need permission,externalto do a whole range of things there, including holding a public gathering or standing on your own with a placard. Applicants have to show that they have sufficient insurance and there has to be a full risk assessment. The GLA told Reality Check that it's not its role to act as a censor, or decide what is or isn't a good protest. But it says it does work with the Metropolitan Police to reject anything containing illegal content, such as anything racist or homophobic. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) does not need to give its permission because the inflatable has been flying below 60m. But a CAA spokesperson said: ""Anyone flying a tethered balloon below 60m may, however, still require permission from air traffic control if operated within 'controlled airspace', such as over Central London."" The air traffic control provider Nats confirmed that the balloon would count as a non-standard flight in controlled airspace. Various parts of the country, such as the areas around airports and the centre of London, count as controlled airspace andpermission is required,externalif you want to do things like release balloons or lanterns, tether balloons or fly drones. Nats ruled last summer that the blimp would have no impact on normal air traffic operations. It told Reality Check that it receives many applications to tether balloons or tow banners behind light aircraft over London every year, most of which attract almost no attention from the public. It stressed that the shape of the balloon or content of the banner was not its responsibility.

"The US is a major trade and investment partner for the UK - by some measures the biggest of all. One issue on President Trump's agenda while he is in Britain will be whether - and how - to deepen that relationship. So just how intertwined are the two economies? As a single country the US is the largest export market for the UK. It is, however, well behind the EU when the bloc is viewed as a single market. There is some logic to viewing the EU in that way, as it has a single external trade policy and most of its members share the same currency. As a supplier of goods and services to the UK, the US comes in second, behind Germany. Viewed from the other side, from President Trump's perspective, the UK is an important trade partner to the US. For both imports and exports it comes behind the immediate neighbours, Canada and Mexico, with which the US has a trade deal: the North American Free Trade Agreement. The US also does more trade with China (at least it does before the full effects of new tariffs are felt). As a source of imports, the Germany and Japan are also ahead of the UK. Bilateral UK/US trade has grown in the past few years, after period of relative stagnation in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The chart below uses data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which suggest the UK exports more to the US than it imports. The US figures suggest the reverse. In principle they cannot both be true. The ONS says there aremany reasons why the figures might diverge,externaland they are working on it. The goods traded cover a wide range, but there a few types that stand out: aircraft coming (or flying) into the UK, as well as scientific instruments. Going the other way to the US: cars and works of art. There is a substantial trade in both directions in medicines and power generation equipment. There is also an important trans-Atlantic trade in services, including finance, business services and tourism. The interconnections are also apparent in the data on foreign direct investment (FDI). This means either establishing a business operation, or taking a controlling interest in one already up and running - usually defined as holding of 10% or more.

"Stansted is one airport that needs to improve its access for disabled passengers, the CAA found Four of the UK's 30 biggest airports are falling short in providing access for disabled travellers, the Civil Aviation Authority has said. Bottom of the list is Manchester, rated as ""poor"" for the second year running. Birmingham and London Stansted airports are also in need of improvement, the CAA said. London Gatwick airport,criticised by BBC journalist and wheelchair user Frank Gardner last year,is named as failing to meet expectations. Mr Gardner has said airlines and airports take too long to help disabled passengers disembark from planes. He has also criticised Heathrow forrepeatedly losing his wheelchairand forcing him to stay on the plane for ages after everyone else has disembarked. The CAA acknowledged that when things do go wrong, ""the impact on individuals is significant"", adding that there was still ""more to do to improve journeys for disabled passengers and those with reduced mobility"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, disability rights campaigner Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson said: ""Most of my inbox is full of complaints about trains or planes. ""The biggest complaint I get is inconsistency of service. You might fly out of an airport one week and get a great service, and it might be awful the next."" She added that ""a lot of disabled people don't complain"" because ""you might spend most of your life complaining, so the true number [affected] might be more"". Baroness Grey-Thompson says many disabled people don't complain Heathrow is now one of 10 airports listed as offering ""good"" access, having been considered ""poor"" last year. ""The passenger journey on arrival is now much quicker and generally seamless from aircraft to final point,"" the CAA said in its comments on the UK's busiest airport. Sixteen of the UK's top 30 airports are rated ""very good"" for disability access by the CAA - 10 more than last year. The CAA said Manchester's problems centred on ""long waiting times for assistance and issues with the recording and reporting of performance data"". In some cases, passengers had been left awaiting assistance for more than an hour, which the CAA said was ""not an acceptable situation"". It said Manchester had acknowledged the problem and had implemented a performance improvement plan. Disabled passenger Ted Stocker agrees that Manchester airport offered ""atrocious"" service to airline passengers with disability issues. Mr Stocker has an electric wheelchair but it is not made available to him after landing until he reaches the baggage carousel, which means he requires an airport wheelchair to leave the plane. Problems occurred recently for him at Manchester, he said, when air bridges were not in use. ""An air ambulance was required to allow safe disembarkation. This went to the wrong aircraft. The net result was we were kept on the aircraft for 45 minutes,"" Mr Stocker said. ""The crew for the next flight were on board."" Mr Stocker believes the root cause of the inconsistent service offered to disabled passengers at the airport was ""a lack of staff"". ""I have written to both Manchester airport and [airport services provider] OCS over the last two years. Both have promised improvements but the service has deteriorated from poor to atrocious over this period"". Gatwick, Stansted and Birmingham had been marked down for failing to provide sufficient information about their standards of service, the CAA said. ""In addition, for Stansted, we have concerns about potential delays to passengers' journeys on arrival from inbound flights."" All three airports were taking action to remedy these problems, the report said. The CAA said there were now more than three million requests for disability assistance at UK airports annually - a rise of nearly 80% since 2010. In all, 83% of people requesting assistance said they were satisfied with the help they received, while 54% were very satisfied. ""The vast majority of passengers' journeys go smoothly and disabled passengers should have even more confidence to travel from UK airports,"" the CAA said.

"The US is a major trade and investment partner for the UK - by some measures the biggest of all. One issue on President Trump's agenda while he is in Britain will be whether - and how - to deepen that relationship. So just how intertwined are the two economies? As a single country the US is the largest export market for the UK. It is, however, well behind the EU when the bloc is viewed as a single market. There is some logic to viewing the EU in that way, as it has a single external trade policy and most of its members share the same currency. As a supplier of goods and services to the UK, the US comes in second, behind Germany. Viewed from the other side, from President Trump's perspective, the UK is an important trade partner to the US. For both imports and exports it comes behind the immediate neighbours, Canada and Mexico, with which the US has a trade deal: the North American Free Trade Agreement. The US also does more trade with China (at least it does before the full effects of new tariffs are felt). As a source of imports, the Germany and Japan are also ahead of the UK. Bilateral UK/US trade has grown in the past few years, after period of relative stagnation in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The chart below uses data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which suggest the UK exports more to the US than it imports. The US figures suggest the reverse. In principle they cannot both be true. The ONS says there aremany reasons why the figures might diverge,externaland they are working on it. The goods traded cover a wide range, but there a few types that stand out: aircraft coming (or flying) into the UK, as well as scientific instruments. Going the other way to the US: cars and works of art. There is a substantial trade in both directions in medicines and power generation equipment. There is also an important trans-Atlantic trade in services, including finance, business services and tourism. The interconnections are also apparent in the data on foreign direct investment (FDI). This means either establishing a business operation, or taking a controlling interest in one already up and running - usually defined as holding of 10% or more. For Britain,the US is the largest source of FDI,external, as a single country. However, depending on exactly what is being measured, the EU as a whole can come out ahead. The US is also the largest destination for FDI abroad by British firms. Looked at from the US end, the UK is an important investment partner.

"Donald Trump (far right) says Nato members would ""substantially"" up their budgets Nato allies have cast doubt on US President Donald Trump's claim they had pledged to ""substantially"" raise their defence budgets, saying they simply remained committed to a 2014 deal. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg told US broadcaster CNN the allies had ""a commitment to spend 2%"" of their annual output (GDP) on defence budgets. Members agreed four years ago they would all reach that target by 2024. Mr Trump had hailed ""tremendous progress"" at Nato's summit in Brussels. Can Nato survive President Donald Trump? He has previously been highly critical of the alliance, complaining the US pays more than others. by Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent Welcome to Trump world. His press conference at Nato ranged from bluster to the bizarre but there is no doubting the president has had an effect. There was ""a new sense of urgency"" about increasing defence spending according to Jens Stoltenberg. But just how much extra money there will be and how quickly remains to be seen. Just as with his summit in North Korea, reality appears to be what President Trump decides it to be. The mere fact that the president of the alliance's essential member could even entertain the idea that the US might leave Nato is extraordinary. But by the end of the summit he said he believed in the alliance. This dissonance is at the heart of the Trump method. He gets results - or appears to - by both strengthening and weakening the alliance at the same time. Nato leaders will be glad this summit is over but remain uneasy as to just what Mr Trump might say when he meets Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. Exactly what took place - and what was agreed - behind closed doors at the two-day Nato summit in Brussels is not known. What is known is that Mr Trump called for an emergency meeting on Thursday morning with other Nato members. How much of Germany's gas comes from Russia? What does the US contribute to Nato? Unconfirmed reports suggested Mr Trump had threatened to go it alone if other nations did not meetthe alliance's target of 2% of their GDP by 2024. But by the time Mr Trump held a press conference, he was hailing the summit as a success. ""We made a tremendous amount of progress today,"" he said. ""It has been really amazing to see the level of spirit in that room."" It was, he said, ""presently unnecessary"" to consider quitting Nato. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""The United States was not being treated fairly"" He added the US commitment to Nato - which was established in 1949 with members agreeing that an attack against one would be considered an attack against them all - remained ""very strong"". Mr Trump went on to say the allies had ""substantially upped their commitment"" and would pay ""more quickly"". Mr Stoltenberg, he added, gave him ""total credit"" for the increased spending which, he said, he instigated during his first Nato meeting last year. Mr Stoltenberg said members had had a ""frank and open discussion"" which ""created a new sense of urgency"", and that the ""clear message from President Trump"" was ""having an impact"". Italy's new Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron also made it clear they had not signed up to anything more than what was agreed four years ago. Trump vows to end 'vicious' African conflicts ""Everyone agreed to raise spending, in line with commitments made in 2014,"" Mr Macron said, adding he was unconvinced by proposals to increase it to 4%. He said France had a clear strategy of analysing security threats and that he could not ask his government for ""tens of billions more"" beyond that. ""It's taxpayers' money we're talking about,"" he said. President Macron also said the meetings had had a different tone to Mr Trump's early morning tweets, which had been typically critical.

Mr Macron said the conversations had been more respectful, according to Reuters news agency. At the meeting, Mr Trump singled out Germany for criticism over its defence spending. Some reports suggest he also shocked other leaders in the room when he turned to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and referred to her by her first name. The Nato leaders also turned their attention to the conflict in Afghanistan. Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani was present for the second day of talks, and Mr Stoltenberg hopes the bloc will agree to fund Afghan security forces until 2024.

"Barbara Reddick (R) and Tyrone MacInnis A Canadian woman's first act upon winning the lottery was to threaten to sue her nephew for his half of the C$1.2m ($912,000; Â£690,000) win. ""See you in court,"" Barbara Reddick told Tyrone MacInnis as they both posed with the giant novelty cheque in Nova Scotia province.

Ms Reddick told reporters she only promised to share possible winnings from a smaller draw, not the jackpot. ""He was lucky, but not for half a million dollars,"" she said. Bernice Curley, chairwoman of the Margaree Forks Chase the Ace committee, said she was taken aback by the family feud. ""I'm a little bit disappointed that happened at the end,"" she told CBC. Chase the Ace is a lottery game popular all over Canada's east coast, and often raises money for charity, in this instance for the regional fire services.

After arriving, he was well enough to post the picture congratulating the NHS on its 70th birthday but ""went downhill quite rapidly from there"", said Mr Jackson. ""It seems there is something wrong with his lungs and he wasn't getting sufficient oxygen into his blood,"" he added. On Twitter, his mother thanked people for their ""lovely messages"".

"The police cordon on Thursday evening was near Zizzi restaurant in Castle Street The policing minister should help with the ""extraordinary level of demand"" facing officers following major incidents in Amesbury and Salisbury, Wiltshire's police commissioner said. Angus Macpherson said he had spoken to policing minister Nick Hurd to ensure the ""increased pressure"" was addressed. The comments were made shortly before police cordoned off a road in Salisbury after a man was reported to be ill. Officers later said there was ""no concern"" for the man's health. On Friday, police said the 33-year-old was cautioned after being arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. A test for the nerve agent Novichok was carried out on the man at Salisbury District Hospital, but proved negative. Police added there was also no ""wider risk to the public"". Mr Macpherson said the resources of forces across the country were also being stretched by the US presidential visit, the Royal International Air Tattoo and large summer events. He said Mr Hurd had reassured him ""the current approach to policing cordons, in relation to the ongoing major incidents in Amesbury and Salisbury, is under review to help me ensure that policing services more widely across Wiltshire and Swindon remain unaffected"". Police cordoned off the street after a man fell ill Mr Macpherson added: ""Wiltshire Police has received great support from almost every police force across the county since the first major incident was declared in March. ""Alongside the chief constable I couldn't be more grateful for the help and support of those forces, however, with more and more rest days being cancelled and annual leave requests being put on hold, we must now explore a different approach."" Police cordoned off Castle Street in Salisbury at about 18:20 BST on Thursday after a man in his 30s was reported to be ill, near the Zizzi restaurant where ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia dined before they fell ill. It was reopened just after 21:00 BST. On Twitter, Salisbury Police said the man had been taken to Salisbury District Hospital and was ""fully assessed by medical staff"". ""We understand that our initial response to the incident may have looked alarming, but we hope you appreciate why we needed to take this highly precautionary measure,"" they added.

"This video can not be played Mays greet Trumps for UK black-tie dinner US President Donald Trump has been welcomed to Blenheim Palace by Theresa May, on the first day of his UK visit. The black-tie dinner, with 150 invited guests, is expected to focus on post-Brexit trade, and comes days after Mr Trump said the UK was in ""turmoil"". He and First Lady Melania Trump arrived in the UK on Thursday afternoon. Protesters have gathered outside the US ambassador's residence in London, where the Trumps are staying tonight, and near Blenheim Palace. Extra security is in place to police the protests, but Mr Trump has said that Britons ""like me a lot"" and that he feels ""fine"" about any such protests. Latest updates on Trump's UK visit Trump: Nato states to up defence funding What is going to happen during Trump's trip? The Trumps left Winfield House at approximately 19:00 BST, with Mrs Trump wearing a full-length yellow dress with a pleated skirt. This video can not be played US President Donald Trump arrived at Stansted Airport for a two-day working visit Mr Trump, who will also spend time with the Queen during his two-day working visit, said earlier of the British public: ""I think they agree with me on immigration... You see what's going on throughout the world with immigration... I think that's why Brexit happened."" He said ""Brexit is Brexit"" and the British people ""voted to break it up, so I imagine that's what they'll do but maybe they're taking a different route - I don't know if that is what they voted for"". Mr Trump has recently been under fire for his own immigration policy,which resulted in the separation of immigrant families. Members of the cabinet and business leaders are at the Blenheim Palace dinner While protesters - for and against the president - gathered outside the venue The Trumps landed at Stansted Airport, Essex, at 13:50 BST before a helicopter took them to Winfield House in Regent's Park, where they are staying as guests of the US ambassador. He was met at the airport by dignitaries including International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and US ambassador Woody Johnson. Speaking at the Nato summit in Brussels before he arrived, Mr Trump said the UK was a ""hot spot right now"". This video can not be played Some of Mr Trump's supporters and protesters have been explaining their motivation His visit comes as the governmentpublishes its plans for the UK's relations with the EUafter Brexit. Earlier this weekMr Trump saidit was ""up to the people"" whether Mrs May stayed on as prime minister after two cabinet ministers resigned within hours over her Brexit policy. Protests were also held outside the US ambassador's residence in Regent's Park A large police presence has been building up outside Blenheim Palace. Police officers estimated there were more than 1,000 people demonstrating before Mr Trump's arrival. A group of protesters has also gathered outside a fenced-off area in Regent's Park, close to the entrance of Winfield House, where Mr Trump is staying. Among those attending the black-tie dinner at the ancestral home of former Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill are cabinet ministers and business leaders. Guests are dining on Scottish salmon, Hereford beef fillet and strawberries with clotted cream ice-cream. Only one person, the digital entrepreneur and philanthropist Baroness Martha Lane-Fox, has publicly refused the invitation. UK protests greet Trump's 'state visit on the sly' Police beds for Trump visit 'a disgrace' Trump raises questions over Brexit plans Mrs May said the UK visit would be an opportunity to boost trade links and strengthen co-operation on security. Along with trade and security ties, Downing Street said the other key areas to be discussed between the two leaders included Brexit and the Middle East. Ahead of Mr Trump's visit, Mrs May said that when the UK leaves the European Union ""there will be no alliance more important in the years ahead"". Mr Trump travelled to the UK from the Nato summit, where he said member countrieshave agreed to increase their military spending. The US president and first lady were greeted by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, the Queen's representative and the chief operating officer of Stansted Airport They then departed on Marine One to travel to the US ambassador's residence in central London Mr Trump had joked earlier this week that his meeting with Vladimir Putin in the Finnish capital Helsinki on Monday ""may be the easiest"" part of his European trip. Downing Street insisted Mrs May welcomed Mr Trump's decision to ""engage"" with the Russian leader. But she also warned Mr Trump not to ignore the ""malign behaviour"" of Russia. By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Since Donald Trump took office, Theresa May has had to disagree with him publicly over his decision to impose trade tariffs on EU steel, abandon the Iran nuclear deal, move the US embassy to Jerusalem, order a Muslim travel ban and retweet anti-Muslim messages from a British far right group. In turn, the US president has described Britain as being in political ""turmoil"", criticised its defence spending and shown no enthusiasm for coming to visit: in the 18 months of his presidency, Mr Trump has chosen to visit 17 other countries first. Whatever this relationship is, it can hardly be described as special. So this trip is about ticking a diplomatic box, getting a visit out of the way before its further delay became politically embarrassing. And as working visits go, it is on the minimal side: no Downing Street barbecue, no cabinet visit, no speech to both Houses of Parliament. The diplomatic aim will be to get through the visit without any gaffes, without upsetting the president, and without him saying anything disobliging about Brexit or a future trade deal. The UK and the US do have a good relationship at an institutional level, in the fields of defence, security and intelligence. The tricky bit is always the politics and the personalities. On Friday, Mrs May and Mr Trump will go to watch a joint counter-terrorism exercise by British and US special forces at a military base. Guess who's coming to dinner with Trump Trump talks of UK 'turmoil' ahead of trip 'Trump Baby' balloon banned from Turnberry The UK-US trade relationship in five charts Stormy Daniels arrested in Ohio - lawyer The pair will then travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for talks with the foreign secretary. The president and first lady will travel to Windsor on Friday afternoon to meet the Queen, before flying to Scotland to spend the weekend at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort. This part of the visit is being considered private. The Police Federation has warned the visit will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces as tens of thousands of people are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday - and in Glasgow on Friday. It has also complained that300 officers working during the visit will have to sleep on camp bedsin a gymnasium that has no hot water and restricted access to hot food. Security has been stepped up outside the US ambassador's residence in London where Mr Trump is staying Smaller demonstrations are also expected to be held across the UK, including Devon, Dundee, Edinburgh, Belfast, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool. Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit. But the balloonwill not be allowed to fly over his Turnberry golf course, Police Scotland have said.

"Donald Trump has raised questions about whether the UK's current Brexit plan is ""what they voted for"". The US president said ""Brexit is Brexit"" but it was turning out ""a little bit differently"" with the UK ""partially involved"" with the EU. ""Maybe they're taking a little bit of a different route,"" he went on. His comments at a press conference in Brussels were made before his visit to the UK - as details of Theresa May's Brexit plan were published. Asked about his remarks, Mrs May said her plan ""absolutely delivers on the Brexit people voted for"". Live: MPs updated on Brexit plans At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know Trump 'fine' with protests as he lands in UK Mr Trump backed a Leave vote ahead of the 2016 EU referendum, when he was a US presidential candidate, and he was asked for his views at the Nato summit press conference. ""It's not for me to say,"" the US president said. ""I'd like to see them be able to work it out so it can go quickly, whatever they work out."" It's not the first Mr Trump has had his say on the UK's relationship with the EU: In May 2016, before the EU referendum, he said he thought the UK was ""better off without"" the European Union ""I'm not making that as a recommendation, just my feeling,"" he said, describing the migration crisis as a ""horrible thing for Europe"" and blaming the EU for driving it. In August 2016, after the UK had voted to leave, he tweeted: ""They will soon be calling me Mr Brexit!"" In January 2017, shortly after becoming president, he gave aninterview to Tory MP Michael Gove,external- a prominent Leave campaigner and former journalist - saying: ""I think Brexit is going to end up being a great thing."" Also in that interview, the president said the EU was ""a vehicle for Germany"" and that the UK was ""so smart in getting out"". And asked why thought the UK voted to leave, he said that ""people don't want to have other people coming in and destroying their country"" Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, had encouraged a Remain vote, warning of the consequences for trade if the UK left the EU. Mrs May is under pressure over her proposals for a future trading relationship between the UK and EU. Senior ministers Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned, saying they cannot support the proposals. Some Tory backbenchers and other Brexit campaigners are also unhappy, saying it means the UK will be too closely tied to the EU. The government has now published aWhite Paper,externalgiving more details of its plans. They are aimed at avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland, securing frictionless trade with the EU while also leaving the single market and customs union and regaining control of the UK's borders. The UK would accept a ""common rule book"" for trade in goods, but not services. There are also plans for what is described as an ""association agreement"", with ""joint institutional arrangements"" between the EU and the UK. The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, after the 2016 referendum in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Brexit. The two sides are negotiating outstanding issues related to its departure as well as the outline of their future relationship once a proposed transition period comes to an end, on 31 December 2020. Both are aiming for an agreement by October, to allow enough time for the UK and European parliaments to vote on what is decided. Dominic Raab, who became Brexit secretary on Monday after Mr Davis quit, told people who are ""criticising or carping"" about the plan that they needed to come up with credible alternatives of their own. The White Paper is not the final deal, as the detailed talks are yet to take place with the EU. The EU has welcomed its publication and said it will respond when it has seen the plans in detail.

"PM Theresa May has set out her plans for Brexit - but EU bigwigs are in no hurry to comment for now Even the president of the United States now sees fit to weigh in on the Brexit path Theresa May is taking. Donald Trump has said, amongst other things, that if the prime minister is successful in her plan -formalised on Thursday in a White Paper,external- then that would make a future trade deal with the US far less likely. So how come key player Brussels remains so uncannily quiet about the paper? Brussels badgered the UK for months and months and months about coming up with a detailed proposal on how it envisions the future EU-UK relationship after Brexit. Now they have it, surely they have an opinion about it? As far as official responses go, the most we got from Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, was that he and his colleagues now need time to analyse the White Paper in detail. On the one hand: fair enough. It is a very dense document. But I feel the EU is hiding behind the paper's 98 pages of Brexit tech-talk. In private, EU diplomats make no secret at all of their rejection of large chunks of the White Paper. Plan 'delivers the Brexit UK voted for' - May Trump: Brexit plan could kill US trade deal Brussels has said since the beginning of Brexit negotiations that the UK can't pick and choose the ""best parts"" of EU membership and walk away from the rest when it leaves. Yet that's exactly how the White Paper is interpreted in EU circles. There is no way Michel Barnier will accept it as is. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, must calculate the best time to criticise the White Paper For Theresa May to get that ""deep and special"" access to the EU in trade terms, Brussels will certainly expect more concessions. But EU leaders are biding their time. Trying to calculate not if, but when, and how to get their criticisms across. They're very aware of the febrile political atmosphere in the UK and think if they make a quick comment or criticism of the White Paper, they'd be adding fuel to the fire. So if the EU is so keen for a soft Brexit - (of course we know, deep down, it would prefer no Brexit at all) - what concessions is Brussels prepared to make now to help shore up the prime minister's position in the political maelstrom at home? Worryingly few, is the answer if you're a fan of Theresa May or her White Paper. Brussels fears UK turmoil may lead to no-deal Brexit EU wonders if Theresa May has run out of 'Brexit fudge' Brexit: Why Brussels seems relaxed about the end game The EU still believes it holds pretty much all the cards in Brexit negotiations. I don't expect real whiffs of EU concessions before the last minute of the 11th hour this autumn. Can Theresa May hang on till then? And if she can, is she politically strong enough to strike a deal with Brussels and then sell it back home? Frankly, no one knows - and in the meantime, Brussels is stepping up contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. Not because the EU or Downing Street wants that - they really do not - but because the time allotted under EU law for a withdrawal agreement to be agreed and signed off by both parties is fast running out. In the meantime, EU diplomats try to sound upbeat: the White Paper is a great springboard from which to re-start face-to-face Brexit negotiations, they say. Those talks begin again behind closed doors on Monday. Trump and May meet amid Brexit storm May pitches trade deal at Trump dinner What happens now that a deal's been done?

"The inflatable depicting Donald Trump as a baby has been flown over Parliament Square again as part of demonstrations against the US president. Some people say it is a legitimate protest against a US president with controversial policies, while others argue it is disrespectful to a democratically elected ally of the UK with whom the government hopes to agree a free-trade deal. The protesters got permission for the helium-filled 6m (19.7ft) high balloon to fly again over Parliament Square Gardens. It was cleared by the City Operations Unit at City Hall, where the Mayor of London is based. The group needed permission from the unit because Parliament Square Gardens is controlled by the Greater London Authority (GLA).You need permission,externalto do a whole range of things there, including holding a public gathering or standing on your own with a placard. Applicants have to show that they have sufficient insurance and there has to be a full risk assessment. The GLA told Reality Check that it's not its role to act as a censor, or decide what is or isn't a good protest. But it says it does work with the Metropolitan Police to reject anything containing illegal content, such as anything racist or homophobic. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) does not need to give its permission because the inflatable has been flying below 60m. But a CAA spokesperson said: ""Anyone flying a tethered balloon below 60m may, however, still require permission from air traffic control if operated within 'controlled airspace', such as over Central London."" The air traffic control provider Nats confirmed that the balloon would count as a non-standard flight in controlled airspace. Various parts of the country, such as the areas around airports and the centre of London, count as controlled airspace andpermission is required,externalif you want to do things like release balloons or lanterns, tether balloons or fly drones. Nats ruled last summer that the blimp would have no impact on normal air traffic operations. It told Reality Check that it receives many applications to tether balloons or tow banners behind light aircraft over London every year, most of which attract almost no attention from the public. It stressed that the shape of the balloon or content of the banner was not its responsibility.
