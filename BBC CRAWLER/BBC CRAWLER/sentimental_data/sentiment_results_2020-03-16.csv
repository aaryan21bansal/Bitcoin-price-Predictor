"Les Miserables is among the shows that have closed for the foreseeable future Theatres in London's West End and around the UK have shut after PM Boris Johnson advised people to avoid such venues as coronavirus spreads. ""You should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues,"" he said. However, he stopped short of forcing venues to close, leaving some in the affected industries in limbo. The Society of London Theatre, which represents the West End, said theatres would close from Monday night until further notice. Sister organisation UK Theatre said its 165 venues around the country would take the same step. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It look as though we are now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve"" Speaking during his first daily news briefing on Monday, Mr Johnson said the government advice was that ""public venues such as theatres should no longer be visited"". He added: ""The proprietors of those venues are taking the logical steps that you would imagine, you are seeing the change happen already. ""As for enforcement, we have the powers if necessary but I don't believe it will be necessary to use those powers."" Mr Johnson said that from Tuesday mass gatherings were something ""we are now moving emphatically away from"". He also saidpeople should now avoid ""non-essential"" travel and contact with others. But many figures from the worlds of theatre, music and nightlife were angry that Mr Johnson advised people to stay away while not forcing venues to close, which could have given them financial protection. UK Music, which represents the music industry, said the hundreds of likely gig and festival cancellations would cause ""immense damage"", and Mr Johnson's comments risked exacerbating the problem. ""The prime minister's latest advice on mass gatherings has resulted in huge uncertainty and confusion over what exactly it will mean for the music industry,"" acting chief executive Tom Kiehl said. ""The government must spell out whether there will be a formal ban, when that might come into effect, which venues and events will be impacted and how long the measures will remain in place. ""The virus is having a catastrophic impact on the UK music industry and will threaten many jobs and businesses across our right across our sector.""

IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Patrick Gracey, producer of Tom Stoppard's latest play Leopoldstadt,said the prime minister,external""has just doomed an entire industry by telling people not to attend the theatre"". He added: ""By not enforcing a shutdown, production insurance will not apply so producers and shows will go bankrupt, and tens of  thousands of people will be without pay.""

Tamara Rojo, artistic director of the English National Ballet, said she wanted the government to come up with ""clear plans to how they are going to support the industry when we are all going dark"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is an industry that provides Â£111bn annually to the economy, that employs two million people, and a third of them are freelancers. ""So, for many, this sudden closure without a clear ban - which means that many venues, theatres, museums won't be able to claim compensation for a devastating loss - means a lot of uncertainty and potentially a lot of loss of employment and income."" Caroline Norbury, chief executive of the Creative Industries Federation,said,external: ""As the social distancing measures announced are only advisory, rather than an outright ban, we are deeply concerned that creative organisations and cultural spaces will find they are unable to claim compensation for the huge losses they will experience as a result of COVID-19."" Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre chief executive Julian Bird said: ""Closing venues is not a decision that is taken lightly, and we know that this will have a severe impact on many of the 290,000 individuals working in our industry."" The Royal Opera House,externalalso shut down immediately after the prime minister's press conference. Endgame, starring (left-right) Daniel Radcliffe, Jane Horrocks, Alan Cumming and Karl Johnson, was cancelled Meanwhile, the Museums Association called on the government to divert money from the planned Festival of Britain to help institutions that will find themselves in financial trouble. ""We are calling for an emergency fund to be created to support museums through this difficult period,"" MA director Sharon Heal said. ""The government had earmarked Â£120m for a Festival of Britain in 2022. We believe this should now be made available to support museums at risk of permanent closure as a result of the Coronavirus epidemic."" The Natural History Museum has closed its buildings in South Kensington and Tring; while Tate Modern, Tate Britain, Tate Liverpool and Tate St Ives will be shut until 1 May. London's Serpetine gallery is also shut, but the National Gallery remains open for now.

Earlier, Daniel Radcliffe's new play Endgame became the first major London production to be cancelled in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Citing travel and other restrictions,the Old Vic said,externalit was ""becoming increasingly impractical to sustain business as usual at our theatre"". The theatre warned that giving full refunds for all lost performances would be ""financially devastating for us"", so asked ticket-holders to consider the ticket price as a donation.

"Global stock markets have sunk again despite central banks around the world announcing a co-ordinated effort to ease the effects of the coronavirus. The Dow Jones index closed 12.9% down after President Donald Trump said the economy ""may be"" heading for recession. London's FTSE 100 ended 4% lower, and other major European markets saw similar slides. On Sunday, theUS Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zeroand launched a $700bn stimulus programme. It was part of co-ordinated action announced alongside the eurozone, the UK, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland. However, investors are worried that central banks now have few options left to combat the impact of the pandemic. The new governor of the Bank of England,Andrew Bailey, has pledged to take ""prompt action again""when necessary to stop the damage to the economy from the coronavirus pandemic. David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets, said that while central bankers were trying to calm the markets, ""in reality it is having the opposite effect"". ""The radical measures have sent out a very worrying message to dealers, and that is why they are blindly dumping stocks."" In New York, steep falls as markets opened triggered another automatic halt to trading, which is meant to curb panic selling. Before last week, such halts, known as circuit breakers, had not been used in more than two decades. But the sell-off continued after the 15-minute suspension, with the Dow losing nearly 3,000 points or 12.9%, its worst percentage drop since 1987. The wider S&P 500 dropped 11.9%, while Nasdaq dropped 12.3%. All three indexes are now down more than 25% from their highs. In London, firms in the travel sector saw big falls. Share in holiday firm Tui sank more than 27% after it said it would suspend the ""majority"" of its operations.  BA-owner IAG fell more than 25% after it said it would cut its flight capacity by at least 75% in April and May. The FTSE 250, which includes a number of well-known UK-focused companies, ended down about 7.8%. New Bank of England boss pledges prompt action US in emergency rate cut and huge stimulus plan Airlines slash more flights as coronavirus hits PM urges industry to help make NHS ventilators All the main European share indexes fell sharply, though they later regained some ground. France's Cac 40 index fell more than 5.7% and Germany's Dax dropped more than 5.3%. Earlier in Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 closed down 2.5% and the Shanghai Composite in China ended the day 3.3% lower. Oil prices, which have been shaken by a price war between exporters, fell again. Brent crude dropped by more than 10% to less than $32 a barrel while West Texas International crude fell more than 8% to less than $30 a barrel. Only a few weeks ago, the fear was that factories grinding to a halt in China's Hubei province could cause global growth to stumble briefly. Then it became clear that the economic pain was likely to be much more extensive. Now, with tourism and leisure activities grinding to a halt and supply chains threatened, a widespread recession may be more likely than not. In other words, economic growth going into reverse for two consecutive quarters, which would mean cash flow emergencies for some businesses, possible corporate failures and rising unemployment. The challenge for policymakers is to stop that downturn. Sunday's extravaganza by the Fed showed how central banks can go big. But interest rate cuts are of limited use; they won't tempt customers to go out and spend in Marseille or New York when the bars are closed, and flights cancelled. So the markets are looking to governments for more targeted support and bailout packages. But even that won't calm nerves altogether. As banks enact their own workplace contingencies, what traders really want is a sign that the virus caseload has peaked, and then that the financial convalescence is on track. On Sunday, the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, cut its interest rates by 100 basis points to a target range of 0% to 0.25% and said it would offer at least $700bn for support to the markets in the coming weeks. The move comes as local officials across the US shut schools, restaurants and bars, sports leagues cancel tournaments, and retailers such as Urban Outfitters, Nike, and Gap announce hundreds of temporary store closures. Speaking after the announcement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said: ""The virus is having a profound effect."" But stock markets dived as investors worried that the world's biggest central banks may now have very little ammunition left to deal with the effects of the coronavirus if the global economic climate continues to worsen. ""They [the Fed] pulled out whatever weapons they had and my sense is I think it may help initially but I don't think it goes much further because this is still a developing issue. They used up basically all their ammunition and we're down to sticks and stones,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at Slatestone Wealth. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. Alongside the Fed, five other central banks - the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, and the Swiss National Bank - also announced measures to make it easier to provide dollars to their financial institutions facing stress in credit markets. The move was designed to bring down the price banks and companies pay for US dollars, which has surged in recent weeks. Andrew Sentance - a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates - told the BBC's Today programme that banks were acting to ensure enough credit was flowing. ""There was some criticism around the financial crisis that central banks didn't move quickly enough,"" he said. ""I see this as a partly precautionary action for central banks to show that they are doing as much as possible to keep the wheels of the economy turning."" Mr Sentance added that any further cut to the base rate in the UK, to 0.10% for example, would be ""symbolic, because it wouldn't have that much impact on companies or individuals"". In other developments on Monday: Strains continued in other parts of the market typically seen as less risky, with gold prices down more than 5% at one point The Bank of Japan eased monetary policy by pledging to buy risky assets at double the current pace and announced a new loan programme to extend one-year, zero-rate loans to financial institutions Shares in Australia recorded their biggest daily percentage fall on record, as the benchmark ASX 200 index dropped 9.7% The Reserve Bank of Australia said it ""stands ready"" to pump more money into the country's financial system New Zealand's central bank lowered interest rates by 75 basis points as it prepared for a ""significant"" hit to the economy.

"This video can not be played Trump tells Americans to avoid public spaces US President Donald Trump has said the nationwide coronavirus emergency could last until the end of the summer or even longer. He said Americans over the next 15 days should not gather in groups of more than 10 and avoid bars, restaurants, food courts, gyms and crowds. At the White House, Mr Trump said the country is facing ""an invisible enemy"" that is ""so contagious"". The US has so far had more than 4,600 cases of the virus and 85 deaths. There have been more than 180,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 globally and over 7,100 deaths, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. Europe expands lockdown in battle against virus Shares plunge despite global central bank action Kind Canadians start 'caremongering' trend Under the US coronavirus task force's other recommendations announced by Mr Trump on Monday: All older Americans are urged to stay home, while work and schooling for everyone should be from home Discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits should be avoided and people should stay away from nursing homes or retirement facilities Anyone in a household who tests positive for the virus should remain at home along with everyone who lives there ""We've made the decision to further toughen the guidelines and blunt the infection now,"" a sombre-sounding Mr Trump told reporters. ""We'd much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it."" Asked how long the emergency would last, Mr Trump - who previously predicted the outbreak would be over in weeks - told reporters: ""They think August, could be July, could be longer than that."" White House coronavirus response co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx, who joined the president, said: ""If everybody in America does what we ask for over the next 15 days, we will see a dramatic difference."" She issued an appeal directly to millennials, asking them to limit social contact even though they are at lower risk of suffering if they contract the virus. ""They are the core people that will stop this virus,"" she said. ""We really want people to be separated."" Dr Birx also warned against socialising even if people feel well. ""We know that there is a large group of infected people who are asymptomatic, who continue to spread the virus,"" she said. This video can not be played Everything you need to know about the coronavirus explained in one minute Mr Trump also said the US ""may be"" heading for a recession. After his news conference, the stock market fell more than 12% in its worst day since 1987. The president, who has been criticised for initially playing down the seriousness of the virus, was asked by a reporter how he would score his administration's response to the crisis on a scale of one to 10. ""I'd rate it a 10,"" he said. ""I think we've done a great job."" The president said he did not yet plan to call for domestic travel restrictions or a national curfew or lockdown, though added: ""We may look at certain areas, certain hot spots as they call them."" Mr Trump told reporters he had not yet decided to close the US-Canada border, but said it was something the administration was considering. As the White House works on a financial assistance package for the beleaguered US airline industry, Mr Trump said it was right to help them as ""it's not their fault"". A trade group for major airlines said the sector requires more than $50bn (Â£40bn) in aid to survive. Canada to bar entry for most foreigners Coronavirus: US volunteers test first vaccine Why US testing failed - and can it catch up now? At least 40 US states have declared an emergency over the virus, and 29 states are shutting schools. Millions of Americans are already working from home and city centres around the country - including Times Square in New York - are drastically less crowded. On Monday, officials in the San Francisco Bay area issued a sweeping shelter-in-place order affecting nearly seven million people. San Francisco is placing itself on lockdown for three weeks from midnight on Tuesday. The California city will legally ban residents from venturing out of their homes except to meet basic needs including buying groceries or medicine. Gun sales are reportedly up in the US, including at this store in Culver City, California, where people queued outside New York, New Jersey and Connecticut announced a tri-state approach to closures, with a shutdown of bars, restaurants, cinemas, casinos and gyms from Monday night for ""as long as necessary"". Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, Ohio, California, Illinois, Michigan, Massachusetts and Washington state have also advised residents to avoid bars and restaurants. For the first time in over a century, the US Supreme Court postponed oral arguments. A Kentucky coronavirus patient has meanwhile been placed under police guard after refusing to quarantine himself. A local judge declared a state of emergency in order to force a ""self-isolation"" on the unnamed 53-year-old man. A Texas person was charged with making a ""false report"" after posting on social media over the weekend that they had tested positive for the virus. CNN reports that Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida is closed for deep cleaning after several individuals who visited the golf club tested positive for coronavirus. The outbreak is also disrupting primary season in the US as Democrats hold state-by-state votes to pick a candidate who will challenge Mr Trump in November. It is now a two-man race between Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders. On Tuesday, four states are scheduled to vote: Arizona, Illinois, Florida and Ohio. But Ohio's governor said late on Monday polls would be postponed to comply with public health warnings against gatherings of more than 50 people. Georgia, Louisiana and Kentucky have already postponed their contests due to the outbreak. Wyoming has suspended in-person voting. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

First a recap on another day of developments that at times came at breakneck speed - here's the main points:  Read more onhow to steps to take to prevent infectionandhow to protect your mental healthduring the pandemic.  Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the UK's Labour Party, has this evening been holding talks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Downing Street. Speaking afterwards to the BBC, he said he supported many of the measures announced earlier but was critical of the governmentâs communication strategy and lack of support for citizens on low incomes. ""If this virus affects us all, as it does, we all have to be treated fairly and properly in this,"" he said. He said he had told the PM that testing for the virus, particularly among NHS workers was ""inadequate"" and he was worried about the lack of ventilators and trained staff. Mr Corbyn, who stands down next month, also said he would not be self-isolating even though heâs over
70. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The UK's plan has shifted because the
scientific modelling showed we were on course for a ""catastrophic
epidemic"". A strategy of just slowing the spread of
the virus, but not trying to stop it, would have overwhelmed intensive care
units. The modelling by Imperial College London
has been heavily informed by the experience in Italy and is influencing
decisions at the heart of government. Their calculations predicted 260,000
deaths in the UK. Instead the plan is to drive down the
number of cases to very low levels, which the models predict will limit deaths
from coronavirus to the thousands or tens of thousands. However, this approach comes with a
major problem - there is no exit strategy. Without the immunity that would build up
if people were infected, then cases would soar as soon as measures are lifted. The report said these could need to be
in place until a vaccine is available, which could take up to 18 months. We are in this for the long haul. Public Health England has published more details about thesocial distancing recommendations announced,externalearlier by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It says those aged over 70 and pregnant women are among those who should ""stringently"" follow the advice on avoiding non-essential use of public transport, working from home and not having friends and family to visit. And it warns that anyone under 70 with a range of underlying health conditions is also at increased risk of suffering ""severe"" illness. The conditions it lists include:  It also gives some tips to people on how to look after their mental health in the tough weeks and months ahead. It says people shouldn't fear going for a walk outdoors if they stay more than 2 metres from others. Other advice includes:  France will deploy 100,000 police officers to ensure that people abide by restrictions on movement to avoid the spread of coronavirus, its interior minister has said. Christophe Castaner said people who venture outside their homes will have to justify their reason for doing so. Speaking at a news conference, he said people may be fined if they break the rules. Exceptions will be made in some circumstances, including for travel between home and work, Mr Castaner said. ""Too many people still disregard the health instructions given,"" Mr Castaner said. His announcement comes after French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a series of drastic new measures designed to stem the spread of coronavirus. From
Tuesday, people should stay at home unless they are buying groceries, travelling to work, exercising or seeking medical
care, Mr Macron said. Helier CheungBBC News A drive-through in a health centre in West Palm Beach, Florida offers testing The World Health Organization warned on Monday that testing is essential to stopping the pandemic. Questions have been raised in the US about the government's approach to testing and how widely available test kits are. So what's the situation there? It's hard to tell - and
even officials have struggled to say how many individuals have been tested. According to the latest figures,external, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and public
health labs have tested over 25,100 specimens for Coronavirus. But that number doesn't give a full picture of how many people were tested -
because many people provide more than one specimen for testing, and many
private health laboratories are also conducting tests. One project by The Atlantic estimates that 41,550 people in the US
have been tested. But that's still fewer than many other countries with smaller
populations - including South Korea, which has tested 240,000, and the UK,
which has tested 44,100. The government has come under heavy criticism - from both
Democratic and Republican lawmakers - over the lack of tests. President Trump
has now promised that five million tests will be available within a month - but
also warned: ""We don't want everyone running out and
taking [the test] - only if you have certain symptoms."" Read more about the US and coronavirus testing here. Some British doctors working overseas are returning to the UK to help treat patients in the coronavirus outbreak, one doctor has told BBC News. Red Elmahdi, who completed her medical training in the UK before specialising in epidemiology research, has flown back from the lab where she was working in Denmark. ""Thereâs little point my sitting around in lockdown doing research from home in Denmark when Iâm seeing the mounting strain on the NHS,"" she explains. However Dr Elmahdi says there has been no central co-ordination and she is relying on her locum agency to be placed in hospital. Dr Red Elmahdi is a specialist in sexually transmitted infectious disease epidemiology Food banks in the UK say they are experiencing a shortage of basic items because shoppers are stockpiling as fears grow over the spread of coronavirus. Organisers of one in Islington, north London,announced they had decided to close due,externalto dwindling food supplies and a desire to protect the ""health and safety of our volunteers and clients"". Other food banks across the UK have said some items including pasta and rice are hard to get. It comes after UK supermarketsurged shoppers not to buy more than they needamid concern over coronavirus-linked stockpiling.  Rajesh Makwana says his food bank in Brent was pre-packaging goods into parcels to prevent germs spreading President Trump said postponing US elections would be ""unnecessary"" President Trump has rebuffed growing calls for US elections to be postponed, calling such a move ""unnecessary"". Four US states - Ohio, Illinois,
Florida and Arizona - are scheduled to host primaries for the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday. Ohioâs Republican governor Mike DeWine has said he will file a lawsuit to postpone the election in his state until 2 June, 2020. In his news conference at the White House, Mr Trump did not seem open to the suggestion of postponement. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing,"" Mr Trump said. ""I think postponing is unnecessary."" He suggested elections could be held safely by ""spreading people out"". âThey have lots of room in lots of electoral places,â Mr Trump said.

The primaries will determine which Democrat faces Mr Trump in November's presidential election, with Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders both vying for the candidacy.  Earlier this evening the UK government announced a number of new measures including advising people to avoid gatherings and crowded places. Here is a taste of how theatres in the UK have reacted:  Head of the Creative Industries Federation and Creative England Caroline Norbury says the measures have the potential to ""devastate"" the UK's theatres, museums, cinemas and venues as well as those who work in the industry. She says that as the social-distancing measures are ""only advisory rather than an outright ban"", creative organisations may be unable to claim compensation for the losses they could experience. ""It is vital that government puts in place support to ensure that our world-leading creative sector is able to survive Covid-19,"" she added. Howard JohnsonPhilippines Correspondent, BBC News Authorities have started implementing the lockdown in Manila Foreign tourists intending to leave the Philippines from international airports in the countryâs main Luzon region have been given 72 hours to do so, starting from 16:00 GMT today. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte earlier announced that Luzon,
which has an estimated population of more than 50 million people and includes
the capital city, Metro Manila, is to be placed under strict âenhanced community
quarantineâ until 12 April. The British embassy in Manila says âa small numberâ of British nationals are affected. On Sunday, Britons were advised against all but essential travel to the Philippines. The government says the country currently has a total of 142 confirmed Covid-19 cases with 12 deaths. But Dr Manuel Dayrit, the countryâs health secretary during the SARS outbreak of 2003, believes the number is relatively low compared with other countries because not enough preemptive testing has been taking place. âWe are actually limited by the fact we are not doing any testing for COVID-19 in the community,â Dr Dayrit told BBC News. âWe are only testing the patients that show up in the hospitals usually with pneumonia, so we can only speculate how extensive community spread is.â  It's been a whirlwind few hours with dramatic announcements from both sides of the Atlantic and beyond. Here's what you need to know: In the UK:  In other European countries:  In the US:  In the markets:    Aintree Racecourse has announced that this year's Grand National on 4 April will not take place because of
the coronavirus pandemic. The Grand National is one of the key events in the horse racing calendar and attracts an estimated global TV audience of 600 million.

Jeremy Corbyn - leader of the UK's Labour Party - has called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to extend full sick pay and lost earnings protection to all workers required to self-isolate. He is also urging the government to reduce the waiting time for new universal credit claimants, ban eviction of tenants affected by the outbreak and raise statutory sick pay in line with other European countries. ""Jeremy Corbyn will emphasise that Labour stands with all communities during this crisis, and that the opposition will hold the government to account to ensure no-one is left behind,"" a party spokesman said. Earlier today, Mr Johnson advised everyone in the UK to avoid ""non-essential"" travel and contact with others to fight the spread of Covid-19. Read all the details here. Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Countries in the Western Balkans and the former Yugoslavia have closed schools, shops and borders to contain the coronavirus outbreak. In Sloveniaâs capital, Ljubljana, the Monday afternoon streets were quieter than a standard Sunday morning. Public transport was not running, though adverts on the video screens next to the deserted bus stops reminded the non-existent passengers to practise good hygiene. Further down the Balkan peninsula, borders have closed. Croatia imposed a 14-day self-isolation period for many arrivals; Serbia has simply sealed its borders to almost everyone. As Serbia is not an EU member, it is counting on help from elsewhere. President Aleksandar Vucic says China is suppling masks, ventilators and doctors. Albania imposed a strict lockdown over the weekend and imposed a 6pm curfew from today. Even a daytime stroll in the park has been ruled out by Prime Minister Edi Rama. âHiking is not vital at this time of war,â he said on his Facebook page. Ljubljana's usually busy streets are now deserted This video can not be played WATCH - coronavirus questions answered If you've got some questions about the virus, and particularly the response in the UK, this video is for you. The BBC's Clive Myrie is joined by BBC Health Editor Hugh Pym and other experts to answer questions including:  Russia has temporarily banned all foreigners from entering the country, following other nations worldwide in restricting travel over the coronavirus pandemic. The ban will come into effect on 18 March and will remain in place until 1 May, the government said on Monday. Exceptions will be made for diplomats and permanent residents. Some 93 cases of the virus have been reported so far in Russia. Russia has beenaccused of spreading disinformation about the new coronavirus outbreak on social media. It has flatly denied those allegations. It has also been slow compared to other countries in starting testing. This has led to speculation that the real number of cases is much higher than
reported. Russia's government says up to 100,000 testing kits are being produced daily to
start testing in large numbers.  Swiss residents like Nadine are heading to the bars for a last beer Our reporter Imogen Foulkes has this from Geneva: People here expected the state of emergency - with cases of the
virus rising fast, many thought the government should have declared it on
Friday, when it announced that schools would close. But now that it has happened, Switzerland, one of the
richest countries in the world, is facing at least a month with everything but
the bare essentials closed. There will be no bars, no cafes, no restaurants, no
sports, no nightclubs, no cinemas, no museums. This evening in Bern people are heading to the bars for a last
beer. Student Nadine is disappointed that her upcoming birthday party wonât
happen, but says complaining feels a bit like a ""first world problem"". Actually
itâs quite fascinating,"" she says, ""we are at a pivotal moment in history"". Historic it
certainly is: to support hospitals the Swiss government today mobilised the
army, the first time that has happened since the start of World War Two. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has closed 12.9% down, in another sign that markets fear a global recession could be on the horizon. It's the biggest percentage daily drop since the outbreak began, and the largest in one day since the Black Monday crash in 1987. Markets dropped around the world today despite a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in the US and co-ordinated action by central banks around the world to shore up confidence. The Dow closed as President Trump said a US recession could be on the horizon and that the virus outbreak could last until August. The other main US indexes - the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq - also plunged 12% in trading on Monday. President Trump has said the US could be heading for a recession due to the coronavirus outbreak. Reporters at the White House press conference are deliberately putting empty seats between them, in a social distancing effort. The US government has faced strong criticism for its slow pace of testing. Mr Trump said that before instituting mass testing, South Korea had experienced ""tremendous problems and great numbers of death"". ""This is something that is an invisible enemy,"" he said, adding that there was now a cross-party effort to fight it. ""My focus is on getting rid of this problem. This virus problem. After that everything else is going to fall into place."" ""We're gonna back the airlines 100 percent. It's not their fault its nobody's fault,"" he continued, but added: ""Unless you go to the regional source."" Read our main story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The French-German border is allowing only goods and commuters to pass Germany has become the latest country to close borders as European nations try to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Its borders with France, Austria and Switzerland were shut on Monday, except for commercial traffic. Spain will also close its borders later while France is considering more stringent lockdowns. Meanwhile, the European Commission has proposed a temporary ban on non-essential travel to the European Union. The measure would initially last for 30 days, and long-term residents in the EU, family members of EU nationals and diplomats would be exempt as well as cross-border and healthcare workers and people transporting goods. The restriction must be approved by the 26 states that make up the borderless Schengen area. Non-Schengen members - including the UK - would be invited to take part.

"Travel restrictions and a slump in demand due to the coronavirus have forced airlines to cancel most flights and temporarily reduce staff. Virgin Atlantic will cut four-fifths of its flights and has asked staff to take eight weeks of unpaid leave. Ryanair and EasyJet are grounding most of their fleets, while BA owner IAG is to cut capacity by 75%. Norwegian Air has cancelled thousands of flights and will temporarily lay off more than 7,500 staff. Holiday company Tui has said it will suspend the ""majority"" of its operations, affecting ""package travel, cruises and hotel"" bookings. Passenger numbers and bookings have plummeted in recent weeks as countries closed their borders and holiday makers cancelled trips. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate UK LATEST:What is the 'delay' phase? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Forecasts by the research firm Centre for Aviation now predict that most airlines in the world will be bankrupt by the end of May unless they receive financial support. ""Coordinated government and industry action is needed - now - if catastrophe is to be avoided,"" the firm said in a statement. ""Demand is drying up in ways that are completely unprecedented. Normality is not yet on the horizon."" In the US, airlines are in talks with the government about rescue funding, after announcing dramatic cuts to flight schedules and other measures. They are seeking up to $50bn in aid, according to the Wall Street Journal. In the UK, Virgin Atlantic has asked the government for support for the sector, including emergency credit of up to Â£7.5bn. EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren also called for government intervention to support the aviation industry. ""European aviation faces a precarious future and it is clear that co-ordinated government backing will be required to ensure the industry survives and is able to continue to operate when the crisis is over,"" he said. Virgin said that it was going to reduce its services to focus on ""core routes"". Its London Heathrow-Newark route will be cut immediately. The airline will also ask staff to take eight weeks unpaid leave over the next three months, with the cost spread over six months' salary. Virgin said it was doing this to avoid job losses, although it is also offering a voluntary redundancy package to all employees. Norwegian Air's temporary reduction in staff numbers will affect pilots, cabin crew and maintenance workers, roughly equalling 90% of its workforce. The coronavirus outbreak has had a severe impact on demand for air travel Over the weekend, Scandinavian airline SAS said it would temporarily halt most of its flights until conditions for commercial aviation improved. As a result, the airline said it would temporarily lay off up to 10,000 employees, or 90% of its workforce. IAG, which owns British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, said it had suspended flights to China, reduced capacity on Asian routes, cancelled all flights to, from and within Italy as well as making other changes to its network. ""There is no cash whatsoever coming in the doors,"" said aviation analyst John Strickland, who warned that airlines could lose money very quickly, despite such drastic measures. Mr Strickland described the reduction in airlines' operations as ""stunning"", warning that airlines can lose money ""very, very quickly"". Stemming the loss by cancelling flights and parking aircraft is one thing, he said, ""but airlines are both capital and labour intensive so there has to be support of the costs that cannot be avoided even if an airline is grounded"". Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, said he expects demand to remain weak well into the summer. BA's boss sent a memo to staff last week questioning the airline's survival if it did not make urgent changes. EasyJet said it had cancelled a ""further significant"" number of flights. ""These actions will continue on a rolling basis for the foreseeable future and could result in the grounding of the majority of the EasyJet fleet,"" it said. Mass cancellations of flights in an unprecedented situation may leave passengers unsure of their rights. For those yet to fly out, it is relatively straightforward - you should be given a refund or, in some cases, the option to rebook for another date. If this is part of a package holiday, then the entire cost of the holiday will be refunded. A separate hotel booking will require a call to the hotel, asking for leeway, or perhaps a travel insurance claim if the policy covers you. For those trying to get home, an airline has a duty of care to get you back if they have cancelled your flight. This may mean flying with another airline or putting you on a different mode of transport. If an extra overnight stay is required, the airline should pay for that as well as the food you need. However, for those who accept a refund for a cancelled return flight, the airline's duty of care ends at that point. You would then have to get yourself home, which could be difficult given the current restrictions.

"France has ordered people to stay at home and only go out for essential duties The European Commission is planning to ban all non-essential travel to the European Union after more countries within the bloc closed their borders to try to limit the spread of coronavirus. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she would ask leaders to implement the measures on Tuesday. ""The less travel, the more we can contain the virus,"" she said.

Ms von der Leyen said that long-term residents, family members of EU nationals and diplomats would be exempt as well as cross-border and healthcare workers and people transporting goods. The measures would be in place for at least 30 days. Some 26 states are part of the Schengen agreement, which allows people to move freely between EU countries without border checks, but several countries have unilaterally closed borders in recent days in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus. This prompted the commission to propose that the bloc act in a more unified fashion and restrict entry to the union as a whole, on the urging of Mr Macron. Citizens of non-Schengen EU member states will also be invited to apply the travel ban. Travel with Switzerland and the UK will be preserved. ""It is more effective and less disruptive than measures to close borders within Europe, which must be avoided to allow cross-border workers to continue their activity and essential goods to circulate in Europe,"" said Mr Macron.

But the enemy is here, invisible, untouchable... and is advancing,"" he said. The country will also close its land borders from midday (11:00 GMT) on Tuesday. The restrictions in France will be in place for at least 15 days, Mr Macron said. Citizens must carry a form spelling out their reasons for travel and the fine for transgressors will be set soon at â¬135 ($150; Â£123).

"Norwegian Air is set to cancel 4,000 flights and temporarily lay off about half of its staff because of the coronavirus outbreak. The budget airline said the changes would apply until the end of May and numbers may increase. Its boss said new restrictions on travel between the US and mainland Europe put ""extra pressure on an already difficult situation"". Analysts say airlines have been dealt another ""body blow"" by the travel ban. Jacob Schram, chief executive of Norwegian, said this was ""an unprecedented situation"". He called on ""international governments to act now to ensure that the aviation industry can protect jobs and continue to be a vital part of the global economic recovery"". The airline has decided to ground 40% of its long-haul fleet and cancel up to a quarter of its short-haul flights. The company, which is looking for a cash injection, employs 1,200 people in UK. But all routes between London Gatwick and the US will continue to operate as normal. The airline industry is already facing an economic hit of $113bn (Â£88bn) from the effects of the outbreak on passenger numbers. Analysts predict this financial loss could grow substantially from the new travel ban. There are fears that some weaker airlines could go bust. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced sweeping travel restrictions on 26 European countries in an attempt to combat the spread of coronavirus. The ban applies to travellers from countries that are members of the Schengen border-free travel area. The UK, Ireland and other non-Schengen countries are unaffected. US citizens are also exempt. Chinese airlines see coronavirus passenger slump Coronavirus: Airlines cancel thousands of flights Stocks fall amid US-Europe coronavirus travel ban ""It is another body blow for many airlines in need of central government support in these incredibly difficult times,"" said John Grant from global travel data firm OAG.

Many airlines are already under the cosh from the effects of coronavirus, and thousands of flights have been cancelled worldwide. Korean Air has warned that the coronavirus impact could threaten its survival, and UK airline Flybe, which was already struggling, collapsed last week,saying the coronavirus outbreak was partly to blame. Airlines around the world are now assessing the impact of Mr Trump's surprise 30-day ban and how it will affect revenues. Analysts predict some airlines could fall into administration. There are nearly 400 daily flights from Europe to the US, according to FlightAware, a flight-tracking service. ""In a crisis like this, cash is king,"" said Michael Duff, managing director of The Airline Analyst. He said transatlantic routes tended to be dominated by the major airlines, who should get through the crisis, assuming it lasts three to six months. ""Secondary players and regional and national European carriers are definitely facing severe survivability risk,"" he added. Association of Flight Attendants-CWA President Sarah Nelson called the ban ""irresponsible"". ""There is no explanation for how this will help fight the spread of the virus,"" she said. ""It makes little sense when the virus is already in the US."" ""Without any consultation with the industry, we don't even know what this means,"" she added. The Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) urged governments to refrain from introducing travel restrictions.

"Travel restrictions and a slump in demand due to the coronavirus have forced airlines to cancel most flights and temporarily reduce staff. Virgin Atlantic will cut four-fifths of its flights and has asked staff to take eight weeks of unpaid leave. Ryanair and EasyJet are grounding most of their fleets, while BA owner IAG is to cut capacity by 75%. Norwegian Air has cancelled thousands of flights and will temporarily lay off more than 7,500 staff. Holiday company Tui has said it will suspend the ""majority"" of its operations, affecting ""package travel, cruises and hotel"" bookings. Passenger numbers and bookings have plummeted in recent weeks as countries closed their borders and holiday makers cancelled trips. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate UK LATEST:What is the 'delay' phase? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Forecasts by the research firm Centre for Aviation now predict that most airlines in the world will be bankrupt by the end of May unless they receive financial support. ""Coordinated government and industry action is needed - now - if catastrophe is to be avoided,"" the firm said in a statement. ""Demand is drying up in ways that are completely unprecedented. Normality is not yet on the horizon."" In the US, airlines are in talks with the government about rescue funding, after announcing dramatic cuts to flight schedules and other measures. They are seeking up to $50bn in aid, according to the Wall Street Journal. In the UK, Virgin Atlantic has asked the government for support for the sector, including emergency credit of up to Â£7.5bn. EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren also called for government intervention to support the aviation industry. ""European aviation faces a precarious future and it is clear that co-ordinated government backing will be required to ensure the industry survives and is able to continue to operate when the crisis is over,"" he said. Virgin said that it was going to reduce its services to focus on ""core routes"". Its London Heathrow-Newark route will be cut immediately. The airline will also ask staff to take eight weeks unpaid leave over the next three months, with the cost spread over six months' salary. Virgin said it was doing this to avoid job losses, although it is also offering a voluntary redundancy package to all employees. Norwegian Air's temporary reduction in staff numbers will affect pilots, cabin crew and maintenance workers, roughly equalling 90% of its workforce. The coronavirus outbreak has had a severe impact on demand for air travel Over the weekend, Scandinavian airline SAS said it would temporarily halt most of its flights until conditions for commercial aviation improved. As a result, the airline said it would temporarily lay off up to 10,000 employees, or 90% of its workforce. IAG, which owns British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, said it had suspended flights to China, reduced capacity on Asian routes, cancelled all flights to, from and within Italy as well as making other changes to its network. ""There is no cash whatsoever coming in the doors,"" said aviation analyst John Strickland, who warned that airlines could lose money very quickly, despite such drastic measures. Mr Strickland described the reduction in airlines' operations as ""stunning"", warning that airlines can lose money ""very, very quickly"". Stemming the loss by cancelling flights and parking aircraft is one thing, he said, ""but airlines are both capital and labour intensive so there has to be support of the costs that cannot be avoided even if an airline is grounded"". Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, said he expects demand to remain weak well into the summer. BA's boss sent a memo to staff last week questioning the airline's survival if it did not make urgent changes. EasyJet said it had cancelled a ""further significant"" number of flights. ""These actions will continue on a rolling basis for the foreseeable future and could result in the grounding of the majority of the EasyJet fleet,"" it said. Mass cancellations of flights in an unprecedented situation may leave passengers unsure of their rights. For those yet to fly out, it is relatively straightforward - you should be given a refund or, in some cases, the option to rebook for another date. If this is part of a package holiday, then the entire cost of the holiday will be refunded. A separate hotel booking will require a call to the hotel, asking for leeway, or perhaps a travel insurance claim if the policy covers you. For those trying to get home, an airline has a duty of care to get you back if they have cancelled your flight. This may mean flying with another airline or putting you on a different mode of transport. If an extra overnight stay is required, the airline should pay for that as well as the food you need. However, for those who accept a refund for a cancelled return flight, the airline's duty of care ends at that point. You would then have to get yourself home, which could be difficult given the current restrictions.

"France has ordered people to stay at home and only go out for essential duties The European Commission is planning to ban all non-essential travel to the European Union after more countries within the bloc closed their borders to try to limit the spread of coronavirus. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she would ask leaders to implement the measures on Tuesday. ""The less travel, the more we can contain the virus,"" she said. Meanwhile, tough new measures in France restricting movement from the home are coming into effect on Tuesday. The latest World Heath Organization (WHO) figures,externallist 173,000 infections globally and 7,000 deaths. A visual guide to the pandemic UK to unveil new financial measures to support economy They were alluded to in French President Emmanuel Macron 's televised address to his nation on Monday. He said that ""all trips between non-European countries and EU countries will be suspended"". Ms von der Leyen said that long-term residents, family members of EU nationals and diplomats would be exempt as well as cross-border and healthcare workers and people transporting goods. The measures would be in place for at least 30 days. Some 26 states are part of the Schengen agreement, which allows people to move freely between EU countries without border checks, but several countries have unilaterally closed borders in recent days in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus. This prompted the commission to propose that the bloc act in a more unified fashion and restrict entry to the union as a whole, on the urging of Mr Macron. Citizens of non-Schengen EU member states will also be invited to apply the travel ban. Travel with Switzerland and the UK will be preserved. ""It is more effective and less disruptive than measures to close borders within Europe, which must be avoided to allow cross-border workers to continue their activity and essential goods to circulate in Europe,"" said Mr Macron. The proposal was to be discussed in a video-summit with EU leaders on Tuesday afternoon hosted by European Council chief Charles Michel. LIVE UPDATES:Follow the latest developments here EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Mr Macron has ordered people to stay at home and only go out for essential duties from 11:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Tuesday. He said the previous measures, including the closing of schools, cafes and non-essential shops, had proved insufficient. ""Even while medics were warning about the gravity of the situation, we saw people get together in the parks, busy markets and restaurants and bars that did not respect the order to close,"" he said in the 20-minute televised address. It was watched by a record 35.3 million people, Le Monde reported, 96% of the people watching TV at the time. ""We are at war... we're fighting neither another army nor our own nation. But the enemy is here, invisible, untouchable... and is advancing,"" he said. The country will also close its land borders from midday (11:00 GMT) on Tuesday. The restrictions in France will be in place for at least 15 days, Mr Macron said. Citizens must carry a form spelling out their reasons for travel and the fine for transgressors will be set soon at â¬135 ($150; Â£123). Some 100,000 civil servants and soldiers will be deployed nationwide to carry out checks. President Macron also offered reassurance to businesses, saying: ""No French company, whatever its size, will be exposed to the risk of collapse"".

"Les Miserables is among the shows that have closed for the foreseeable future Theatres in London's West End and around the UK have shut after PM Boris Johnson advised people to avoid such venues as coronavirus spreads. ""You should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues,"" he said. However, he stopped short of forcing venues to close, leaving some in the affected industries in limbo. The Society of London Theatre, which represents the West End, said theatres would close from Monday night until further notice. Sister organisation UK Theatre said its 165 venues around the country would take the same step. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It look as though we are now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve"" Speaking during his first daily news briefing on Monday, Mr Johnson said the government advice was that ""public venues such as theatres should no longer be visited"". He added: ""The proprietors of those venues are taking the logical steps that you would imagine, you are seeing the change happen already. ""As for enforcement, we have the powers if necessary but I don't believe it will be necessary to use those powers."" Mr Johnson said that from Tuesday mass gatherings were something ""we are now moving emphatically away from"". He also saidpeople should now avoid ""non-essential"" travel and contact with others. But many figures from the worlds of theatre, music and nightlife were angry that Mr Johnson advised people to stay away while not forcing venues to close, which could have given them financial protection. UK Music, which represents the music industry, said the hundreds of likely gig and festival cancellations would cause ""immense damage"", and Mr Johnson's comments risked exacerbating the problem. ""The prime minister's latest advice on mass gatherings has resulted in huge uncertainty and confusion over what exactly it will mean for the music industry,"" acting chief executive Tom Kiehl said. ""The government must spell out whether there will be a formal ban, when that might come into effect, which venues and events will be impacted and how long the measures will remain in place.

Tamara Rojo, artistic director of the English National Ballet, said she wanted the government to come up with ""clear plans to how they are going to support the industry when we are all going dark"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is an industry that provides Â£111bn annually to the economy, that employs two million people, and a third of them are freelancers. ""So, for many, this sudden closure without a clear ban - which means that many venues, theatres, museums won't be able to claim compensation for a devastating loss - means a lot of uncertainty and potentially a lot of loss of employment and income."" Caroline Norbury, chief executive of the Creative Industries Federation,said,external: ""As the social distancing measures announced are only advisory, rather than an outright ban, we are deeply concerned that creative organisations and cultural spaces will find they are unable to claim compensation for the huge losses they will experience as a result of COVID-19.""

""We are calling for an emergency fund to be created to support museums through this difficult period,"" MA director Sharon Heal said. ""The government had earmarked Â£120m for a Festival of Britain in 2022.

"The new Bank of England governor has pledged to take fresh ""prompt action again"" when necessary to stop the damage to the economy from coronavirus. Andrew Bailey took over from current Bank governor Mark Carney on Monday. Mr Bailey was speaking hours after the US central bank slashed interest rates and the Bank of England alongside other central banks acted to ensure the financial system had enough US dollars. Mr Bailey said the coordinated action on US dollars was ""a step forward"". ""You saw some pretty big dislocations in financial markets last week, in particular in dollar financial markets which of course are global by nature. ""So the fact that the Fed, with the other central banks have extended swap lines so we can we can provide essentially three-month dollar money. Dollar money is a step forward. ""We're going to see how that how that works its way through the markets today in the coming days to see what the effect it has, but I would emphasise that this is strong coordination among central banks"". Asked if the impact of the global pandemic on the economy would be more significant than the Bank's words last week that the effect would be ""large, sharp but temporary"", Mr Bailey, said the Bank was consulting epidemiologists [people who study disease outbreaks] to try to help work out the economic impact. ""There's two parts. First of all, of course, is how long Covid itself is going to go on for, obviously that's not something that as a central bank, we have an expertise in. We're working very closely with epidemiologists to understand that. That will obviously have an effect on the economy, no question about that. ""The second part - which we emphasised last week - which we are very keen also to ensure doesn't happen is that the economic effects that materialise during the period of Covid then get extended onwards by virtue of effectively the damage that's done to the economy and that's something that we want to want to minimise and stop. And that's why you saw prompt action last week."" The governor acknowledged that he was ""going to be very, very focused on on the response to Covid, that's the key thing at the moment. We need to get through that period"". But he also said that he had some important other objectives, from preparing the UK for its new relationship with the EU to dealing with new financial technology and to ""address our presence in the country as a whole, because that's one of the ways in which we serve the country as a whole"".

"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

"The BBC is to delay TV licence fee changes for the over-75s until August in light of the coronavirus situation. Free TV licences for up to 3.7 million people had been due to be scrapped on 1 June, but that has been put back to 1 August. These are ""exceptional circumstances"" and ""now is not the right time"", BBC chairman Sir David Clementi said. He added: ""We are fully focused on delivering our services to the public at this difficult time."" The BBC confirmed it will foot the cost of the two-month delay. Last year, the corporation announced that only low-income households where one person receives the pension credit benefit will still be eligible for a free licence from June 2020. On Monday, amid the growing spread of the coronavirus, the BBC and the government issued a joint statement saying they ""do not want anyone to be worried about any potential change"" at the current time. ""The BBC's priority over the coming period will be to do everything we can to serve the nation at this uniquely challenging time,"" the statement said. ""As the national broadcaster, the BBC has a vital role to play in supplying information to the public in the weeks and months ahead."" ""Recognising the exceptional circumstances, the BBC board has therefore decided to change the start date of the new policy. Our current plan is to now bring it into place on 1 August. We will of course keep the issue under review as the situation continues to evolve."" Free TV licences for the over-75s have been provided by the government since 2000, but responsibility for the provision is being passed to the BBC as part of its last licence fee settlement. There was an outcry in 2019 when the broadcaster announced it would end the scheme for all but those receiving the pension credit benefit. Do I need a TV licence and what does it pay for? BBC licence fee to rise by Â£3 in April BBC and government 'should save free TV licences' More than 630,000 people signed a petition set up by the charity Age UK, which called on the prime minister to take action. On Monday, Age UK welcomed the delay as ""a victory for common sense"", but questioned whether an eight-week delay ""will be anything like long enough"". Charity director Caroline Abrahams said: ""Unfortunately many over-75s will have already received a letter suggesting they get their pension credit letters photocopied at the local library or corner shop. ""This runs counter to the public health message the government seems likely to be giving older people very soon about staying at home to reduce their risk of infection, so it's important older people are informed that there's no need for them to take this action for now."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""I am pleased the BBC has worked with us and agreed to delay their licence fee changes for over-75s from coming in and will keep this under review. ""It will be welcome news to millions of older people who now don't need to worry about their TV licence during this challenging period. ""It is right that the BBC have recognised the exceptional circumstances posed by the coronavirus outbreak and the need for the whole country to pull together in the national effort."" A 2018 report estimated that continuing to providing free licences for the 2020/2021 financial year would cost the BBC around Â£700m. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic The DCMS Committee chair Julian Knight said: ""We welcome this news at what will be a time of great anxiety, particularly for those over 75. Television and radio broadcasts will offer comfort as well as being a vital means for accessing public information. ""However, this delay seems to offer a short-term fix to a much wider problem. What we want is to see is renewed efforts from the Government and the BBC to sit down and resolve this issue once and for all."" How much is the BBC licence fee and what does it pay for?

"Castleford's home win against St Helens in round seven was the last game to be played in Super League Super League and the Rugby Football League have suspended the season until 3 April as a result of the spread of coronavirus. Most games went ahead as planned at the weekend, with the RFL saying on Friday that it would be ""following the government's guidance as requested"". However, a change to government advice, warning against mass gatherings, has prompted the postponement. It applies to all tiers, including the men's, women's and community game. Future of rugby league 'may go out of existence' How coronavirus has impacted sport ""These are unprecedented times, and they present significant financial and commercial implications for rugby league, which will be further considered during the period of suspension,"" said the joint statement from Robert Elstone, the executive chairman of Super League Europe, and Ralph Rimmer, CEO of RFL. ""Super League is also an international competition, and consideration has to be given to our clubs in Canada and France, particularly around travel restrictions and scheduling fixtures. ""Player welfare and maintaining the integrity of the competition are key concerns moving forward. Equally our responsibilities to rugby league communities remain front of mind for all of us. ""The whole country is facing major challenges - and the support of our fans, partners and stakeholders is needed now more than ever before."" This video can not be played 'Challenging times ahead' for rugby league - RFL's Mark Foster One of the points in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's briefing on Monday was thedecision to withdraw the support of emergency workersat mass gatherings, such as sporting events. There is a mandatory requirement to have a doctor and physiotherapist at Super League games. while best practice advice is to have secondary doctor and physiotherapist cover at every match. While there are currently no confirmed cases of coronavirus within rugby league, Toronto Wolfpack said they have four players under self-isolation after reporting symptoms, and have stood down their playing staff accordingly. Earlier on Monday, St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus said the ""very existence of the sport"" was in danger if the government did not offer financial support to clubs during any postponement to the season. ""The government has to look at a degree of support for our sport. There's huge financial implications - the very existence of our sport is on the line,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""We're different to soccer, probably different to rugby union. We're at the beginning of our season. This is open-ended both in time and terms of quantum. No-one knows the full extent of it.""

"Global stock markets have sunk again despite central banks around the world announcing a co-ordinated effort to ease the effects of the coronavirus. The Dow Jones index closed 12.9% down after President Donald Trump said the economy ""may be"" heading for recession. London's FTSE 100 ended 4% lower, and other major European markets saw similar slides. On Sunday, theUS Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zeroand launched a $700bn stimulus programme. It was part of co-ordinated action announced alongside the eurozone, the UK, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland. However, investors are worried that central banks now have few options left to combat the impact of the pandemic. The new governor of the Bank of England,Andrew Bailey, has pledged to take ""prompt action again""when necessary to stop the damage to the economy from the coronavirus pandemic. David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets, said that while central bankers were trying to calm the markets, ""in reality it is having the opposite effect"". ""The radical measures have sent out a very worrying message to dealers, and that is why they are blindly dumping stocks."" In New York, steep falls as markets opened triggered another automatic halt to trading, which is meant to curb panic selling. Before last week, such halts, known as circuit breakers, had not been used in more than two decades. But the sell-off continued after the 15-minute suspension, with the Dow losing nearly 3,000 points or 12.9%, its worst percentage drop since 1987. The wider S&P 500 dropped 11.9%, while Nasdaq dropped 12.3%. All three indexes are now down more than 25% from their highs. In London, firms in the travel sector saw big falls. Share in holiday firm Tui sank more than 27% after it said it would suspend the ""majority"" of its operations.  BA-owner IAG fell more than 25% after it said it would cut its flight capacity by at least 75% in April and May. The FTSE 250, which includes a number of well-known UK-focused companies, ended down about 7.8%. New Bank of England boss pledges prompt action US in emergency rate cut and huge stimulus plan Airlines slash more flights as coronavirus hits PM urges industry to help make NHS ventilators All the main European share indexes fell sharply, though they later regained some ground. France's Cac 40 index fell more than 5.7% and Germany's Dax dropped more than 5.3%. Earlier in Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 closed down 2.5% and the Shanghai Composite in China ended the day 3.3% lower. Oil prices, which have been shaken by a price war between exporters, fell again. Brent crude dropped by more than 10% to less than $32 a barrel while West Texas International crude fell more than 8% to less than $30 a barrel. Only a few weeks ago, the fear was that factories grinding to a halt in China's Hubei province could cause global growth to stumble briefly. Then it became clear that the economic pain was likely to be much more extensive. Now, with tourism and leisure activities grinding to a halt and supply chains threatened, a widespread recession may be more likely than not. In other words, economic growth going into reverse for two consecutive quarters, which would mean cash flow emergencies for some businesses, possible corporate failures and rising unemployment. The challenge for policymakers is to stop that downturn. Sunday's extravaganza by the Fed showed how central banks can go big. But interest rate cuts are of limited use; they won't tempt customers to go out and spend in Marseille or New York when the bars are closed, and flights cancelled. So the markets are looking to governments for more targeted support and bailout packages. But even that won't calm nerves altogether. As banks enact their own workplace contingencies, what traders really want is a sign that the virus caseload has peaked, and then that the financial convalescence is on track. On Sunday, the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, cut its interest rates by 100 basis points to a target range of 0% to 0.25% and said it would offer at least $700bn for support to the markets in the coming weeks. The move comes as local officials across the US shut schools, restaurants and bars, sports leagues cancel tournaments, and retailers such as Urban Outfitters, Nike, and Gap announce hundreds of temporary store closures. Speaking after the announcement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said: ""The virus is having a profound effect."" But stock markets dived as investors worried that the world's biggest central banks may now have very little ammunition left to deal with the effects of the coronavirus if the global economic climate continues to worsen. ""They [the Fed] pulled out whatever weapons they had and my sense is I think it may help initially but I don't think it goes much further because this is still a developing issue. They used up basically all their ammunition and we're down to sticks and stones,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at Slatestone Wealth. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. Alongside the Fed, five other central banks - the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, and the Swiss National Bank - also announced measures to make it easier to provide dollars to their financial institutions facing stress in credit markets. The move was designed to bring down the price banks and companies pay for US dollars, which has surged in recent weeks. Andrew Sentance - a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates - told the BBC's Today programme that banks were acting to ensure enough credit was flowing. ""There was some criticism around the financial crisis that central banks didn't move quickly enough,"" he said. ""I see this as a partly precautionary action for central banks to show that they are doing as much as possible to keep the wheels of the economy turning."" Mr Sentance added that any further cut to the base rate in the UK, to 0.10% for example, would be ""symbolic, because it wouldn't have that much impact on companies or individuals"". In other developments on Monday: Strains continued in other parts of the market typically seen as less risky, with gold prices down more than 5% at one point The Bank of Japan eased monetary policy by pledging to buy risky assets at double the current pace and announced a new loan programme to extend one-year, zero-rate loans to financial institutions Shares in Australia recorded their biggest daily percentage fall on record, as the benchmark ASX 200 index dropped 9.7% The Reserve Bank of Australia said it ""stands ready"" to pump more money into the country's financial system New Zealand's central bank lowered interest rates by 75 basis points as it prepared for a ""significant"" hit to the economy.

"Some Iceland stores will open one hour early to allow older shoppers to buy food when it is quieter amid the coronavirus outbreak. Iceland said it was not a company policy, but it was allowing individual stores to decide how best to meet the needs of shoppers in their local areas. The move comes as supermarkets continue to try to stop customers stockpiling. Several supermarkets have limited the sales of certain products to avoid them selling out completely. Iceland's Kennedy Centre store in West Belfast will let older customers shop on their own between 08:00 and 09:00 every day from Wednesday. ""We just want to make sure the experience is as stress-free as possible,"" store manager Danny Burke said. The Iceland store in West Belfast has set aside an hour for elderly shoppers Mr Burke said the idea had been prompted by suggestions on social media. He said the store was asking shoppers to ""respect the dedicated hour"", but said there would be no formal checks on shoppers' ages. He told the BBC that the store had seen a ""big uplift in sales"" amid the coronavirus outbreak. Items including toilet roll, long-life grocery items such as noodles, and frozen foods had reportedly seen a boost. Shop offers exclusive sessions for over-70s Airlines slash more flights as coronavirus hits Iceland's Food Warehouse store in Thanet will also open one hour earlier at 07:00 for older shoppers on Wednesday. In a Facebook post, the store manager said that the early opening slot would only be for old age pensioners. It will be at the store's discretion as to who they let in. The building society Nationwide is also trialling opening its branches one hour early for older people and those with underlying health conditions. From 18 March, 100 of its branches across the UK will be open from 08:00 between Monday and Friday for those it says are at highest risk from the virus. The BBC has requested comment from other supermarkets on whether they are planning any similar measures. Supermarkets have called on customers to be ""considerate"" as panic buying has seen shelves stripped of some items including toilet roll and pasta. In a joint letter on Sunday, UK retailers asked customers to be ""considerate"" when shopping, so that others are not left without much-needed items. Speaking on behalf of retailers, Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said: ""In the face of unprecedented demand as a result of coronavirus, food retailers have come together to ask their customers to support each other to make sure everyone can get access to the products they need."" Panic buying has left some supermarkets in the UK with empty shelves The emptying of shelves has led some supermarkets to limit the sale of certain products. Aldi has restricted customers to buying a maximum of four of each item, while Tesco shoppers are limited to buying no more than five of certain goods such as anti-bacterial gels or UHT milk. With increasing demand seen across UK supermarkets, retailers have been trying to reassure customers that there is enough food supply in the system. Bruno Monteyne, senior analyst at European Food Retail, told the BBC that although food retailers face a ""stretch"", ""the industry is ready for this"". He said that many retailers will already have plans in place to deal with added pressure. Morrisons tweeted that it was increasing the amount of food being sent to stores from its warehouses.

"Coronavirus has plunged the world into uncertainty and the constant news about the pandemic can feel relentless. All of this is taking its toll on people's mental health, particularly those already living with conditions like anxiety and OCD. So how can we protect our mental health? Being concerned about the news is understandable, but for many people it can make existing mental health problems worse. When the World Health Organization released advice onprotecting your mental health during the coronavirus outbreak,external, it was broadly welcomed. As Anxiety UK's Nicky Lidbetter explains, the fear of being out of control and unable to tolerate uncertainty are common characteristics of many anxiety disorders. So it's understandable that many individuals with pre-existing anxiety are facing challenges at the moment. ""A lot of anxiety is rooted in worrying about the unknown and waiting for something to happen - coronavirus is that on a macro scale,"" agrees Rosie Weatherley, spokesperson for mental health charity Mind. So how can we protect our mental health? Reading lots of news about coronavirus has led to panic attacks for Nick, a father-of-two from Kent, who lives with anxiety. ""When I'm feeling anxious my thoughts can spiral out of control and I start thinking about catastrophic outcomes,"" he says. Nick is worried about his parents and other older people he knows. ""Usually when I suffer I can walk away from a situation. This is out of my control,"" he says. Having long periods away from news websites and social media has helped him to manage his anxiety. He has also found support helplines, run by mental health charities such as AnxietyUK, useful. Limit the amount of time you spend reading or watching things which aren't making you feel better. Perhaps decide on a specific time to check in with the news There is a lot of misinformation swirling around - stay informed by sticking to trusted sources of information such as government and NHS websites This video can not be played Tips on managing anxiety and OCD during the coronavirus pandemic Alison, 24, from Manchester, has health anxiety and feels compelled to stay informed and research the subject. But at the same time she knows social media can be a trigger. ""A month ago I was clicking on hashtags and seeing all this unverified conspiracy rubbish and it would make me really anxious and I would feel really hopeless and cry,"" she says. Now she is careful about which accounts she tunes into and is avoiding clicking on coronavirus hashtags. She is also trying hard to have time away from social media, watching TV or reading books instead. Mute key words which might be triggering on Twitter and unfollow or mute accounts Mute WhatsApp groups and hide Facebook posts and feeds if you find them too overwhelming A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area OCD Action has seen an increase in support requests from people whose fears have become focused on the coronavirus pandemic. For people with OCD and some types of anxiety, being constantly told to wash your hands can be especially difficult to hear. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

For Lily Bailey, author of Because We Are Bad, a book about living with OCD, fear of contamination was one aspect of her obsessive compulsive disorder. She says the advice about hand washing can be a huge trigger for people who have recovered. ""It's really difficult because I now have to do some of the behaviours that I've been avoiding,"" says Bailey. ""I'm sticking to the advice really rigidly but it's hard, considering that for me, soap and sanitiser used to be something comparable to an addiction."" Charity OCD Action says the issue to look out for is the function - for example, is the washing being carried out for the recommended amount of time to reduce the risk of spreading of the virus - or is it being done ritualistically in a specific order to feel ""just right""? Bailey points out that for a lot of people with OCD, getting better means being able to leave the house - so self-isolating can present another challenge.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to speak to engineering firms on Monday about whether they can shift production lines to building NHS ventilators. It comes amid growing concern about a shortage of the life-saving equipment as coronavirus infections increase. Carmakers and the construction equipment firm JCB are among manufacturers to be contacted. Downing Street said it wanted the manufacturing sector ""to come together to help the country"". ""Preparing for the spread of the coronavirus outbreak is a national priority and we're calling on the manufacturing industry and all those with relevant expertise who might be able to help to come together to help the country tackle this national crisis,"" Downing Street said. ""We need to step up production of vital equipment such as ventilators so that we can all help the most vulnerable, and we need businesses to come to us and help in this national effort."" However, BBC business editor Simon Jack said that manufacturers were far from ready to switch production. One company told him that comparisons with the accelerated production of Spitfire aircraft during World War Two were misplaced as there was no accepted design nor guarantee components could be sourced quickly. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Getting through this is going to be a national effort"" It is understood one subject on the agenda during the prime minister's talks with industry on Monday is whether specialist firms that make ventilators and other critical equipment might be prepared to share their intellectual property. Engineers have already been asked to draw up plans to quickly produce more ventilators. And on Sunday evening, Tory MP Tom Tugendhat tweeted: ""The Prime Minister is calling for a National Effort for Ventilator production. We have been inundated with offers. ""If you produce ventilators please call the BEIS Business Support helpline on 0300 456 3565. A specific team receiving these calls will start at 10am tomorrow."" On Sunday's BBC Andrew Marr show, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said engineering firms should consider switching some manufacturing to help ramp production of the vital equipment. He accepted it was the kind of policy normally reserved for times of war. ""We've got high quality engineering in this country,"" Mr Hancock said. ""We want anybody who has the manufacturing capability to turn to the manufacture of ventilators, to do that."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic LATEST UPDATES:Follow live Ventilators are vital in the treatment of patients whose lungs have been attacked by the infection. The health secretary told Sky News that the country currently has 5,000 ventilators but said it would need ""many times more than that"". But questions remain over how engineering firms with no experience of producing ventilators will be able start manufacturing the complex medical devices. In a statement on Sunday, the chairman JCB, Lord Bamford, said: ""We have been approached by the prime minister to see if we can help with the production of ventilators. ""We have research and engineering teams actively looking at the request at the moment,"" he said. However, he continued: ""It's unclear as yet if we can assist, but as a British company, we will do whatever we can to help during the unprecedented times our country is facing."" A ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe by getting oxygen into the lungs and removing carbon dioxide Ventilators can be used to help a person breathe if they have lung disease or another condition that makes breathing difficult. They can also be used during and post-surgery A tube, connected to a ventilator machine, is placed in a person's mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat (called a tracheostomy) Manufacturing firm, Unipart, confirmed that it was involved in the discussions and aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce said it was ""keen to do whatever we can"". It is not just manufacturing firms that have offered their services. Hotel chain Best Western has said it could turn its properties into temporary hospitals if the NHS needed additional bed space during the coronavirus outbreak. The company said it had seen a surge in cancellations over the last month due to the outbreak. ""If the NHS wants additional bed space, and we can partner with other companies to provide the right medical equipment and supplies, and we can do it safely, then we would be willing to start having those conversations immediately,"" the hotel chain's boss, Rob Paterson, said. Manufacturers asked by the government to produce thousands of ventilators to help save the lives of seriously affected victims of coronavirus are not ready to fill the demand. Although firms including JCB, Unipart, Rolls-Royce and others are in close conversation with the government, no detailed blueprint for increased manufacture of the life-saving equipment currently exists. One manufacturer told the BBC that comparisons with the accelerated manufacture of Spitfire aircraft during World War Two were misplaced, as there was no accepted design. Even if there was, there is no guarantee the components could be sourced in time to even start production in the next two months. Ventilators are vital as medical experts estimate that between 10% and 20% of those who succumb to the virus will need critical care. Many of those will need help breathing. Although firms stand ready and able to produce more ventilators, a lack of clarity on design specifications and component sourcing mean that production remains many weeks away.

"Castleford's home win against St Helens in round seven was the last game to be played in Super League Super League and the Rugby Football League have suspended the season until 3 April as a result of the spread of coronavirus. Most games went ahead as planned at the weekend, with the RFL saying on Friday that it would be ""following the government's guidance as requested"". However, a change to government advice, warning against mass gatherings, has prompted the postponement. It applies to all tiers, including the men's, women's and community game. Future of rugby league 'may go out of existence' How coronavirus has impacted sport ""These are unprecedented times, and they present significant financial and commercial implications for rugby league, which will be further considered during the period of suspension,"" said the joint statement from Robert Elstone, the executive chairman of Super League Europe, and Ralph Rimmer, CEO of RFL. ""Super League is also an international competition, and consideration has to be given to our clubs in Canada and France, particularly around travel restrictions and scheduling fixtures. ""Player welfare and maintaining the integrity of the competition are key concerns moving forward. Equally our responsibilities to rugby league communities remain front of mind for all of us. ""The whole country is facing major challenges - and the support of our fans, partners and stakeholders is needed now more than ever before."" This video can not be played 'Challenging times ahead' for rugby league - RFL's Mark Foster One of the points in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's briefing on Monday was thedecision to withdraw the support of emergency workersat mass gatherings, such as sporting events. There is a mandatory requirement to have a doctor and physiotherapist at Super League games. while best practice advice is to have secondary doctor and physiotherapist cover at every match. While there are currently no confirmed cases of coronavirus within rugby league, Toronto Wolfpack said they have four players under self-isolation after reporting symptoms, and have stood down their playing staff accordingly. Earlier on Monday, St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus said the ""very existence of the sport"" was in danger if the government did not offer financial support to clubs during any postponement to the season. ""The government has to look at a degree of support for our sport. There's huge financial implications - the very existence of our sport is on the line,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""We're different to soccer, probably different to rugby union. We're at the beginning of our season. This is open-ended both in time and terms of quantum. No-one knows the full extent of it.""

"Holly Eason and her fiancÃ© have been planning their April wedding in their hometown of Tokyo for ages but now, thanks to coronavirus, they've had to cancel everything. Ms Eason, a teacher, couldn't risk her guests being exposed to infection. She said: ""I couldn't forgive myself if our celebration became the cause of a serious health condition. I'm also worried that my dad and my brother wouldn't be allowed to enter Japan. We just don't know what the situation will be at the time and I wouldn't want to go ahead without them being here."" She feels frustrated - but says safety is the priority. The coronavirus only emerged in December but is now a pandemic, with countries implementing lockdowns and travel restrictions. On the day the couple finally decided to cancel, their wedding invitations turned up at the home of Ms Eason's father, Mike, at his home in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, in the UK. He said: ""It hit home the effort she had put into organise the day but as I am over 60, she was very worried about putting me and the others at risk. This video can not be played Couples share masked kiss in Philippines mass wedding ceremony ""My daughter has arranged the wedding day herself as I cannot offer much help from the UK."" He said the family was now facing difficulty trying to get refunds. ""We cannot get our money back for the flights and hotel, so stand to write off approximately Â£5,000. I have tried to claim back through my credit card but despite being on hold for nearly 90 minutes (as everyone else is trying to get through too) they say there is nothing they can do.""

IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Saavan Nathwani and Risha Modi were looking forward to getting married in Tuscany For Saavan Nathwani and Risha Modi, their dream wedding in Italy was supposed to be the happiest moment of their lives. But Ms Modi, who is from Harrow, London, said: ""In a matter of one week, our world was turned upside down, when the outbreak in Italy was announced. ""We were due to marry in Tuscany in about a month's time but now we're in a bit of a limbo and have no idea whether it's going to go ahead or if we should postpone or cancel. ""We had been planning for this wedding for nearly six months. We both work full-time and even though it has been a stressful and bumpy road, the only thing that kept us going was knowing we would marry one another."" She said they had more than 150 guests coming from all over the world including babies, grandparents and elderly relatives but many were now too scared to travel. With the response to the virus in the UK also changing rapidly, they also were concerned that it might be better to postpone if Britain eventually enters lockdown. Charlotte Armitage and Lauren Maitland Lauren Maitland and her fiance, Charlotte Armitage, have their fingers crossed their marriage will go ahead at The Whitby Abbey in Yorkshire in May. But Ms Maitland said: ""My mum has recently had a surgical procedure carried out on her heart and is recovering, while my granddad is 90 years old. Charlotte worries about her own parents daily too. ""Beyond that, we're nervous of large public gatherings being cancelled which would mean our ceremony couldn't go ahead, or indeed so many people having to self-quarantine meaning that the reception at Whitby Pavilion can't go ahead.

They have taken out wedding insurance and have travel insurance already in place for their 10-day honeymoon in Orlando, Florida and a week on a Royal Caribbean cruise but Ms Maitland adds: ""With the current travel bans, park closures and cruise cancellations, we're certainly starting to feel anxious about what is going to happen with our best-laid plans."" The couple, who live in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, say they are opting for a wait-and-see approach. ""More importantly, we remember to keep things in context. As important as our wedding is to us, and as excited as we are about our honeymoon, nothing is more important to us than the friends and family who we've invited to join us on that special day. ""As long as they all remain well and virus-free, then postponing or cancelling our plans doesn't really matter in the end. We just want everyone to be OK."" Elisha Deol and Ronak Shah still want to try to go ahead with their wedding Meanwhile, also in London, Elisha Deol and her fiance Ronak Shah are trying to figure out contingency plans to make sure their wedding goes ahead in a few weeks. The couple, who have been engaged for just over a year, were due to have a Hindu wedding with 500 guests at the Oshwal Centre in Potters Bar next month, with a civil wedding and reception to follow at The Savoy hotel the next day. The whole event was set to cost around Â£100,000. Ms Deol said: ""There are a lot of things that concern us about the wedding going ahead. These include venues and suppliers cancelling on us at the last minute; the health and wellbeing of ourselves and our elderly and at-risk guests and the fact we have friends and family who were due to come from overseas."" She said guests from Canada, Kenya and the US had mostly all cancelled already. Ms Deol adds: ""We are currently in the process of writing to all suppliers asking them what their contingency plans are.

"The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers. Quarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November. If the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. For example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant. What are the UK's new travel rules? If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. This is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund. In this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have. EasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its ""freedom to change"" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022. Some may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive. They may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund. That may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given. ""If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,"" he said. ""Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead."" People who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator. Operators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate. It is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel. Travel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy. The majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel. Importantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go. Rules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries. The government haspublished a charter,externalthat ""clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place"". It says it expects travel operators to be ""flexible"" with customers, given the circumstances, and theCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firmsthey must stick to refund rules. â¨ How are travel rules being relaxed?

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It look as though we are now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve"" The PM has said everyone in the UK should avoid ""non-essential"" travel and contact with others to curb coronavirus - as the country's death toll hit 55. Boris Johnson said people should work from home where possible as part of a range of stringent new measures. Pregnant women, people over the age of 70 and those with certain health conditions should consider the advice ""particularly important"", he said. People in at-risk groups will be asked within days to stay home for 12 weeks. More than 1,500 people have tested positive for the virus in the UK - but the actual number of cases is estimated to be between 35,000 and 50,000. Thekey new government measures,externalare: Everyone should avoid gatherings and crowded places, such as pubs, clubs and theatres Everyone should work from home if they can All ""unnecessary"" visits to friends and relatives in care homes should cease People should only use the NHS ""where we really need to"" - and can reduce the burden on workers by getting advice onthe NHS website,externalwhere possible By next weekend, those with the most serious health conditions must be ""largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks"" The UK is now ""three weeks"" behind Italy - the worst-hit country in Europe If one person in any household has a persistent cough or fever, everyone living there must stay at home for 14 days Those people should, if possible, avoid leaving the house ""even to buy food or essentials"" - but they may leave the house ""for exercise and, in that case, at a safe distance from others"" Schools will not be closed for the moment Chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said the group of people who should take ""particular care to minimise their social contact"" were: People over the age of 70 Other adults who would normally be advised to have the flu vaccine (such as those with chronic diseases) Pregnant women Mr Johnson said ""drastic action"" was needed as the UK approaches ""the fast growth part of the upward curve"" in the number of cases.He told Londoners to pay special attentionto the advice as the virus is spreading more rapidly in the capital than elsewhere. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons the number of people to have died with the virus in England had risen to 53 - and ""the disease is now accelerating"". Thefirst death in Wales, and a death in Scotland, brings the total number of deaths in the UK to 55. The UK's plan has shifted because the scientific modelling showed we were on course for a ""catastrophic epidemic"". A strategy of just slowing the spread of the virus, but not trying to stop it, would have overwhelmed intensive care units. The modelling by Imperial College London,externalhas been heavily informed by the experience in Italy and is influencing decisions at the heart of government. Its calculations predicted 260,000 deaths in the UK. Instead the plan is to drive down the number of cases to very low levels, which the models predict will limit deaths from coronavirus to the thousands or tens of thousands. However, this approach comes with a major problem - there is no exit strategy. Without the immunity that would build up if people were infected, then cases would soar as soon as measures are lifted. The report said these could need to be in place until a vaccine is available, which could take up to 18 months. We are in this for the long haul. ""We are in a war against an invisible killer,"" Mr Hancock said, adding that emergency legislation to tackle the virus would be introduced to Parliament on Thursday. Somelegislation will pass through the Commons unopposedthis week as MPs feel the pressure to tackle coronavirus. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, said further measures such as closing schools may be necessary at some point. ""Those things need to be done at the right time,"" he said. The total number of people in the UK to test positive for the virus has risen by 171 in a day to a total of 1,543, according tothe latest Department of Health figures,external. The latest cases include 30 more from Wales and18 in Scotland. Sir Patrick said the UK is now ""three weeks"" behind Italy. Italy, the worst-affected nation outside China - where the virus originated - has more than 20,000 cases and has suffered more than 1,800 deaths. Sir Patrick added: ""It looks like we're on the fast upswing or just about to get there and that's the reason to want to get in quite quickly with these measures."" This video can not be played Prof Whitty: ""People who do this...are doing things to protect the NHS."" However, Prof Whitty added that the chance of dying with the virus ""for any individual person"" was ""very low"". Most of those who have died in the UK have been people over the age of 60 with underlying health conditions. What are social distancing and self-isolation? GPs prepare for NHS' 'biggest crisis' How to protect your mental health The acts of kindness sparked by coronavirus Prof Whitty said if one person in any household starts to display symptoms, everyone living there must stay at home for 14 days. Mr Johnson said the stay at home advice means people should, if possible, avoid leaving the house ""even to buy food or essentials"". He said people could leave home to do exercise but should do so at a safe distance from others. Prof Whitty said social restrictions would be ""very difficult for people to maintain"" but they would be ""doing it to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed"". All non-essential public access to the Houses of Parliament will be stopped in response to the virus. Commons Speaker Sir Hoyle urged MPs and peers to heed the latest advice. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised the government's communication strategy and lack of support for low wage citizens. He said, despite being 70, he would not follow any advice to self-isolate. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Theatres and music venues around the UK,including the National Theatre, London Palladium and Royal Opera House, have announced they are to close from Monday night until further notice after the prime minister said people should avoid such locations. Ticket-holders will be contacted about obtaining refunds but as many venues are charitable enterprises, people are being encouraged to donate the cost to show their support. The British Beer and Pub Association said coronavirus was having a ""devastating"" effect on pubs. ""The government needs to give clear instructions and detail on the support package to rescue the sector and hundreds of thousands of jobs,"" chief executive Emma McClarkin said. Many have expressed anger that Mr Johnson advised people to stay away from ""pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues"" while not forcing premises to close, which could have given them financial protection. Actor Idris Elbaconfirmed on Twitter,externalhe had tested positive for the virus. And furthersporting events have been suspended,including Football's National League and Rugby Union's premiership, while events such as theGrand National,Boat Race and Isle of Mann TT races have been cancelled. Mr Johnson said the risk of transmission of the disease at sporting events was relatively low, ""but obviously, logically, as we advise against unnecessary social contact of all kinds, it's right that we should extend that advice to mass gatherings as well"". Meanwhile, head teacher leaders have warned that keeping schools open as growing numbers of staff have to self-isolateis the most pressing challenge they face.The government policy remains schools should stay open although closures may be necessary ""at the right stage"" of the outbreak. The prime minister said the economy would take a short-term hit from the pandemic, but should come ""roaring back"" as the disease declines. Butglobal stock markets sank againon Monday despite central banks around the world announcing a co-ordinated effort to ease the effects of the virus. More than 44,000 people in the UK have been tested for the virus. People self-isolating with mild symptoms are no longer being tested -the government has said,externaltests are primarily being given to hospital patients with respiratory problems, and to people in residential or care facilities experiencing outbreaks. But on Monday the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said not enough tests were being carried out. ""We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test,"" he said - adding that the WHO has sent out almost 1.5 million tests to 120 countries.

"Holly Eason and her fiancÃ© have been planning their April wedding in their hometown of Tokyo for ages but now, thanks to coronavirus, they've had to cancel everything. Ms Eason, a teacher, couldn't risk her guests being exposed to infection. She said: ""I couldn't forgive myself if our celebration became the cause of a serious health condition. I'm also worried that my dad and my brother wouldn't be allowed to enter Japan. We just don't know what the situation will be at the time and I wouldn't want to go ahead without them being here."" She feels frustrated - but says safety is the priority. The coronavirus only emerged in December but is now a pandemic, with countries implementing lockdowns and travel restrictions. On the day the couple finally decided to cancel, their wedding invitations turned up at the home of Ms Eason's father, Mike, at his home in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, in the UK. He said: ""It hit home the effort she had put into organise the day but as I am over 60, she was very worried about putting me and the others at risk. This video can not be played Couples share masked kiss in Philippines mass wedding ceremony ""My daughter has arranged the wedding day herself as I cannot offer much help from the UK."" He said the family was now facing difficulty trying to get refunds. ""We cannot get our money back for the flights and hotel, so stand to write off approximately Â£5,000. I have tried to claim back through my credit card but despite being on hold for nearly 90 minutes (as everyone else is trying to get through too) they say there is nothing they can do."" The family hopes to reschedule the wedding at a later date, ideally during blossom season again. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Saavan Nathwani and Risha Modi were looking forward to getting married in Tuscany For Saavan Nathwani and Risha Modi, their dream wedding in Italy was supposed to be the happiest moment of their lives. But Ms Modi, who is from Harrow, London, said: ""In a matter of one week, our world was turned upside down, when the outbreak in Italy was announced. ""We were due to marry in Tuscany in about a month's time but now we're in a bit of a limbo and have no idea whether it's going to go ahead or if we should postpone or cancel. ""We had been planning for this wedding for nearly six months. We both work full-time and even though it has been a stressful and bumpy road, the only thing that kept us going was knowing we would marry one another."" She said they had more than 150 guests coming from all over the world including babies, grandparents and elderly relatives but many were now too scared to travel. With the response to the virus in the UK also changing rapidly, they also were concerned that it might be better to postpone if Britain eventually enters lockdown. Charlotte Armitage and Lauren Maitland Lauren Maitland and her fiance, Charlotte Armitage, have their fingers crossed their marriage will go ahead at The Whitby Abbey in Yorkshire in May. But Ms Maitland said: ""My mum has recently had a surgical procedure carried out on her heart and is recovering, while my granddad is 90 years old. Charlotte worries about her own parents daily too. ""Beyond that, we're nervous of large public gatherings being cancelled which would mean our ceremony couldn't go ahead, or indeed so many people having to self-quarantine meaning that the reception at Whitby Pavilion can't go ahead. Couple postpone wedding over coronavirus fears Mass wedding in S Korea defies coronavirus fears Virus 'forces' couple to live-stream into own wedding ""We also have friends and family travelling from Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Germany and the USA. We're very nervous they won't be able to travel."" They have taken out wedding insurance and have travel insurance already in place for their 10-day honeymoon in Orlando, Florida and a week on a Royal Caribbean cruise but Ms Maitland adds: ""With the current travel bans, park closures and cruise cancellations, we're certainly starting to feel anxious about what is going to happen with our best-laid plans."" The couple, who live in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, say they are opting for a wait-and-see approach. ""More importantly, we remember to keep things in context. As important as our wedding is to us, and as excited as we are about our honeymoon, nothing is more important to us than the friends and family who we've invited to join us on that special day. ""As long as they all remain well and virus-free, then postponing or cancelling our plans doesn't really matter in the end. We just want everyone to be OK."" Elisha Deol and Ronak Shah still want to try to go ahead with their wedding Meanwhile, also in London, Elisha Deol and her fiance Ronak Shah are trying to figure out contingency plans to make sure their wedding goes ahead in a few weeks. The couple, who have been engaged for just over a year, were due to have a Hindu wedding with 500 guests at the Oshwal Centre in Potters Bar next month, with a civil wedding and reception to follow at The Savoy hotel the next day. The whole event was set to cost around Â£100,000. Ms Deol said: ""There are a lot of things that concern us about the wedding going ahead. These include venues and suppliers cancelling on us at the last minute; the health and wellbeing of ourselves and our elderly and at-risk guests and the fact we have friends and family who were due to come from overseas."" She said guests from Canada, Kenya and the US had mostly all cancelled already. Ms Deol adds: ""We are currently in the process of writing to all suppliers asking them what their contingency plans are. ""It is so hard to know if we will get refunds, or even try to make any real plans as the picture is constantly changing.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It look as though we are now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve"" The PM has said everyone in the UK should avoid ""non-essential"" travel and contact with others to curb coronavirus - as the country's death toll hit 55. Boris Johnson said people should work from home where possible as part of a range of stringent new measures. Pregnant women, people over the age of 70 and those with certain health conditions should consider the advice ""particularly important"", he said. People in at-risk groups will be asked within days to stay home for 12 weeks. More than 1,500 people have tested positive for the virus in the UK - but the actual number of cases is estimated to be between 35,000 and 50,000. Thekey new government measures,externalare: Everyone should avoid gatherings and crowded places, such as pubs, clubs and theatres Everyone should work from home if they can All ""unnecessary"" visits to friends and relatives in care homes should cease People should only use the NHS ""where we really need to"" - and can reduce the burden on workers by getting advice onthe NHS website,externalwhere possible By next weekend, those with the most serious health conditions must be ""largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks"" The UK is now ""three weeks"" behind Italy - the worst-hit country in Europe If one person in any household has a persistent cough or fever, everyone living there must stay at home for 14 days Those people should, if possible, avoid leaving the house ""even to buy food or essentials"" - but they may leave the house ""for exercise and, in that case, at a safe distance from others"" Schools will not be closed for the moment Chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said the group of people who should take ""particular care to minimise their social contact"" were: People over the age of 70 Other adults who would normally be advised to have the flu vaccine (such as those with chronic diseases) Pregnant women Mr Johnson said ""drastic action"" was needed as the UK approaches ""the fast growth part of the upward curve"" in the number of cases.He told Londoners to pay special attentionto the advice as the virus is spreading more rapidly in the capital than elsewhere. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons the number of people to have died with the virus in England had risen to 53 - and ""the disease is now accelerating"". Thefirst death in Wales, and a death in Scotland, brings the total number of deaths in the UK to 55. The UK's plan has shifted because the scientific modelling showed we were on course for a ""catastrophic epidemic"". A strategy of just slowing the spread of the virus, but not trying to stop it, would have overwhelmed intensive care units. The modelling by Imperial College London,externalhas been heavily informed by the experience in Italy and is influencing decisions at the heart of government. Its calculations predicted 260,000 deaths in the UK. Instead the plan is to drive down the number of cases to very low levels, which the models predict will limit deaths from coronavirus to the thousands or tens of thousands. However, this approach comes with a major problem - there is no exit strategy. Without the immunity that would build up if people were infected, then cases would soar as soon as measures are lifted. The report said these could need to be in place until a vaccine is available, which could take up to 18 months. We are in this for the long haul. ""We are in a war against an invisible killer,"" Mr Hancock said, adding that emergency legislation to tackle the virus would be introduced to Parliament on Thursday. Somelegislation will pass through the Commons unopposedthis week as MPs feel the pressure to tackle coronavirus. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, said further measures such as closing schools may be necessary at some point. ""Those things need to be done at the right time,"" he said. The total number of people in the UK to test positive for the virus has risen by 171 in a day to a total of 1,543, according tothe latest Department of Health figures,external. The latest cases include 30 more from Wales and18 in Scotland. Sir Patrick said the UK is now ""three weeks"" behind Italy. Italy, the worst-affected nation outside China - where the virus originated - has more than 20,000 cases and has suffered more than 1,800 deaths. Sir Patrick added: ""It looks like we're on the fast upswing or just about to get there and that's the reason to want to get in quite quickly with these measures."" This video can not be played Prof Whitty: ""People who do this...are doing things to protect the NHS."" However, Prof Whitty added that the chance of dying with the virus ""for any individual person"" was ""very low"". Most of those who have died in the UK have been people over the age of 60 with underlying health conditions. What are social distancing and self-isolation? GPs prepare for NHS' 'biggest crisis' How to protect your mental health The acts of kindness sparked by coronavirus Prof Whitty said if one person in any household starts to display symptoms, everyone living there must stay at home for 14 days. Mr Johnson said the stay at home advice means people should, if possible, avoid leaving the house ""even to buy food or essentials"". He said people could leave home to do exercise but should do so at a safe distance from others. Prof Whitty said social restrictions would be ""very difficult for people to maintain"" but they would be ""doing it to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed"". All non-essential public access to the Houses of Parliament will be stopped in response to the virus. Commons Speaker Sir Hoyle urged MPs and peers to heed the latest advice. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised the government's communication strategy and lack of support for low wage citizens. He said, despite being 70, he would not follow any advice to self-isolate. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Theatres and music venues around the UK,including the National Theatre, London Palladium and Royal Opera House, have announced they are to close from Monday night until further notice after the prime minister said people should avoid such locations. Ticket-holders will be contacted about obtaining refunds but as many venues are charitable enterprises, people are being encouraged to donate the cost to show their support. The British Beer and Pub Association said coronavirus was having a ""devastating"" effect on pubs. ""The government needs to give clear instructions and detail on the support package to rescue the sector and hundreds of thousands of jobs,"" chief executive Emma McClarkin said. Many have expressed anger that Mr Johnson advised people to stay away from ""pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues"" while not forcing premises to close, which could have given them financial protection.

Meanwhile, head teacher leaders have warned that keeping schools open as growing numbers of staff have to self-isolateis the most pressing challenge they face.The government policy remains schools should stay open although closures may be necessary ""at the right stage"" of the outbreak.

""We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test,"" he said - adding that the WHO has sent out almost 1.5 million tests to 120 countries.

Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, said further measures such as closing schools may be necessary at some point. ""Those things need to be done at the right time,"" he said. The total number of people in the UK to test positive for the virus has risen by 171 in a day to a total of 1,543, according tothe latest Department of Health figures,external. The latest cases include 30 more from Wales and18 in Scotland. Sir Patrick said the UK is now ""three weeks"" behind Italy. Italy, the worst-affected nation outside China - where the virus originated - has more than 20,000 cases and has suffered more than 1,800 deaths. Sir Patrick added: ""It looks like we're on the fast upswing or just about to get there and that's the reason to want to get in quite quickly with these measures."" This video can not be played Prof Whitty: ""People who do this...are doing things to protect the NHS."" However, Prof Whitty added that the chance of dying with the virus ""for any individual person"" was ""very low"". Most of those who have died in the UK have been people over the age of 60 with underlying health conditions. What are social distancing and self-isolation? GPs prepare for NHS' 'biggest crisis' How to protect your mental health The acts of kindness sparked by coronavirus Prof Whitty said if one person in any household starts to display symptoms, everyone living there must stay at home for 14 days. Mr Johnson said the stay at home advice means people should, if possible, avoid leaving the house ""even to buy food or essentials"". He said people could leave home to do exercise but should do so at a safe distance from others. Prof Whitty said social restrictions would be ""very difficult for people to maintain"" but they would be ""doing it to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed"". All non-essential public access to the Houses of Parliament will be stopped in response to the virus. Commons Speaker Sir Hoyle urged MPs and peers to heed the latest advice. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised the government's communication strategy and lack of support for low wage citizens. He said, despite being 70, he would not follow any advice to self-isolate. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Theatres and music venues around the UK,including the National Theatre, London Palladium and Royal Opera House, have announced they are to close from Monday night until further notice after the prime minister said people should avoid such locations. Ticket-holders will be contacted about obtaining refunds but as many venues are charitable enterprises, people are being encouraged to donate the cost to show their support. The British Beer and Pub Association said coronavirus was having a ""devastating"" effect on pubs. ""The government needs to give clear instructions and detail on the support package to rescue the sector and hundreds of thousands of jobs,"" chief executive Emma McClarkin said. Many have expressed anger that Mr Johnson advised people to stay away from ""pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues"" while not forcing premises to close, which could have given them financial protection. Actor Idris Elbaconfirmed on Twitter,externalhe had tested positive for the virus. And furthersporting events have been suspended,including Football's National League and Rugby Union's premiership, while events such as theGrand National,Boat Race and Isle of Mann TT races have been cancelled. Mr Johnson said the risk of transmission of the disease at sporting events was relatively low, ""but obviously, logically, as we advise against unnecessary social contact of all kinds, it's right that we should extend that advice to mass gatherings as well"". Meanwhile, head teacher leaders have warned that keeping schools open as growing numbers of staff have to self-isolateis the most pressing challenge they face.The government policy remains schools should stay open although closures may be necessary ""at the right stage"" of the outbreak. The prime minister said the economy would take a short-term hit from the pandemic, but should come ""roaring back"" as the disease declines. Butglobal stock markets sank againon Monday despite central banks around the world announcing a co-ordinated effort to ease the effects of the virus. More than 44,000 people in the UK have been tested for the virus. People self-isolating with mild symptoms are no longer being tested -the government has said,externaltests are primarily being given to hospital patients with respiratory problems, and to people in residential or care facilities experiencing outbreaks. But on Monday the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said not enough tests were being carried out. ""We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test,"" he said - adding that the WHO has sent out almost 1.5 million tests to 120 countries. Prof Whitty defended the UK's testing regime but said: ""We do intend to continue to scale up testing."" He said tests only reveal whether or not people are currently sick - and that a test to show whether or not people had previously had the virus would be ""transformational"". Public Health England (PHE) was ""very rapidly"" developing such a test, he added. The lockdown of European countries has continued to expand -Germany and Franceare the latest to enforce stringent measures The European Union will close its borders for 30 days from Tuesday to external visitors from non-EU countries, according to French President Emmanuel Macron.

"Coronavirus has plunged the world into uncertainty and the constant news about the pandemic can feel relentless. All of this is taking its toll on people's mental health, particularly those already living with conditions like anxiety and OCD. So how can we protect our mental health? Being concerned about the news is understandable, but for many people it can make existing mental health problems worse. When the World Health Organization released advice onprotecting your mental health during the coronavirus outbreak,external, it was broadly welcomed. As Anxiety UK's Nicky Lidbetter explains, the fear of being out of control and unable to tolerate uncertainty are common characteristics of many anxiety disorders. So it's understandable that many individuals with pre-existing anxiety are facing challenges at the moment. ""A lot of anxiety is rooted in worrying about the unknown and waiting for something to happen - coronavirus is that on a macro scale,"" agrees Rosie Weatherley, spokesperson for mental health charity Mind. So how can we protect our mental health? Reading lots of news about coronavirus has led to panic attacks for Nick, a father-of-two from Kent, who lives with anxiety. ""When I'm feeling anxious my thoughts can spiral out of control and I start thinking about catastrophic outcomes,"" he says. Nick is worried about his parents and other older people he knows. ""Usually when I suffer I can walk away from a situation. This is out of my control,"" he says. Having long periods away from news websites and social media has helped him to manage his anxiety. He has also found support helplines, run by mental health charities such as AnxietyUK, useful. Limit the amount of time you spend reading or watching things which aren't making you feel better. Perhaps decide on a specific time to check in with the news There is a lot of misinformation swirling around - stay informed by sticking to trusted sources of information such as government and NHS websites This video can not be played Tips on managing anxiety and OCD during the coronavirus pandemic Alison, 24, from Manchester, has health anxiety and feels compelled to stay informed and research the subject. But at the same time she knows social media can be a trigger. ""A month ago I was clicking on hashtags and seeing all this unverified conspiracy rubbish and it would make me really anxious and I would feel really hopeless and cry,"" she says. Now she is careful about which accounts she tunes into and is avoiding clicking on coronavirus hashtags. She is also trying hard to have time away from social media, watching TV or reading books instead. Mute key words which might be triggering on Twitter and unfollow or mute accounts Mute WhatsApp groups and hide Facebook posts and feeds if you find them too overwhelming A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area OCD Action has seen an increase in support requests from people whose fears have become focused on the coronavirus pandemic. For people with OCD and some types of anxiety, being constantly told to wash your hands can be especially difficult to hear. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

For Lily Bailey, author of Because We Are Bad, a book about living with OCD, fear of contamination was one aspect of her obsessive compulsive disorder. She says the advice about hand washing can be a huge trigger for people who have recovered. ""It's really difficult because I now have to do some of the behaviours that I've been avoiding,"" says Bailey. ""I'm sticking to the advice really rigidly but it's hard, considering that for me, soap and sanitiser used to be something comparable to an addiction."" Charity OCD Action says the issue to look out for is the function - for example, is the washing being carried out for the recommended amount of time to reduce the risk of spreading of the virus - or is it being done ritualistically in a specific order to feel ""just right""? Bailey points out that for a lot of people with OCD, getting better means being able to leave the house - so self-isolating can present another challenge. ""If we're forced to stay at home, we have lots of time on our hands, and boredom can make OCD worse,"" she says. Staying in touch with those you care about will help to maintain good mental health during long periods of self-isolation. ""Agree regular check-in times and feel connected to the people around you,"" says Weatherley. Strike a balance between having a routine and making sure each day has some variety. For some people it might end up actually feeling like quite a productive or restful period. You could work through your to-do list or read a book you'd been meaning to get to. With weeks and months of the coronavirus pandemic ahead, it is important to have down time. Mind recommends continuing to access nature and sunlight wherever possible. Do exercise, eat well and stay hydrated. AnxietyUK suggests practising the ""Apple"" technique to deal with anxiety and worries. Acknowledge:Notice and acknowledge the uncertainty as it comes to mind. Pause:Don't react as you normally do. Don't react at all. Pause and breathe. Pull back:Tell yourself this is just the worry talking, and this apparent need for certainty is not helpful and not necessary. It is only a thought or feeling. Don't believe everything you think. Thoughts are not statements or facts. Let go:Let go of the thought or feeling. It will pass. You don't have to respond to them. You might imagine them floating away in a bubble or cloud. Explore:Explore the present moment, because right now, in this moment, all is well. Notice your breathing and the sensations of your breathing. Notice the ground beneath you. Look around and notice what you see, what you hear, what you can touch, what you can smell. Right now. Then shift your focus of attention to something else - on what you need to do, on what you were doing before you noticed the worry, or do something else - mindfully with your full attention.

"UK PM Johnson: Everyone should now avoid social contact with others Macron orders French to stay at home - and says those who don't will be punished EU set to close external borders to non-essential travellers Financial markets plunge, with Dow suffering biggest one-day drop since 1987 crash Germany closes shops and other public places, after shutting some borders Johnson: Virus ""a few weeks ahead"" in London compared with rest of UK WHO director urges governments to test all suspected virus cases, not just serious ones Coronavirus infections are now higher outside China than in the country where the outbreak began Georgina Rannard, Kevin Ponniah, Joshua Nevett, Yvette Tan, Andreas Illmer, Owen Amos, Ashitha Nagesh, George Wright and Gavin Stamp We're closing our live coverage shortly. First a recap on another day of developments that at times came at breakneck speed - here's the main points:  Read more onhow to steps to take to prevent infectionandhow to protect your mental healthduring the pandemic.  Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the UK's Labour Party, has this evening been holding talks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Downing Street. Speaking afterwards to the BBC, he said he supported many of the measures announced earlier but was critical of the governmentâs communication strategy and lack of support for citizens on low incomes. ""If this virus affects us all, as it does, we all have to be treated fairly and properly in this,"" he said. He said he had told the PM that testing for the virus, particularly among NHS workers was ""inadequate"" and he was worried about the lack of ventilators and trained staff. Mr Corbyn, who stands down next month, also said he would not be self-isolating even though heâs over
70. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The UK's plan has shifted because the
scientific modelling showed we were on course for a ""catastrophic
epidemic"". A strategy of just slowing the spread of
the virus, but not trying to stop it, would have overwhelmed intensive care
units. The modelling by Imperial College London
has been heavily informed by the experience in Italy and is influencing
decisions at the heart of government. Their calculations predicted 260,000
deaths in the UK. Instead the plan is to drive down the
number of cases to very low levels, which the models predict will limit deaths
from coronavirus to the thousands or tens of thousands. However, this approach comes with a
major problem - there is no exit strategy. Without the immunity that would build up
if people were infected, then cases would soar as soon as measures are lifted. The report said these could need to be
in place until a vaccine is available, which could take up to 18 months. We are in this for the long haul. Public Health England has published more details about thesocial distancing recommendations announced,externalearlier by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It says those aged over 70 and pregnant women are among those who should ""stringently"" follow the advice on avoiding non-essential use of public transport, working from home and not having friends and family to visit. And it warns that anyone under 70 with a range of underlying health conditions is also at increased risk of suffering ""severe"" illness. The conditions it lists include:  It also gives some tips to people on how to look after their mental health in the tough weeks and months ahead. It says people shouldn't fear going for a walk outdoors if they stay more than 2 metres from others. Other advice includes:  France will deploy 100,000 police officers to ensure that people abide by restrictions on movement to avoid the spread of coronavirus, its interior minister has said. Christophe Castaner said people who venture outside their homes will have to justify their reason for doing so. Speaking at a news conference, he said people may be fined if they break the rules. Exceptions will be made in some circumstances, including for travel between home and work, Mr Castaner said. ""Too many people still disregard the health instructions given,"" Mr Castaner said. His announcement comes after French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a series of drastic new measures designed to stem the spread of coronavirus. From
Tuesday, people should stay at home unless they are buying groceries, travelling to work, exercising or seeking medical
care, Mr Macron said. Helier CheungBBC News A drive-through in a health centre in West Palm Beach, Florida offers testing The World Health Organization warned on Monday that testing is essential to stopping the pandemic. Questions have been raised in the US about the government's approach to testing and how widely available test kits are. So what's the situation there? It's hard to tell - and
even officials have struggled to say how many individuals have been tested. According to the latest figures,external, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and public
health labs have tested over 25,100 specimens for Coronavirus. But that number doesn't give a full picture of how many people were tested -
because many people provide more than one specimen for testing, and many
private health laboratories are also conducting tests. One project by The Atlantic estimates that 41,550 people in the US
have been tested. But that's still fewer than many other countries with smaller
populations - including South Korea, which has tested 240,000, and the UK,
which has tested 44,100. The government has come under heavy criticism - from both
Democratic and Republican lawmakers - over the lack of tests. President Trump
has now promised that five million tests will be available within a month - but
also warned: ""We don't want everyone running out and
taking [the test] - only if you have certain symptoms."" Read more about the US and coronavirus testing here. Some British doctors working overseas are returning to the UK to help treat patients in the coronavirus outbreak, one doctor has told BBC News. Red Elmahdi, who completed her medical training in the UK before specialising in epidemiology research, has flown back from the lab where she was working in Denmark. ""Thereâs little point my sitting around in lockdown doing research from home in Denmark when Iâm seeing the mounting strain on the NHS,"" she explains. However Dr Elmahdi says there has been no central co-ordination and she is relying on her locum agency to be placed in hospital. Dr Red Elmahdi is a specialist in sexually transmitted infectious disease epidemiology Food banks in the UK say they are experiencing a shortage of basic items because shoppers are stockpiling as fears grow over the spread of coronavirus. Organisers of one in Islington, north London,announced they had decided to close due,externalto dwindling food supplies and a desire to protect the ""health and safety of our volunteers and clients"". Other food banks across the UK have said some items including pasta and rice are hard to get. It comes after UK supermarketsurged shoppers not to buy more than they needamid concern over coronavirus-linked stockpiling.  Rajesh Makwana says his food bank in Brent was pre-packaging goods into parcels to prevent germs spreading President Trump said postponing US elections would be ""unnecessary"" President Trump has rebuffed growing calls for US elections to be postponed, calling such a move ""unnecessary"". Four US states - Ohio, Illinois,
Florida and Arizona - are scheduled to host primaries for the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday. Ohioâs Republican governor Mike DeWine has said he will file a lawsuit to postpone the election in his state until 2 June, 2020. In his news conference at the White House, Mr Trump did not seem open to the suggestion of postponement. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing,"" Mr Trump said. ""I think postponing is unnecessary."" He suggested elections could be held safely by ""spreading people out"". âThey have lots of room in lots of electoral places,â Mr Trump said.

The primaries will determine which Democrat faces Mr Trump in November's presidential election, with Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders both vying for the candidacy.  Earlier this evening the UK government announced a number of new measures including advising people to avoid gatherings and crowded places. Here is a taste of how theatres in the UK have reacted:  Head of the Creative Industries Federation and Creative England Caroline Norbury says the measures have the potential to ""devastate"" the UK's theatres, museums, cinemas and venues as well as those who work in the industry. She says that as the social-distancing measures are ""only advisory rather than an outright ban"", creative organisations may be unable to claim compensation for the losses they could experience. ""It is vital that government puts in place support to ensure that our world-leading creative sector is able to survive Covid-19,"" she added. Howard JohnsonPhilippines Correspondent, BBC News Authorities have started implementing the lockdown in Manila Foreign tourists intending to leave the Philippines from international airports in the countryâs main Luzon region have been given 72 hours to do so, starting from 16:00 GMT today. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte earlier announced that Luzon,
which has an estimated population of more than 50 million people and includes
the capital city, Metro Manila, is to be placed under strict âenhanced community
quarantineâ until 12 April. The British embassy in Manila says âa small numberâ of British nationals are affected. On Sunday, Britons were advised against all but essential travel to the Philippines. The government says the country currently has a total of 142 confirmed Covid-19 cases with 12 deaths. But Dr Manuel Dayrit, the countryâs health secretary during the SARS outbreak of 2003, believes the number is relatively low compared with other countries because not enough preemptive testing has been taking place. âWe are actually limited by the fact we are not doing any testing for COVID-19 in the community,â Dr Dayrit told BBC News. âWe are only testing the patients that show up in the hospitals usually with pneumonia, so we can only speculate how extensive community spread is.â  It's been a whirlwind few hours with dramatic announcements from both sides of the Atlantic and beyond. Here's what you need to know: In the UK:  In other European countries:  In the US:  In the markets:    Aintree Racecourse has announced that this year's Grand National on 4 April will not take place because of
the coronavirus pandemic. The Grand National is one of the key events in the horse racing calendar and attracts an estimated global TV audience of 600 million. In 2019 bookmakers said about Â£150m ($184m) was bet on the race. Jeremy Corbyn - leader of the UK's Labour Party - has called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to extend full sick pay and lost earnings protection to all workers required to self-isolate. He is also urging the government to reduce the waiting time for new universal credit claimants, ban eviction of tenants affected by the outbreak and raise statutory sick pay in line with other European countries. ""Jeremy Corbyn will emphasise that Labour stands with all communities during this crisis, and that the opposition will hold the government to account to ensure no-one is left behind,"" a party spokesman said. Earlier today, Mr Johnson advised everyone in the UK to avoid ""non-essential"" travel and contact with others to fight the spread of Covid-19. Read all the details here. Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Countries in the Western Balkans and the former Yugoslavia have closed schools, shops and borders to contain the coronavirus outbreak. In Sloveniaâs capital, Ljubljana, the Monday afternoon streets were quieter than a standard Sunday morning. Public transport was not running, though adverts on the video screens next to the deserted bus stops reminded the non-existent passengers to practise good hygiene. Further down the Balkan peninsula, borders have closed. Croatia imposed a 14-day self-isolation period for many arrivals; Serbia has simply sealed its borders to almost everyone. As Serbia is not an EU member, it is counting on help from elsewhere. President Aleksandar Vucic says China is suppling masks, ventilators and doctors. Albania imposed a strict lockdown over the weekend and imposed a 6pm curfew from today. Even a daytime stroll in the park has been ruled out by Prime Minister Edi Rama. âHiking is not vital at this time of war,â he said on his Facebook page. Ljubljana's usually busy streets are now deserted This video can not be played WATCH - coronavirus questions answered If you've got some questions about the virus, and particularly the response in the UK, this video is for you. The BBC's Clive Myrie is joined by BBC Health Editor Hugh Pym and other experts to answer questions including:  Russia has temporarily banned all foreigners from entering the country, following other nations worldwide in restricting travel over the coronavirus pandemic. The ban will come into effect on 18 March and will remain in place until 1 May, the government said on Monday. Exceptions will be made for diplomats and permanent residents. Some 93 cases of the virus have been reported so far in Russia. Russia has beenaccused of spreading disinformation about the new coronavirus outbreak on social media. It has flatly denied those allegations. It has also been slow compared to other countries in starting testing. This has led to speculation that the real number of cases is much higher than
reported. Russia's government says up to 100,000 testing kits are being produced daily to
start testing in large numbers.  Swiss residents like Nadine are heading to the bars for a last beer Our reporter Imogen Foulkes has this from Geneva: People here expected the state of emergency - with cases of the
virus rising fast, many thought the government should have declared it on
Friday, when it announced that schools would close. But now that it has happened, Switzerland, one of the
richest countries in the world, is facing at least a month with everything but
the bare essentials closed. There will be no bars, no cafes, no restaurants, no
sports, no nightclubs, no cinemas, no museums. This evening in Bern people are heading to the bars for a last
beer. Student Nadine is disappointed that her upcoming birthday party wonât
happen, but says complaining feels a bit like a ""first world problem"". Actually
itâs quite fascinating,"" she says, ""we are at a pivotal moment in history"". Historic it
certainly is: to support hospitals the Swiss government today mobilised the
army, the first time that has happened since the start of World War Two. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has closed 12.9% down, in another sign that markets fear a global recession could be on the horizon. It's the biggest percentage daily drop since the outbreak began, and the largest in one day since the Black Monday crash in 1987. Markets dropped around the world today despite a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in the US and co-ordinated action by central banks around the world to shore up confidence. The Dow closed as President Trump said a US recession could be on the horizon and that the virus outbreak could last until August. The other main US indexes - the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq - also plunged 12% in trading on Monday. President Trump has said the US could be heading for a recession due to the coronavirus outbreak. Reporters at the White House press conference are deliberately putting empty seats between them, in a social distancing effort. The US government has faced strong criticism for its slow pace of testing. Mr Trump said that before instituting mass testing, South Korea had experienced ""tremendous problems and great numbers of death"". ""This is something that is an invisible enemy,"" he said, adding that there was now a cross-party effort to fight it. ""My focus is on getting rid of this problem. This virus problem. After that everything else is going to fall into place."" ""We're gonna back the airlines 100 percent. It's not their fault its nobody's fault,"" he continued, but added: ""Unless you go to the regional source."" Read our main story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The French-German border is allowing only goods and commuters to pass Germany has become the latest country to close borders as European nations try to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Its borders with France, Austria and Switzerland were shut on Monday, except for commercial traffic. Spain will also close its borders later while France is considering more stringent lockdowns. Meanwhile, the European Commission has proposed a temporary ban on non-essential travel to the European Union. The measure would initially last for 30 days, and long-term residents in the EU, family members of EU nationals and diplomats would be exempt as well as cross-border and healthcare workers and people transporting goods. The restriction must be approved by the 26 states that make up the borderless Schengen area. Non-Schengen members - including the UK - would be invited to take part. A visual guide to the pandemic There have been more than 174,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and over 6,700 deaths,according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University.,external Speaking in Geneva, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said governments were not doing enough to combat the pandemic, and urged them to step up their testing programmes. ""You can't fight a fire blindfolded and we can't stop this pandemic if we don't know who is infected,"" he said. ""We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.""

To try to curb the economic turmoil, central banks around the world, including the US Federal Reserve and those in the UK, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland have cut interest rates and taken other measures. But stock markets in Asia and Europe still felland, on Wall St, trading was temporarily halted after the S&P 500 index dropped 8% on opening. It was the third time in six days that the session was interrupted. The EU's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said a recession was now expected, with a 2-2.5% negative growth. Airlines are also continuing to slash flightsas demand slumps. Germany had tried to resist closing its borders, to try to keep the Schengen agreement working, but traffic crossing the borders with the three neighbours and also Luxembourg will now be restricted to goods and people commuting for work. The aim is to stem the spread of the virus but also to curtail cross-border panic-buying, German media reported. Only the borders with the Netherlands and Belgium are as yet unaffected. Chancellor Angela Merkel announced a raft of other measures to limit social contact, including the closure of most non-grocery, cultural and entertainment venues. She also said people should cancel all domestic and foreign holiday travel. Schools in Germany were closed on Monday and large gatherings nationwide had already been banned.

German tourism giant TUI said on Monday it was suspending most of its operations and asked for state aid. Germany now has close to 5,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 12 deaths. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas responded to reports that US President Donald Trump wanted to buy exclusive access to a potential vaccine developed by a German biotech firm, saying: ""We cannot allow others to seek exclusive results.""

"Matt Colvin bought all of the hand sanitiser he could find in stores across Tennessee A man who stockpiled 17,700 bottles of hand sanitiser to sell on Amazon is being investigated for price gouging. Matt Colvin, from Chattanooga in Tennessee,told the New York Times,externalhe had faced a ""huge amount of whiplash"". Online platforms have cracked down on sellers listing coronavirus-related items at inflated prices. Mr Colvin later said he would donate his goods but on the same day Tennessee's attorney general opened an investigation, the Times reported. Mr Colvin said that from 1 March, the day after the first coronavirus-related death in the US was confirmed, he and his brother had spent three days driving across Tennessee, buying up all the hand sanitiser they could find. He then listed the bottles on Amazon, selling some for as much as $70 (Â£57). LIVE UPDATES:Follow the latest developments here EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Amazon then deleted listings of hand sanitiser, sanitising wipes and face masks with marked-up prices, while eBay outright prohibited the sale of any of these items. After the initial article was published, Mr Colvin faced a major backlash, with many accusing him of attempting to profit off a global crisis. He expressed remorse in a follow-up interview, saying he ""had no idea that these stores wouldnât be able to get replenished"". Price gouging - the act of re-selling an item in high demand with a ""grossly excessive"" price mark-up - is prohibited in the state of Tennessee if the governor has declared a state of emergency. If found guilty, a person can be fined up to $1,000 (Â£813). In a statement, Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III said: ""We will not tolerate price gouging in this time of exceptional need, and we will take aggressive action to stop it.""

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to speak to engineering firms on Monday about whether they can shift production lines to building NHS ventilators. It comes amid growing concern about a shortage of the life-saving equipment as coronavirus infections increase. Carmakers and the construction equipment firm JCB are among manufacturers to be contacted. Downing Street said it wanted the manufacturing sector ""to come together to help the country"". ""Preparing for the spread of the coronavirus outbreak is a national priority and we're calling on the manufacturing industry and all those with relevant expertise who might be able to help to come together to help the country tackle this national crisis,"" Downing Street said. ""We need to step up production of vital equipment such as ventilators so that we can all help the most vulnerable, and we need businesses to come to us and help in this national effort."" However, BBC business editor Simon Jack said that manufacturers were far from ready to switch production. One company told him that comparisons with the accelerated production of Spitfire aircraft during World War Two were misplaced as there was no accepted design nor guarantee components could be sourced quickly. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Getting through this is going to be a national effort"" It is understood one subject on the agenda during the prime minister's talks with industry on Monday is whether specialist firms that make ventilators and other critical equipment might be prepared to share their intellectual property. Engineers have already been asked to draw up plans to quickly produce more ventilators. And on Sunday evening, Tory MP Tom Tugendhat tweeted: ""The Prime Minister is calling for a National Effort for Ventilator production. We have been inundated with offers. ""If you produce ventilators please call the BEIS Business Support helpline on 0300 456 3565. A specific team receiving these calls will start at 10am tomorrow."" On Sunday's BBC Andrew Marr show, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said engineering firms should consider switching some manufacturing to help ramp production of the vital equipment. He accepted it was the kind of policy normally reserved for times of war. ""We've got high quality engineering in this country,"" Mr Hancock said. ""We want anybody who has the manufacturing capability to turn to the manufacture of ventilators, to do that."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic LATEST UPDATES:Follow live Ventilators are vital in the treatment of patients whose lungs have been attacked by the infection. The health secretary told Sky News that the country currently has 5,000 ventilators but said it would need ""many times more than that"". But questions remain over how engineering firms with no experience of producing ventilators will be able start manufacturing the complex medical devices. In a statement on Sunday, the chairman JCB, Lord Bamford, said: ""We have been approached by the prime minister to see if we can help with the production of ventilators. ""We have research and engineering teams actively looking at the request at the moment,"" he said. However, he continued: ""It's unclear as yet if we can assist, but as a British company, we will do whatever we can to help during the unprecedented times our country is facing."" A ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe by getting oxygen into the lungs and removing carbon dioxide Ventilators can be used to help a person breathe if they have lung disease or another condition that makes breathing difficult. They can also be used during and post-surgery A tube, connected to a ventilator machine, is placed in a person's mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat (called a tracheostomy) Manufacturing firm, Unipart, confirmed that it was involved in the discussions and aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce said it was ""keen to do whatever we can"". It is not just manufacturing firms that have offered their services. Hotel chain Best Western has said it could turn its properties into temporary hospitals if the NHS needed additional bed space during the coronavirus outbreak. The company said it had seen a surge in cancellations over the last month due to the outbreak. ""If the NHS wants additional bed space, and we can partner with other companies to provide the right medical equipment and supplies, and we can do it safely, then we would be willing to start having those conversations immediately,"" the hotel chain's boss, Rob Paterson, said. Manufacturers asked by the government to produce thousands of ventilators to help save the lives of seriously affected victims of coronavirus are not ready to fill the demand. Although firms including JCB, Unipart, Rolls-Royce and others are in close conversation with the government, no detailed blueprint for increased manufacture of the life-saving equipment currently exists. One manufacturer told the BBC that comparisons with the accelerated manufacture of Spitfire aircraft during World War Two were misplaced, as there was no accepted design. Even if there was, there is no guarantee the components could be sourced in time to even start production in the next two months. Ventilators are vital as medical experts estimate that between 10% and 20% of those who succumb to the virus will need critical care. Many of those will need help breathing. Although firms stand ready and able to produce more ventilators, a lack of clarity on design specifications and component sourcing mean that production remains many weeks away.

"Travel restrictions and a slump in demand due to the coronavirus have forced airlines to cancel most flights and temporarily reduce staff. Virgin Atlantic will cut four-fifths of its flights and has asked staff to take eight weeks of unpaid leave. Ryanair and EasyJet are grounding most of their fleets, while BA owner IAG is to cut capacity by 75%. Norwegian Air has cancelled thousands of flights and will temporarily lay off more than 7,500 staff. Holiday company Tui has said it will suspend the ""majority"" of its operations, affecting ""package travel, cruises and hotel"" bookings. Passenger numbers and bookings have plummeted in recent weeks as countries closed their borders and holiday makers cancelled trips. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate UK LATEST:What is the 'delay' phase? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Forecasts by the research firm Centre for Aviation now predict that most airlines in the world will be bankrupt by the end of May unless they receive financial support. ""Coordinated government and industry action is needed - now - if catastrophe is to be avoided,"" the firm said in a statement. ""Demand is drying up in ways that are completely unprecedented. Normality is not yet on the horizon."" In the US, airlines are in talks with the government about rescue funding, after announcing dramatic cuts to flight schedules and other measures. They are seeking up to $50bn in aid, according to the Wall Street Journal. In the UK, Virgin Atlantic has asked the government for support for the sector, including emergency credit of up to Â£7.5bn. EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren also called for government intervention to support the aviation industry. ""European aviation faces a precarious future and it is clear that co-ordinated government backing will be required to ensure the industry survives and is able to continue to operate when the crisis is over,"" he said. Virgin said that it was going to reduce its services to focus on ""core routes"". Its London Heathrow-Newark route will be cut immediately. The airline will also ask staff to take eight weeks unpaid leave over the next three months, with the cost spread over six months' salary. Virgin said it was doing this to avoid job losses, although it is also offering a voluntary redundancy package to all employees. Norwegian Air's temporary reduction in staff numbers will affect pilots, cabin crew and maintenance workers, roughly equalling 90% of its workforce. The coronavirus outbreak has had a severe impact on demand for air travel Over the weekend, Scandinavian airline SAS said it would temporarily halt most of its flights until conditions for commercial aviation improved. As a result, the airline said it would temporarily lay off up to 10,000 employees, or 90% of its workforce. IAG, which owns British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, said it had suspended flights to China, reduced capacity on Asian routes, cancelled all flights to, from and within Italy as well as making other changes to its network. ""There is no cash whatsoever coming in the doors,"" said aviation analyst John Strickland, who warned that airlines could lose money very quickly, despite such drastic measures. Mr Strickland described the reduction in airlines' operations as ""stunning"", warning that airlines can lose money ""very, very quickly"". Stemming the loss by cancelling flights and parking aircraft is one thing, he said, ""but airlines are both capital and labour intensive so there has to be support of the costs that cannot be avoided even if an airline is grounded"". Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, said he expects demand to remain weak well into the summer. BA's boss sent a memo to staff last week questioning the airline's survival if it did not make urgent changes. EasyJet said it had cancelled a ""further significant"" number of flights. ""These actions will continue on a rolling basis for the foreseeable future and could result in the grounding of the majority of the EasyJet fleet,"" it said. Mass cancellations of flights in an unprecedented situation may leave passengers unsure of their rights. For those yet to fly out, it is relatively straightforward - you should be given a refund or, in some cases, the option to rebook for another date. If this is part of a package holiday, then the entire cost of the holiday will be refunded. A separate hotel booking will require a call to the hotel, asking for leeway, or perhaps a travel insurance claim if the policy covers you. For those trying to get home, an airline has a duty of care to get you back if they have cancelled your flight. This may mean flying with another airline or putting you on a different mode of transport. If an extra overnight stay is required, the airline should pay for that as well as the food you need. However, for those who accept a refund for a cancelled return flight, the airline's duty of care ends at that point. You would then have to get yourself home, which could be difficult given the current restrictions.

"Global stock markets have sunk again despite central banks around the world announcing a co-ordinated effort to ease the effects of the coronavirus. The Dow Jones index closed 12.9% down after President Donald Trump said the economy ""may be"" heading for recession. London's FTSE 100 ended 4% lower, and other major European markets saw similar slides. On Sunday, theUS Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zeroand launched a $700bn stimulus programme. It was part of co-ordinated action announced alongside the eurozone, the UK, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland. However, investors are worried that central banks now have few options left to combat the impact of the pandemic. The new governor of the Bank of England,Andrew Bailey, has pledged to take ""prompt action again""when necessary to stop the damage to the economy from the coronavirus pandemic. David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets, said that while central bankers were trying to calm the markets, ""in reality it is having the opposite effect"". ""The radical measures have sent out a very worrying message to dealers, and that is why they are blindly dumping stocks."" In New York, steep falls as markets opened triggered another automatic halt to trading, which is meant to curb panic selling. Before last week, such halts, known as circuit breakers, had not been used in more than two decades. But the sell-off continued after the 15-minute suspension, with the Dow losing nearly 3,000 points or 12.9%, its worst percentage drop since 1987. The wider S&P 500 dropped 11.9%, while Nasdaq dropped 12.3%. All three indexes are now down more than 25% from their highs. In London, firms in the travel sector saw big falls. Share in holiday firm Tui sank more than 27% after it said it would suspend the ""majority"" of its operations.  BA-owner IAG fell more than 25% after it said it would cut its flight capacity by at least 75% in April and May. The FTSE 250, which includes a number of well-known UK-focused companies, ended down about 7.8%. New Bank of England boss pledges prompt action US in emergency rate cut and huge stimulus plan Airlines slash more flights as coronavirus hits PM urges industry to help make NHS ventilators All the main European share indexes fell sharply, though they later regained some ground. France's Cac 40 index fell more than 5.7% and Germany's Dax dropped more than 5.3%. Earlier in Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 closed down 2.5% and the Shanghai Composite in China ended the day 3.3% lower. Oil prices, which have been shaken by a price war between exporters, fell again. Brent crude dropped by more than 10% to less than $32 a barrel while West Texas International crude fell more than 8% to less than $30 a barrel. Only a few weeks ago, the fear was that factories grinding to a halt in China's Hubei province could cause global growth to stumble briefly. Then it became clear that the economic pain was likely to be much more extensive. Now, with tourism and leisure activities grinding to a halt and supply chains threatened, a widespread recession may be more likely than not. In other words, economic growth going into reverse for two consecutive quarters, which would mean cash flow emergencies for some businesses, possible corporate failures and rising unemployment. The challenge for policymakers is to stop that downturn. Sunday's extravaganza by the Fed showed how central banks can go big. But interest rate cuts are of limited use; they won't tempt customers to go out and spend in Marseille or New York when the bars are closed, and flights cancelled. So the markets are looking to governments for more targeted support and bailout packages. But even that won't calm nerves altogether. As banks enact their own workplace contingencies, what traders really want is a sign that the virus caseload has peaked, and then that the financial convalescence is on track. On Sunday, the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, cut its interest rates by 100 basis points to a target range of 0% to 0.25% and said it would offer at least $700bn for support to the markets in the coming weeks. The move comes as local officials across the US shut schools, restaurants and bars, sports leagues cancel tournaments, and retailers such as Urban Outfitters, Nike, and Gap announce hundreds of temporary store closures. Speaking after the announcement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said: ""The virus is having a profound effect."" But stock markets dived as investors worried that the world's biggest central banks may now have very little ammunition left to deal with the effects of the coronavirus if the global economic climate continues to worsen. ""They [the Fed] pulled out whatever weapons they had and my sense is I think it may help initially but I don't think it goes much further because this is still a developing issue. They used up basically all their ammunition and we're down to sticks and stones,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at Slatestone Wealth. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. Alongside the Fed, five other central banks - the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, and the Swiss National Bank - also announced measures to make it easier to provide dollars to their financial institutions facing stress in credit markets. The move was designed to bring down the price banks and companies pay for US dollars, which has surged in recent weeks. Andrew Sentance - a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates - told the BBC's Today programme that banks were acting to ensure enough credit was flowing. ""There was some criticism around the financial crisis that central banks didn't move quickly enough,"" he said. ""I see this as a partly precautionary action for central banks to show that they are doing as much as possible to keep the wheels of the economy turning."" Mr Sentance added that any further cut to the base rate in the UK, to 0.10% for example, would be ""symbolic, because it wouldn't have that much impact on companies or individuals"". In other developments on Monday: Strains continued in other parts of the market typically seen as less risky, with gold prices down more than 5% at one point The Bank of Japan eased monetary policy by pledging to buy risky assets at double the current pace and announced a new loan programme to extend one-year, zero-rate loans to financial institutions Shares in Australia recorded their biggest daily percentage fall on record, as the benchmark ASX 200 index dropped 9.7% The Reserve Bank of Australia said it ""stands ready"" to pump more money into the country's financial system New Zealand's central bank lowered interest rates by 75 basis points as it prepared for a ""significant"" hit to the economy.

"The coronavirus pandemic has reached almost every country in the world. Its spread has left national economies and businesses counting the costs, as governments struggle with new lockdown measures to tackle the spread of the virus. Despite the development of new vaccines, many are still wondering what recovery could look like. Here is a selection of charts and maps to help you understand the economic impact of the virus so far. Big shifts in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, can affect the value of pensions or individual savings accounts (Isas). The FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei all saw huge falls as the number of Covid-19 cases grew in the first months of the crisis. The major Asian and US stock markets have recovered following the announcement of the first vaccine in November, but the FTSE is still in negative territory. The FTSE dropped 14.3% in 2020, its worst performance since 2008. In response, central banks in many countries, including the UK, have slashed interest rates. That should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy. Some markets recovered ground in January this year, but this is a normal tendency known as the ""January effect"". Analysts are worried that the possibility of further lockdowns and delays in vaccination programmes might trigger more market volatility this year. Many people have lost their jobs or seen their incomes cut. Unemployment rates have increased across major economies. In the United States, the proportion of people out of work hit a yearly total of 8.9%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), signalling an end to a decade of jobs expansion. Millions of workers have also been put on government-supported job retention schemes as parts of the economy, such as tourism and hospitality, have come to a near standstill. The numbers of new job opportunities is still very low in many countries. Job vacancies in Australia have returned to the same level of 2019, but they are lagging in France, Spain, the UK and several other countries. Some experts have warned it could be years before levels of employment return to those seen before the pandemic. If the economy is growing, that generally means more wealth and more new jobs. It's measured by looking at the percentage change in gross domestic product, or the value of goods and services produced, typically over three months or a year. The IMF estimates that the global economy shrunk by 4.4% in 2020. The organisation described the decline as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The only major economy to grow in 2020 was China.It registered a growth of 2.3%. The IMF is, however, predicting global growth of 5.2% in 2021. That will be driven primarily by countries such as India and China, forecast to grow by 8.8% and 8.2% respectively. Recovery in big, services-reliant, economies that have been hit hard by the outbreak, such as the UK or Italy, is expected to be slow. The travel industry has been badly damaged, with airlines cutting flights and customers cancelling business trips and holidays. New variants of the virus - discovered only in recent months - have forced many countries to introduce tighter travel restrictions. Data from the flight tracking service Flight Radar 24 shows that the number of flights globally took a huge hit in 2020 and it is still a long way from recovery. The hospitality sector has been hit hard, with millions of jobs and many companies bankrupt. Data from Transparent,external- an industry-leading intelligence company that covers over 35 million hotel and rental listings worldwide - has registered a fall in reservations in all the top travel destinations. Billions of dollars have been lost in 2020 and although the forecast for 2021 is better, many analysts believe that international travel and tourism won't return to the normal pre-pandemic levels until around 2025. Retail footfall has seen unprecedented falls as shoppers stayed at home. New variants and surges in cases have made problems worse. Pedestrian numbers have fallen further from the first lockdown, according to research firm ShopperTrak, Separate research suggests that consumers are still feeling anxious about their return to stores.Accountancy giant EY,externalsays 67% customers are now not willing to travel more than 5 kilometres for shopping. This change in shopping behaviour has significantly boosted online retail, with a global revenue of $3.9 trillion in 2020. Governments around the world have pledged billions of dollars for a Covid-19 vaccine and treatment options. Shares in some pharmaceutical companies involved in vaccine development have shot up. Moderna, Novavax and AstraZeneca have seen significant rises. But Pfizer has seen its share price fall. The partnership with BioNTech, the high cost of production and management of the vaccine, and the growing number of same-size competitors have reduced the investors' trust in the company to have bigger revenue in 2021. A number of pharmaceutical firms have started already distributing doses and many countries have started their vaccination programmes. Many more - such as Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi/GSK - will join the vaccine distribution during 2021.

"Travel restrictions and a slump in demand due to the coronavirus have forced airlines to cancel most flights and temporarily reduce staff. Virgin Atlantic will cut four-fifths of its flights and has asked staff to take eight weeks of unpaid leave. Ryanair and EasyJet are grounding most of their fleets, while BA owner IAG is to cut capacity by 75%. Norwegian Air has cancelled thousands of flights and will temporarily lay off more than 7,500 staff. Holiday company Tui has said it will suspend the ""majority"" of its operations, affecting ""package travel, cruises and hotel"" bookings. Passenger numbers and bookings have plummeted in recent weeks as countries closed their borders and holiday makers cancelled trips. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate UK LATEST:What is the 'delay' phase? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Forecasts by the research firm Centre for Aviation now predict that most airlines in the world will be bankrupt by the end of May unless they receive financial support. ""Coordinated government and industry action is needed - now - if catastrophe is to be avoided,"" the firm said in a statement. ""Demand is drying up in ways that are completely unprecedented. Normality is not yet on the horizon."" In the US, airlines are in talks with the government about rescue funding, after announcing dramatic cuts to flight schedules and other measures. They are seeking up to $50bn in aid, according to the Wall Street Journal. In the UK, Virgin Atlantic has asked the government for support for the sector, including emergency credit of up to Â£7.5bn. EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren also called for government intervention to support the aviation industry. ""European aviation faces a precarious future and it is clear that co-ordinated government backing will be required to ensure the industry survives and is able to continue to operate when the crisis is over,"" he said. Virgin said that it was going to reduce its services to focus on ""core routes"". Its London Heathrow-Newark route will be cut immediately. The airline will also ask staff to take eight weeks unpaid leave over the next three months, with the cost spread over six months' salary. Virgin said it was doing this to avoid job losses, although it is also offering a voluntary redundancy package to all employees. Norwegian Air's temporary reduction in staff numbers will affect pilots, cabin crew and maintenance workers, roughly equalling 90% of its workforce. The coronavirus outbreak has had a severe impact on demand for air travel Over the weekend, Scandinavian airline SAS said it would temporarily halt most of its flights until conditions for commercial aviation improved. As a result, the airline said it would temporarily lay off up to 10,000 employees, or 90% of its workforce. IAG, which owns British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, said it had suspended flights to China, reduced capacity on Asian routes, cancelled all flights to, from and within Italy as well as making other changes to its network. ""There is no cash whatsoever coming in the doors,"" said aviation analyst John Strickland, who warned that airlines could lose money very quickly, despite such drastic measures. Mr Strickland described the reduction in airlines' operations as ""stunning"", warning that airlines can lose money ""very, very quickly"". Stemming the loss by cancelling flights and parking aircraft is one thing, he said, ""but airlines are both capital and labour intensive so there has to be support of the costs that cannot be avoided even if an airline is grounded"". Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, said he expects demand to remain weak well into the summer. BA's boss sent a memo to staff last week questioning the airline's survival if it did not make urgent changes. EasyJet said it had cancelled a ""further significant"" number of flights. ""These actions will continue on a rolling basis for the foreseeable future and could result in the grounding of the majority of the EasyJet fleet,"" it said. Mass cancellations of flights in an unprecedented situation may leave passengers unsure of their rights. For those yet to fly out, it is relatively straightforward - you should be given a refund or, in some cases, the option to rebook for another date. If this is part of a package holiday, then the entire cost of the holiday will be refunded. A separate hotel booking will require a call to the hotel, asking for leeway, or perhaps a travel insurance claim if the policy covers you. For those trying to get home, an airline has a duty of care to get you back if they have cancelled your flight. This may mean flying with another airline or putting you on a different mode of transport. If an extra overnight stay is required, the airline should pay for that as well as the food you need.

"Louis Vuitton owner LVMH will use its perfume production lines to start making hand sanitiser to protect people against the coronavirus outbreak. The luxury goods maker says it wants to help tackle a nationwide shortage of the anti-viral products across France. ""These gels will be delivered free of charge to the health authorities,"" LVMH announced on Sunday. France has now seen 120 deaths from the coronavirus as the pandemic spreads. ""LVMH will use the production lines of its perfume and cosmetic brands... to produce large quantities of hydroalcoholic gels from Monday,"" LVMH said in a statement. The factories normally produce perfume and makeup for luxury brands like Christian Dior and Givenchy. Asia stocks fall after global central bank action PM urges industry to help make NHS ventilators iPhone maker Foxconn starts making masks The French luxury conglomerate also owns well-known brands such as champagne maker Moet & Chandon, watchmaker Tag Heuer and jeweller Bulgari. ""LVMH will continue to honour this commitment for as long as necessary, in connection with the French health authorities,"" the company said. France has closed its restaurants, cafes and non-essential stores in an effort to combat the virus, which has infected an estimated 165,000 people and killed more than 6,000 worldwide. Governments across the world have called on manufacturers to help make products that are running low during the virus outbreak. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to ask UK engineering firms on Monday to shift production to build ventilators for the NHS. In China, at the peak of its coronavirus outbreak in February, electronics giant Foxconn switched some of its production from Apple iPhones to make surgical masks.

"Matt Colvin bought all of the hand sanitiser he could find in stores across Tennessee A man who stockpiled 17,700 bottles of hand sanitiser to sell on Amazon is being investigated for price gouging. Matt Colvin, from Chattanooga in Tennessee,told the New York Times,externalhe had faced a ""huge amount of whiplash"". Online platforms have cracked down on sellers listing coronavirus-related items at inflated prices. Mr Colvin later said he would donate his goods but on the same day Tennessee's attorney general opened an investigation, the Times reported. Mr Colvin said that from 1 March, the day after the first coronavirus-related death in the US was confirmed, he and his brother had spent three days driving across Tennessee, buying up all the hand sanitiser they could find. He then listed the bottles on Amazon, selling some for as much as $70 (Â£57). LIVE UPDATES:Follow the latest developments here EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Amazon then deleted listings of hand sanitiser, sanitising wipes and face masks with marked-up prices, while eBay outright prohibited the sale of any of these items. After the initial article was published, Mr Colvin faced a major backlash, with many accusing him of attempting to profit off a global crisis. He expressed remorse in a follow-up interview, saying he ""had no idea that these stores wouldnât be able to get replenished"". Price gouging - the act of re-selling an item in high demand with a ""grossly excessive"" price mark-up - is prohibited in the state of Tennessee if the governor has declared a state of emergency. If found guilty, a person can be fined up to $1,000 (Â£813). In a statement, Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III said: ""We will not tolerate price gouging in this time of exceptional need, and we will take aggressive action to stop it.""

"The candidates face off, six feet apart due to coronavirus concerns Nine months after 20 Democratic candidates gathered for the first debate of the 2020 primary season, it has come down to two candidates - Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Given the circumstances, one might expect a sombre mood with respectful disagreements. Instead it was an at-times feisty affair, with Sanders going on the attack in a way he never did four years ago in his unsuccessful presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton. If the Bernie revolution is on the ropes, the candidate - who just a few weeks ago was considered the front-runner - isn't going to go down without a fight. Both candidates discussed the personal steps that they - as at-risk elderly individuals - were taking to avoid contracting the coronavirus, including limiting their public contacts, having their staff work remotely and holding online rallies and forums. Both septuagenarian candidates also had a few flubs. Biden referred to the 2009 swine flu as N1HI, not H1N1. Sanders at one point repeatedly referred to coronavirus as ""Ebola"". Biden also made news by promising to choose a woman as his vice-presidential running mate if he were to win the Democratic nomination. Sanders wouldn't make such a commitment, although he did say his ""very strong tendency would be to move in that direction"". Here's a look at some of the other key moments and conflicts. Unsurprisingly, the coronavirus pandemic - and the candidates' plans for addressing it - dominated the debate. An elbow bump replaced the pre-debate handshake Biden spoke of expanding testing, including mandating at least 10 drive-through sites in every state, bringing together global leaders and experts to form an international response to the virus and building new hospitals. Sanders agreed, adding that hospitals need to be provided with sufficient equipment and personnel to deal with the coming surge of critical patients. He also said the US should ""protect"" the wages of Americans who lose their job because of economic damage from the crisis. As the evening unfolded, however, a fundamental difference between the two candidates emerged - and it shouldn't be a big shock to those who have watched the exchanges over healthcare in any of the 10 previous Democratic debates. Biden said that the coronavirus was an urgent crisis that required the federal government to cover all costs of testing and treatment. US in emergency rate cut and huge stimulus plan Airports in disarray over virus screenings For Sanders, however, the pandemic was a reflection of the ""incredible weakness and dysfunctionality"" of the entire US healthcare system, which is structured around a for-profit private industry. He wants the government to pay for every medical ailment, not just this virus. ""In a good year, without the epidemic, we're losing up to 60,000 people who die every year because they don't get to a doctor on time,"" Sanders said. ""It's clear this crisis is only making a bad situation worse."" Biden countered that government-run healthcare was not the solution, noting that Italy has a Sanders-style government-run healthcare system that was being overwhelmed by the virus. Biden wants a publicly run health-insurance option that competes along side private insurers. Sanders wants the government to replace private insurance entirely. In the end, the coronavirus became just a new bullet-point in this much bigger debate within the Democratic Party. At one point early in the debate, Biden crystallised the key difference between the two candidates - not just on healthcare but on their entire governing philosophy. ""People are looking for results, not a revolution,"" he said. ""They want to deal with the results they need right now."" Biden is an incrementalist. A career political player, he is inclined to work within the system and sees politics as the art of the possible. Sanders, at his heart, is a revolutionary. He views the current political and economic system as irredeemably broken and in need of sweeping reform.  Sanders' view is that revolution is exactly what's necessary to bring about fundamental change. Eighteen things Bernie Sanders believes How much does Sanders want to spend? ""If you want to make real changes in this country; if you want to create an economy that works for all, not just the few; if you want to guarantee quality health care to all, not make $100 billion in profit for the health care industry, you know what you need?"" Sanders asked. ""You need to take on Wall Street; you need to take on the drug companies and the insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry."" The question is whether Americans are ready for the kind of real change Sanders is calling for. If the voting results in the Democratic primaries so far are any indication, they may not be so ambitious. The sharpest exchanges came when the two went after each other on past votes and positions. Sanders hit Biden on his past support for considering cuts to the government-run Social Security retirement programme, as well as his votes for a gay marriage ban, the Iraq War, stringent bankruptcy reform, free-trade bills and prohibitions on public-funding of abortion. ""The people of America know my record, OK?"" Sanders said. ""For 30 years, I have stood with the working families of this country. I have taken on every special interest there is out there. And that is what I will do in the White House. That's a very different record than Joe's."" Five Joe Biden weaknesses Profile: Third White House run for 'Middle Class Joe' Biden countered by hitting Sanders for his past opposition to gun-control legislation and a recent vote against sanctioning Russia for its 2016 election interference. ""Go to the YouTube right now,"" Sanders said at one point, urging viewers to see Biden's 1995 Social Security comments on the floor of the US Senate. Biden, who has taken many positions over his nearly 50-year political career that are out of step with the current views of the Democratic Party, ultimately defended himself by trying to change the focus. ""The question is,"" he said, ""what do we do from this point on? This Democratic primary debate - conducted in the shadow of the coronavirus outbreak, moved from Phoenix to a Washington, DC, studio at the last minute and held without an audience or a crush of media watching from an adjoining spin room - may end up as the last one of this election cycle. If so, what a strange and unexpected coda it would be to more than 14 months of campaigning by dozens of candidates. Polls indicate that on Tuesday Biden is poised to post dominating wins over Sanders in Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Arizona, further extending his lead in the all-important count of delegates to the national convention in July. National polls give Biden a sizable lead, suggesting that Democratic voters are ready for this race to be over and for the general election contest against Donald Trump - who was only occasionally mentioned in this debate - to begin. This video can not be played âWe voted for Obama, then Trumpâ - who can win over these swing voters? Of course, in a post-debate interview Sanders suggested that the he wasn't sure ""it makes a lot of sense"" to hold this week's primaries given the coronavirus outbreak, where many voters - including the elderly - could be in close contact. Two primaries set to be held later in the month, in Georgia and Louisiana, have already been delayed. If that turns out to be the case, perhaps the Democratic contest - while effectively nearing its conclusion - may linger in a suspended state for some time to come.

""People are looking for results, not a revolution,"" he said. ""They want to deal with the results they need right now."" Biden is an incrementalist. A career political player, he is inclined to work within the system and sees politics as the art of the possible. Sanders, at his heart, is a revolutionary. He views the current political and economic system as irredeemably broken and in need of sweeping reform.  Sanders' view is that revolution is exactly what's necessary to bring about fundamental change. Eighteen things Bernie Sanders believes How much does Sanders want to spend? ""If you want to make real changes in this country; if you want to create an economy that works for all, not just the few; if you want to guarantee quality health care to all, not make $100 billion in profit for the health care industry, you know what you need?"" Sanders asked. ""You need to take on Wall Street; you need to take on the drug companies and the insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry."" The question is whether Americans are ready for the kind of real change Sanders is calling for. If the voting results in the Democratic primaries so far are any indication, they may not be so ambitious. The sharpest exchanges came when the two went after each other on past votes and positions. Sanders hit Biden on his past support for considering cuts to the government-run Social Security retirement programme, as well as his votes for a gay marriage ban, the Iraq War, stringent bankruptcy reform, free-trade bills and prohibitions on public-funding of abortion. ""The people of America know my record, OK?"" Sanders said. ""For 30 years, I have stood with the working families of this country. I have taken on every special interest there is out there. And that is what I will do in the White House. That's a very different record than Joe's."" Five Joe Biden weaknesses Profile: Third White House run for 'Middle Class Joe' Biden countered by hitting Sanders for his past opposition to gun-control legislation and a recent vote against sanctioning Russia for its 2016 election interference. ""Go to the YouTube right now,"" Sanders said at one point, urging viewers to see Biden's 1995 Social Security comments on the floor of the US Senate. Biden, who has taken many positions over his nearly 50-year political career that are out of step with the current views of the Democratic Party, ultimately defended himself by trying to change the focus. ""The question is,"" he said, ""what do we do from this point on? This Democratic primary debate - conducted in the shadow of the coronavirus outbreak, moved from Phoenix to a Washington, DC, studio at the last minute and held without an audience or a crush of media watching from an adjoining spin room - may end up as the last one of this election cycle. If so, what a strange and unexpected coda it would be to more than 14 months of campaigning by dozens of candidates. Polls indicate that on Tuesday Biden is poised to post dominating wins over Sanders in Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Arizona, further extending his lead in the all-important count of delegates to the national convention in July. National polls give Biden a sizable lead, suggesting that Democratic voters are ready for this race to be over and for the general election contest against Donald Trump - who was only occasionally mentioned in this debate - to begin. This video can not be played âWe voted for Obama, then Trumpâ - who can win over these swing voters? Of course, in a post-debate interview Sanders suggested that the he wasn't sure ""it makes a lot of sense"" to hold this week's primaries given the coronavirus outbreak, where many voters - including the elderly - could be in close contact. Two primaries set to be held later in the month, in Georgia and Louisiana, have already been delayed. If that turns out to be the case, perhaps the Democratic contest - while effectively nearing its conclusion - may linger in a suspended state for some time to come.

"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell held a media conference on Sunday The US has cut interest rates to almost zero and launched a $700bn stimulus programme in a bid to protect the economy from the effect of coronavirus. It is part of a co-ordinated action announced on Sunday in the UK, Japan, eurozone, Canada, and Switzerland. In a news conference Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the pandemic was having a ""profound"" impact on the economy. US President Donald Trump said the emergency action ""makes me very happy"". The Fed has cut rates to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and said it would it begin buying bonds - quantitative easing - a move that pumps money directly into the economy. The central bank had already cut interest rates by half a percentage point after an emergency meeting on 3 March. That had been the first rate cut outside of a regularly scheduled policy meeting since the financial crisis in 2008. Stock markets have plunged in recent days amid fears that economic paralysis will wipe out corporate profits and spark a global recession. But early indications suggest the Fed's move may not shore up financial markets. US stock market futures, which anticipate the direction of shares when trading begins, were almost 4% down. LIVE UPDATES:Follow the latest developments here EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Speaking after the emergency meeting, which was held in place of the Fed's regular rates setting decision scheduled for this week, Mr Powell warned that although it was clear the outbreak was already having a major impact on the economy it was still too early to tell just how far-reaching the effects will be. ""The economic outlook is evolving on a daily basis and it is depending on the spread of the virus... that is not something that is knowable,"" he said. As part of Sunday's announcement, the Fed will work with other central banks to increase the availability of dollars for commercial banks. These so-called currency swap lines,externalwere an important tool in maintaining financial stability after the 2008 banking crisis. ""Today's coordinated action by major central banks will improve global liquidity by lowering the price and extending the maximum term of US dollar lending operations,"" Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in a joint statement with Andrew Bailey, who succeeds him as BoE chief on Monday. The Bank of Japan also eased monetary policy by pledging to buy risky assets at double the current pace and announced a new loan programme to extend one-year, zero-rate loans to financial institutions. The Federal Reserve has now fired most of its remaining big guns to stimulate a US economy facing a serious financial shock from the coronavirus. Interest rates were slashed by one full percentage point to just above zero, and the bank restarted the pumping of hundreds of billions of dollars into financial markets. Global central banks, including the Bank of England, joined in to ease the flow of dollars around the world. It was the full crisis toolkit designed to inject confidence into markets that ran riot last week as the outbreak turned into a global pandemic. While the moves should soothe the financing of US business, they also reflect that the health emergency in the US has become far worse than expected and reveals US authorities are running short of options. Interest rate cuts are a blunt instrument to deal with a pandemic, and more is expected from Congress and the White House, in particular. President Trump welcomed the cut, but it was his decision to ban European travel that sparked the latest record share sell off on Thursday. There is some hope that a video conference call later between leaders of the G7 western industrialised nations, including President Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, will result in a more coordinated global approach to the virus. The authorities will be watching markets carefully today, including Mr Bailey, on his first day in the job. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at UK-based CMC Markets, described the co-ordinated move as throwing ""the kitchen sink at the markets. [It] serves to underscore the seriousness of the economic shocks coming our way"". And in the US, Greg McBridge, chief financial analyst at online bank and mortgage firm Bankrate.com, said: ""Desperate times call for desperate measures and the Fed is doing just that in an effort to keep credit markets functioning and prevent the type of starving of credit that nearly toppled the global economy into a depression in 2008. ""Reducing interest rates to borrowers will ease the burden of existing debts slightly but is unlikely to spur the usual surge of borrowing as consumers and businesses batten down the hatches for a coming drop off in US economic activity.""

"Global stock markets have sunk again despite central banks around the world announcing a co-ordinated effort to ease the effects of the coronavirus. The Dow Jones index closed 12.9% down after President Donald Trump said the economy ""may be"" heading for recession. London's FTSE 100 ended 4% lower, and other major European markets saw similar slides. On Sunday, theUS Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zeroand launched a $700bn stimulus programme. It was part of co-ordinated action announced alongside the eurozone, the UK, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland. However, investors are worried that central banks now have few options left to combat the impact of the pandemic. The new governor of the Bank of England,Andrew Bailey, has pledged to take ""prompt action again""when necessary to stop the damage to the economy from the coronavirus pandemic. David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets, said that while central bankers were trying to calm the markets, ""in reality it is having the opposite effect"". ""The radical measures have sent out a very worrying message to dealers, and that is why they are blindly dumping stocks."" In New York, steep falls as markets opened triggered another automatic halt to trading, which is meant to curb panic selling. Before last week, such halts, known as circuit breakers, had not been used in more than two decades. But the sell-off continued after the 15-minute suspension, with the Dow losing nearly 3,000 points or 12.9%, its worst percentage drop since 1987. The wider S&P 500 dropped 11.9%, while Nasdaq dropped 12.3%. All three indexes are now down more than 25% from their highs. In London, firms in the travel sector saw big falls. Share in holiday firm Tui sank more than 27% after it said it would suspend the ""majority"" of its operations.  BA-owner IAG fell more than 25% after it said it would cut its flight capacity by at least 75% in April and May. The FTSE 250, which includes a number of well-known UK-focused companies, ended down about 7.8%. New Bank of England boss pledges prompt action US in emergency rate cut and huge stimulus plan Airlines slash more flights as coronavirus hits PM urges industry to help make NHS ventilators All the main European share indexes fell sharply, though they later regained some ground. France's Cac 40 index fell more than 5.7% and Germany's Dax dropped more than 5.3%. Earlier in Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 closed down 2.5% and the Shanghai Composite in China ended the day 3.3% lower. Oil prices, which have been shaken by a price war between exporters, fell again. Brent crude dropped by more than 10% to less than $32 a barrel while West Texas International crude fell more than 8% to less than $30 a barrel. Only a few weeks ago, the fear was that factories grinding to a halt in China's Hubei province could cause global growth to stumble briefly. Then it became clear that the economic pain was likely to be much more extensive. Now, with tourism and leisure activities grinding to a halt and supply chains threatened, a widespread recession may be more likely than not. In other words, economic growth going into reverse for two consecutive quarters, which would mean cash flow emergencies for some businesses, possible corporate failures and rising unemployment. The challenge for policymakers is to stop that downturn. Sunday's extravaganza by the Fed showed how central banks can go big. But interest rate cuts are of limited use; they won't tempt customers to go out and spend in Marseille or New York when the bars are closed, and flights cancelled. So the markets are looking to governments for more targeted support and bailout packages. But even that won't calm nerves altogether. As banks enact their own workplace contingencies, what traders really want is a sign that the virus caseload has peaked, and then that the financial convalescence is on track. On Sunday, the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, cut its interest rates by 100 basis points to a target range of 0% to 0.25% and said it would offer at least $700bn for support to the markets in the coming weeks. The move comes as local officials across the US shut schools, restaurants and bars, sports leagues cancel tournaments, and retailers such as Urban Outfitters, Nike, and Gap announce hundreds of temporary store closures. Speaking after the announcement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said: ""The virus is having a profound effect."" But stock markets dived as investors worried that the world's biggest central banks may now have very little ammunition left to deal with the effects of the coronavirus if the global economic climate continues to worsen. ""They [the Fed] pulled out whatever weapons they had and my sense is I think it may help initially but I don't think it goes much further because this is still a developing issue. They used up basically all their ammunition and we're down to sticks and stones,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at Slatestone Wealth. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. Alongside the Fed, five other central banks - the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, and the Swiss National Bank - also announced measures to make it easier to provide dollars to their financial institutions facing stress in credit markets. The move was designed to bring down the price banks and companies pay for US dollars, which has surged in recent weeks. Andrew Sentance - a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates - told the BBC's Today programme that banks were acting to ensure enough credit was flowing. ""There was some criticism around the financial crisis that central banks didn't move quickly enough,"" he said. ""I see this as a partly precautionary action for central banks to show that they are doing as much as possible to keep the wheels of the economy turning."" Mr Sentance added that any further cut to the base rate in the UK, to 0.10% for example, would be ""symbolic, because it wouldn't have that much impact on companies or individuals"". In other developments on Monday: Strains continued in other parts of the market typically seen as less risky, with gold prices down more than 5% at one point The Bank of Japan eased monetary policy by pledging to buy risky assets at double the current pace and announced a new loan programme to extend one-year, zero-rate loans to financial institutions Shares in Australia recorded their biggest daily percentage fall on record, as the benchmark ASX 200 index dropped 9.7% The Reserve Bank of Australia said it ""stands ready"" to pump more money into the country's financial system New Zealand's central bank lowered interest rates by 75 basis points as it prepared for a ""significant"" hit to the economy.

"The candidates face off, six feet apart due to coronavirus concerns Nine months after 20 Democratic candidates gathered for the first debate of the 2020 primary season, it has come down to two candidates - Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Given the circumstances, one might expect a sombre mood with respectful disagreements. Instead it was an at-times feisty affair, with Sanders going on the attack in a way he never did four years ago in his unsuccessful presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton. If the Bernie revolution is on the ropes, the candidate - who just a few weeks ago was considered the front-runner - isn't going to go down without a fight. Both candidates discussed the personal steps that they - as at-risk elderly individuals - were taking to avoid contracting the coronavirus, including limiting their public contacts, having their staff work remotely and holding online rallies and forums. Both septuagenarian candidates also had a few flubs. Biden referred to the 2009 swine flu as N1HI, not H1N1. Sanders at one point repeatedly referred to coronavirus as ""Ebola"". Biden also made news by promising to choose a woman as his vice-presidential running mate if he were to win the Democratic nomination. Sanders wouldn't make such a commitment, although he did say his ""very strong tendency would be to move in that direction"". Here's a look at some of the other key moments and conflicts. Unsurprisingly, the coronavirus pandemic - and the candidates' plans for addressing it - dominated the debate. An elbow bump replaced the pre-debate handshake Biden spoke of expanding testing, including mandating at least 10 drive-through sites in every state, bringing together global leaders and experts to form an international response to the virus and building new hospitals. Sanders agreed, adding that hospitals need to be provided with sufficient equipment and personnel to deal with the coming surge of critical patients. He also said the US should ""protect"" the wages of Americans who lose their job because of economic damage from the crisis. As the evening unfolded, however, a fundamental difference between the two candidates emerged - and it shouldn't be a big shock to those who have watched the exchanges over healthcare in any of the 10 previous Democratic debates. Biden said that the coronavirus was an urgent crisis that required the federal government to cover all costs of testing and treatment. US in emergency rate cut and huge stimulus plan Airports in disarray over virus screenings For Sanders, however, the pandemic was a reflection of the ""incredible weakness and dysfunctionality"" of the entire US healthcare system, which is structured around a for-profit private industry. He wants the government to pay for every medical ailment, not just this virus. ""In a good year, without the epidemic, we're losing up to 60,000 people who die every year because they don't get to a doctor on time,"" Sanders said. ""It's clear this crisis is only making a bad situation worse."" Biden countered that government-run healthcare was not the solution, noting that Italy has a Sanders-style government-run healthcare system that was being overwhelmed by the virus. Biden wants a publicly run health-insurance option that competes along side private insurers. Sanders wants the government to replace private insurance entirely. In the end, the coronavirus became just a new bullet-point in this much bigger debate within the Democratic Party. At one point early in the debate, Biden crystallised the key difference between the two candidates - not just on healthcare but on their entire governing philosophy. ""People are looking for results, not a revolution,"" he said. ""They want to deal with the results they need right now."" Biden is an incrementalist.

The UK also saw a single-day record, with 14 new deaths and a total of 35. Governments across Europe have responded by curbing the movements of citizens and tightening borders. Germany is to impose controls on its borderswith France, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark and Luxembourg as of Monday morning, while Portugal will clamp down on its frontier with Spain. The Czech government has introduced stringent lockdown measures: people will be allowed to go to and from work and buy food or medicine, and make urgent family visits, but otherwise free movement will be severely limited from midnight (23:00 GMT) on Sunday until 24 March. Austria is banning gatherings of more than five people from Monday, and the Republic of Ireland is asking pubs to shut until 29 March. Schools will be closed across many European states.

Italy has borne the heaviest burden from the pandemic with 24,747 infections and 1,218 of its fatalities were recorded in one region, Lombardy, which is home to the business hub of Milan. The government put the whole country in lockdown last Monday, restricting people's movements and ordering the closure of all shops except food stores and pharmacies. Schools, gyms, museums, nightclubs and other venues had been closed earlier. On Saturday, Spain, which now has 7,753 infections, and France, which has 5,400, took drastic temporary measures of their own. The Spanish government banned people from leaving home except for buying essential supplies and medicines, or for work. The area near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris was quiet on Sunday In France, cafes, restaurants, cinemas and most shops are now shut. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called on member states to fight the pandemic with a rapidly co-ordinated response and pooled resources. She said the bloc would boost production of equipment such as ventilators, test kits and masks, which would then be shared across the EU instead of each country making its own supply. The export of these products to non-EU countries would be strictly controlled. To date,an estimated 162,687 people have been infected worldwide,external, with just under half of them in China (81,003 cases). An estimated 6,065 people have died, 3,085 of them in China.

However, investors are worried that central banks now have few options left to combat the impact of the pandemic. The new governor of the Bank of England,Andrew Bailey, has pledged to take ""prompt action again""when necessary to stop the damage to the economy from the coronavirus pandemic. David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets, said that while central bankers were trying to calm the markets, ""in reality it is having the opposite effect"". ""The radical measures have sent out a very worrying message to dealers, and that is why they are blindly dumping stocks."" In New York, steep falls as markets opened triggered another automatic halt to trading, which is meant to curb panic selling. Before last week, such halts, known as circuit breakers, had not been used in more than two decades. But the sell-off continued after the 15-minute suspension, with the Dow losing nearly 3,000 points or 12.9%, its worst percentage drop since 1987. The wider S&P 500 dropped 11.9%, while Nasdaq dropped 12.3%. All three indexes are now down more than 25% from their highs. In London, firms in the travel sector saw big falls. Share in holiday firm Tui sank more than 27% after it said it would suspend the ""majority"" of its operations.  BA-owner IAG fell more than 25% after it said it would cut its flight capacity by at least 75% in April and May. The FTSE 250, which includes a number of well-known UK-focused companies, ended down about 7.8%. New Bank of England boss pledges prompt action US in emergency rate cut and huge stimulus plan Airlines slash more flights as coronavirus hits PM urges industry to help make NHS ventilators All the main European share indexes fell sharply, though they later regained some ground. France's Cac 40 index fell more than 5.7% and Germany's Dax dropped more than 5.3%. Earlier in Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 closed down 2.5% and the Shanghai Composite in China ended the day 3.3% lower. Oil prices, which have been shaken by a price war between exporters, fell again. Brent crude dropped by more than 10% to less than $32 a barrel while West Texas International crude fell more than 8% to less than $30 a barrel. Only a few weeks ago, the fear was that factories grinding to a halt in China's Hubei province could cause global growth to stumble briefly. Then it became clear that the economic pain was likely to be much more extensive. Now, with tourism and leisure activities grinding to a halt and supply chains threatened, a widespread recession may be more likely than not. In other words, economic growth going into reverse for two consecutive quarters, which would mean cash flow emergencies for some businesses, possible corporate failures and rising unemployment. The challenge for policymakers is to stop that downturn. Sunday's extravaganza by the Fed showed how central banks can go big. But interest rate cuts are of limited use; they won't tempt customers to go out and spend in Marseille or New York when the bars are closed, and flights cancelled. So the markets are looking to governments for more targeted support and bailout packages. But even that won't calm nerves altogether. As banks enact their own workplace contingencies, what traders really want is a sign that the virus caseload has peaked, and then that the financial convalescence is on track. On Sunday, the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, cut its interest rates by 100 basis points to a target range of 0% to 0.25% and said it would offer at least $700bn for support to the markets in the coming weeks. The move comes as local officials across the US shut schools, restaurants and bars, sports leagues cancel tournaments, and retailers such as Urban Outfitters, Nike, and Gap announce hundreds of temporary store closures. Speaking after the announcement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said: ""The virus is having a profound effect."" But stock markets dived as investors worried that the world's biggest central banks may now have very little ammunition left to deal with the effects of the coronavirus if the global economic climate continues to worsen. ""They [the Fed] pulled out whatever weapons they had and my sense is I think it may help initially but I don't think it goes much further because this is still a developing issue. They used up basically all their ammunition and we're down to sticks and stones,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at Slatestone Wealth. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. Alongside the Fed, five other central banks - the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, and the Swiss National Bank - also announced measures to make it easier to provide dollars to their financial institutions facing stress in credit markets. The move was designed to bring down the price banks and companies pay for US dollars, which has surged in recent weeks. Andrew Sentance - a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates - told the BBC's Today programme that banks were acting to ensure enough credit was flowing. ""There was some criticism around the financial crisis that central banks didn't move quickly enough,"" he said. ""I see this as a partly precautionary action for central banks to show that they are doing as much as possible to keep the wheels of the economy turning."" Mr Sentance added that any further cut to the base rate in the UK, to 0.10% for example, would be ""symbolic, because it wouldn't have that much impact on companies or individuals"". In other developments on Monday: Strains continued in other parts of the market typically seen as less risky, with gold prices down more than 5% at one point The Bank of Japan eased monetary policy by pledging to buy risky assets at double the current pace and announced a new loan programme to extend one-year, zero-rate loans to financial institutions Shares in Australia recorded their biggest daily percentage fall on record, as the benchmark ASX 200 index dropped 9.7% The Reserve Bank of Australia said it ""stands ready"" to pump more money into the country's financial system New Zealand's central bank lowered interest rates by 75 basis points as it prepared for a ""significant"" hit to the economy.

"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell held a media conference on Sunday The US has cut interest rates to almost zero and launched a $700bn stimulus programme in a bid to protect the economy from the effect of coronavirus. It is part of a co-ordinated action announced on Sunday in the UK, Japan, eurozone, Canada, and Switzerland. In a news conference Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the pandemic was having a ""profound"" impact on the economy. US President Donald Trump said the emergency action ""makes me very happy"". The Fed has cut rates to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and said it would it begin buying bonds - quantitative easing - a move that pumps money directly into the economy. The central bank had already cut interest rates by half a percentage point after an emergency meeting on 3 March. That had been the first rate cut outside of a regularly scheduled policy meeting since the financial crisis in 2008. Stock markets have plunged in recent days amid fears that economic paralysis will wipe out corporate profits and spark a global recession. But early indications suggest the Fed's move may not shore up financial markets. US stock market futures, which anticipate the direction of shares when trading begins, were almost 4% down. LIVE UPDATES:Follow the latest developments here EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Speaking after the emergency meeting, which was held in place of the Fed's regular rates setting decision scheduled for this week, Mr Powell warned that although it was clear the outbreak was already having a major impact on the economy it was still too early to tell just how far-reaching the effects will be. ""The economic outlook is evolving on a daily basis and it is depending on the spread of the virus... that is not something that is knowable,"" he said. As part of Sunday's announcement, the Fed will work with other central banks to increase the availability of dollars for commercial banks. These so-called currency swap lines,externalwere an important tool in maintaining financial stability after the 2008 banking crisis. ""Today's coordinated action by major central banks will improve global liquidity by lowering the price and extending the maximum term of US dollar lending operations,"" Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in a joint statement with Andrew Bailey, who succeeds him as BoE chief on Monday. The Bank of Japan also eased monetary policy by pledging to buy risky assets at double the current pace and announced a new loan programme to extend one-year, zero-rate loans to financial institutions. The Federal Reserve has now fired most of its remaining big guns to stimulate a US economy facing a serious financial shock from the coronavirus. Interest rates were slashed by one full percentage point to just above zero, and the bank restarted the pumping of hundreds of billions of dollars into financial markets. Global central banks, including the Bank of England, joined in to ease the flow of dollars around the world. It was the full crisis toolkit designed to inject confidence into markets that ran riot last week as the outbreak turned into a global pandemic. While the moves should soothe the financing of US business, they also reflect that the health emergency in the US has become far worse than expected and reveals US authorities are running short of options. Interest rate cuts are a blunt instrument to deal with a pandemic, and more is expected from Congress and the White House, in particular. President Trump welcomed the cut, but it was his decision to ban European travel that sparked the latest record share sell off on Thursday. There is some hope that a video conference call later between leaders of the G7 western industrialised nations, including President Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, will result in a more coordinated global approach to the virus. The authorities will be watching markets carefully today, including Mr Bailey, on his first day in the job. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at UK-based CMC Markets, described the co-ordinated move as throwing ""the kitchen sink at the markets. [It] serves to underscore the seriousness of the economic shocks coming our way"". And in the US, Greg McBridge, chief financial analyst at online bank and mortgage firm Bankrate.com, said: ""Desperate times call for desperate measures and the Fed is doing just that in an effort to keep credit markets functioning and prevent the type of starving of credit that nearly toppled the global economy into a depression in 2008. ""Reducing interest rates to borrowers will ease the burden of existing debts slightly but is unlikely to spur the usual surge of borrowing as consumers and businesses batten down the hatches for a coming drop off in US economic activity.""

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Getting through this is going to be a national effort"" Every Briton over the age of 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period to protect themselves from coronavirus. When it happens, they will be asked to stay home for ""a very long time"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. The government is to release social distancing advice for elderly people on Monday - but they will not yet be asked to self-isolate for long periods. Fourteen more people have died from the virus, bringing deaths in the UK to 35. Mr Hancock told the BBC that manufacturers were being asked to help produce medical equipment, such as ventilators, to help with an expected surge in demand by the NHS. He also said hotels could be converted into makeshift hospitals, while the government has begun negotiating with private healthcare providers to obtain thousands of extra beds in private hospitals. The number of confirmed UK cases of the virus has reached 1,372, with 40,279 people tested, according to thelatest Department of Health figures,external. Almost all of the new cases were in England, but34 new cases were announced in Wales,32 in Scotlandand11 in Northern Ireland. Most of the 35 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK have so far been people aged over 60 and with underlying health conditions. People self-isolating with mild symptoms of the virus are no longer being tested.The government says,externaltests will primarily be given: To all patients needing hospital treatment for pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or a flu-like illness Where an outbreak has occurred in a residential or care setting, for example long-term care facilities or prisons This video can not be played Watch: How to self-isolate Mr Hancock said the over-70s and people with certain health conditions would soon be asked to self-isolate - but he did not say for how long. He toldthe BBC's Andrew Marr Showpeople without symptoms would still be able to visit older relatives and friends as long as they stayed 2m (6ft) away from them. Five ways hospitals will change to tackle virus 'I've cancelled my wedding because of coronavirus' Some scientists say UK virus strategy 'risks lives' The health secretary also said the NHS would stop non-urgent surgery and retrain medics from other specialisms to treat those with the disease caused by coronavirus, Covid-19. He said details of emergency legislation giving the government more powers to deal with the outbreak will be shared on Tuesday. This video can not be played Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticises the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic The health minister for Wales, Vaughan Gething, said it was ""entirely possible"" elderly people would be asked to self-isolate for long periods. ""That shouldn't be a surprise,"" he added. But the Scottish government said it had no plans to isolate the elderly, and would instead""ask them to reduce social contact"". Jeane Freeman, Mr Hancock's counterpart in Scotland, said: ""We don't want people who are elderly to be stuck in their homes alone not contacting anyone, with their families not able to be in touch with them and to help them."" Scottish ministers have also advised against gatherings of 500 people or more. They do not have the power to call off events but have urged organisers to ""act responsibly"" by cancelling such gatherings from Monday. Mary Matthews paid tribute to her husband, Nick, on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""best friend"" The 14 patients whose deaths were announced on Sunday were aged between 59 and 94 and all had underlying health conditions, NHS England said. Among them was retired police officer Nick Matthews, 59, of Nailsea, near Bristol, who died at Bristol Royal Infirmary in the early hours of Saturday. His wife, Mary, paid tribute on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""soul mate"" and ""best friend"". EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic She urged people not to visit her and her family until their own test results for the virus came back. Mr and Mrs Matthews had returned from a holiday in Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, on 29 February. Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available at the moment -  but that many times that number would be needed. Car companies and weapon manufacturers are among the firmsthe government has asked to help to make ventilatorsto treat Covid-19 patients. Ventilators treat severe breathing problems caused by Covid-19 by giving people oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from their lungs. Digger manufacturer JCB said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had asked if it could help. JCB chairman Lord Bamford said it was ""unclear"" whether the firm could agree to do so, but that engineers were ""actively looking"" at the request. Shielding the vulnerable and elderly will be an essential part of the government's strategy when cases are rising rapidly - it was one of the decisions signed off at an emergency Cobra meeting on Thursday. Half of the overall cases are expected within a period of a few weeks, with 95% in a period of around 10 weeks. So officials will ask those at most risk of developing severe illness to stay at home. They believe if they get the timing right and people adhere to it the move could reduce the number of deaths by up to a third. But it of course carries its own risks - mentally and physically. They believe the longest they could ask people to do this for is around 12 weeks. That's why it's essential people don't start too soon. At the moment the vulnerable groups should be protected to a degree by the fact that the small number of people with the virus should be self-isolating. But officials recognise individuals will make their own decisions about when to start.

Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the UK's Labour Party, has this evening been holding talks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Downing Street. Speaking afterwards to the BBC, he said he supported many of the measures announced earlier but was critical of the governmentâs communication strategy and lack of support for citizens on low incomes. ""If this virus affects us all, as it does, we all have to be treated fairly and properly in this,"" he said. He said he had told the PM that testing for the virus, particularly among NHS workers was ""inadequate"" and he was worried about the lack of ventilators and trained staff. Mr Corbyn, who stands down next month, also said he would not be self-isolating even though heâs over
70. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The UK's plan has shifted because the
scientific modelling showed we were on course for a ""catastrophic
epidemic"". A strategy of just slowing the spread of
the virus, but not trying to stop it, would have overwhelmed intensive care
units. The modelling by Imperial College London
has been heavily informed by the experience in Italy and is influencing
decisions at the heart of government. Their calculations predicted 260,000
deaths in the UK. Instead the plan is to drive down the
number of cases to very low levels, which the models predict will limit deaths
from coronavirus to the thousands or tens of thousands. However, this approach comes with a
major problem - there is no exit strategy. Without the immunity that would build up
if people were infected, then cases would soar as soon as measures are lifted. The report said these could need to be
in place until a vaccine is available, which could take up to 18 months. We are in this for the long haul. Public Health England has published more details about thesocial distancing recommendations announced,externalearlier by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It says those aged over 70 and pregnant women are among those who should ""stringently"" follow the advice on avoiding non-essential use of public transport, working from home and not having friends and family to visit. And it warns that anyone under 70 with a range of underlying health conditions is also at increased risk of suffering ""severe"" illness. The conditions it lists include:  It also gives some tips to people on how to look after their mental health in the tough weeks and months ahead. It says people shouldn't fear going for a walk outdoors if they stay more than 2 metres from others. Other advice includes:  France will deploy 100,000 police officers to ensure that people abide by restrictions on movement to avoid the spread of coronavirus, its interior minister has said. Christophe Castaner said people who venture outside their homes will have to justify their reason for doing so. Speaking at a news conference, he said people may be fined if they break the rules. Exceptions will be made in some circumstances, including for travel between home and work, Mr Castaner said. ""Too many people still disregard the health instructions given,"" Mr Castaner said. His announcement comes after French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a series of drastic new measures designed to stem the spread of coronavirus. From
Tuesday, people should stay at home unless they are buying groceries, travelling to work, exercising or seeking medical
care, Mr Macron said. Helier CheungBBC News A drive-through in a health centre in West Palm Beach, Florida offers testing The World Health Organization warned on Monday that testing is essential to stopping the pandemic. Questions have been raised in the US about the government's approach to testing and how widely available test kits are. So what's the situation there? It's hard to tell - and
even officials have struggled to say how many individuals have been tested. According to the latest figures,external, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and public
health labs have tested over 25,100 specimens for Coronavirus. But that number doesn't give a full picture of how many people were tested -
because many people provide more than one specimen for testing, and many
private health laboratories are also conducting tests. One project by The Atlantic estimates that 41,550 people in the US
have been tested. But that's still fewer than many other countries with smaller
populations - including South Korea, which has tested 240,000, and the UK,
which has tested 44,100. The government has come under heavy criticism - from both
Democratic and Republican lawmakers - over the lack of tests. President Trump
has now promised that five million tests will be available within a month - but
also warned: ""We don't want everyone running out and
taking [the test] - only if you have certain symptoms."" Read more about the US and coronavirus testing here. Some British doctors working overseas are returning to the UK to help treat patients in the coronavirus outbreak, one doctor has told BBC News. Red Elmahdi, who completed her medical training in the UK before specialising in epidemiology research, has flown back from the lab where she was working in Denmark. ""Thereâs little point my sitting around in lockdown doing research from home in Denmark when Iâm seeing the mounting strain on the NHS,"" she explains. However Dr Elmahdi says there has been no central co-ordination and she is relying on her locum agency to be placed in hospital. Dr Red Elmahdi is a specialist in sexually transmitted infectious disease epidemiology Food banks in the UK say they are experiencing a shortage of basic items because shoppers are stockpiling as fears grow over the spread of coronavirus. Organisers of one in Islington, north London,announced they had decided to close due,externalto dwindling food supplies and a desire to protect the ""health and safety of our volunteers and clients"". Other food banks across the UK have said some items including pasta and rice are hard to get. It comes after UK supermarketsurged shoppers not to buy more than they needamid concern over coronavirus-linked stockpiling.  Rajesh Makwana says his food bank in Brent was pre-packaging goods into parcels to prevent germs spreading President Trump said postponing US elections would be ""unnecessary"" President Trump has rebuffed growing calls for US elections to be postponed, calling such a move ""unnecessary"". Four US states - Ohio, Illinois,
Florida and Arizona - are scheduled to host primaries for the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday. Ohioâs Republican governor Mike DeWine has said he will file a lawsuit to postpone the election in his state until 2 June, 2020. In his news conference at the White House, Mr Trump did not seem open to the suggestion of postponement. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing,"" Mr Trump said. ""I think postponing is unnecessary."" He suggested elections could be held safely by ""spreading people out"". âThey have lots of room in lots of electoral places,â Mr Trump said.

Earlier this evening the UK government announced a number of new measures including advising people to avoid gatherings and crowded places. Here is a taste of how theatres in the UK have reacted:  Head of the Creative Industries Federation and Creative England Caroline Norbury says the measures have the potential to ""devastate"" the UK's theatres, museums, cinemas and venues as well as those who work in the industry. She says that as the social-distancing measures are ""only advisory rather than an outright ban"", creative organisations may be unable to claim compensation for the losses they could experience. ""It is vital that government puts in place support to ensure that our world-leading creative sector is able to survive Covid-19,"" she added. Howard JohnsonPhilippines Correspondent, BBC News Authorities have started implementing the lockdown in Manila Foreign tourists intending to leave the Philippines from international airports in the countryâs main Luzon region have been given 72 hours to do so, starting from 16:00 GMT today. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte earlier announced that Luzon,
which has an estimated population of more than 50 million people and includes
the capital city, Metro Manila, is to be placed under strict âenhanced community
quarantineâ until 12 April. The British embassy in Manila says âa small numberâ of British nationals are affected. On Sunday, Britons were advised against all but essential travel to the Philippines. The government says the country currently has a total of 142 confirmed Covid-19 cases with 12 deaths. But Dr Manuel Dayrit, the countryâs health secretary during the SARS outbreak of 2003, believes the number is relatively low compared with other countries because not enough preemptive testing has been taking place. âWe are actually limited by the fact we are not doing any testing for COVID-19 in the community,â Dr Dayrit told BBC News. âWe are only testing the patients that show up in the hospitals usually with pneumonia, so we can only speculate how extensive community spread is.â  It's been a whirlwind few hours with dramatic announcements from both sides of the Atlantic and beyond. Here's what you need to know: In the UK:  In other European countries:  In the US:  In the markets:    Aintree Racecourse has announced that this year's Grand National on 4 April will not take place because of
the coronavirus pandemic. The Grand National is one of the key events in the horse racing calendar and attracts an estimated global TV audience of 600 million.

Jeremy Corbyn - leader of the UK's Labour Party - has called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to extend full sick pay and lost earnings protection to all workers required to self-isolate. He is also urging the government to reduce the waiting time for new universal credit claimants, ban eviction of tenants affected by the outbreak and raise statutory sick pay in line with other European countries. ""Jeremy Corbyn will emphasise that Labour stands with all communities during this crisis, and that the opposition will hold the government to account to ensure no-one is left behind,"" a party spokesman said. Earlier today, Mr Johnson advised everyone in the UK to avoid ""non-essential"" travel and contact with others to fight the spread of Covid-19. Read all the details here. Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Countries in the Western Balkans and the former Yugoslavia have closed schools, shops and borders to contain the coronavirus outbreak. In Sloveniaâs capital, Ljubljana, the Monday afternoon streets were quieter than a standard Sunday morning. Public transport was not running, though adverts on the video screens next to the deserted bus stops reminded the non-existent passengers to practise good hygiene. Further down the Balkan peninsula, borders have closed. Croatia imposed a 14-day self-isolation period for many arrivals; Serbia has simply sealed its borders to almost everyone. As Serbia is not an EU member, it is counting on help from elsewhere. President Aleksandar Vucic says China is suppling masks, ventilators and doctors. Albania imposed a strict lockdown over the weekend and imposed a 6pm curfew from today. Even a daytime stroll in the park has been ruled out by Prime Minister Edi Rama. âHiking is not vital at this time of war,â he said on his Facebook page. Ljubljana's usually busy streets are now deserted This video can not be played WATCH - coronavirus questions answered If you've got some questions about the virus, and particularly the response in the UK, this video is for you. The BBC's Clive Myrie is joined by BBC Health Editor Hugh Pym and other experts to answer questions including:  Russia has temporarily banned all foreigners from entering the country, following other nations worldwide in restricting travel over the coronavirus pandemic. The ban will come into effect on 18 March and will remain in place until 1 May, the government said on Monday. Exceptions will be made for diplomats and permanent residents. Some 93 cases of the virus have been reported so far in Russia. Russia has beenaccused of spreading disinformation about the new coronavirus outbreak on social media. It has flatly denied those allegations. It has also been slow compared to other countries in starting testing. This has led to speculation that the real number of cases is much higher than
reported. Russia's government says up to 100,000 testing kits are being produced daily to
start testing in large numbers.  Swiss residents like Nadine are heading to the bars for a last beer Our reporter Imogen Foulkes has this from Geneva: People here expected the state of emergency - with cases of the
virus rising fast, many thought the government should have declared it on
Friday, when it announced that schools would close. But now that it has happened, Switzerland, one of the
richest countries in the world, is facing at least a month with everything but
the bare essentials closed. There will be no bars, no cafes, no restaurants, no
sports, no nightclubs, no cinemas, no museums. This evening in Bern people are heading to the bars for a last
beer. Student Nadine is disappointed that her upcoming birthday party wonât
happen, but says complaining feels a bit like a ""first world problem"". Actually
itâs quite fascinating,"" she says, ""we are at a pivotal moment in history"". Historic it
certainly is: to support hospitals the Swiss government today mobilised the
army, the first time that has happened since the start of World War Two. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has closed 12.9% down, in another sign that markets fear a global recession could be on the horizon. It's the biggest percentage daily drop since the outbreak began, and the largest in one day since the Black Monday crash in 1987. Markets dropped around the world today despite a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in the US and co-ordinated action by central banks around the world to shore up confidence. The Dow closed as President Trump said a US recession could be on the horizon and that the virus outbreak could last until August. The other main US indexes - the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq - also plunged 12% in trading on Monday. President Trump has said the US could be heading for a recession due to the coronavirus outbreak. Reporters at the White House press conference are deliberately putting empty seats between them, in a social distancing effort. The US government has faced strong criticism for its slow pace of testing. Mr Trump said that before instituting mass testing, South Korea had experienced ""tremendous problems and great numbers of death"". ""This is something that is an invisible enemy,"" he said, adding that there was now a cross-party effort to fight it. ""My focus is on getting rid of this problem. This virus problem. After that everything else is going to fall into place."" ""We're gonna back the airlines 100 percent. It's not their fault its nobody's fault,"" he continued, but added: ""Unless you go to the regional source."" Read our main story here. Â© 2025 BBC.
