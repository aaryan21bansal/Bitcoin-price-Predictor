"Black Panther is among the films which could be recognised in the new category The Oscars are introducing a new category for outstanding achievement in popular film. It's among three changes which were approved on Tuesday by the Academy's board of governors. It means films which are popular with the public but less so with critics will be more likely to win an Oscar. Superhero films such as Black Panther are among those which could now stand a much better chance of being recognised during awards season. It's understood the change will come into effect in time for the next Oscars ceremony in February. In a message to its members, the Academy said eligibility requirements for the new category and other key details would be ""forthcoming"". In previous years, films which have done well at the box office - including Mamma Mia, Avatar and the Mission Impossible franchise - have been snubbed by the Oscars. An outstanding popular film category may also go some way to allay criticism that many of the films acknowledged by the Oscars are""increasingly irrelevant"",externaland do not reflect what the viewing public want to watch. Which films could win the new Oscar? Lady Bird 'most overrated' Oscars film by critics How The Greatest Showman became a film phenomenon The Academy's board of governors has also set an earlier date for the 2020 Oscars ceremony and will shorten the telecast to three hours in an attempt to make the ceremony ""more accessible for our viewers worldwide"". In order to fit in all 24 award categories, some will be presented during commercial breaks with the winning moments edited and aired later in the broadcast. By Lizo Mzimba, BBC entertainment correspondent This is a move from an awards body not just anxious to be relevant, but anxious to be seen to be relevant. They've made a lot of progress making the approximately 8,000 Oscar voters more diverse, with more women and people from ethnic minorities. But they know that that's not enough and that there needs to be greater uniformity between the kind of films honoured at the Oscars and the kind of films that enjoy huge success at the box office. But the question is, is this the right way to achieve this? While the new category will all but guarantee nominations for films like Black Panther, at the same time it might well make them much less likely to get nominations for best picture. Voters could decide it's less important to recognise them in the most prestigious categories because there's now a separate category, which the Academy can point to as evidence they're not ignoring some of the year's biggest hits.

"All types of exercises were found to improve mental health no matter people's age or gender Regular physical activity lasting 45 minutes three to five times a week can reduce poor mental health - but doing more than that is not always beneficial, a large US study suggests. A total of 1.2 million people reported their activity levels for a month and rated their mental wellbeing. People who exercised had 1.5 fewer ""bad days"" a month than non-exercisers, the study found. Team sports, cycling and aerobics had the greatest positive impact. All types of activity were found to improve mental health no matter people's age or gender, including doing the housework and looking after the children. The study, published inThe Lancet Psychiatry Journal,,externalis the largest of its kind to date but it cannot confirm that physical activity is the cause of improved mental health. Depression, anxiety, OCD - running helped us beat them Caring for a child with mental health issues Poor mental health 'part and parcel of childhood' Mental health: Children failed at vulnerable point Previous research into the effects of exercise on mental health have thrown up mixed results, and some studies suggest that lack of activity could lead to poor mental health as well as being a symptom of it. Exercise is already known to reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Adults taking part in the study said they experienced on average 3.4 days of poor mental health each month. For those who were physically active, this reduced to only two days. Among people who had been diagnosed previously with depression, exercise appeared to have a larger effect, resulting in seven days of poor mental health a month compared with nearly 11 days for those who did no exercise. Being involved in team sport could be good for resilience and reduce isolation How often and for how long people were active was also important. Being active for 30 to 60 minutes every second day came out as the optimal routine. But there could be such a thing as doing too much exercise, the study concluded. Dr Adam Chekroud, study author and assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale University, said: ""Previously, people have believed that the more exercise you do, the better your mental health, but our study suggests that this is not the case. ""Doing exercise more than 23 times a month, or exercising for longer than 90-minute sessions is associated with worse mental health."" He said the positive impact of team sports suggested that social sports activities could reduce isolation and be good for resilience, while also reducing depression. The findings back up government guidelines recommending that people should do 150 minutes of physical activity per week. But the study has some limitations. It is based on self-reporting, which is not always accurate, and there is no way of measuring physical activity. Dr Dean Burnett, neuroscientist and honorary research associate, from the school of psychology at Cardiff University, said the link between exercise and mental health had been difficult to pin down but this large study ""strongly suggests that there is a definite association between the two"". ""However, the nature of the study means it's difficult to say more than that with any real certainty,"" he said. Prof Stephen Lawrie, head of psychiatry at the University of Edinburgh, said it indicated that social and ""mindful"" exercise is particularly good for mental health - but not if it is overdone. ""I suspect we all know people who seem 'addicted' to exercise and if this starts to impact on other aspects of life - like foregoing social activities because one has to be up at the crack of dawn to run several miles - it might actually be bad for people,"" he added.

"This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge paid tribute to ""the fallen of all nations"" The Duke of Cambridge and the prime minister have attended commemorations in northern France to mark the centenary of the Battle of Amiens - the beginning of the end of World War One. Prince William and Theresa May both paid tribute at a service at Amiens Cathedral. They also spoke to descendants of soldiers who fought in the battle. In a reading, the duke said he was ""delighted"" to mark the centenary in the ""historic cathedral"". He added the purpose of the service was to ""honour the fallen of all nations"" involved in the war. In her message printed in the official programme, Mrs May paid tribute to the ""courage, bravery and skill"" of troops who fought at Amiens. She added it was important to ""reflect on the fear and hardship experienced by the people of this city and the surrounding battlefields"". William and Kate remember WW1 battle Princes pay tribute to fallen soldiers Somme fallen honoured 100 years on At Wednesday's service, the story of the battle was told through contemporary letters, diaries and poems read by guests from the 2,000-strong congregation. The British-commanded Fourth Army was involved in the battle, heralding the start of the Hundred Days offensive. General Sir Henry Rawlinson had learnt the lessons of the bloodySomme offensiveand employed improved tactics and new equipment. The prime minister arrives at the cathedral in Amiens, France, ahead of her reading The Royal Anglian Regiment formed a guard of honour outside the cathedral More than 500 UK tanks were deployed, alongside 1,900 British and French aircraft, and more than 2,000 guns from the Royal Artillery. A string of military victories by combined air and land forces from Britain, Australia, Canada, France, and the US followed, leading to the surrender of German forces and the end of the conflict on 11 November 1918. Armed Forces Minister Mark Lancaster and Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter also attended the service. Gen Carter said the Battle of Amiens was a ""remarkable achievement... moulding a new citizen-based force into a very accomplished fighting force, against a backdrop of rapid technological change"". French Foreign Legion officers with their dogs in Amiens Forces from Britain, Australia, Canada, France and the US were involved in the Battle of Amiens Kevin Sherlock, 58, a retired Rolls-Royce engine inspector from Derby, said his 19-year-old great uncle Ernest Harm, who was killed towards the end of the battle, ""paid the ultimate sacrifice"", helping to bring peace to Europe. He said the teenage soldier, also from Derby, was killed, possibly by machine gun fire, going ""over the top"" on 11 August 1918. Mr Sherlock added: ""I think as I've got older I've thought about it more really, he was only 19, just a lad really, never experienced anything in his life. ""So there's sadness but also pride that he took part in a key battle that brought ultimately the Allied victory and no doubt about it, shortened the war as well.""

"Suspects Siraj Wahhaj (L) and Lucas Morton. Mr Wahhaj is also suspected of abducting his three-year-old son A man arrested after 11 malnourished children were found in a remote desert compound was training them to commit school shootings, US media report. According to prosecutors' documents, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj was teaching some of the children, who are aged one to 15, how to use weapons. Mr Wahhaj was one of two armed men arrested at the scene on Friday in New Mexico. Three women were also arrested. Police say the remains of a boy were also discovered at the compound. Found on Monday, the remains are probably those of Mr Wahhaj's missing three-year-old son, Abdula-Ghani Wahhaj, theTaos News reports,external. Mr Wahhaj is suspected of abducting the boy from his Georgia home in December, and it was the search for him that led to the arrests. The toddler suffered from seizures according to the missing person's report filed by his mother. But Mr Wahhaj believed the boy needed to be exorcised, say court papers. The compound had no running water and children were living in squalid conditions. Prosecutor Timothy Hasson filed the documents on Wednesday, but did not discuss the accusations in court, the Associated Press reported. Mr Hasson requested that Mr Wahhaj be held without bail. ""He poses a great danger to the children found on the property as well as a threat to the community as a whole due to the presence of firearms and his intent to use these firearms in a violent and illegal manner,"" Mr Hasson wrote in court documents. CNN reports the legal filings also warn that if ""released from custody, there is a substantial likelihood defendants may commit new crimes due to their planning and preparation for future school shootings"". The complaint cites a foster parent of one of the 11 children as saying Mr Wahhaj ""had trained the child in the use of an assault rifle in preparation for future school shootings"", US media say. All five adults arrested at the compound last week face child abuse charges. Lucas Morton was the other man arrested at the scene. From left to right: Jany Leveille, Hujhrah Wahhaj, Subhannah Wahhaj Three women, believed to be the children's mothers, were also ""arrested without incident"" and booked into the Taos Adult Detention Center,according to the sheriff's office,external. Police have not explained what connection the women - named as Jany Leveille and Subhannah Wahhaj, both 35, and 38-year-old Hujrah Wahhaj - have to each other. The officers who discovered the children said they looked ""like Third World country refugees not only with no food or fresh water, but with no shoes, personal hygiene and basically dirty rags for clothing"". Authorities had raided the site after receiving a message from someone that read: ""We are starving and need food and water."" Police said they had been aware of the compound for some time but had to wait for a search warrant before entering, as the occupants were ""most likely heavily armed and considered extremist of the Muslim belief"". Mr Wahhaj was armed with an AR-15 rifle and four pistols when they encountered him, they said. According to New York media, Mr Wahhaj's father, Imam Siriaj Wahhaj, is a prominent Muslim leader in Brooklyn, who has been called""one of the most admired Muslim leaders"",externalin the US. He reportedly testified as a character witness at the trial for Omar Abdel-Rahman, who was later convicted of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. In 1991, he became the first Muslim to lead an opening prayer before the US House of Representatives.

"Farah Hashi was visiting friends in Dubai when he was repeatedly caught speeding The family of a Welsh tourist who was fined Â£36,000 ($46,000) for speeding in a Lamborghini say he is being forced to stay in Dubai. Farah Hashi, 25, from Newport, cannot afford the fines, his brother said. The dealership where Mr Hashi rented the Lamborghini HuracÃ¡n told the city's newspaper, The National,he left his passport as a guarantee,external. But his brother Adman, 50, claims his passport was seized after he had driven the Â£155,000 supercar.

The total cost of the fines came to 175,000 dirhams (Â£36,000; $47,600). The fines were issued after he triggered every speed camera on the Sheikh Zayed Road and reached a top speed of 150mph (240 km/h). A top-end Lamborghini HuracÃ¡n costs just under Â£200,000 Adman Hashi, said: ""They came to his hotel and demanded he hand it over after the speeding ticket came through and out of fear he gave it to them.

"Loose-fitting boxer shorts, like those worn by Gary Lineker on Match of the Day after Leicester City won the Premier League, are linked to improved sperm counts Wearing looser underpants could be a simple way for men to improve their sperm count and the hormones that control it, a US study suggests. In a study of 656 men, by researchers at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, in the US, boxer short wearers had a 25% higher sperm concentration than men in tight-fitting underwear. Cooler temperatures around the testicles could be the reason. Experts say this simple lifestyle change could improve men's fertility. Sperm production is known to be sensitive to temperatures above 34C (92F), which is why the testicles hang down away from the body. Some styles of underpants, such as jockey shorts or briefs, bring the scrotum nearer to the body, causing the testicles to warm up, while others, such as boxer shorts, are looser and cooler. In the largest study of its kind to date, the researchers found men attending a fertility clinic with looser-fitting boxer shorts had higher sperm concentration, a 17% higher total sperm count and 33% more swimming sperm than men with tighter-fitting underwear. However, the sperm shape wasn't affected and neither was the DNA quality. Researchers, who took into account other factors that can affect sperm, including age, body mass index (BMI) and habits such as smoking and hot tub use, speculate that the higher heat inside pants is the root of the problem. Thestudy, published in the journal Human Reproduction,,externalalso found that a hormone from the brain that tells the testicle to make sperm, called follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), was 14% lower in wearers of looser underwear. The findings suggest that this hormone kicks into gear when it needs to compensate for increasing scrotal temperatures and decreasing sperm counts in tight underwear. Prof Allan Pacey, professor of andrology, from the University of Sheffield, who was not involved in the study, said the different levels of FSH among men with different types of underwear ""suggests that the tight-pant wearers have evidence of testicular damage"". The study is about sperm quantity and quality, however, and not fertility itself. Regardless of the types of underpants worn, sperm counts were in the normal range. But Prof Pacey told the BBC: ""Potentially switching from tight to loose might help some men who are on the lower edge of sperm production. ""It shows that tight pants have an effect and shows there is a relatively cheap and easy thing that men can attempt to do to try and improve their situation."" The paper's author, Dr Jorge Chaverro, told the BBC: ""It takes about three months for an entire population of sperm to change, so plan in advance. ""Infertility is most certainly not just a female problem. Reproduction is a team sport. You need both people to make a baby. ""I think we still have a lot to learn about men's contribution to fertility.""â Follow Lucy onTwitter,external Hollywood Hills in flames amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"The Hollywood couple had been together since 2005 but only married in 2014 US actor Brad Pitt has rebutted claims made by his estranged wife Angelina Jolie that he has failed to support their children. In a court filing on Wednesday, the star's legal team said he had paid more than $1.3m (Â£1m) in costs and loaned $8m to Jolie to help her buy a house. On Tuesday, Jolie's lawyer said Pitt had paid ""no meaningful child support"" since she filed for divorce in 2016. The couple had been together since 2005 but only married in 2014. In the documents, Pitt's lawyers also said Jolie's claims regarding child support were a ""thinly-veiled effort to manipulate media coverage"". Angelina Jolie 'not enjoying being single' Brad Pitt reveals therapy after divorce How Brad Pitt fixed his image problem Her lawyer said in the filing on Tuesday: ""[Pitt] has a statutory duty to pay child support. As of present, [he] has paid no meaningful child support since separation. ""Given that the informal arrangements around the payment of the children's expenses have not been regularly sustained... for over a year and a half, [Jolie] intends to file... for the establishment of a retroactive child support order,"" the documents stated. Responding to Pitt's rebuttal, Jolie's lawyer Samantha Bley DeJean said she hoped the dispute could be resolved ""without further delay or posturing"". ""A loan is not... child support and to represent it as such is misleading and inaccurate,"" she said. ""Angelina is asking Brad to pay 50% of the children's expenses. He has not. ""Angelina has had to shoulder the majority of those without his contribution for the past two years. Child support is not optional in California."" Jolie cited ""irreconcilable differences"" when she filed to end the marriage, and the pair became embroiled in a bitter child custody battle in the months following the announcement. Pitt was investigated for possible child abuseafter losing his temper in front of some of the children, but was later cleared of the allegations. The couple were known as ""Brangelina"" by fans and met on the set of the 2005 film Mr and Mrs Smith. The marriage was Pitt's second, having previously wed Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie's third after actors Billy Bob Thornton and Jonny Lee Miller.

"Homebase has about 250 stores and 11,500 staff in the UK and was sold for Â£1 in May The new owners of Homebase will reveal plans to close up to 60 stores next week, putting about 1,500 jobs at risk. Restructuring company Hilco, which bought the DIY chain for Â£1 in May, will outline plans for a rescue deal next week, according to reports. Hilco bought the struggling chain from Australian firm Wesfarmers after its disastrous foray into the UK market. Homebase has about 250 stores and 11,500 employees. The closure plan wasfirst revealed by Sky News,external, which said that Hilco is to propose an insolvency mechanism known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) early next week. The BBC understands that about 60 outlets have been identified for closure, which have on average about 25 staff per store. A number of retailers have used CVAs as a step short of going into administration, including House of Fraser, Mothercare, New Look and Carpetright. Wesfarmers bought Homebase in 2016 and set about redeveloping Homebase stores under its Bunnings brand. But the Australian firm admitted making a number of ""self-induced"" blunders, including underestimating winter demand for items such as heaters, as well as dropping popular kitchen and bathroom ranges. At the end of June, Travis Perkins reported that its Wickes chain had been hit by a ""challenging UK DIY market"" and that it would be ""executing a significant cost reduction programme"". Many retailers in the UK are struggling with growing online competition, weak consumer spending, rising labour costs, and higher business property taxes. Many High Street favourites are struggling.

"A neighbour had just walked past when an explosion tore through a small, white house in the Spanish coastal town of Alcanar last August. Debris was flung hundreds of metres by the force of the blast and the bodies of two men landed in nearby gardens. A third man who had been on a roof terrace talking on his phone survived. The next day a van attack was launched on pedestrians in Barcelona's central tourist avenue, Las Ramblas. Hours later there was another attack, in Cambrils, a coastal town. Sixteen people died and more than 130 were injured. Catalonia had come under attack from a jihadist gang of 11 people. Youssef Aalla and Younes Abouyaaqoub preparing an explosive belt at a house in Alcanar Investigators believe they had planned to target Barcelona's Sagrada Familia and the Camp Nou stadium, home to Barcelona football club. The Eiffel Tower in Paris was another target. The Alcanar blast late on 16 August had changed all that and the key figure, Abdelbaki Es Satty, lay dead in the rubble. Barcelona attacks: What we know Aftermath of attacks - in pictures Who are the Barcelona suspects? But this is also a story of missed clues and intelligence failings, because Es Satty had been known to the authorities for years. And the BBC has learned that his gang of extremists was plugged into a network that, according to a surviving cell member, could have included another imam with a second cell of eight or nine young men in France. A year on, investigators in France have requested information from 10 countries and are still trying to break up that network and identify a possible French cell. Catalonia's head of counter-terrorism believes the plot could have been masterminded by someone outside Spain. As neighbours emerged from the destroyed buildings in Alcanar, no-one considered an extremist link. The bodies of Es Satty, 44, and 22-year-old Youssef Aallaa were identified. The house in Alcanar was all but destroyed by the explosion ""The strongest hypothesis was that it was a drugs lab,"" said firefighter Jordi Bort, who was among the first on the scene. It was not until emergency services had dug through the rubble the next day that the full picture emerged. There was a second blast, almost as large as the first. Nine firefighters were injured. They had stumbled on a bomb factory containing more than 200kg (440lb) of explosives. Much of it was extremely unstable, designed to cause multiple deaths. Younes Abouyaaqoub and Youssef Aalla posing as they prepare hand grenades at a house in Alcanar There were canisters, nails, large quantities of acetone, hydrogen peroxide, bicarbonate and detonator switches - all the ingredients to create TATP (triacetone triperoxide) explosive. They also found grenades and suicide vests. Investigators only discovered later, from material recovered from digital cameras, computers and mobile phones, that the men had planned to use these explosives at some of Europe's biggest landmarks. It was on the afternoon of 17 August that 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub jumped into a rented white van and zig-zagged down Las Ramblas at high speed, careering into pedestrians along the packed avenue. Witnesses said the driver had tried to hit as many people as possible. Many were knocked to the ground while others fled for cover in nearby shops and cafes. Abouyaaqoub killed 13 people and injured more than 130 before fleeing on foot. He then hijacked a white Ford Focus, killing the driver. A German woman injured on Las Ramblas later died, taking the death toll to 15. Eight hours later, in the early hours of 18 August, five men drove to Cambrils, 100km (62 miles) down the coast from Barcelona. They were the Barcelona attacker's brother, Houssaine Abouyaaqoub, along with Moussa Oukabir, Said Aallaa and brothers Mohamed and Omar Hychami. Their black Audi A3 car ploughed into pedestrians at the seaside resort and overturned before the gang got out wielding knives and an axe.  A Spanish woman was killed and several others wounded. Who were the victims? Written on the trees of the Ramblas The attackers were wearing fake suicide vests adorned with plastic bottles to create panic. The vests also ensured they would be shot by police and, in their eyes, die as martyrs. Barcelona attacker Younes Abouyaaqoub was still on the run. His journey finally came to an end on 21 August in a field west of Barcelona. Police were tipped off by the public and Abouyaaqoub, wearing a fake explosives belt, was shot dead. The young men behind the attacks had claimed 16 lives. Who was behind these murders? Ninety minutes' drive inland from Barcelona, on the edge of the Pyrenees, lies the picturesque town of Ripoll. Surrounded by pine trees and mountain rivers, this is where most of the Catalan terror cell grew up. They were all first- or second-generation immigrants from Morocco and most were childhood friends who went to the same school. They included four sets of brothers. By all accounts they were normal kids who played in the local football teams, went to after-school clubs and took part in hiking trips. Cambrils attacker Houssaine Abouyaaqoub was known as Houssa and was part of the local football team. When they were boys they played football together Social worker Nuria Perpinya helped some of them at a school homework club. ""They would go there after school to use the computers because they didn't have a computer or any internet connection at home,"" she said. ""They were like all the kids,"" wrote Raquel Rull, the mother of one of Houssa's friends, in an emotional letter published after the attacks. ""Like the one you see playing in the square, or the one who carries a big school bag filled with books, or the one who says 'Hi' and lets you go first in the supermarket queue, or the one who gets nervous when a girl smiles at him."" The youngest member of the cell, Houssaine Abouyaaqoub, was known to friends as Houssa Apart from the older Es Satty, only Driss Oukabir, the eldest of the boys, was known to the authorities. He had a criminal record for robbery, sexual assault and domestic violence, but even then his conduct had attracted little attention. Driss Oukabir ""enjoyed life"" with his girlfriend and his dog On leaving school, most of them had gone to work in local factories, cafes and restaurants. Then Abdelbaki Es Satty arrived and started working at one of the town's two mosques, saying he was an imam. Born in Morocco's Rif mountain region, he had come to Spain in the early 2000s and had been in and out of prison until he was brought to Ripoll by a Moroccan woodcutter during the spring of 2015. Abdelbaki Es Satty arrived in Ripoll in 2015 For Ibrahim Aallaa, whose sons Said and Youssef were killed at Alcanar and Cambrils, Es Satty was a ""bad influence"" and he did not like him. He had twice visited the house uninvited when he thought Ibrahim was not at home. Said had been working in a local cafe and Es Satty said he should stop as it served alcohol and pork. Youssef had been told to stop working during Ramadan. Es Satty's flat overlooked Ripoll ""Es Satty's belief was too strict,"" Ibrahim said. ""It was an interpretation of Islam that I didn't like. I told my boys too. I didn't want them to go to the mosque and I didn't talk to Es Satty."" By January 2016, Es Satty had left Ripoll in search of new opportunities. He went to Belgium to preach at a mosque in Diegem, outside Brussels. He had told leading members of the community he was an informant for the Spanish intelligence services. Hans Bonte, mayor of Vilvoorde in Belgium, has spoken of intelligence failings related to the case ""They didn't trust him, they asked him for some papers to convince them that he actually was an imam,"" said Hans Bonte, mayor of Vilvoorde. ""But he didn't have a record, so he couldn't give them."" The head of the mosque went to the police and Es Satty's details were put on a national database by a local police officer. The case was due to be discussed by local and national security services, but the officer heard nothing back. The Belgian officer also approached a Catalan counterpart he knew but nothing came of that either. Despite local authorities twice flagging up their concerns, Es Satty returned to Ripoll in April 2016, soon after the Brussels bombings. ""There was a lack of information exchange between Catalan police and the federal Spanish police and that gave a lot of tension between Catalan and Spanish authorities,"" Mayor Bonte said. Es Satty was to return to Brussels several times. Back in Ripoll, Es Satty began work at the town's second mosque. A year before the events in Barcelona, friends of the Ripoll cell members began to notice a change in their behaviour. They stopped wearing branded clothing and visited the mosque more frequently. ""They closed themselves up a little,"" said one. This video can not be played ""They were missing something - a spiritual void, a religious void"" They also made regular trips to the bomb factory in Alcanar. One of the most frequent visitors was Younes Abouyaaqoub, the Barcelona attacker. The house was registered in his name and in Youssef Aalla's. In documents seen by the BBC, the cell searched online for chemistry manuals, various IS leading figures, bomb-making manuals and possible targets to attack. In order to fund the purchase of explosives and their travelling, they stole money from their places of work, and sold gold and jewellery in small towns on the coast. By now, older members of the Ripoll gang were travelling abroad and material found on computers and phones has revealed how the cell was linked to people known to authorities across Europe. There were various trips to Morocco to visit friends and family, especially ahead of the attacks, and one visit to Austria. Es Satty repeatedly travelled to Belgium too, and was last seen there two months before the Catalonia attacks. But there were two other trips that investigators found particularly interesting. In December 2016 Youssef Aallaa and Mohamed Hychami flew to Basel in Switzerland and stayed at the Olympia Hotel in Zurich. Their aim was likely to discuss logistics or financing with figures connected to a controversial An'Nur mosque. The mosque in Winterthur, which has since shut, denies such claims. One week later, those two men joined Younes Abouyaaqoub - who would eventually become the Ramblas attacker - in Brussels. Omar Hychami beside the Eiffel Tower in Paris And days before the Ramblas attack, the man who carried it out, Younes Abouyaaqoub, went to Paris with Omar Hychami. They took the Audi which Hychami was in when it rammed pedestrians in Cambrils. On 11 and 12 August the men's phones were tracked to central Paris as well as the city's Malakoff and Saint-Denis areas. They called contacts who were using pay-as-you-go Sim cards. Investigators believe the Paris trip was part of a mission to find targets for a second cell of jihadists. That target was to be the Eiffel Tower. The question is whether Es Satty and the Ripoll cell were part of something much larger and linked to wider extremist networks and plots in Europe. ""We think there is some brain outside Spain,"" says Manel Castellvi, head of counter-terrorism in Catalonia, ""maybe in Europe, or maybe in a conflict zone, who convinced them to carry out this attack."" This video can not be played Senior police officials believe an outside mastermind was involved. While the TATP explosives they amassed in Alcanar were relatively easy to get hold of, Mr Castellvi believes the quantity they had, as well as their ability to make the explosives, suggests ""someone with important knowledge could have given information to the cell"". The BBC has also learned that Es Satty had booked a flight from Barcelona to Brussels for October 2017 - suggesting Es Satty was not planning to kill himself like the others. Es Satty had been known to intelligence agencies for years, but decisive action was never taken. When the alarm was raised in Brussels in 2016, there was a failure to communicate between Belgium and Spain, and within Spain itself. But the failings go back much further than that. Es Satty was on their radar for links to jihadists as early as 2005. He was living in Vilanova i la Geltru, a coastal town near Barcelona, and spent time with an Algerian man called Belgacem Belil. The pair were connected to a network known as the Vilanova cell. Abdelbaki Es Satty's phone was tapped twice by Spanish authorities Belil became a suicide bomber in Iraq, killing 28 people in November 2003. Members of the cell were investigated for sending people to Syria and Iraq and were connected to people involved in the 2004 Madrid bombings. However, initial convictions handed down to them were quashed. Then, in 2005, Spanish authorities sought approval to tap Es Satty's phone. They believed he could be acting as an intermediary with individuals connected to militant group Ansar al Islam. Not finding enough evidence, the phone tap was lifted but, at some point, his name was added to a European database of people who support terrorism. In 2010 he was jailed in Castellon, south of Barcelona, for transporting cannabis between Morocco and Spain. While in prison, he was approached by Spain's National Intelligence Centre (CNI), most probably as a possible informant, but he was deemed unreliable. However, he was considered interesting enough for his phone to be tapped when he left prison, the BBC has learned. The CNI wanted to know if he was still in touch with extremists, but again the wire-tap was halted because a judge decided it had failed to yield relevant results. The warning signs were there and opportunities were missed. Abdelbaki Es Satty took several years to move from the fringes of extremist Islam to become the ringleader of a murderous cell in rural northern Spain. Lessons have to be learned about exchanging information, says Manuel Navarrete, Europol's head of counter-terrorism.

"The pound has fallen below $1.29 for the first time in almost a year on continuing worries Britain will leave the EU without a trade deal. Sterling also hit a nine-month low against the euro, and was down against the yen and Swiss franc. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said on Friday the chances of a no-deal Brexit were ""uncomfortably high"". On Sunday, international trade secretary Liam Fox put the odds at ""certainly not much more than 60-40"". The falls come despite a rise in UK interest rates, which usually pushes up the value of sterling. Since the beginning of the month, the pound has fallen 1.7% against the dollar and 0.8% against the euro. ""Some are thinking in the market that the Bank of England raised rates in order to give them ammunition to cut them in the face of a no-deal,"" said Neil Jones, a foreign exchange expert at Mizuho Bank. ""The next move  by the central bank could be a cut rather than another hike."" Nomura strategist Jordan Rochester added: ""We remain bearish on the pound in the short term until the Brexit mess is out the way... "" A cheaper pound makes imports - and anything bought by foreign exchange, such as holidays - more expensive. It also makes the UK a less attractive place to work for foreign nationals. But it makes UK exports more competitive. In the first three months of the year, the UK exported a record Â£87bn in goods to the rest of the world, following a year in which they hit an all-time annual high ofÂ£338.9bn,external Investors are focusing on a critical meeting in October between Prime Minister Theresa May and EU leaders to try to thrash out the terms of Britain's withdrawal. Without a deal, some economists believe the UK and its trading partners would suffer an economic downturn. The IMF has said economic growth across the 27 remaining EU states would fall by as much as 1.5% by 2030, and wipe out almost 4% of the UK's GDP. However, others claim the dangers of a no-deal have been overstated. Sir Bernard Jenkin MP said: ""The civil service and the government are feeding industry - and the industry is feeding the government - with this diet of gloom and alarm and despondency."" The head of foreign exchange strategy at CIBC, Jeremy Stretch, said: ""If there's no improvement in the negotiating strategy with the EU, we could see the pound going back to levels not seen since last autumn, around $1.28 - and if it falls through that, it could go lower still. ""And unless the economic data in the UK starts to validate the rise in interest rates, it's hard to see the pound regaining any strength."" The pound's fall has also been exacerbated by the dollar's recent strength on the back of strong economic numbers and good company profits in the first two quarters of the year. However, Mr Stretch added that CIBC had researched the pound's performance on a monthly basis over the last 15 years and had found that it typically underperformed during the August holiday period.

Billy Valentine, 19, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent at aprevious hearingand was sentenced to seven and a half years at a young offenders' institution. Four other men were also jailed at Swansea Crown Court on Wednesday. As they were sentenced by Judge Keith Thomas, who said the five must share responsibility for the ""devastating consequences"" of their activities, the defendants laughed, waved at family members and fist bumped one another. The attack happened after Mr Owens was walking with two friends and ""exchanged banter"" with the men, the court heard. Mr Owens, who became separated from his friends told Valentine, from Aberystwyth, and two others that he ""didn't want to fight"".

He was hit with a traffic cone then punched by Valentine ""with a sufficiently heavy blow"" before falling to the ground where he ""probably hit his head on the kerb"". Mr Owens, a second-year criminology student at Aberystwyth University, was initially taken to Bronglais Hospital, in the town, but was later transferred to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. His injuries included fractured skull. Mr Owens woke from his coma on 11 February, four weeks after the attack. David Robert Lloyd, 25, of no fixed address, was jailed for three years and eight months; Lee Andersen, 20, of Newcastle Emlyn, received a 25-month jail term; and both Andrew Raymond John Scott, 23, of Llangwyryfon, and Michael Jones, 24, of Llanfair Clydogau, received 30-month sentences. They had previously denied causing grievous bodily harm but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of violent disorder during a hearing on 1 August. L-R Gareth Owens, Ifan Richard Owens and Tomi Owens at the Euro 2016 in Bordeaux A victim impact statement was read by the prosecution on behalf of Mr Owens's father, Gareth Owens, in which he said his family ""really feared the worst"" after the attack. As a result of his injuries, his son suffered from fatigue, memory loss, hearing problems, and has issues with his speech, the court heard. He is also unsure whether he will return to his university studies, according to his father's statement. Valentine's defence lawyer said he ""went off the rails"" following a personal tragedy, while the defence for the other men stressed the attack had not been premeditated. They were identified by Mr Owens's friends following the incident as they were driven around the town by police officers. Speaking after the hearing, Det Insp Anthony Evans said: ""The incident shook the community of Aberystwyth, and I would like to thank members of that community for their continued support and understanding during what has been a lengthy and complex investigation.""

"The risk of footballers dying because their heart stops beating is higher than experts thought, a study suggests. There have been high-profile deaths, including that of Marc-Vivien Foewhile playing for Cameroonaged 28. Former England defender Ugo Ehiogu, who was a Spurs coach,died last yearaged 44. The study,in the New England Journal of Medicine,external, comes from two decades of data on 11,168 youth players in the UK. Doctors said there was a duty to protect players. Diseases that affect the heart muscle - cardiomyopathies - are silent killers. The first symptom can be the heart suddenly stopping. This is why clubs have a screening programme for academy players at age 16. The dangers are higher in elite athletes because taxing the heart can trigger their underlying disease. Adrenaline, changes in electrolytes and dehydration all increase the risk of triggering a cardiac arrest. But nobody was certain how common deaths from a cardiac arrest were. Estimates had put the figure at less than two in every 100,000 players but this analysis says the figure is higher - seven in every 100,000 players. Cardiologist Prof Sanjay Sharma, who led the research at St George's, University of London, told BBC News: ""It means we need to open our eyes to the fact death rates are higher than we thought, although they are still rare."" In 20 years of screening, 42 academy prospects were found to be at risk. Treatments - including corrective surgery and heart drugs - meant 30 could resume their careers. The rest were advised to stop playing competitive sport. But the screening was not perfect. It missed Bolton player Fabrice Muamba, who survived after his heart stopped and hecollapsed during an FA Cup match. Doctors said Fabrice Muamba ""died for 78 minutes"" after his heart stopped. And of the eight players who died during the study, only six had been diagnosed with a heart problem as a result of screening. Prof Sharma said England's Football Association had already introduced additional screening at ages 18, 20 and 25. He said identifying an untreatable heart problem could be hard for young players and decisions had to be made between the player, their parents and their club. He said: ""It's very difficult for a young kid who's dreamt of this and has done nothing but play football since the age of eight or nine. ""We have to be extremely honest and say there is a risk of sudden death and the death rate is low but we can't predict it. ""If we're asking young people to push themselves beyond their limit to entertain us and be role models for our youth, we have some duty to be protective."" This video can not be played How to use a defibrillator and save a life Dr Zaf Iqbal, a doctor with Crystal Palace Football Club, told the BBC: ""In every Premier League game, there always has to be a doctor on each bench, two paramedics and mandatory equipment. ""Compared with 10 years ago, I think players are better protected."" As well as the screening programme, he said, the club had defibrillators - which deliver an electric shot to the heart - on the training ground and coaching staff had been trained to use them. ""The thing that will save these guys is a defibrillator,"" he said. The FA said it had one of the most comprehensive heart-screening programmes in sport and offered emergency training to medical teams at professional clubs. A spokesman said: ""There are multiple health benefits from playing football. However, we are aware that a very small number of people may have an increased risk of heart abnormalities through hard training, which is why we have this programme in place.""

"Black Panther is among the films which could be recognised in the new category The Oscars are introducing a new category for outstanding achievement in popular film. It's among three changes which were approved on Tuesday by the Academy's board of governors. It means films which are popular with the public but less so with critics will be more likely to win an Oscar. Superhero films such as Black Panther are among those which could now stand a much better chance of being recognised during awards season. It's understood the change will come into effect in time for the next Oscars ceremony in February. In a message to its members, the Academy said eligibility requirements for the new category and other key details would be ""forthcoming"". In previous years, films which have done well at the box office - including Mamma Mia, Avatar and the Mission Impossible franchise - have been snubbed by the Oscars. An outstanding popular film category may also go some way to allay criticism that many of the films acknowledged by the Oscars are""increasingly irrelevant"",externaland do not reflect what the viewing public want to watch. Which films could win the new Oscar? Lady Bird 'most overrated' Oscars film by critics How The Greatest Showman became a film phenomenon The Academy's board of governors has also set an earlier date for the 2020 Oscars ceremony and will shorten the telecast to three hours in an attempt to make the ceremony ""more accessible for our viewers worldwide"". In order to fit in all 24 award categories, some will be presented during commercial breaks with the winning moments edited and aired later in the broadcast. By Lizo Mzimba, BBC entertainment correspondent This is a move from an awards body not just anxious to be relevant, but anxious to be seen to be relevant. They've made a lot of progress making the approximately 8,000 Oscar voters more diverse, with more women and people from ethnic minorities. But they know that that's not enough and that there needs to be greater uniformity between the kind of films honoured at the Oscars and the kind of films that enjoy huge success at the box office. But the question is, is this the right way to achieve this? While the new category will all but guarantee nominations for films like Black Panther, at the same time it might well make them much less likely to get nominations for best picture. Voters could decide it's less important to recognise them in the most prestigious categories because there's now a separate category, which the Academy can point to as evidence they're not ignoring some of the year's biggest hits.

"This video can not be played Ben Stokes trial: CCTV footage of fight England cricketer Ben Stokes was the ""main aggressor"" in a fight outside a nightclub, a court has heard. The Durham all-rounder is one of three men accused of fighting in Bristol on 25 September. Bristol Crown Court previously heard Ryan Ali, 28, and Ryan Hale, 27, were knocked unconscious by 27-year-old Mr Stokes, who denies affray. Mr Ali and Mr Hale have also pleaded not guilty to affray and are on trial alongside the cricketer. Witness Mark Spure, an off-duty police community support officer (PCSO), said that after he left Mbargo nightclub he spotted ""three to five"" people involved in a ""scuffle"" on a nearby street. In a statement, Mr Spure said he had tried to separate Mr Stokes and Mr Ali, with the others continuing to row behind him. ""The individual seemed to be the main aggressor or was progressing forward trying to get to another individual,"" he told the court. ""In my statement I describe him as a gentleman with ginger or light brown hair. He had a green T-shirt on."" Police released these photographs of Mr Stokes and Mr Ali after they were shown to the jury Mr Ali ""seemed to be trying to back away or get away from the situation"" before he was punched by Mr Stokes, he added. Mr Spure told the court he had tried to move Mr Ali out of the road, as there were passing cars, but he was ""completely unable to move"". The jury heard he then identified Mr Stokes to police officers, who arrested the cricketer. Mr Stokes first hit Mr Hale, knocking him to the ground, before rendering Mr Ali unconscious in the punch seen by the PCSO, jurors have been told. Mr Ali is alleged to have threatened Mr Stokes' England teammate Alex Hales with a bottle during the altercation, while it is claimed Mr Hale broke off a metal pole from a nearby road sign after being allegedly knocked out by Mr Stokes. The jury heard Mr Ali had suffered a fractured left eye socket, a cracked tooth and cuts and bruises, while Mr Hale suffered bruising and a cut to his forehead. Footage from a body camera worn by PC Stacey Alway, who arrested Mr Stokes, was shown to the jury. She told the court the cricketer had been ""squaring up"" to a group of men at the side of the road as she approached them. ""I didn't know who these males were because I was unable to identify them,"" PC Alway said. ""From the moment I approached [Mr Stokes] he calmed down and he was completely compliant with me."" The court heard that when PC Alway said to Mr Stokes ""a guy over there was covered in blood and I've been told you punched him"", he replied ""because he was abusing my two friends for being gay"". Mr Hale suffered bruising and a cut to his forehead, the court was told Nottinghamshire batsman Mr Hales told PC Alway he had not seen the alleged fight, the court was told. ""I came after you guys turned up,"" he told her. After Mr Stokes had been put in a police car and PC Alway told Mr Hales to leave, he replied: ""I feel bad. He's my best friend. I saw him after everything happened."" In a statement Mr Stokes gave to police after he had been arrested, he said he had acted in self-defence when he punched Mr Ali and Mr Hale, after seeing them verbally abuse two gay men, Kai Barry and William O'Connor. ""These men were speaking to the gay guys in what I would call a harsh and abusive way,"" the statement said. ""It was homophobic in nature. It wasn't at all like banter. Ben Stokes denies affray and is on trial at Bristol Crown Court ""I took exception and said 'leave it out'."" Mr Stokes told police Mr Ali approached him while holding a bottle and he believed he was going to be assaulted. He said the pair ""scuffled"" before Mr Hale grabbed and pulled him. ""I felt the need to defend myself. I felt I was going to be attacked. ""I didn't feel I had an option to leave in the heat of the situation."" Mr Ali (left) and Mr Hale have both pleaded not guilty to affray In a second statement given to police, Mr Stokes said he did not mimic Mr Barry and Mr O'Connor and had not flicked a cigarette butt at them. He told detectives he witnessed Mr Ali and Mr Hale verbally abusing the two gay men. When Mr Ali was interviewed by police, he denied saying anything homophobic to Mr O'Connor or Mr Barry. ""No, I wouldn't do that, no,"" he said. Mr Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham; Mr Ali, of Bristol; and Mr Hale, of Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, all deny a joint charge of affray. The trial continues.

"Yulia Skripal and her father, Sergei, were poisoned in March It is becoming clear, without any official policing sources confirming it, that significant progress has been made in the Salisbury spy poisoning investigation. Detectives from the South East Counter-Terrorism Unit appear to have got to the stage where they have isolated two people from CCTV images as their prime suspects in the suspected nerve agent poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March. The attack led, three months later,to the subsequent death of Dawn Sturgess, and the accidental contamination of her partner Charlie Rowley. At this stage no-one has confirmed officially that the two suspects have been fully identified by their real names, but a discussion has begun between counter-terrorism officers, the Crown Prosecution Service, the Foreign Office, the Home Office and the intelligence agencies as to what is the best way forward. The key question in those discussions is whether the UK should make a formal request to Russia for the two people suspected of carrying out the Novichok attack to be sent to the UK for trial. We know from thecase of Alexander Litvinenko, killed in London in 2006,that such a request would be unsuccessful, because Russia would simply refuse. In the Litvinenko case Russia said it could not, under its constitution, send Russian citizens for trial in the UK. The two Litvinenko suspects - Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun - are still both living as free men in Russia, although neither can leave the country, as they know they risk being arrested on behalf of the UK. Andrei Lugovoi has made a successful career as a member of the Duma, the Russian parliament. He has made a virtue of enjoying visiting all the wildest parts of his huge country instead of travelling overseas. On one of the times I met him he was fishing and horse-riding in Kamchatka, a remote volcanic peninsula in the far east of Russia. Daniel Sandford (l) met Andrei Lugovoi (r) on a fishing trip in eastern Russia in 2011 So, making an extradition request will produce a firm ""nyet"" from Moscow, but would at least allow the UK to show that it has identified two suspects. It would not help relations between the UK and Russia although these are at an all-time low anyway since the break-up of the Soviet Union. However, not making a request would leave Russia guessing and mean that the two suspects would not know if they had been fully identified and would leave them permanently worried about leaving Russia. This may seem like quite an attractive option, but would allow Russia to continue to say that the initial British government accusations were baseless, and not supported by any evidence. A third option is to do what ultimately happened in the Litvinenko case, and hold a public inquiry in which as much as possible of the evidence is laid out for everyone to see. Of course, this third option does not rule out making an extradition request initially, and then proceeding to a public inquiry when the request is refused. Whitehall officials continue to say that this is a police investigation, but ultimately some political decisions will have to be made about how to proceed.

"A single flower has been left near the scene in Staithes A nine-year-old girl died from serious head injuries when rocks fell from a cliff at a beach in North Yorkshire. Eyewitnesses said the girl had been on holiday with her family when the accident happened in the Seaton Garth area of Staithes on Wednesday. Police said the child died at the scene and her family was being supported by specialist officers. Onlookers described the fall, which they said was near warning signs about the cliff, as ""particularly serious"". Staithes Coastguard confirmed a section of the cliff had fallen Staithes Coastguard confirmed a section of the cliff had fallen. Yorkshire breaking news: Birthday plea to missing teenager; Police to tackle 'zombie' drug users Part of the beach at the popular tourist resort was cordoned off on Wednesday night. It has since reopened. The area where the accident happened is understood to be on the eastern side of a harbour wall. A woman said residents knew not to go too close to the cliffs as minor collapses were common Eyewitnesses said the beach had been particularly busy at the time - at about 16:15 BST - and described seeing a ""number of emergency vehicles"", including fire engines, heading for the beach. One woman, who did not wish to be named, said the beach was ""teeming with people"". ""I was on there with my grandchildren and we left just before this happened,"" she said. ""It is absolutely terrible what's happened. ""Fortunately, we had walked the other way."" Signs are in the village warning of the danger of falling rocks The woman said minor collapses were common and residents believed the recent weather had made the cliffs more unstable, especially with a long dry spell followed by heavy rain. Engineering geologist Dr Helen Reeves said the recent dry weather was ""likely to be a contributing factor"" to the fall. ""Recent weeks have seen an increased number of cliff falls reported around our coastline in the UK. ""Current research has linked rock falls to temperature fluctuations, but the research to fully understand this process is still ongoing."" The only signs of yesterday's tragedy that remain are the police tape cordoning off the beach and the sombre feeling that has descended on the village. Only a handful of people have made the walk to an unusually quiet Seaton Garth this morning. Most spend a few minutes looking out to sea, then turn away. From speaking to residents it is clear many are still reeling from the devastating news that something so awful could happen so close to home, at a place associated with fun and family. Most people feel unable to put the shock into words at this time. Part of the beach at Staithes has been cordoned off North Yorkshire Police said: ""Sadly, despite the efforts of the emergency services, the girl died at the scene from her injuries."" A statement from the RNLI said: ""The RNLI, and in particular the volunteers of Staithes and Runswick Lifeboat Station, would like to share their deepest condolences with the child's family."" Scarborough Borough Council Leader Derek Bastiman added: ""Our thoughts are with the family of the nine-year-old girl who has lost her life in such tragic circumstances.

"L-R Democrat Sharice Davids, Republican Susan Hutchison and Democrat Rashida Tlaib, who is almost certain to be the first Muslim woman in Congress More women candidates than ever will contest US governorships and House seats in November's mid-term elections. After Tuesday's primaries across four states, there are now 11 female nominees for governor and at least 185 for the House of Representatives. The results were hailed as a continuing success story by activists for women in politics. There was also a key election for a House seat in Ohio, in which President Donald Trump claimed victory. But US media said the race was still too close to call, in a safe Republican seat held by them since 1983. The outcome could indicate whether Democrats have a chance to overturn the Republican majority in the House in November. What election results mean for Trump Kris Kobach: Trump's political apprentice After polling closed in the four states holding primaries on Tuesday - Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington - it became clear women had broken records for gubernatorial and House nominations. Victories for Gretchen Whitmer (Michigan) and Laura Kelly (Kansas) in Democratic primaries mean 11 women will contest governorships in November - one more than the previous 1994 record.

Despite this, US news outlets have not called the contest yet.The New York Times gave Mr Balderson 50.2%,external, a lead of 1,754 votes in the 12th Congressional District race, with all precincts reporting. But thousands of absentee and provisional ballots are still outstanding, which could lead Mr O'Connor to force a recount. He said: ""We're not stopping now.""

And one interesting sidebar: Ron Estes has beaten Ron Estes in a Kansas Republican primary. The victorious incumbent congressman had to fund a campaign to spell out which candidate was which. The beaten candidate was Ron M Estes - his opponent said the M stood for misleading. The beaten man's campaign was described by some analysts as ""not serious"". The winning Ron Estes took about 80% of the vote and will face Democrat James Thompson, a supporter of Bernie Sanders in November.

"The Spanish Eurofighter jet was taking part in a training exercise (file pic) Spain's defence ministry is investigating after one of its fighter jets accidentally fired a missile over Estonia during a training mission. The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon ""in an area of southwest Estonia authorised for this type of exercise"", the ministry said. It added that the air-to-air missile did not cause damage and was designed to self-destruct. But Estonia's military says it is looking for the remains of the missile. ""A Spanish Eurofighter based in Lithuania accidentally fired a missile without causing any harm,"" Spain's defence ministry said in a statement. ""The air-to-air missile has not hit any aircraft. [We] have opened an investigation to clarify the exact cause of the incident."" What is the Nato alliance? Estonia: What you need to know The missile was reportedly carrying up to 10kg (22lb) of explosives and is thought to have landed 24 miles (40km) north of the Estonian city of Tartu. Two Spanish jets and two French jets were taking part in an exercise as part of Nato's Baltic Air Policing mission when the incident happened. On Wednesday, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg offered his full support to Estonian Prime Minister JÃ¼ri Ratas. ""Nato is committed to the defence of all allies and we will continue to safeguard the airspace... in the Baltic region,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.

"Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has been criticised for saying Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"" and for comparing them to ""bank robbers"" - prompting calls for him to apologise andbe expelled from the Conservative Party. But Mr Johnson's comments, which some believe will aggravate Islamophobic tensions in the UK, have also highlighted some confusion about what a burka is - as the veil revealing just the eyes is, in fact, known as a niqab. So what actually are the differences between the various types of Islamic dress for women and what governs their choices? The Koran, Islam's holy book, tells Muslims - men and women - to dress modestly. Male modesty has been interpreted to be covering the area from the navel to the knee. For women it is generally seen as covering everything except their face, hands and feet when in the presence of men they are not related or married to. However, there has been much debate within Islam as to whether this goes far enough. This has led to a distinction between the hijab (literally ""covering up"" in Arabic) and the niqab (meaning ""full veil""). Thehijabis typically a scarf that covers the hair and neck, whereas theniqabis a veil for the face that leaves the area around the eyes clear. It is worn with an accompanying headscarf or anabaya, a full-length robe, and sometimes with a separate transparent eye veil. Theburkais the most concealing - covering the entire face and body, leaving just a mesh screen to see through. This video can not be played Four Muslim women discuss their relationship with the veil UK mother-of-seven Tahira Noor, who has been wearing a burka for 20 years, says it's ""100% my choice"" and Mr Johnson's comments show a ""lack of knowledge"". The ""majority of the women who wear the burka"" she says, are born and brought up in Britain. They are ""educated in this country, they've been to colleges, universities, and have understood why they want to do what they're doing,""she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""They're under no oppression, they're not doing it because their husbands want them to or their fathers want them to."" Ms Noor has four daughters none of whom wear a burka. ""I haven't forced my daughters into it because I don't have to,"" she said. ""It's not a must. It's not an obligation. However... [it] gets you closer to God. It's a spiritual thing more than anything else."" She is ""not under an obligation"" to cover her face but does so because it is ""emulating"" the Prophet Muhammad. So, how does she respond if asked to remove her covering for security reasons? ""I'm happy to take my veil off,"" she said, citing the example of being asked to at a bank. ""When I travel, and I do travel, sometimes I don't even wear [it] because I think it's a lot easier not to [for] security reasons. ""To make comments that they (women who wear burkas) look like bank robbers, I don't think it's fair."" Sahar Al-Faifi said she has experienced verbal abuse for wearing a niqab Sahar Al-Faifi, from Cardiff, wears the niqab but told BBC News she sometimes gets verbal abuse from others for her choice of veil. ""A week ago someone abused me and said 'you're an ugly terrorist' when I tried to park my car near where I live,"" she said. ""Two years ago, when I was passing by one department to another at Heath Hospital, someone passed by and said 'don't cut off my head you're ISIS'. It's quite painful [to hear]."" In 2014, BBC News' Shaimaa Khalil wrote about why shestopped wearing her headscarf, only to put it back on againwhen she became the Pakistan correspondent. Dr Qanta Ahmed, a British-American Muslim doctor who lives in New York, does not wear a face veil and supports a ban on them. She said the number of women wearing them in the West is increasing in part because girls begin to wear them before they reach puberty and many were not given a choice. The burka completely covers a woman's body Muslim scholars have long debated whether it is obligatory to wear the burka or niqab, or whether it is just recommended. There have also been more liberal interpretations which say any headscarf is unnecessary, as long as women maintain the sartorial modesty stipulated in the Koran. That holy text addresses ""the faithful women"" who are told to shield their private parts and not to display their adornment ""except what is apparent of it"". Scholarly disputes revolve around what this last phrase means. Does it refer to the outer surface of a woman's garments, necessitating that she cover every part of her body - ie don the full niqab? Or does it give an exemption referring to the face and the hands, as well as conventional female ornaments such as kohl, rings, bracelets and make-up? The latter interpretation has been adopted by some of the most prominent scholars from Islamic history who favour the hijab - headscarf - option. There are additional Koranic instructions - seen as ambiguous and therefore much debated - for women to draw the ""khimar"" (scarf) to cover the ""jayb"" (bosom/upper chest), and for ""the wives and daughters of the Prophet and the women of the believers to draw their ""jalabib"" (cloaks) close round them"". Two women wearing niqabs leave a polling station in Luton When contacted by BBC Reality Check, both the Women's Muslim Council and Faith Matters (an organisation which promotes integration) said accurate numbers weren't available for the UK. But there does seem to be consensus that the figure is likely to be low. Dr Omar Khan, director at the Runnymede Trust, a think tank that deals with race equality, said that it is likely to be ""less than 1% [of the Muslim female population] - how much less is difficult to know"". Sunder Katwala, director of think tank British Future,acknowledged a lack of a ""robust methodology"",external, but said there was a ""ballpark estimate in region of 3,000-5,000"" with it ""very unlikely to be as high as 1-2%"" of the female Muslim population. These are both estimates by experts working in relevant fields, but until specific research is carried out, it will be difficult to know how prevalent the full-face veil is. What we do know is that in the 2011 census, Muslims represented 4.8% of the population of England and Wales. Using the most recent population estimates, this would mean there are roughly 1.43 million Muslim women living in the two nations. If the number of Muslim women wearing the niqab were to be as high as 1% - this would equate to just over 14,000 women - but, again, the 1% figure is just an estimate. In other European countries, the figure also appears to be low. Denmark woman fined for wearing veil In 2009, a French Interior Ministry report estimated that just 0.1% of French Muslim women wore full-face veils which, at the time, equated to 1,900 women. In Austria, a ban of full face veils in public spaces was said to affect just 0.03% of the Muslim population, according to Nilufar Ahmed, asenior lecturer in public health,externalat Swansea University. In Belgium between 150 and 200 women wore the niqab before a ban came into force, says Michael Privot, director of the European Network Against Racism. Between 150 and 200 women in Demark - which banned face veils in public this month - wore a niqab or burqa on a daily basis. That's 0.1% ofMuslim women,externalin the country, according to the Guardian. Women in Denmark protested against the country's new law that says ""anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine"" WhileBoris Johnson's comments,externalabout Islamic face veils have provoked consternation among some, his defenders have said they were made as part of an argument against banning such garments. Other countries though, have taken this step. Francewas the first European country to ban full-face veils - ie burkas and niqabs - in public places in April 2011, seven years after it introduced a law prohibiting conspicuous religious symbols in state schools. It was followed a few months later byBelgium, which banned the wearing of partial or total face veils in public on the grounds of security. Full or partial bans on full-face veils have since been in place inAustria,Bulgaria, the southern German state ofBavariaand, since 1 August,Denmark. There have been protests against Denmark's new law, which does not mention burkas and niqabs by name, but says ""anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine"". Repeat offenders could be fined 10,000 ($1,500; Â£1,200) kroner. The Islamic veil across Europe Iran jails woman for removing headscarf Iranian women threw off the hijab - then what? By contrast, inIranthe law requires women to wear modest ""Islamic"" clothing. In practice, this means women must wear a chador, a full-body cloak, or a headscarf and a manteau (overcoat) that covers their arms. There are posters in cities and towns comparing unveiled women to unwrapped candy and lollipops attracting unwanted attention from flies. Recently, some Iranian women have protested against this law by taking off their headscarf in public. One woman was jailed for two years in March for doing this.

"Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has been accused of Islamophobia after saying Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"". He said he was against bans on face-covering veils in public places, in his Telegraph column, but that it was ""ridiculous"" people chose to wear them. The Muslim Council of Britain accused him of ""pandering to the far right"". Labour MP Jess Phillips said she would report Mr Johnson to the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The Muslim Council of Britain said the comments were ""particularly regrettable in this current climate, where Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hatred is becoming worryingly pervasive"". Denmark woman fined for wearing veil Brexit dream dying, Johnson tells May Profile: Boris Johnson The group said that the government had shown ""little action"" to tackle anti-Muslim hate and repeated its call for an inquiry into Islamophobia within the Conservative Party. The chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum, Mohammed Amin, said the article was ""anti-Muslim"" and would ""whip up hatred of women who wear the niqab and burqa"". ""Boris Johnson is a master of the English language - he must understand exactly what effect his language will have. I find it deplorable he chose to write such an article,"" he said. The imam of Finsbury Park mosque, Mohammed Mahmoud, has, meanwhile, accused the government of failing to show ""meaningful engagement"" with the Muslim community. In an article for the Evening Standard,external, Mr Mahmoud, who was praised forhis response to last year's terror attack on his mosque, criticised the government's ""lacklustre"" efforts to fight Islamophobia. Conservative peer Baroness Warsi, the first Muslim woman to sit in a British cabinet, accused Mr Johnson of indulging in ""dog whistle"" politics. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Johnson - who last month quit the government in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit policy - was commenting on the introduction of a burka ban in Denmark. He said he felt ""fully entitled"" to expect women to remove face coverings when talking to him at his MP surgery - and schools and universities should be able to take the same approach if a student ""turns up... looking like a bank robber"". ""If you tell me that the burka is oppressive, then I am with you,"" he said. ""If you say that it is weird and bullying to expect women to cover their faces, then I totally agree - and I would add that I can find no scriptural authority for the practice in the Koran. ""I would go further and say that it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes."" He said businesses and government agencies should be able to ""enforce a dress code"" that allowed them to see customers' faces. But he said: ""Such restrictions are not quite the same as telling a free-born adult woman what she may or may not wear, in a public place, when she is simply minding her own business."" He said a total ban on face-covering veils would give a boost to radicals who said there was a ""clash of civilisations"" between Islam and the West and could lead to ""a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation"". Denmark has seen protests against the veil ban Labour MPs accused of him of stoking Islamophobia to boost his ambitions of becoming the next Conservative leader. Labour MP David Lammy said: ""Muslim women are having their burkas pulled off by thugs in our streets and Boris Johnson's response is to mock them for 'looking like letter boxes'. ""Our pound-shop Donald Trump is fanning the flames of Islamophobia to propel his grubby electoral ambitions."" Labour MP Stella Creasy said the former foreign secretary was in danger of ""going full Morrissey"" - a reference to the former Smiths singer whose comments on immigration have sparked controversy. Her advice to Mr Johnson was that ""being a buffoon, not being a racist and misogynist, [is] more British"". Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Christine Jardine said Mr Johnson had ""proven himself to be a xenophobe"". ""This desperate pitch to stay in the news completely disregards the women who are facing daily discrimination on our streets,"" she added. Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""The long-standing government position on this is clear, that we do not support a ban on the wearing of the veil in public. ""Such a prescriptive approach would be not in keeping with British values of religious tolerance and gender equality.""

"A single flower has been left near the scene in Staithes A nine-year-old girl died from serious head injuries when rocks fell from a cliff at a beach in North Yorkshire. Eyewitnesses said the girl had been on holiday with her family when the accident happened in the Seaton Garth area of Staithes on Wednesday. Police said the child died at the scene and her family was being supported by specialist officers. Onlookers described the fall, which they said was near warning signs about the cliff, as ""particularly serious"". Staithes Coastguard confirmed a section of the cliff had fallen Staithes Coastguard confirmed a section of the cliff had fallen. Yorkshire breaking news: Birthday plea to missing teenager; Police to tackle 'zombie' drug users Part of the beach at the popular tourist resort was cordoned off on Wednesday night. It has since reopened. The area where the accident happened is understood to be on the eastern side of a harbour wall. A woman said residents knew not to go too close to the cliffs as minor collapses were common Eyewitnesses said the beach had been particularly busy at the time - at about 16:15 BST - and described seeing a ""number of emergency vehicles"", including fire engines, heading for the beach. One woman, who did not wish to be named, said the beach was ""teeming with people"". ""I was on there with my grandchildren and we left just before this happened,"" she said. ""It is absolutely terrible what's happened. ""Fortunately, we had walked the other way."" Signs are in the village warning of the danger of falling rocks The woman said minor collapses were common and residents believed the recent weather had made the cliffs more unstable, especially with a long dry spell followed by heavy rain. Engineering geologist Dr Helen Reeves said the recent dry weather was ""likely to be a contributing factor"" to the fall. ""Recent weeks have seen an increased number of cliff falls reported around our coastline in the UK. ""Current research has linked rock falls to temperature fluctuations, but the research to fully understand this process is still ongoing."" The only signs of yesterday's tragedy that remain are the police tape cordoning off the beach and the sombre feeling that has descended on the village. Only a handful of people have made the walk to an unusually quiet Seaton Garth this morning. Most spend a few minutes looking out to sea, then turn away. From speaking to residents it is clear many are still reeling from the devastating news that something so awful could happen so close to home, at a place associated with fun and family. Most people feel unable to put the shock into words at this time. Part of the beach at Staithes has been cordoned off North Yorkshire Police said: ""Sadly, despite the efforts of the emergency services, the girl died at the scene from her injuries."" A statement from the RNLI said: ""The RNLI, and in particular the volunteers of Staithes and Runswick Lifeboat Station, would like to share their deepest condolences with the child's family.""

"This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge paid tribute to ""the fallen of all nations"" The Duke of Cambridge and the prime minister have attended commemorations in northern France to mark the centenary of the Battle of Amiens - the beginning of the end of World War One. Prince William and Theresa May both paid tribute at a service at Amiens Cathedral. They also spoke to descendants of soldiers who fought in the battle. In a reading, the duke said he was ""delighted"" to mark the centenary in the ""historic cathedral"". He added the purpose of the service was to ""honour the fallen of all nations"" involved in the war. In her message printed in the official programme, Mrs May paid tribute to the ""courage, bravery and skill"" of troops who fought at Amiens. She added it was important to ""reflect on the fear and hardship experienced by the people of this city and the surrounding battlefields"". William and Kate remember WW1 battle Princes pay tribute to fallen soldiers Somme fallen honoured 100 years on At Wednesday's service, the story of the battle was told through contemporary letters, diaries and poems read by guests from the 2,000-strong congregation. The British-commanded Fourth Army was involved in the battle, heralding the start of the Hundred Days offensive. General Sir Henry Rawlinson had learnt the lessons of the bloodySomme offensiveand employed improved tactics and new equipment. The prime minister arrives at the cathedral in Amiens, France, ahead of her reading The Royal Anglian Regiment formed a guard of honour outside the cathedral More than 500 UK tanks were deployed, alongside 1,900 British and French aircraft, and more than 2,000 guns from the Royal Artillery. A string of military victories by combined air and land forces from Britain, Australia, Canada, France, and the US followed, leading to the surrender of German forces and the end of the conflict on 11 November 1918. Armed Forces Minister Mark Lancaster and Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter also attended the service. Gen Carter said the Battle of Amiens was a ""remarkable achievement... moulding a new citizen-based force into a very accomplished fighting force, against a backdrop of rapid technological change"". French Foreign Legion officers with their dogs in Amiens Forces from Britain, Australia, Canada, France and the US were involved in the Battle of Amiens Kevin Sherlock, 58, a retired Rolls-Royce engine inspector from Derby, said his 19-year-old great uncle Ernest Harm, who was killed towards the end of the battle, ""paid the ultimate sacrifice"", helping to bring peace to Europe. He said the teenage soldier, also from Derby, was killed, possibly by machine gun fire, going ""over the top"" on 11 August 1918. Mr Sherlock added: ""I think as I've got older I've thought about it more really, he was only 19, just a lad really, never experienced anything in his life. ""So there's sadness but also pride that he took part in a key battle that brought ultimately the Allied victory and no doubt about it, shortened the war as well.""

"A trick used by viruses to make us sick - ""stealth spheres"" - has been discovered by scientists. It had been thought viruses were all lone wolves, each on a solo campaign of infection. Instead they can form ""packs"" of up to 40 viruses and surround themselves with a fatty sphere that makes them invisible to our body's defences. The team at the US National Institutes of Health say their findings rewrite the textbooks of infection. The researchers were analysing stool samples from patients with either rotavirus or norovirus. Rotavirus is the biggest cause of diarrhoea in children in the world Norovirus is so infectious it spreads rampantly through schools, care homes and frequently cruise ships ""It blew my mind,"" said researcher Dr Nihal Altan-Bonnet, the head of host-pathogen dynamics at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. ""I had this preconceived notion... I couldn't believe it when I saw it in the stool, I just couldn't believe they'd be able to exist."" The conventional view is that a virus infects a cell, which is converted into a factory for making more viruses, which burst out as individual viruses into the body. Instead some are released as groups in spheres known as vesicles. Viruses in their stealth sphere Experiments, published in the journal Cell Host and Microbe, showed the spheres gave the viruses huge advantages. The spheres acted like an invisibility cloak that prevents the immune system spotting the viruses The spheres protected the viruses from harsh environments including stomach acid And they helped viruses reach their target in larger numbers and overwhelm cells in the intestines The researchers infected animals with a set number of viruses that were either released on their own or packaged into the stealth spheres. Dr Altan-Bonnet told the BBC: ""The animals that got the vesicles got disease much faster and had more severe symptoms. ""We think by being inside [the vesicles] the viruses become invisible and take longer to clear. ""In the viral world it's always about having an edge and in a vesicle you have a leg up in the early stages of the infection."" There are no drug treatments for either norovirus or rotavirus so the researchers hope targeting the vesicles will lead to new options. That could be a type of handwash that breaks down the spheres or drugs that stop them forming in the first place. Winter Olympics: Swiss athletes hit by norovirus outbreak 'Sticky balls' stop cancer spreading British cruise ship passengers hit by norovirus Dr Altan-Bonnet says the need for better ways of tackling diseases like norovirus should not be underestimated: ""Even healthy people like you or I, we get so sick we wouldn't go to work for days. ""Its liquid coming violently out of both ends, there's a lot of economic cost, and for children and elderly it can be fatal."" The researchers say poliovirus and rhinovirus, a cause of the common cold, can also form these stealth spheres. Jonathan Ball, a professor of virology at the University of Nottingham, said the findings were a surprise. He told the BBC: ""These vesicles seems to give the viruses increased infectivity when compared to naked individual viruses.

"A single flower has been left near the scene in Staithes A nine-year-old girl died from serious head injuries when rocks fell from a cliff at a beach in North Yorkshire. Eyewitnesses said the girl had been on holiday with her family when the accident happened in the Seaton Garth area of Staithes on Wednesday. Police said the child died at the scene and her family was being supported by specialist officers. Onlookers described the fall, which they said was near warning signs about the cliff, as ""particularly serious"". Staithes Coastguard confirmed a section of the cliff had fallen Staithes Coastguard confirmed a section of the cliff had fallen. Yorkshire breaking news: Birthday plea to missing teenager; Police to tackle 'zombie' drug users Part of the beach at the popular tourist resort was cordoned off on Wednesday night. It has since reopened. The area where the accident happened is understood to be on the eastern side of a harbour wall. A woman said residents knew not to go too close to the cliffs as minor collapses were common Eyewitnesses said the beach had been particularly busy at the time - at about 16:15 BST - and described seeing a ""number of emergency vehicles"", including fire engines, heading for the beach. One woman, who did not wish to be named, said the beach was ""teeming with people"". ""I was on there with my grandchildren and we left just before this happened,"" she said. ""It is absolutely terrible what's happened. ""Fortunately, we had walked the other way."" Signs are in the village warning of the danger of falling rocks The woman said minor collapses were common and residents believed the recent weather had made the cliffs more unstable, especially with a long dry spell followed by heavy rain. Engineering geologist Dr Helen Reeves said the recent dry weather was ""likely to be a contributing factor"" to the fall. ""Recent weeks have seen an increased number of cliff falls reported around our coastline in the UK. ""Current research has linked rock falls to temperature fluctuations, but the research to fully understand this process is still ongoing."" The only signs of yesterday's tragedy that remain are the police tape cordoning off the beach and the sombre feeling that has descended on the village. Only a handful of people have made the walk to an unusually quiet Seaton Garth this morning. Most spend a few minutes looking out to sea, then turn away. From speaking to residents it is clear many are still reeling from the devastating news that something so awful could happen so close to home, at a place associated with fun and family. Most people feel unable to put the shock into words at this time. Part of the beach at Staithes has been cordoned off North Yorkshire Police said: ""Sadly, despite the efforts of the emergency services, the girl died at the scene from her injuries."" A statement from the RNLI said: ""The RNLI, and in particular the volunteers of Staithes and Runswick Lifeboat Station, would like to share their deepest condolences with the child's family."" Scarborough Borough Council Leader Derek Bastiman added: ""Our thoughts are with the family of the nine-year-old girl who has lost her life in such tragic circumstances.

"This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge paid tribute to ""the fallen of all nations"" The Duke of Cambridge and the prime minister have attended commemorations in northern France to mark the centenary of the Battle of Amiens - the beginning of the end of World War One. Prince William and Theresa May both paid tribute at a service at Amiens Cathedral. They also spoke to descendants of soldiers who fought in the battle. In a reading, the duke said he was ""delighted"" to mark the centenary in the ""historic cathedral"". He added the purpose of the service was to ""honour the fallen of all nations"" involved in the war. In her message printed in the official programme, Mrs May paid tribute to the ""courage, bravery and skill"" of troops who fought at Amiens. She added it was important to ""reflect on the fear and hardship experienced by the people of this city and the surrounding battlefields"". William and Kate remember WW1 battle Princes pay tribute to fallen soldiers Somme fallen honoured 100 years on At Wednesday's service, the story of the battle was told through contemporary letters, diaries and poems read by guests from the 2,000-strong congregation. The British-commanded Fourth Army was involved in the battle, heralding the start of the Hundred Days offensive. General Sir Henry Rawlinson had learnt the lessons of the bloodySomme offensiveand employed improved tactics and new equipment. The prime minister arrives at the cathedral in Amiens, France, ahead of her reading The Royal Anglian Regiment formed a guard of honour outside the cathedral More than 500 UK tanks were deployed, alongside 1,900 British and French aircraft, and more than 2,000 guns from the Royal Artillery. A string of military victories by combined air and land forces from Britain, Australia, Canada, France, and the US followed, leading to the surrender of German forces and the end of the conflict on 11 November 1918. Armed Forces Minister Mark Lancaster and Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter also attended the service. Gen Carter said the Battle of Amiens was a ""remarkable achievement... moulding a new citizen-based force into a very accomplished fighting force, against a backdrop of rapid technological change"". French Foreign Legion officers with their dogs in Amiens Forces from Britain, Australia, Canada, France and the US were involved in the Battle of Amiens Kevin Sherlock, 58, a retired Rolls-Royce engine inspector from Derby, said his 19-year-old great uncle Ernest Harm, who was killed towards the end of the battle, ""paid the ultimate sacrifice"", helping to bring peace to Europe. He said the teenage soldier, also from Derby, was killed, possibly by machine gun fire, going ""over the top"" on 11 August 1918. Mr Sherlock added: ""I think as I've got older I've thought about it more really, he was only 19, just a lad really, never experienced anything in his life. ""So there's sadness but also pride that he took part in a key battle that brought ultimately the Allied victory and no doubt about it, shortened the war as well.""

"A trick used by viruses to make us sick - ""stealth spheres"" - has been discovered by scientists. It had been thought viruses were all lone wolves, each on a solo campaign of infection. Instead they can form ""packs"" of up to 40 viruses and surround themselves with a fatty sphere that makes them invisible to our body's defences. The team at the US National Institutes of Health say their findings rewrite the textbooks of infection. The researchers were analysing stool samples from patients with either rotavirus or norovirus. Rotavirus is the biggest cause of diarrhoea in children in the world Norovirus is so infectious it spreads rampantly through schools, care homes and frequently cruise ships ""It blew my mind,"" said researcher Dr Nihal Altan-Bonnet, the head of host-pathogen dynamics at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. ""I had this preconceived notion... I couldn't believe it when I saw it in the stool, I just couldn't believe they'd be able to exist."" The conventional view is that a virus infects a cell, which is converted into a factory for making more viruses, which burst out as individual viruses into the body. Instead some are released as groups in spheres known as vesicles. Viruses in their stealth sphere Experiments, published in the journal Cell Host and Microbe, showed the spheres gave the viruses huge advantages. The spheres acted like an invisibility cloak that prevents the immune system spotting the viruses The spheres protected the viruses from harsh environments including stomach acid And they helped viruses reach their target in larger numbers and overwhelm cells in the intestines The researchers infected animals with a set number of viruses that were either released on their own or packaged into the stealth spheres. Dr Altan-Bonnet told the BBC: ""The animals that got the vesicles got disease much faster and had more severe symptoms. ""We think by being inside [the vesicles] the viruses become invisible and take longer to clear. ""In the viral world it's always about having an edge and in a vesicle you have a leg up in the early stages of the infection."" There are no drug treatments for either norovirus or rotavirus so the researchers hope targeting the vesicles will lead to new options. That could be a type of handwash that breaks down the spheres or drugs that stop them forming in the first place. Winter Olympics: Swiss athletes hit by norovirus outbreak 'Sticky balls' stop cancer spreading British cruise ship passengers hit by norovirus Dr Altan-Bonnet says the need for better ways of tackling diseases like norovirus should not be underestimated: ""Even healthy people like you or I, we get so sick we wouldn't go to work for days. ""Its liquid coming violently out of both ends, there's a lot of economic cost, and for children and elderly it can be fatal."" The researchers say poliovirus and rhinovirus, a cause of the common cold, can also form these stealth spheres. Jonathan Ball, a professor of virology at the University of Nottingham, said the findings were a surprise. He told the BBC: ""These vesicles seems to give the viruses increased infectivity when compared to naked individual viruses. ""Why this increased concentration of viruses results in better levels of entry is unclear, and no doubt will be an important next question. ""But what this data does indicate is how little we know about some of the most fundamental aspects of  the virus lifecycle."" Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

"This video can not be played A drone captures thirsty cattle swarming around a water truck in New South Wales Australia's most populous state, New South Wales (NSW), is now entirely in drought, officials have confirmed. A dry winter has intensified what has been called the worst drought in living memory in parts of eastern Australia. NSW produces about a quarter of Australia's agricultural output. It was officially listed as ""100% in drought"" on Wednesday. The state and federal governments have provided A$576m (Â£330m; $430m) in emergency relief funding. ""There isn't a person in the state that isn't hoping to see some rain for our farmers and regional communities,"" said NSW Minister for Primary Industries Niall Blair. Farmers have told harrowing stories of failing crops, severe water shortages and being unable to feed livestock. Some have spent up to A$10,000 per truckload of hay just to feed their animals, according to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Farmers are struggling to afford to feed their animals ""It's like you are in jail every day,"" Queensland farmer Ashley Gambletold the Nine Network,external. ""You turn up here because you've got to turn up. It's just depressing."" Australia's drought seen from the air How Australia's extreme heat might be here to stay Five places that have just broken heat records Stock agent Simon Bourketold the ABC,external: ""We're selling livestock we don't want to sellâ¦ down the track there's really not going to be too many cattle or sheep left."" A farmer stands in the middle of a dried-up dam near the town of Gunnedah in New South Wales Cattle farmer David Graham said he was resigned to waiting for rain, telling the BBC: ""In our community you just support each other through the tough times."" Suicide rates in rural regions are on average about 40% higher than in urban areas, mental health group Sane Australia has said. Southern Australia has just experienced its second-driest autumn on record, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, with rainfall 57mm (2.24in) below average. Less than 10mm of rain was then recorded in parts of NSW in July, and drier than normal conditions are forecast in coming months. On Wednesday, officials said 23% of NSW was classified as being in ""intense drought"", with the remainder in drought or drought-affected. But the problem is not confined to NSW - more than half of neighbouring Queensland is in drought. Parts of Victoria and South Australia are also experiencing dry conditions. On Sunday, Prime MinisterMalcolm Turnbull warned that the country had become a ""land of drought"". The weather in Australia naturally varies a lot year-on-year, and droughts are caused by many different, complex factors. Scientists are reluctant to blame any single event on rising emissions. However, the Australian government says some of the aspects that affect drought, such as high atmospheric pressure,could be becoming more likely because of human-induced climate change.,external While touring some of the worst-hit areas in June, PM Turnbull said: ""I don't know many people in rural New South Wales that... don't think the climate is getting drier and rainfall is becoming more volatile."" Farmers are already eligible for annual relief payments of up to A$16,000 each. Earlier this week, Mr Turnbull announced additional payments of up to A$12,000. The prime minister said that although drought was considered ""part of the Australian climate"", farmers needed help. ""What we have to do is make sure we [the government] back them when the times get as tough as they are now,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation earlier this week. However, some have criticised the measure as ""too little, too late"" and said the payments process is too onerous. Almost 20,000 eligible people are yet to apply for the grant. No, the so-called millennium drought of 1997-2005 is often cited as the most devastating - it ravaged almost 50% of Australia's agricultural land. That event coincided with two El Nino systems, powerful weather phenomena that are often associated with droughts in Australia. Earlier this year, meteorologists rated Australia as having a 50% chance of experiencing an El Nino in its spring beginning in September.

"Samantha Eastwood's family has thanked members of the public for their support Midwife Samantha Eastwood was found in a shallow grave, wrapped in a duvet cover and with tape around her eyes and face, a court has heard. The 28-year-old's body was found in Caverswall, Staffordshire, on Saturday, eight days after she was reported missing. Pathologists found no gunshot or knife wounds during initial tests on her remains, Stafford Crown Court heard. Michael Stirling, 32, is accused of Ms Eastwood's murder. The defendant, of Gratton Road, Bucknall, appeared at court via videolink, and was remanded in custody until his next hearing on 5 October. Midlands Live: Man seriously injured in microlight crash; Force u-turn over 'fake' police car Mr Stirling is the brother-in-law of Ms Eastwood's ex-fiance, John Peake, and is accused of killing her between 26 July and 5 August at Baddeley Green, Stoke-on-Trent. Jonas Hankin QC, prosecuting, told the court the investigation into her death was ""complex"" and meant a provisional trial date set for February 2019 was unlikely to remain in place. A preliminary post-mortem examination did not reveal any gunshot, stab or penetrating wounds, and further analysis of neck bones would be conducted, Judge Michael Challinor QC was also told. Michael Stirling leaves North Staffordshire Justice Centre on Monday CCTV footage, telephone evidence and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) data are also set to form part of the evidence at trial. Defence barrister Samina Rasid made no application for bail and Mr Stirling was not required to enter any plea. Two men, aged 60 and 28, arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender have been released on conditional bail. Ms Eastwood, of Stockton Brook in Stoke-on-Trent, was last seen in uniform leaving work at Royal Stoke University Hospital on the morning of 27 July. Earlier this week, Staffordshire Police said a post-mortem examination had taken place but further tests were required. Tributes to the midwife have been left outside Royal Stoke University Hospital More than Â£10,000 has now been collected on a fundraising page set up to help Ms Eastwood's family with funeral costs.

"Black Panther is among the films which could be recognised in the new category The Oscars are introducing a new category for outstanding achievement in popular film. It's among three changes which were approved on Tuesday by the Academy's board of governors. It means films which are popular with the public but less so with critics will be more likely to win an Oscar. Superhero films such as Black Panther are among those which could now stand a much better chance of being recognised during awards season. It's understood the change will come into effect in time for the next Oscars ceremony in February. In a message to its members, the Academy said eligibility requirements for the new category and other key details would be ""forthcoming"". In previous years, films which have done well at the box office - including Mamma Mia, Avatar and the Mission Impossible franchise - have been snubbed by the Oscars. An outstanding popular film category may also go some way to allay criticism that many of the films acknowledged by the Oscars are""increasingly irrelevant"",externaland do not reflect what the viewing public want to watch. Which films could win the new Oscar? Lady Bird 'most overrated' Oscars film by critics How The Greatest Showman became a film phenomenon The Academy's board of governors has also set an earlier date for the 2020 Oscars ceremony and will shorten the telecast to three hours in an attempt to make the ceremony ""more accessible for our viewers worldwide"". In order to fit in all 24 award categories, some will be presented during commercial breaks with the winning moments edited and aired later in the broadcast. By Lizo Mzimba, BBC entertainment correspondent This is a move from an awards body not just anxious to be relevant, but anxious to be seen to be relevant. They've made a lot of progress making the approximately 8,000 Oscar voters more diverse, with more women and people from ethnic minorities. But they know that that's not enough and that there needs to be greater uniformity between the kind of films honoured at the Oscars and the kind of films that enjoy huge success at the box office. But the question is, is this the right way to achieve this? While the new category will all but guarantee nominations for films like Black Panther, at the same time it might well make them much less likely to get nominations for best picture. Voters could decide it's less important to recognise them in the most prestigious categories because there's now a separate category, which the Academy can point to as evidence they're not ignoring some of the year's biggest hits.

She said: ""I think it's a fantastic thing that is happening now with the register. And I think a lot of it had to do with the publicity I got. ""Women having their lips filled were saying, 'I don't want to look like Lesley Ash.'"" Sue Ibrahim, from the British Association of Aesthetic Nurses, Doctors and Dentists, said the inclusion of beauticians for filler treatments had put the public at risk.

"This video can not be played Father grieved at wrong grave for 30 years due to misplaced headstone A father discovered he had been grieving for his daughter at the wrong grave for 30 years because of a misplaced headstone. George Salt's daughter Victoria died less than two days after being born in July 1988 and was buried at Southern Cemetery in Manchester. Mr Salt said he felt ""let down"" that he found out by being faced with an empty spot where the gravestone had been. Manchester City Council apologised for the distress he has suffered. Mr Salt, who has visited the grave twice a year for 30 years, said: ""I looked down and was completely gobsmacked. I thought 'where's the stone gone?'."" He then found the headstone, which marks a public grave containing the remains of Victoria and 16 others, in a different spot. The stone had been moved in error during the 1980s to a vacant plot, but the mistake was only discovered this year when cemetery workers checked records and moved it to the correct place. Victoria's gravestone in Southern Cemetery ""I just wasn't told. I feel so let down,"" Mr Salt said. ""When you go to a grave, you sit and talk and say what your troubles are but the annoying thing is you're talking to a piece of ground where she isn't there."" The council said they accepted something clearly went wrong in the 1980s and had offered ""sincere apologies"" to Mr Salt for the distress he has suffered. The passing of time meant they were unable to say why it was moved to the wrong plot, the authority added.

"L-R Democrat Sharice Davids, Republican Susan Hutchison and Democrat Rashida Tlaib, who is almost certain to be the first Muslim woman in Congress More women candidates than ever will contest US governorships and House seats in November's mid-term elections. After Tuesday's primaries across four states, there are now 11 female nominees for governor and at least 185 for the House of Representatives. The results were hailed as a continuing success story by activists for women in politics. There was also a key election for a House seat in Ohio, in which President Donald Trump claimed victory. But US media said the race was still too close to call, in a safe Republican seat held by them since 1983. The outcome could indicate whether Democrats have a chance to overturn the Republican majority in the House in November. What election results mean for Trump Kris Kobach: Trump's political apprentice After polling closed in the four states holding primaries on Tuesday - Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington - it became clear women had broken records for gubernatorial and House nominations. Victories for Gretchen Whitmer (Michigan) and Laura Kelly (Kansas) in Democratic primaries mean 11 women will contest governorships in November - one more than the previous 1994 record.

At least 182 female major party nominees will run for the House, beating the record of 167 from 2016. Another three women are leading in close primary contests.

In Kansas, 38-year-old Sharice Davids - a gay ex-mixed martial arts fighter - won her primary and could become the first Native-American woman elected to Congress. Ms Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, was raised by a single mother who worked as a drill sergeant in the US Army. Her campaign ran adverts showing her hitting a punching bag.

Another Native-American woman, Democrat Deb Haaland of New Mexico, became a congressional nominee in June. And one of the candidates for the House in the state is all but certain to become the first Muslim woman in Congress. Rashida Tlaib won a Democratic nomination and will not be opposed by the Republicans in November. She will also be the first Palestinian-American congresswoman. This video can not be played The US state about to finally elect a woman There will be two all-female races in Washington state. Democrat Lisa Brown faces Cathy McMorris Rodgers for a House seat, while Republican Susan Hutchison will take on incumbent Senator Maria Cantwell. Democratic women could outnumber their white male colleagues in the House after November, a recent study suggested. First black female nominee for governor US mid-terms: Can we tell now if Democrats will win? Republican candidate Troy Balderson has been taking on Democrat Danny O'Connor for a seat in the House of Representatives. Ohio is one of the key battleground states in the mid-terms. Mr Trump tweeted ""Congratulations to Troy Balderson on a great win in Ohio. A very special and important race!"" Despite this, US news outlets have not called the contest yet.The New York Times gave Mr Balderson 50.2%,external, a lead of 1,754 votes in the 12th Congressional District race, with all precincts reporting. But thousands of absentee and provisional ballots are still outstanding, which could lead Mr O'Connor to force a recount. He said: ""We're not stopping now."" A provisional ballot is used to record a vote when there are questions about a voter's eligibility. Absentee ballots are cast by those unable to attend polling stations. Donald Trump travelled to Ohio to support Troy Balderson Democrat House representative Ben Ray LujÃ¡n said the seat should have been a ""slam dunk"" for the Republicans and the closeness of the contest was an ""ominous sign"" for them in November. Mr Trump won the 12th Congressional District in 2016 by more than 11 percentage points. Mr Balderson and Mr O'Connor will have to fight the seat again in November. It appears Donald Trump has had success in getting the candidates he endorsed nominated. The battle for the soul of the Democratic Party Why US mid-term elections matter They include John James, an African-American Republican, who won the Senate race nomination in Michigan, and key ally Bill Schuette, who will take on Ms Whitmer for governor in the same state.

The Kansas gubernatorial election has been rancorous for Republicans. Mr Trump's controversial endorsement of the hard-right Kris Kobach over incumbent Jeff Colyer may have just about paid off. Mr Kobach holds a lead of just under 200 votes with all precincts reporting, but again provisional and other ballots are still outstanding. And one interesting sidebar: Ron Estes has beaten Ron Estes in a Kansas Republican primary. The victorious incumbent congressman had to fund a campaign to spell out which candidate was which. The beaten candidate was Ron M Estes - his opponent said the M stood for misleading. The beaten man's campaign was described by some analysts as ""not serious"". The winning Ron Estes took about 80% of the vote and will face Democrat James Thompson, a supporter of Bernie Sanders in November. All 435 House seats, 35 of the 100 Senate seats and 36 of 50 governor races are to be fought. This video can not be played Why are US election campaigns never-ending? Ask America has the answer The Democrats need to pick up 23 seats in the House to gain a majority. With dozens of Republican lawmakers retiring this year, the minority party has a decent chance of taking over the House. The place that tells you everything about US politics In the Senate they need just two seats to take control. But the Republicans are tipped to retain their majority and perhaps even consolidate it.

Abdul Aziz, Adil Khan and Qari Abdul Rauf were among nine jailed for crimes including rape and trafficking of girls as young as 13 in Rochdale, in 2012. Theresa May, then Home Secretary, ruled in 2015 that the Pakistani nationals should not remain British. Court of Appeal judges rejected their challenge. The ruling means they could be deported. Rochdale grooming case: Victim's story Rochdale sex grooming gang citizenship appeal fails Rochdale grooming: Abusers 'not fazed' by convictions, says victim The men had lost earlier legal challenges against the decision, which they argued violated their human right to family life. But senior judges ruled on Wednesday that the previous tribunals had made a ""proper and lawful assessment"" of the likelihood of deportation. Lord Justice Sales said: ""Given the extremely serious nature of the offending by each appellant, there is no good ground for calling that conclusion into question."" Aziz, Khan and Rauf were given jail sentences of between six and nine years in 2012 but have since been released on licence. In some cases their victims, aged in their early teens, had been raped and pimped out to paying customers in Rochdale and Oldham. Lord Justice Sales said the men were motivated by ""lust and greed"" which amounted to ""serious organised crime"" and that stripping them of citizenship was ""conducive to the public good"". ""All the men treated the girls as though they were worthless and beyond all respect,"" he added. While the decision paves the way for the government to deport them at the end of their sentences, they would have a further legal right to appeal and the process could take months.

"The new Â£1 coin has been described by the Royal Mint as the most secure coin in the world There may be one in an old coat pocket or hidden down the back of the sofa. About 169 million round Â£1 coins have not been returned to the Royal Mint, nine months after they stopped being legal tender. The round Â£1 coin was replaced by the 12-sided version in October last year, with millions of the old coins being melted down to create the new ones. But, while you can not spend the old coin, you can still take it to your bank and deposit it into your account. Is it legal to draw on money? Harry Kane 'Â£50,000' fiver spent in Merthyr Tydfil The new Â£1 coin was introduced on 28 March 2017 to help crack down on counterfeiting, with one in 30 of the old version estimated to be fakeaccording to the Royal Mint,external. About 138 million round Â£1 coins have been melted down to help create some of the 1.5 billion new ones at the Royal Mint, based in Llantrisant near Cardiff, according to figures obtained by BBC Wales. The new coin is described by the Mint as the most ""secure in the world"" and has a string of anti-counterfeiting details, including a hologram, and micro-sized lettering inside both rims. It also has material inside which can be detected when electronically scanned by coin-counting or payment machines. All you need to know about new Â£1 coins New Â£1 coin's 'hidden' security feature A spokesman for the Mint said it had expected about 85% of the 1.7bn round Â£1 coins - or 1.4bn of them - to be returned during the transition period, based on the number of coins returned when the 50p coin changed in 1997-98. ""We do not expect that all round Â£1 coins in circulation at the time of the transition will be returned to the Mint,"" he said, adding the numbers returned were in line with expectations. ""Also, based on the returns of other demonetised coins we expect there to be some returns for a number of years to come as people find these."" This video can not be played The Royal Mint appealed for old Â£1 coins to be returned in October The Royal Mint declined to say how much money smelting the round Â£1 coins saved in production costs of the new Â£1 coin, saying that disclosure of the information ""could put us at a material disadvantage in any future negotiations with our overseas customers for the manufacture of their coinage"". According to the Royal Mint, the old round Â£1 coin can continue to be deposited into a customer's account, either business or personal, at most high-street banks.

"Homebase has about 250 stores and 11,500 staff in the UK and was sold for Â£1 in May The new owners of Homebase will reveal plans to close up to 60 stores next week, putting about 1,500 jobs at risk. Restructuring company Hilco, which bought the DIY chain for Â£1 in May, will outline plans for a rescue deal next week, according to reports. Hilco bought the struggling chain from Australian firm Wesfarmers after its disastrous foray into the UK market. Homebase has about 250 stores and 11,500 employees. The closure plan wasfirst revealed by Sky News,external, which said that Hilco is to propose an insolvency mechanism known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) early next week. The BBC understands that about 60 outlets have been identified for closure, which have on average about 25 staff per store. A number of retailers have used CVAs as a step short of going into administration, including House of Fraser, Mothercare, New Look and Carpetright. Wesfarmers bought Homebase in 2016 and set about redeveloping Homebase stores under its Bunnings brand. But the Australian firm admitted making a number of ""self-induced"" blunders, including underestimating winter demand for items such as heaters, as well as dropping popular kitchen and bathroom ranges. At the end of June, Travis Perkins reported that its Wickes chain had been hit by a ""challenging UK DIY market"" and that it would be ""executing a significant cost reduction programme"".

"Tesla's board has confirmed that it will consider the proposal by chief executive Elon Musk to take it private. A statement was issued by six members of the electric carmaker's board after Mr Musk tweeted to say he had the funding to de-list the company. The board had ""met several times over the last week"" to discuss going private, the statement said. They said this ""included discussion as to how being private could better serve Tesla's long-term interests"". Mr Musk said in his tweet on Tuesday that shareholders would be offered $420 (Â£326) per share, valuing the business at more than $70bn. This would make it the biggest deal of its kind, surpassing the purchase of utility TXU Corp in 2007 for $44bn by a consortium. The brief statement by six of the nine board directors said Mr Musk had ""opened a discussion"" about taking the company private last week. The discussions ""addressed the funding for this to occur"", the six directors added. They did not include Mr Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk, and Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist. The board statement came amid questions about how Mr Musk opted to disclose the possible de-listing to investors. While companies are allowed to make announcements via social media, typically they also make a simultaneous regulatory filing, said Andrew M Calamari, a partner at the law firm Finn Dixon & Herling and former director of the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US market regulator. ""Just in terms of the style of this, it strikes me as very irregular,"" Mr Calamari said. ""It also raises questions about his intent,"" he added. ""Was he in earnest in what he's saying, or does he have some other motive"" like influencing the stock price. Tesla shares reached a peak of $368 after Mr Musk's tweets on Tuesday, before trading on the stock market was halted. Trades resumed later that afternoon, after the company published an email from Mr Musk to employees elaborating on the plans. Tesla shares surged close to their all-time high of $385, which they touched almost a year ago, but fluctuated on Wednesday after the board members issued their statement. In the staff memo,external, Mr Musk explained why he wanted to take the company private. ""As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders,"" he wrote. ""Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long term,"" he wrote. He added that the company was ""the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market"" - a trading strategy which assumes share prices will fall - so ""being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company"". Those traders are likely to have lost money when the share price rose on the announcement about a delisting. Mr Musk already owns 20% of the company. He said his intention in taking the company private was not to increase his personal holding and his plan would give existing investors the option to retain their shares. Regulators are likely to be interested in what evidence exists - such as agreements with investors or banks - for Mr Musk's claim that funding was ""secured"", Mr Calamari said. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the US market regulator, has inquired about the issue,the Wall Street Journal reported,external. The structure of the deal also remains ambiguous, said Adam C Pritchard, professor of securities law at the University of Michigan. If more than 2,000 investors opt to retain their shares, then the firm would be subject to the disclosure rules of a public company, he added. ""Intuitively it doesn't make sense because it would still be a public entity, and the public entity status is what is apparently objectionable to Musk,"" Mr Pritchard said. Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity, said it would be difficult for Mr Musk to raise the necessary finance when Tesla has still not made a profit. ""The company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?"" he said.

"This video can not be played ""Why I chose to freeze my eggs"" Women who freeze their eggs need to be aware of the ""relatively low success rates"" of becoming pregnant, a leading gynaecologist has said. With more women freezing eggs past the age of 35, when chances of conceiving fall, Prof Adam Balen said: ""Egg freezing does not guarantee a baby."" However, Dr Jara Ben Nagi says freezing can help single women wait until they meet the right partner to have a baby. She said women should not be pressured into a relationship to get pregnant. Two groups of experts have been debating the benefits and risks associated with social egg freezing and IVF treatment for women in their late 30s in BJOG: An International Journal Of Obstetrics And Gynaecology. Prof Balen, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: ""Success rates for egg freezing have improved significantly in recent years, so offer an opportunity for women to freeze their eggs for social reasons if they're not ready to have children yet. ""While women should be supported in their choices, they must be informed about the relatively low success rates, high costs and side-effects. ""Women should also be aware that in the UK the storage limit for eggs frozen for social reasons is currently limited to 10 years."" He warned that women should speak to a reproductive specialist and choose an experienced clinic to visit, adding that the best time to freeze eggs is in a woman's early 20s and certainly under the age of 37. Offer transgender patients egg freezing, experts say 'Egg freezing guarantees a little piece of my future' Chinese woman's 6,000-mile egg freezing journey However, Dr Ben Nagi, from the Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health, and her colleagues argue that the preservation of eggs offers more time for single women to find a relationship and gives them hope at a time that their pregnancy chances may be receding. They point out that in a study of 1,382 women who underwent social egg freezing, 120 returned to use their eggs after an average time of just over two years and that 45 of 95 women who were single at the time came back when they had a partner. They add that the survival rate of the frozen egg using the new vitrification method was 85%, with pregnancy rates of 27% - similar to a 23% success rate for IVF in women aged 35 to 37. They said: ""Women should no longer be punished with childlessness for not finding a partner, nor should they feel pressured into a relationship because of their declining ovarian reserve."" Dr Timothy Bracewell-Milnes, from Imperial College London, and co-authors from Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London,warn that the majority of women are taking measures to preserve their fertility too late.,external They said it is being done as a ""last-ditch effort"" instead of a planned and informed choice in their early to mid-30s. They said research has shown young people are not aware of the natural limits of female fertility and ""significantly overestimate"" the success rates of freezing eggs to get pregnant later. ""Egg freezing is indirectly encouraging women to have children at an advanced maternal age, which carries with it significantly increased risk of medical complications in pregnancy,"" the authors said. For women in their late 30s, they said 30 eggs would be needed to have a good chance of getting pregnant. This would require three cycles of ovarian stimulation which would cost around Â£15,000. On top of this there will be an annual storage fee of Â£200-400 and the cost of future fertility treatment to use the frozen eggs. They agree egg freezing should be available to single women in their late 30s ""who accept the high costs and low successes, but they must be provided with accurate and balanced information on the safety and likelihood of success"". But they do agree that women need to be made aware of all the information to make an informed choice.

"British Gas is to increase prices for 3.5 million customers, its parent company Centrica has announced. The 3.8% increase in its standard variable tariff (SVT) from 1 October means the average bill will rise by Â£44, taking it to Â£1,205 a year. This is thesecond increase this year, but Centrica said wholesale energy prices had risen since the last time. The SVT was withdrawn for new customers in March and 2.4 million customers on fixed rates are unaffected. The company, the biggest energy supplier in the UK, said its average bill was still ""just below"" the average of other large energy suppliers. ""We understand that any price increase adds extra pressure on customers' household bills. However, this reflects the sharp rise in wholesale energy costs,"" said Mark Hodges, chief executive of Centrica's consumer arm. E.On, SSE, Npower, EDF, ScottishPower and Bulb have all hiked energy prices, blaming wholesale energy costs for the increases. Ofgem has also announced it israising its pre-payment meter cap- which protects vulnerable customers - from October. Centrica said that until now, it had protected customers from price rises in the wholesale energy market, because it buys its supplies in advance. It quoted figures showing that since April, gas prices had increased by 21% and electricity prices by 18% in the wholesale market. Mr Hodges said British Gas was trying to focus on putting customers on fixed-price deals rather than the SVT. While the company has 3.5 million customers on the SVT, this is down from 4.3 million at the start of the year. It expects to have reduced the number to three million by the end of this year. Customers who do not pick a new tariff when they come off fixed-rate deals are now put on its new temporary tariff, which will also increase by 3.8% from 1 October.  British Gas said a typical dual-fuel customer would pay Â£1,180 on this tariff. It has 250,000 customers on this tariff. In July, the company said it had lost 340,000 customer accounts in the first half of the year, which was partly blamed on its low ranking in best-buy tables. Consumers on the SVT were urged to switch providers. ""Millions will be rightly furious with British Gas when they hear of yet another price hike. But customers need to turn that anger into action,"" said Guy Anker, deputy editor of MoneySavingExpert.com. Alex Neill, managing director of home products and services at consumer group Which?, said the latest rise meant that bills had increased by an average of Â£104 in six months. ""They should take the power back into their own hands and radically change how much they pay, simply by choosing a better deal. Before the energy price cap comes into effect later this year, customers still stuck on poor value standard tariffs should look to switch now as they could potentially save almost Â£400 a year,"" said Ms Neill.

"Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has been criticised for saying Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"" and for comparing them to ""bank robbers"" - prompting calls for him to apologise andbe expelled from the Conservative Party. But Mr Johnson's comments, which some believe will aggravate Islamophobic tensions in the UK, have also highlighted some confusion about what a burka is - as the veil revealing just the eyes is, in fact, known as a niqab. So what actually are the differences between the various types of Islamic dress for women and what governs their choices? The Koran, Islam's holy book, tells Muslims - men and women - to dress modestly. Male modesty has been interpreted to be covering the area from the navel to the knee. For women it is generally seen as covering everything except their face, hands and feet when in the presence of men they are not related or married to. However, there has been much debate within Islam as to whether this goes far enough. This has led to a distinction between the hijab (literally ""covering up"" in Arabic) and the niqab (meaning ""full veil""). Thehijabis typically a scarf that covers the hair and neck, whereas theniqabis a veil for the face that leaves the area around the eyes clear. It is worn with an accompanying headscarf or anabaya, a full-length robe, and sometimes with a separate transparent eye veil. Theburkais the most concealing - covering the entire face and body, leaving just a mesh screen to see through. This video can not be played Four Muslim women discuss their relationship with the veil UK mother-of-seven Tahira Noor, who has been wearing a burka for 20 years, says it's ""100% my choice"" and Mr Johnson's comments show a ""lack of knowledge"". The ""majority of the women who wear the burka"" she says, are born and brought up in Britain. They are ""educated in this country, they've been to colleges, universities, and have understood why they want to do what they're doing,""she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""They're under no oppression, they're not doing it because their husbands want them to or their fathers want them to."" Ms Noor has four daughters none of whom wear a burka. ""I haven't forced my daughters into it because I don't have to,"" she said. ""It's not a must. It's not an obligation. However... [it] gets you closer to God. It's a spiritual thing more than anything else."" She is ""not under an obligation"" to cover her face but does so because it is ""emulating"" the Prophet Muhammad. So, how does she respond if asked to remove her covering for security reasons? ""I'm happy to take my veil off,"" she said, citing the example of being asked to at a bank. ""When I travel, and I do travel, sometimes I don't even wear [it] because I think it's a lot easier not to [for] security reasons. ""To make comments that they (women who wear burkas) look like bank robbers, I don't think it's fair."" Sahar Al-Faifi said she has experienced verbal abuse for wearing a niqab Sahar Al-Faifi, from Cardiff, wears the niqab but told BBC News she sometimes gets verbal abuse from others for her choice of veil. ""A week ago someone abused me and said 'you're an ugly terrorist' when I tried to park my car near where I live,"" she said. ""Two years ago, when I was passing by one department to another at Heath Hospital, someone passed by and said 'don't cut off my head you're ISIS'. It's quite painful [to hear]."" In 2014, BBC News' Shaimaa Khalil wrote about why shestopped wearing her headscarf, only to put it back on againwhen she became the Pakistan correspondent. Dr Qanta Ahmed, a British-American Muslim doctor who lives in New York, does not wear a face veil and supports a ban on them. She said the number of women wearing them in the West is increasing in part because girls begin to wear them before they reach puberty and many were not given a choice. The burka completely covers a woman's body Muslim scholars have long debated whether it is obligatory to wear the burka or niqab, or whether it is just recommended. There have also been more liberal interpretations which say any headscarf is unnecessary, as long as women maintain the sartorial modesty stipulated in the Koran. That holy text addresses ""the faithful women"" who are told to shield their private parts and not to display their adornment ""except what is apparent of it"". Scholarly disputes revolve around what this last phrase means. Does it refer to the outer surface of a woman's garments, necessitating that she cover every part of her body - ie don the full niqab? Or does it give an exemption referring to the face and the hands, as well as conventional female ornaments such as kohl, rings, bracelets and make-up? The latter interpretation has been adopted by some of the most prominent scholars from Islamic history who favour the hijab - headscarf - option. There are additional Koranic instructions - seen as ambiguous and therefore much debated - for women to draw the ""khimar"" (scarf) to cover the ""jayb"" (bosom/upper chest), and for ""the wives and daughters of the Prophet and the women of the believers to draw their ""jalabib"" (cloaks) close round them"". Two women wearing niqabs leave a polling station in Luton When contacted by BBC Reality Check, both the Women's Muslim Council and Faith Matters (an organisation which promotes integration) said accurate numbers weren't available for the UK. But there does seem to be consensus that the figure is likely to be low. Dr Omar Khan, director at the Runnymede Trust, a think tank that deals with race equality, said that it is likely to be ""less than 1% [of the Muslim female population] - how much less is difficult to know"". Sunder Katwala, director of think tank British Future,acknowledged a lack of a ""robust methodology"",external, but said there was a ""ballpark estimate in region of 3,000-5,000"" with it ""very unlikely to be as high as 1-2%"" of the female Muslim population. These are both estimates by experts working in relevant fields, but until specific research is carried out, it will be difficult to know how prevalent the full-face veil is. What we do know is that in the 2011 census, Muslims represented 4.8% of the population of England and Wales. Using the most recent population estimates, this would mean there are roughly 1.43 million Muslim women living in the two nations. If the number of Muslim women wearing the niqab were to be as high as 1% - this would equate to just over 14,000 women - but, again, the 1% figure is just an estimate. In other European countries, the figure also appears to be low. Denmark woman fined for wearing veil In 2009, a French Interior Ministry report estimated that just 0.1% of French Muslim women wore full-face veils which, at the time, equated to 1,900 women. In Austria, a ban of full face veils in public spaces was said to affect just 0.03% of the Muslim population, according to Nilufar Ahmed, asenior lecturer in public health,externalat Swansea University. In Belgium between 150 and 200 women wore the niqab before a ban came into force, says Michael Privot, director of the European Network Against Racism. Between 150 and 200 women in Demark - which banned face veils in public this month - wore a niqab or burqa on a daily basis. That's 0.1% ofMuslim women,externalin the country, according to the Guardian. Women in Denmark protested against the country's new law that says ""anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine"" WhileBoris Johnson's comments,externalabout Islamic face veils have provoked consternation among some, his defenders have said they were made as part of an argument against banning such garments. Other countries though, have taken this step. Francewas the first European country to ban full-face veils - ie burkas and niqabs - in public places in April 2011, seven years after it introduced a law prohibiting conspicuous religious symbols in state schools. It was followed a few months later byBelgium, which banned the wearing of partial or total face veils in public on the grounds of security. Full or partial bans on full-face veils have since been in place inAustria,Bulgaria, the southern German state ofBavariaand, since 1 August,Denmark. There have been protests against Denmark's new law, which does not mention burkas and niqabs by name, but says ""anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine"". Repeat offenders could be fined 10,000 ($1,500; Â£1,200) kroner. The Islamic veil across Europe Iran jails woman for removing headscarf Iranian women threw off the hijab - then what? By contrast, inIranthe law requires women to wear modest ""Islamic"" clothing. In practice, this means women must wear a chador, a full-body cloak, or a headscarf and a manteau (overcoat) that covers their arms. There are posters in cities and towns comparing unveiled women to unwrapped candy and lollipops attracting unwanted attention from flies. Recently, some Iranian women have protested against this law by taking off their headscarf in public. One woman was jailed for two years in March for doing this.

"HIV self-testing kits are now available to buy on the High Street for the first time, a retailer has announced. Superdrug said it is now selling the BioSURE test, which provides a result in 15 minutes, in all of its 200 pharmacy stores in the UK for Â£33.95. It had previously been available to buy online afterbecoming the first legally approved self-testing kit in 2015. An HIV charity welcomed the announcement but added that many people would be unable to afford the test. However, free testing is available on the NHS. 'Dangerous complacency' to HIV epidemic HIV vaccine shows promise in human trial The BioSURE test requires a small amount of blood from a finger prick sample to detect the presence of HIV antibodies. Making it more widely available will help reduce a person's waiting time between taking the test and their result, and could increase early diagnosis, Superdrug said. Experts say that while these home-testing kits are highly accurate, positive results must be confirmed at clinics. Improvement in treatments for HIV have made the disease more manageable, but late diagnosis can have a devastating impact on health and life expectancy. In May, the Terrence Higgins Trust launched a six-month programme to enable people in high-risk groups to order free HIV self-testing kits. The charity has estimated that there are 10,400 people in the UK who do not know that they are living with HIV. This means they are not on effective medication and could unknowingly be passing on the virus. Marc Thompson, health improvement lead at the charity, said: ""Around one in eight people living with HIV in the UK remain undiagnosed, which is why we strongly welcome anything that increases access to and awareness of HIV testing. ""But not everyone can afford to buy a kit, and it's important to make clear that you can test for free at any sexual health clinic. ""We're also offering free self-test kits for communities most affected by HIV in the UK."" Free testing for HIV is usually offered by sexual health clinics, some GP surgeries, drug dependency services and charities like the Terrence Higgins Trust, as well as when women are pregnant.

A statement was issued by six members of the electric carmaker's board after Mr Musk tweeted to say he had the funding to de-list the company. The board had ""met several times over the last week"" to discuss going private, the statement said. They said this ""included discussion as to how being private could better serve Tesla's long-term interests"". Mr Musk said in his tweet on Tuesday that shareholders would be offered $420 (Â£326) per share, valuing the business at more than $70bn. This would make it the biggest deal of its kind, surpassing the purchase of utility TXU Corp in 2007 for $44bn by a consortium. The brief statement by six of the nine board directors said Mr Musk had ""opened a discussion"" about taking the company private last week. The discussions ""addressed the funding for this to occur"", the six directors added. They did not include Mr Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk, and Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist. The board statement came amid questions about how Mr Musk opted to disclose the possible de-listing to investors. While companies are allowed to make announcements via social media, typically they also make a simultaneous regulatory filing, said Andrew M Calamari, a partner at the law firm Finn Dixon & Herling and former director of the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US market regulator. ""Just in terms of the style of this, it strikes me as very irregular,"" Mr Calamari said. ""It also raises questions about his intent,"" he added. ""Was he in earnest in what he's saying, or does he have some other motive"" like influencing the stock price. Tesla shares reached a peak of $368 after Mr Musk's tweets on Tuesday, before trading on the stock market was halted. Trades resumed later that afternoon, after the company published an email from Mr Musk to employees elaborating on the plans. Tesla shares surged close to their all-time high of $385, which they touched almost a year ago, but fluctuated on Wednesday after the board members issued their statement. In the staff memo,external, Mr Musk explained why he wanted to take the company private. ""As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders,"" he wrote. ""Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long term,"" he wrote. He added that the company was ""the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market"" - a trading strategy which assumes share prices will fall - so ""being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company"". Those traders are likely to have lost money when the share price rose on the announcement about a delisting. Mr Musk already owns 20% of the company. He said his intention in taking the company private was not to increase his personal holding and his plan would give existing investors the option to retain their shares. Regulators are likely to be interested in what evidence exists - such as agreements with investors or banks - for Mr Musk's claim that funding was ""secured"", Mr Calamari said. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the US market regulator, has inquired about the issue,the Wall Street Journal reported,external. The structure of the deal also remains ambiguous, said Adam C Pritchard, professor of securities law at the University of Michigan. If more than 2,000 investors opt to retain their shares, then the firm would be subject to the disclosure rules of a public company, he added. ""Intuitively it doesn't make sense because it would still be a public entity, and the public entity status is what is apparently objectionable to Musk,"" Mr Pritchard said. Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity, said it would be difficult for Mr Musk to raise the necessary finance when Tesla has still not made a profit. ""The company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?"" he said.

"This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge paid tribute to ""the fallen of all nations"" The Duke of Cambridge and the prime minister have attended commemorations in northern France to mark the centenary of the Battle of Amiens - the beginning of the end of World War One. Prince William and Theresa May both paid tribute at a service at Amiens Cathedral. They also spoke to descendants of soldiers who fought in the battle. In a reading, the duke said he was ""delighted"" to mark the centenary in the ""historic cathedral"". He added the purpose of the service was to ""honour the fallen of all nations"" involved in the war. In her message printed in the official programme, Mrs May paid tribute to the ""courage, bravery and skill"" of troops who fought at Amiens. She added it was important to ""reflect on the fear and hardship experienced by the people of this city and the surrounding battlefields"". William and Kate remember WW1 battle Princes pay tribute to fallen soldiers Somme fallen honoured 100 years on At Wednesday's service, the story of the battle was told through contemporary letters, diaries and poems read by guests from the 2,000-strong congregation. The British-commanded Fourth Army was involved in the battle, heralding the start of the Hundred Days offensive. General Sir Henry Rawlinson had learnt the lessons of the bloodySomme offensiveand employed improved tactics and new equipment. The prime minister arrives at the cathedral in Amiens, France, ahead of her reading The Royal Anglian Regiment formed a guard of honour outside the cathedral More than 500 UK tanks were deployed, alongside 1,900 British and French aircraft, and more than 2,000 guns from the Royal Artillery. A string of military victories by combined air and land forces from Britain, Australia, Canada, France, and the US followed, leading to the surrender of German forces and the end of the conflict on 11 November 1918. Armed Forces Minister Mark Lancaster and Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter also attended the service. Gen Carter said the Battle of Amiens was a ""remarkable achievement... moulding a new citizen-based force into a very accomplished fighting force, against a backdrop of rapid technological change"". French Foreign Legion officers with their dogs in Amiens Forces from Britain, Australia, Canada, France and the US were involved in the Battle of Amiens Kevin Sherlock, 58, a retired Rolls-Royce engine inspector from Derby, said his 19-year-old great uncle Ernest Harm, who was killed towards the end of the battle, ""paid the ultimate sacrifice"", helping to bring peace to Europe. He said the teenage soldier, also from Derby, was killed, possibly by machine gun fire, going ""over the top"" on 11 August 1918. Mr Sherlock added: ""I think as I've got older I've thought about it more really, he was only 19, just a lad really, never experienced anything in his life. ""So there's sadness but also pride that he took part in a key battle that brought ultimately the Allied victory and no doubt about it, shortened the war as well.""

"This video can not be played Senior Conservative Muslim peer Lord Sheikh calls on party to take whip away from Johnson Boris Johnson should be kicked out of the Conservative Party for his remarks about the burka, a Muslim peer says. Conservative Muslim Forum founder Lord Sheikh told Newsnight demands from the PM for an apology were not enough. He has called for Mr Johnson to have the whip removed - meaning the MP would no longer represent the Tory party. Mr Johnson said Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"" and compared them to ""bank robbers"". A source said he stood by the comments. Conservative peer Baroness Warsi - the first Muslim woman to sit in a British cabinet - said comments like Mr Johnson's could lead to a rise in hate crime in the UK. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said there was no reason not to have a ""robust conversation"", but added: ""We're not talking to our friends in the pub, we are public figures and we have an additional obligation to be careful."" Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour it was right to have a debate on the issue but that Mr Johnson should say sorry for the ""language that he used"". And a former Tory chairman, Lord Pickles, said Mr Johnson, who was foreign secretary until resigning last month over Brexit, risked ""closing down"" the debate with his ""illiberal language"". He said that if someone made a complaint to the party, an independent panel would look into it, but it was ""pretty much inconceivable"" that the former foreign secretary would face disciplinary action. A source close to Mr Johnson has said: ""We must not fall into the trap of shutting down the debate on difficult issues. ""We have to call it out. If we fail to speak up for liberal values then we are simply yielding ground to reactionaries and extremists."" Johnson burka 'letter box' jibe sparks anger What's the difference between a hijab, niqab and burka? The Islamic veil across Europe In his Daily Telegraph article, Mr Johnson said full-face veils should not be banned but that it was ""absolutely ridiculous"" women chose to ""go around looking like letter boxes"". Theresa May has backed calls for an apology. The prime minister said the remarks had ""clearly caused offence"". Lord Sheikh, a former adviser to David Cameron, said: ""Take the whip from him. Why not? He's not a super human being, he's a member of the party. The party chairman, the prime minister has the right to take the whip. ""It's not out of order and that's the thing I'd like to see."" A source close to Mr Johnson said the MP ""won't be apologising"" Mr Johnson, who is a former mayor of London and the current MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, has long been seen as a potential candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party. He fronted the successful Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, and resigned as foreign secretary last month in protest at Theresa May's Brexit plans. His comments have seen him accused of using the issue of Muslim women's veils as a ""political football"" to further his leadership ambitions. This video can not be played Boris Johnson 'has caused offence', PM says Writing in the Guardian,external, Baroness Warsi said Mr Johnson's remarks were ""indefensible"" and ""have no place in the modern Conservative Party"". She said although he was setting out a liberal position on the burka, he was doing it in an ""alt-right"" way, and using Muslim women as ""political fodderâ¦ to stake out a leadership bid"". ""Johnson's wordsâ¦ send out a message that Muslim women are fair game,"" she wrote. ""What starts as useful targets for 'colourful political language' and the odd bit of toxic campaigning ends up in attacks on our streets. ""As much as Johnson thinks he's being his usual clever self, he's helping to create an environment in which hate crime is more likely."" Baroness Warsi was the first Muslim woman to sit in a British cabinet Lord Pickles toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think the very sensible thing would be for him to apologise. ""If he is wanting to open up and defend liberal values, then the sensible thing is not to use illiberal language."" Speaking to BBC News later, he said the party was ""far away"" from removing the whip from Mr Johnson, but he said the MP was getting more ""slack"" than other party members might. ""If this was a councillor from Scunthorpe or Middlesbrough, I am not entirely sure he would have been given the amount of slack, and in truth he wouldn't have been given the amount of attention that Boris has got,"" he added. But Mr Johnson's former adviser Munira Mirza said his views on the burka had been ""entirely consistent"" and other Conservative politicians had expressed the same view, without being called Islamophobic. ""The reality is there is a political fight here,"" she said. ""People who frankly couldn't care less about the issues that Muslim women face are piling into Boris because Boris said it."" By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani Last year,Zaynab Hussein, a mother from Leicester, was left fighting for her lifeafter a man she didn't know smashed into her with his car - and then ran over her again. She was attacked because she was a Muslim. Tell Mama, the national organisation that collects anti-Muslim attack statistics, says that the majority of street victims of such abuse and violence are women, for the same reason that Mrs Hussein was singled out: some Muslim women are easily identifiable by their mode of dress - and therefore easy to target. Seven years ago Baroness Warsi said prejudice against Muslims had passed the ""dinner table test"". And Mr Johnson's critics regard his ""letter box"" and ""bank robber"" comments as part of the problem the peer defined: normalising prejudice and dehumanising women, rather than calmly debating the complexities of the veil in an open society. Since Baroness Warsi's warning, there has been the launch of a cross-departmental working group to tackle anti-Muslim hate. But it has been criticised as toothless, not least because the government can't agree a definition for Islamophobia. In his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson - who last month quit the government in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit policy - was commenting on the introduction of a burka ban in Denmark. He said he felt ""fully entitled"" to expect women to remove face coverings when talking to him at his MP surgery - and schools and universities should be able to take the same approach if a student ""turns up... looking like a bank robber"". ""If you tell me that the burka is oppressive, then I am with you,"" he said. ""If you say that it is weird and bullying to expect women to cover their faces, then I totally agree - and I would add that I can find no scriptural authority for the practice in the Koran. ""I would go further and say that it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes."" He said businesses and government agencies should be able to ""enforce a dress code"" that allowed them to see customers' faces. Boris Johnson said he did not think face coverings should be banned but said the burka was ""oppressive"" But he said: ""Such restrictions are not quite the same as telling a free-born adult woman what she may or may not wear, in a public place, when she is simply minding her own business."" He said a total ban on face-covering veils would give a boost to radicals who said there was a ""clash of civilisations"" between Islam and the West, and could lead to ""a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation"".

"Boris Johnson said he did not want to see full-face coverings banned, but said it was ""ridiculous"" women chose to wear them Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is facing growing criticism over his remark that Muslim women wearing the burka ""look like letter boxes"". Dominic Grieve, the ex-attorney general, said he would quit the party if Mr Johnson became leader. Ex-Tory chairwoman Baroness Warsi said Mr Johnson's remarks could trigger a rise in hate crime.

This video can not be played ""There's no reason to insult people in that way,"" one woman told the BBC's Asian Network The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, has also backed calls for an apology over what she called ""gratuitously offensive"" comments. Speaking at an event in North Berwick, East Lothian, she said: ""This wasn't an off-the-cuff slip, he wrote a column, he knew exactly what he was doing and I think it crossed from being provocative and starting a debate and actually it became rude and gratuitous.

A former Tory chairman, Lord Pickles, said Mr Johnson, who was foreign secretary until resigning last month over Brexit, risked ""closing down"" the debate with his ""illiberal language"". Supporters of Mr Johnson say the row is politically-motivated and that other senior Tories have made similar remarks without such criticism. By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent By saying what he did, in the way he said it, Boris Johnson was guaranteed to provoke a reaction. The question of what Muslim women choose to wear in public is a sensitive one, around which most politicians tread very carefully. But Boris Johnson is not most politicians. And by using language you rarely hear in the normal course of political debate, the former foreign secretary has attracted attention and criticism. If it was his intention to remind everyone that Boris is still Boris, not afraid to say what he thinks, despite being out of government and away on holiday, it was not without risk. Figures show a rise in Islamophobic attacks and the Conservative party faces criticism for not addressing anti-Muslim prejudice in its own ranks. In this context, many feel he has picked the wrong time to tackle the wrong issue. But as ever, being outspoken is at once appealing to Boris Johnson's supporters and distasteful to his detractors. Mr Johnson, who is the current MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, has long been seen as a potential candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party. He fronted the successful Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, and resigned as foreign secretary last month in protest at Theresa May's Brexit plans.

Baroness Warsi was the first Muslim woman to sit in a British cabinet But mother-of-seven Tahira Noor, who has been wearing a burka for 20 years, said it was ""100% my choice"" and Mr Johnson's comments showed a ""lack of knowledge"". Shetold BBC Radio 5 Live: ""In today's day and age, the majority of the women who wear the burka are born and brought up in this country, are educated in this country, they've been to colleges, universities, and have understood why they want to do what they're doing. ""They're under no oppression, they're not doing it because their husbands want them to or their fathers want them to."" Ms Noor has four daughters and none of them wears a burka, adding: ""It's not a must, it's not an obligation."" Sahar Al-Faifi, from Cardiff, who wears the niqab, told BBC News: ""I absolutely have no problem with anyone disagreeing with my choice to wear it and criticising it. ""But when you demonise and dehumanise a minority, who happen to be women of colour, I have a problem with this. ""It's not for the state, it's not for the government and it's definitely not for middle-aged white men to tell me what to wear and what not to.""

Mr Johnson's former adviser Munira Mirza said Mr Johnson's views on the burka had been ""entirely consistent"" and other Conservative politicians had expressed the same view, without being called Islamophobic. In 2013 former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke - who also opposed a ban on the public wearing of burkas - said they should not be worn while giving evidence in court. He referred to burkas as a ""peculiar costume"" and a ""kind of bag"". Ms Mirza added: ""The reality is there is a political fight here. People who frankly couldn't care less about the issues that Muslim women face are piling into Boris because Boris said it."" Conservative MP Conor Burns also defended Mr Johnson, accusing his political colleagues of ""bandwagon jumping"".

"Food giants KFC and Kellogg's have been told to remove adverts which promoted junk food to children, by the UK's advertising watchdog. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says they broke strict rules on advertising high fat, sugar or salt products to children. The ASA found Kellogg's promoted a Coco Pops product during a Mr Bean cartoon, likely to have been seen by children. It also ruled KFC advertised a Mars product on a phone box by a school. First ads banned under new junk food rules Children 'bombarded by junk food' ads Will new child obesity measures make life easier? KFC said the appearance of the ad close to a school was a simple human error and it had taken the advert down promptly, once it had been alerted. And Kellogg's said it was disappointed with the decision as it had only meant to promote the healthier Coco Pops Granola product, rather than the original version. Members of the public complained to the ASA, triggering the investigations. The ASA was alerted to a poster ad for KFC's Mars Krushems drink which was seen on a phone box outside a school. Because it was displayed close to the entrance to a primary school, children under the age of 16 made up a much higher proportion of the ad's audience. Advertising for children is allowed in general - think of ads for toys and games - but theASA says there are factors,externalthat must be considered. Adverts must not: Suggest a child would be unpopular if they do not own a particular product Make a direct appeal to a child to get a product Encourage children to make a nuisance of themselves unless they get bought a product Cause confusion between real-life and imagination Harm a child's physical or mental health or encourage them to put themselves in harm's way, for example showing children in a dangerous situation (unless the ad is a safety warning) Advertise high salt, fat or sugar foods to children The ASA considered it was highly likely those younger children comprised significantly more than 25% of the audience of the ad, and that it therefore broke the rules. The Coco Pops Granola ad appeared between episodes of the Mr Bean cartoon, during a section of programming specifically directed at children under 16. The ASA said that, although Coco Pops Granola was not a high fat, sugar or salt product, because the Coco Pops branding was synonymous with Coco Pops original cereal and with the Coco Pops range, it concluded the ad had effectively promoted the range. Two other ads by McDonald's, which had also been complained about, were deemed not to have broken rules. Jess Tye from the ASA said, ""obviously advertising has an effect"" otherwise companies ""wouldn't be bothering with adverts"". She said: ""We do know that ads play a small part in food preferences for children and it's really important that we act as a regulator to make sure that advertisers are being really responsible in the way that they are promoting these products."" Steven Woodford, chief executive of the Advertising Association which represents the advertising industry, said the KFC breach had been ""inadvertent"". He said: ""Rules are there to protect children. ""That's what the industry is trying to do."" Should rules on Instagram ads be tougher?

"This video can not be played Ben Stokes trial: CCTV footage of fight England cricketer Ben Stokes was the ""main aggressor"" in a fight outside a nightclub, a court has heard. The Durham all-rounder is one of three men accused of fighting in Bristol on 25 September. Bristol Crown Court previously heard Ryan Ali, 28, and Ryan Hale, 27, were knocked unconscious by 27-year-old Mr Stokes, who denies affray. Mr Ali and Mr Hale have also pleaded not guilty to affray and are on trial alongside the cricketer. Witness Mark Spure, an off-duty police community support officer (PCSO), said that after he left Mbargo nightclub he spotted ""three to five"" people involved in a ""scuffle"" on a nearby street. In a statement, Mr Spure said he had tried to separate Mr Stokes and Mr Ali, with the others continuing to row behind him. ""The individual seemed to be the main aggressor or was progressing forward trying to get to another individual,"" he told the court. ""In my statement I describe him as a gentleman with ginger or light brown hair. He had a green T-shirt on."" Police released these photographs of Mr Stokes and Mr Ali after they were shown to the jury Mr Ali ""seemed to be trying to back away or get away from the situation"" before he was punched by Mr Stokes, he added. Mr Spure told the court he had tried to move Mr Ali out of the road, as there were passing cars, but he was ""completely unable to move"". The jury heard he then identified Mr Stokes to police officers, who arrested the cricketer. Mr Stokes first hit Mr Hale, knocking him to the ground, before rendering Mr Ali unconscious in the punch seen by the PCSO, jurors have been told. Mr Ali is alleged to have threatened Mr Stokes' England teammate Alex Hales with a bottle during the altercation, while it is claimed Mr Hale broke off a metal pole from a nearby road sign after being allegedly knocked out by Mr Stokes. The jury heard Mr Ali had suffered a fractured left eye socket, a cracked tooth and cuts and bruises, while Mr Hale suffered bruising and a cut to his forehead. Footage from a body camera worn by PC Stacey Alway, who arrested Mr Stokes, was shown to the jury. She told the court the cricketer had been ""squaring up"" to a group of men at the side of the road as she approached them. ""I didn't know who these males were because I was unable to identify them,"" PC Alway said. ""From the moment I approached [Mr Stokes] he calmed down and he was completely compliant with me."" The court heard that when PC Alway said to Mr Stokes ""a guy over there was covered in blood and I've been told you punched him"", he replied ""because he was abusing my two friends for being gay"". Mr Hale suffered bruising and a cut to his forehead, the court was told Nottinghamshire batsman Mr Hales told PC Alway he had not seen the alleged fight, the court was told. ""I came after you guys turned up,"" he told her. After Mr Stokes had been put in a police car and PC Alway told Mr Hales to leave, he replied: ""I feel bad. He's my best friend. I saw him after everything happened."" In a statement Mr Stokes gave to police after he had been arrested, he said he had acted in self-defence when he punched Mr Ali and Mr Hale, after seeing them verbally abuse two gay men, Kai Barry and William O'Connor. ""These men were speaking to the gay guys in what I would call a harsh and abusive way,"" the statement said. ""It was homophobic in nature. It wasn't at all like banter. Ben Stokes denies affray and is on trial at Bristol Crown Court ""I took exception and said 'leave it out'."" Mr Stokes told police Mr Ali approached him while holding a bottle and he believed he was going to be assaulted. He said the pair ""scuffled"" before Mr Hale grabbed and pulled him. ""I felt the need to defend myself. I felt I was going to be attacked. ""I didn't feel I had an option to leave in the heat of the situation."" Mr Ali (left) and Mr Hale have both pleaded not guilty to affray In a second statement given to police, Mr Stokes said he did not mimic Mr Barry and Mr O'Connor and had not flicked a cigarette butt at them. He told detectives he witnessed Mr Ali and Mr Hale verbally abusing the two gay men. When Mr Ali was interviewed by police, he denied saying anything homophobic to Mr O'Connor or Mr Barry. ""No, I wouldn't do that, no,"" he said. Mr Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham; Mr Ali, of Bristol; and Mr Hale, of Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, all deny a joint charge of affray. The trial continues.

"Samantha Eastwood's family has thanked members of the public for their support Midwife Samantha Eastwood was found in a shallow grave, wrapped in a duvet cover and with tape around her eyes and face, a court has heard. The 28-year-old's body was found in Caverswall, Staffordshire, on Saturday, eight days after she was reported missing. Pathologists found no gunshot or knife wounds during initial tests on her remains, Stafford Crown Court heard. Michael Stirling, 32, is accused of Ms Eastwood's murder. The defendant, of Gratton Road, Bucknall, appeared at court via videolink, and was remanded in custody until his next hearing on 5 October. Midlands Live: Man seriously injured in microlight crash; Force u-turn over 'fake' police car Mr Stirling is the brother-in-law of Ms Eastwood's ex-fiance, John Peake, and is accused of killing her between 26 July and 5 August at Baddeley Green, Stoke-on-Trent. Jonas Hankin QC, prosecuting, told the court the investigation into her death was ""complex"" and meant a provisional trial date set for February 2019 was unlikely to remain in place. A preliminary post-mortem examination did not reveal any gunshot, stab or penetrating wounds, and further analysis of neck bones would be conducted, Judge Michael Challinor QC was also told. Michael Stirling leaves North Staffordshire Justice Centre on Monday CCTV footage, telephone evidence and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) data are also set to form part of the evidence at trial. Defence barrister Samina Rasid made no application for bail and Mr Stirling was not required to enter any plea. Two men, aged 60 and 28, arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender have been released on conditional bail. Ms Eastwood, of Stockton Brook in Stoke-on-Trent, was last seen in uniform leaving work at Royal Stoke University Hospital on the morning of 27 July. Earlier this week, Staffordshire Police said a post-mortem examination had taken place but further tests were required. Tributes to the midwife have been left outside Royal Stoke University Hospital More than Â£10,000 has now been collected on a fundraising page set up to help Ms Eastwood's family with funeral costs. It surpassed its target 24 hours after being launched and continued to gather donations from the many people touched by her death. An event has also been set up onFacebook,externalencouraging people from the medical profession, or the wider public, to light a candle in her memory on Friday.

"L-R Democrat Sharice Davids, Republican Susan Hutchison and Democrat Rashida Tlaib, who is almost certain to be the first Muslim woman in Congress More women candidates than ever will contest US governorships and House seats in November's mid-term elections. After Tuesday's primaries across four states, there are now 11 female nominees for governor and at least 185 for the House of Representatives. The results were hailed as a continuing success story by activists for women in politics. There was also a key election for a House seat in Ohio, in which President Donald Trump claimed victory. But US media said the race was still too close to call, in a safe Republican seat held by them since 1983. The outcome could indicate whether Democrats have a chance to overturn the Republican majority in the House in November. What election results mean for Trump Kris Kobach: Trump's political apprentice After polling closed in the four states holding primaries on Tuesday - Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington - it became clear women had broken records for gubernatorial and House nominations. Victories for Gretchen Whitmer (Michigan) and Laura Kelly (Kansas) in Democratic primaries mean 11 women will contest governorships in November - one more than the previous 1994 record.

At least 182 female major party nominees will run for the House, beating the record of 167 from 2016. Another three women are leading in close primary contests. Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP) said: ""This has been an election season of records for women candidates, and tonight continues that story."" This video can not be played The ""Pink Wave"": How women are shaping the 2018 US elections Ms Whitmer will in fact lead a four-strong, all-women ticket for the Democrats at state level in Michigan. In Kansas, 38-year-old Sharice Davids - a gay ex-mixed martial arts fighter - won her primary and could become the first Native-American woman elected to Congress. Ms Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, was raised by a single mother who worked as a drill sergeant in the US Army. Her campaign ran adverts showing her hitting a punching bag.

Another Native-American woman, Democrat Deb Haaland of New Mexico, became a congressional nominee in June. And one of the candidates for the House in the state is all but certain to become the first Muslim woman in Congress. Rashida Tlaib won a Democratic nomination and will not be opposed by the Republicans in November. She will also be the first Palestinian-American congresswoman. This video can not be played The US state about to finally elect a woman There will be two all-female races in Washington state. Democrat Lisa Brown faces Cathy McMorris Rodgers for a House seat, while Republican Susan Hutchison will take on incumbent Senator Maria Cantwell. Democratic women could outnumber their white male colleagues in the House after November, a recent study suggested. First black female nominee for governor US mid-terms: Can we tell now if Democrats will win? Republican candidate Troy Balderson has been taking on Democrat Danny O'Connor for a seat in the House of Representatives. Ohio is one of the key battleground states in the mid-terms. Mr Trump tweeted ""Congratulations to Troy Balderson on a great win in Ohio. A very special and important race!"" Despite this, US news outlets have not called the contest yet.The New York Times gave Mr Balderson 50.2%,external, a lead of 1,754 votes in the 12th Congressional District race, with all precincts reporting. But thousands of absentee and provisional ballots are still outstanding, which could lead Mr O'Connor to force a recount. He said: ""We're not stopping now."" A provisional ballot is used to record a vote when there are questions about a voter's eligibility. Absentee ballots are cast by those unable to attend polling stations. Donald Trump travelled to Ohio to support Troy Balderson Democrat House representative Ben Ray LujÃ¡n said the seat should have been a ""slam dunk"" for the Republicans and the closeness of the contest was an ""ominous sign"" for them in November. Mr Trump won the 12th Congressional District in 2016 by more than 11 percentage points. Mr Balderson and Mr O'Connor will have to fight the seat again in November. It appears Donald Trump has had success in getting the candidates he endorsed nominated. The battle for the soul of the Democratic Party Why US mid-term elections matter They include John James, an African-American Republican, who won the Senate race nomination in Michigan, and key ally Bill Schuette, who will take on Ms Whitmer for governor in the same state.

The Kansas gubernatorial election has been rancorous for Republicans. Mr Trump's controversial endorsement of the hard-right Kris Kobach over incumbent Jeff Colyer may have just about paid off. Mr Kobach holds a lead of just under 200 votes with all precincts reporting, but again provisional and other ballots are still outstanding. And one interesting sidebar: Ron Estes has beaten Ron Estes in a Kansas Republican primary. The victorious incumbent congressman had to fund a campaign to spell out which candidate was which. The beaten candidate was Ron M Estes - his opponent said the M stood for misleading. The beaten man's campaign was described by some analysts as ""not serious"". The winning Ron Estes took about 80% of the vote and will face Democrat James Thompson, a supporter of Bernie Sanders in November. All 435 House seats, 35 of the 100 Senate seats and 36 of 50 governor races are to be fought. This video can not be played Why are US election campaigns never-ending? Ask America has the answer The Democrats need to pick up 23 seats in the House to gain a majority. With dozens of Republican lawmakers retiring this year, the minority party has a decent chance of taking over the House. The place that tells you everything about US politics In the Senate they need just two seats to take control. But the Republicans are tipped to retain their majority and perhaps even consolidate it.

"Mr Paisley could lose his seat and face a by-election if 10% of voters in North Antrim sign the petition A petition that could force a by-election in North Antrim and unseat the current MP Ian Paisley has opened. In July, MPsvoted to suspend Mr Paisley for 30 sitting daysfor failing to declare two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government and lobbying on its behalf at Westminster - triggering the recall procedure. The DUP MP apologised in the Commons, but will face a by-election if 10% of his constituents sign the petition. The recall petition is the first in UK parliamentary history. Profile: DUP MP Ian Paisley Timeline: Ian Paisley suspension Three centres selected for Paisley petition Paisley apologises over rule breach This is a fairly recent addition to politics, becoming law underthe Recall of MPs Act which came into effect in 2016. It states that MPs who are convicted of a criminal offence and jailed, convicted of providing false information on allowance claims or barred from the House of Commons for 10 sitting days or longer can lose their seat if there is a successful petition to recall them. The petition is open for signing for six weeks from 8 August to 19 September Last month, Mr Paisley received a ban from Westminster of 30 sitting days for breaching parliamentary rules, beginning on 4 September, which triggered the recall procedure. According to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland (EONI), the number of people entitled to sign the petition (ie eligible registered voters) is 75,478. The Recall of MPs Act 2015 says a petition needs 10% of that number in order to trigger a by-election, therefore 7,543 signatures are required. It would have been 7,547 but last week the Electoral Office said the figure was 7,543 - due to a ""sweep"" of the register removing deceased voters and others who were not eligible. The petition is open for signing for six weeks from 8 August to 19 September from 09:00-17:00 BST, Monday to Friday. Opening hours at the designated centres will be extended to 21:00 on 6 and 13 September. Letters have already been sent to constituents informing them about the details of the petition. Anyone wanting to sign it must live in the North Antrim constituency and be 18 years old, or have their 18th birthday before the end of the signing period on 19 September. But just like in any normal election, anyone wanting to sign it must also be registered to vote in parliamentary elections. The Electoral Office selected three designated venues which are located at: Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre, Ballymoney Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Ballymena Sheskburn House Recreation Centre, Ballycastle The petition can be signed at three centres Legislation allows for up to 10 locations for the petition but the electoral office has opened three,a decision which drew criticismfrom some political parties. Voters can also apply to sign by post or proxy. Applications for those must be returned to the Electoral Office by 4 September. The chief electoral officer, Virginia McVea, said there had been a change in the law in relation to the postal application so anyone who chooses not to attend in person will be able to apply for the postal option and if their details are verified, can receive it within six weeks. Applications can be downloaded at eoni.org.uk. There are two help lines for constituents who have queries about the process. They are 02890446600 and 02890446668. No. The Electoral Office has sought to reassure people that this will not happen. In normal elections, what is known as a ""marked register"" is made available to the political parties afterwards. This way, they can tell who has turned out to vote and that helps inform their campaigning for the future without giving away any information about an individual voter's particular preferences. But the recall petition is different in as much as it is fairly obvious that if someone has turned out, it is because they think Ian Paisley should face a by-election. With that in mind, the Chief Electoral Officer Virginia McVea has said the marked register for this recall petition will not be made available for inspection, and that maintaining the secrecy of the ballot is of ""paramount importance"". The Electoral Office also said no figures will be released about the number of postal votes issued for the petition. If the number of signatures reaches or surpasses 7,543 it will trigger a by-election and Mr Paisley will lose his seat. There would be nothing to stop him from standing in the by-election, however, and he has already indicated that he would do so. He has been the MP for North Antrim since 2010.

"Turner, 64, is best known for her iconic voice, which gave life to the character of Jessica Rabbit in 1988 Hollywood actress Kathleen Turner, who found fame in 1980s films like Body Heat and Romancing the Stone, is being lauded online forgiving an open and frank interview to New York Magazine's Vulture about the industry and her career.,external Turner, known best for her iconic smoky voice, dished Hollywood dirt on everything from the cast of Friends, to Elizabeth Taylor's voice and Donald Trump's handshake in the wide-ranging interview. Here are six of the biggest talking points from the piece. Asked by journalist David Marchese what had driven her career aside from luck, Turner responded simply with ""rage"". Pushed further, the actress replied: ""I'm [expletive] angry, man"" about ""everything"" and ""injustice in the world"". The interviewer then presses her on whether this stems from her career being derailed by illness. ""I suppose there was a feeling of loss. Rheumatoid arthritis hit in my late 30s - the last of my years in which Hollywood would consider me a sexually appealing leading lady,"" she told the magazine. Turner became a breakthrough star in the erotic thriller Body Heat in 1981 ""The hardest part was that so much of my confidence was based on my physicality. If I didn't have that, who was I?"" She later takes aim at accusations she was ""difficult"" to work with on set. ""If a man comes on set and says, 'Here's how I see this being done,' people go 'He's decisive'. If a woman does it, they say, 'Oh [expletive], there she goes'."" She discusses resisting playing one type of role, saying actors have a choice between wanting audiences to like them and becoming skilled. Turner takes aim at one unnamed actress for playing the same role for 20 years. ""She even looks pretty much the same. She's probably one of the richest women out there, but I would shoot myself if I were like that, only giving people what they expect."" The internet has been trying to guess who she is talking about since the article was published. Which actress was Kathleen Turner dissing? Robert Redford's greatest roles Johnny Depp's Notorious B.I.G. film pulled In the interview she speaks angrily about feeling like a ""sexual target"" and a ""trophy"" after her early breakthrough roles. She says that she always felt insecure in Los Angeles, because of an ""unspoken assumption"" in Hollywood ""that women were property to be claimed"". She won the Golden Globe for best actress opposite Douglas in Romancing the Stone Turner says she learned that there had been a competition between actors Michael Douglas, Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty about ""who would get [her] first"". ""None of them did, by the by,"" she told Vulture. Hollywood star Elizabeth Taylor is one of several big names who come under fire from Turner in the interview. She criticises Taylor's performance in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? saying: ""I don't think she was very skilled."" Turner describes the actress' voice as ""awful"" and ""badly used"". She also takes aim at Nicolas Cage for his work alongside her on the set of Peggy Sue Got Married, released in 1986. ""He was very difficult on set. But the director allowed what Nicolas wanted to do with his role, so I wasn't in a position to do much except play with what I'd been given,"" she said. Turner said it was tough not to tell Cage to stop playing his part with an unusual voice ""If anything, it [Cage's portrayal] only further illustrated my character's disillusionment with the past. The way I saw it was, yeah, he was that [expletive]."" Asked to elaborate on whether she meant the comment toward Cage or his character, she responded: ""Listen, I made it work, honey."" She also said that working with Burt Reynolds in 1988 was ""terrible"" and his actions on set made her cry. ""His behaviour was shocking. It never occurred to me that I wasn't someone's equal. I left the room sobbing,"" she said. Turner also says she once slapped a male co-star in a theatre production who had bitten her, but doesn't reveal who. Turner, who guest starred as Chandler's father in hit US sitcom Friends, said she ""didn't feel very welcomed by the cast"" on set. Turner said none of the cast offered her a seat when she was struggling in a difficult outfit and high heels ""The Friends actors were such a clique - but I don't think my experience with them was unique,"" she said. ""I think it was simply that they were such a tight little group that nobody from the outside mattered."" Asked whether she ever bumped into Mr Trump in the 1980s, Turner responded: ""Yes. Yuck. He has this gross handshake."" She elaborated: ""He goes to shake your hand and with his index finger kind of rubs the inside of your wrist. He's trying to do some kind of seductive intimacy move. You pull your hand away and go yuck.""

"The film will expand on the multi-media presentation of Anna Meredith's Five Telegrams The BBC Proms is to enter virtual reality for the first time, with a production that puts viewers in the centre of the Royal Albert Hall. Five Telegrams captures a performance by the BBC Symphony Orchestra on the first night of this year's festival, mixed with cutting-edge spatial sound. Written by Anna Meredith, the piece is an exploration of the means of communication in World War One. It encompasses everything from news and propaganda to code-breaking efforts. The centrepiece is a seven-minute movement called Nothing To Be Written, inspired by the multiple-choice postcards sent home from the trenches. The pre-written cards allowed soldiers to choose one of three options: ""I am quite well"", ""I have been injured"" or ""I am in hospital."" They were allowed to sign their name and date it - but if they wrote anything else, the cards would be destroyed. Soldiers were permitted to choose one of three pre-written options The VR experience will put viewers in the shoes of the soldiers and their loved ones, contrasting the horror of the trenches with the quiet dread of their families as they waited for news to arrive. Meredith said she was ""totally delighted"" with the ""beautiful story-telling"" in the film, which was created by 59 Productions - best known as the video designers for the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony. ""To me it mirrors the music I wrote, by allowing you to experience the texture both at a distance or really zooming into the detail of the field postcards and the stories they tell beyond the prescribed text,"" she added. Seven startling Proms moments The horribly difficult Proms quiz Proms 2018: Official website In keeping with the Proms' ""performance-first"" ethos, the film will premiere to a live audience at Imperial College, across the road from the Royal Albert Hall, on 21 August. Around 400 tickets will be available for the initial event, before heading to further events associated with 1418-NOW's World War One centenary commemorations. The experiment follows in the footsteps of other orchestras, who have been employing VR to let audiences experience live music at home. The Philharmonia Orchestrahave even created an app,externalthat puts the user in the centre of the musicians as they perform Beethoven's fifth symphony and Mahler's third. The Proms film takes a different approach, using the Royal Albert Hall to illustrate the music by having the building's walls and geometry morph and change. ""The space feels real but heightened,"" said Lysander Ashton of 59 Productions. ""As the music begins, the hall begins to transform in response to the music. ""The architecture around you shifts and changes, becoming a canvas on which the music is painted."" The film will be released for home users on platforms including Oculus VR and the BBC website later this year. Nothing To Be Written will also be made available as a stand-alone VR experience.

"Mr Jones and his InfoWars Twitter accounts have shared 100,000 tweets on the platform The CEO of Twitter says it will not ban InfoWars or its founder Alex Jones because their accounts do not violate the social media platform's rules. A number of tech giants, including YouTube and Facebook, deleted the right-wing conspiracy theorist's content this week, citing hate speech. Mr Jones has accused the platforms of unfair censorship of his accounts. The radio host is best known for spreading unsubstantiated allegations about tragic events, including 9/11. Twitter in a tangle over InfoWars Sandy Hook to Trump: 'Help us stop conspiracy theorists' He is currently being sued for defamationby the parents of two children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which he has repeatedly claimed was a ""giant hoax"". Twenty children under the age of seven and six adults died in the attack. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Twitter CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey explained the platform's decision, confirming it would not be following in the footsteps of others like Apple and Spotify and removing Mr Jones' and InfoWars' content.

Mr Dorsey said the accounts had not violated the platform's rules, but vowed to suspend them if they ever did so. In his explanation, Mr Dorsey said it would be wrong to ""succumb and simply react to outside pressure"" instead of sticking to the company's codified principles. He also implied one-off actions risked fuelling new conspiracy theories in the long-run, and said it was critical for journalists to ""document, validate and refute"" unsubstantiated rumours like the ones spread by Mr Jones ""so people can form their own opinions"". Mr Jones mostly uses his Twitter account to share content and videos from InfoWars with his 850,000 followers, and promotes conspiracy theories against liberals, Muslims and migrants. In July, he said that Democrats planned to launch a civil war on 4 July or US Independence Day Last year, he tweeted that Muslims in England were demanding that the Queen either convert to Islam or leave the country. However, the CNN clip Infowars based its article on dates back to 2009 and features a group led by radical preacher Anjem Choudary, who by 2017 was already serving a five-and-a-half-year sentence for inviting support for the Islamic State group (IS) He has previously said that ""transgenderism"" is a CIA ""plan to depopulate humanity"" and that the normalisation of mental illness is an ""evil paedophile plot to sexualise and destroy children"" In 2013, he described then President Barack Obama as the ""global head of al-Qaeda"", and later accused him of arming IS Some users replied angrily to the Twitter CEO's tweets, accusing the platform of ignoring hate speech and labelling his explanation a ""cop out"". Mr Dorsey expanded on his original messages after receiving the criticism. He wrote in a series of tweets on Wednesday afternoon that the platform must build new tools to support journalists, who he described as ""one of the most important constituencies we serve"".

"Paul Manafort entering court back in February Ex-Trump aide Paul Manafort's lawyer has told a court his deputy led a ""secret life"" and told so many lies he could not keep track of them all. Mr Manafort's defence team was cross-examining his former right-hand man, Rick Gates, who is now star witness for the prosecution. Gates told the court on Monday that Mr Manafort ordered him to commit fraud. This is the first criminal trial to come from the Department of Justice-led inquiry into alleged Russian meddling. Ex-Manafort deputy details their 'crimes' Mr Manafort, 69, has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud and tax fraud. Gates, 46, struck a plea deal with prosecutors in February, admitting two charges of conspiracy and lying to the FBI. The case arises from the pair's consultancy work for Russian-backed Ukrainian politicians. Mr Manafort's legal team sought to undercut Gates' credibility on Tuesday, day six of the trial. Defence attorney Kevin Downing asked about the witness's co-operation with special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. ""After all the lies you told you expect this jury to believe you?"" Mr Downing asked Gates. ""I'm here to tell the truth,"" the witness replied. ""Mr Manafort had the same path. I'm here."" Mr Manafort has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud and tax fraud The defence lawyer pointed out Gates had lied to investigators before entering his guilty plea. ""Have they confronted you with so many lies that you can't remember?"" Mr Downing added. The defence lawyer also pressed Gates on his adultery. ""There was another Richard Gates, isn't that right?"" Mr Downing asked. ""A secret Richard Gates?"" The witness responded that he had had an extramarital affair over 10 years ago. Gates acknowledged keeping a flat in London for two months during those trysts, and listing luxury hotels as a business expense. He also said he had possibly submitted personal expenses to President Donald Trump's inaugural committee for his work on the election campaign. And he conceded he had penned a fraudulent letter to prospective investors for a movie project. Gates - pictured here in February - has already pleaded guilty to two criminal charges One text exchange drew laughter from the court when a message was read out revealing Mr Manafort's dismay at his high tax rate. Beginning with an expletive, he wrote: ""You told me you were on top of this... This is a disaster."" The two former business partners were indicted last October for hiding millions of dollars they made lobbying for Russian-backed Ukrainian politicians. The charges relating to the pair's political consulting largely predate the Trump 2016 election campaign they worked on together. Gates told the Alexandria, Virginia, court on Monday he was helping prosecutors in the hope of leniency. Gates still faces up to six years in prison under the terms of his plea deal. He has avoided all eye contact with Mr Manafort in his two days of testimony, according to reporters in court. Who's who in Russia drama? How Trump-Russia scandal has unfolded What is the special counsel? Who is Paul Manafort? Tensions are running high in the courtroom, and not just on the witness stand. On Monday the judge accused the prosecutor of getting weepy as the pair argued, according to a court transcript. The dispute began as Judge TS Ellis told Greg Andres his line of questioning was not relevant. ""Look at me when you're talking to me,"" the judge reprimanded Mr Andres, out of earshot of the jury. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? The prosecutor protested that he did not ""want to get in trouble for some facial expression"". Judge Ellis said: ""There's tears in your eyes right now."" Mr Andres denied it. ""Well, they're watery,"" Judge Ellis said. ""Look, I want you to focus sharply on what you need to prove - to prove the crime. ""And I don't understand what a lot of these questions have to do with it.""

"He became Colombia's youngest elected leader after being sworn in at Bogota's Bolivar Square Colombia's newly-elected President IvÃ¡n Duque took office on Tuesday, pledging to unite the country and improve economic growth. The conservative political newcomer was elected in June after a divisive election campaign where he saw off left-wing rival Gustavo Petro. In his inaugural address, the former lawyer pledged changes to tackle corruption and invigorate the economy. The leader has also vowed to change the peace deal with the Farc rebel group. The outgoing President Juan Manuel Santos has urged Mr Duque to respect the deal, which was negotiated in 2016 to bring an end to the country's brutal five-decade civil conflict. The Farc, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, is now a political party known as the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force.A number of its members took up seats in parliament last monthas part of the terms which guarantee it political representation. IvÃ¡n Duque: Puppet or rock star? Colombia's ex-fighters taught skills for peace Colombia's Farc rebels - 50 years of conflict Mr Duque has said he remains committed to Colombia's peace process, but says that it is too lenient on former guerrilla fighters accused of war crimes. ""We will deploy corrective measures to ensure that the victims get the truth, proportional justice, reparations and no repetitions of the past,"" the new president said in his address on Tuesday. Official photographs were released of the new president and his family Mr Duque also spoke about the need to heal the country after a divisive election campaign earlier this year. The Centro DemocrÃ¡tico (Democratic Centre) party candidate beat opponent Gustavo Petro by 12 points in June - winning the run-off election with 54% of the final vote. ""I want to govern Colombia with unbreakable values and principles, overcoming the divisions of left and right, overcoming with popular dialogue the prickly feelings that invite social fracture, I want to govern Colombia with a spirit to build, never to destroy,"" President Duque said in his address. His political platform is considered business-friendly after he pledged to cut taxes and boost investment in Colombia's economy. Mr Duque, who at 42 is the youngest Colombian to be president in the modern era, was handpicked as party leader by founder Ãlvaro Uribe Velez, who himself was president from 2002 to 2010. Mr Uribe remains active in politics, but resigned from his senate seat in Julyto face a bribery and fraud investigation in the Supreme Court.

"Food giants KFC and Kellogg's have been told to remove adverts which promoted junk food to children, by the UK's advertising watchdog. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says they broke strict rules on advertising high fat, sugar or salt products to children. The ASA found Kellogg's promoted a Coco Pops product during a Mr Bean cartoon, likely to have been seen by children. It also ruled KFC advertised a Mars product on a phone box by a school. First ads banned under new junk food rules Children 'bombarded by junk food' ads Will new child obesity measures make life easier? KFC said the appearance of the ad close to a school was a simple human error and it had taken the advert down promptly, once it had been alerted. And Kellogg's said it was disappointed with the decision as it had only meant to promote the healthier Coco Pops Granola product, rather than the original version. Members of the public complained to the ASA, triggering the investigations. The ASA was alerted to a poster ad for KFC's Mars Krushems drink which was seen on a phone box outside a school. Because it was displayed close to the entrance to a primary school, children under the age of 16 made up a much higher proportion of the ad's audience. Advertising for children is allowed in general - think of ads for toys and games - but theASA says there are factors,externalthat must be considered. Adverts must not: Suggest a child would be unpopular if they do not own a particular product Make a direct appeal to a child to get a product Encourage children to make a nuisance of themselves unless they get bought a product Cause confusion between real-life and imagination Harm a child's physical or mental health or encourage them to put themselves in harm's way, for example showing children in a dangerous situation (unless the ad is a safety warning) Advertise high salt, fat or sugar foods to children The ASA considered it was highly likely those younger children comprised significantly more than 25% of the audience of the ad, and that it therefore broke the rules. The Coco Pops Granola ad appeared between episodes of the Mr Bean cartoon, during a section of programming specifically directed at children under 16. The ASA said that, although Coco Pops Granola was not a high fat, sugar or salt product, because the Coco Pops branding was synonymous with Coco Pops original cereal and with the Coco Pops range, it concluded the ad had effectively promoted the range. Two other ads by McDonald's, which had also been complained about, were deemed not to have broken rules. Jess Tye from the ASA said, ""obviously advertising has an effect"" otherwise companies ""wouldn't be bothering with adverts"". She said: ""We do know that ads play a small part in food preferences for children and it's really important that we act as a regulator to make sure that advertisers are being really responsible in the way that they are promoting these products."" Steven Woodford, chief executive of the Advertising Association which represents the advertising industry, said the KFC breach had been ""inadvertent"". He said: ""Rules are there to protect children. ""That's what the industry is trying to do."" Should rules on Instagram ads be tougher?

"Joel Urhie dreamed of becoming a firefighter, his family said The death of a seven-year-old boy killed in a house fire is being treated as murder, the Met Police has said. Joel Urhie was found after a ""very severe fire"" at his home in Adolphus Street, Deptford, south-east London, in the early hours. Joel's mother Sophie and sister Sarah escaped. His father John said: ""It's terrible, the pain we cannot forget."" Det Supt Jane Corrigan said the fire was believed to be arson but Joel was unlikely to be the target. ""It is difficult to imagine a seven-year-old is the motive for the attack,"" she said. ""[He] has lost his life in what should have been the safest place for him, his home,"" she added. ""We believe that the fire was started deliberately but at this stage I am unable to go into any further detail due to operational reasons."" There are no suspects at the moment, the Met said. Joel's mother Sophie and sister Sarah jumped to safety from the first floor Joel's family said he dreamed of becoming a firefighter. Speaking outside the house, Mr Urhie described Joel as ""a very lovely boy who was just loving life"". The 54-year-old said he moved out of the family home about five years ago but had been called at about 04:00 BST to say there had been a fire. ""When I came, the first thing I saw was my daughter inside the ambulance. They said, 'Joel's dead', and there's nothing I can do about it,"" he said. Police officers and firefighterswere called to the house shortly before 03:30 BST on Tuesday. It took more than 75 minutes to bring the flames under control and surrounding homes were evacuated as a precaution. The ground floor of the house was badly damaged by the blaze, as well as the first floor and the stairs. No-one was in the house at the time apart from Joel, his mother and sister, police said. Ms Urhie and her daughter jumped to safety from the first floor. They are recovering in hospital, with non-life threatening injuries, where they were joined by Joel's brother Sam, 21. Homes were evacuated as a precaution after the fire broke out in Adolphus Street Family friend Grace Gbenedio, 56, said she rushed outside her nearby home after hearing screams. Mrs Gbenedio said she held Joel's mother, who said: ""My son is inside."" ""She was on the floor crying, 'help, help, help',"" Mrs Gbenedio added. ""The fire was just too much, like a curtain, no-one could go in or out,"" she said. ""We heard the last blast of the glass and she just collapsed.""

"He became Colombia's youngest elected leader after being sworn in at Bogota's Bolivar Square Colombia's newly-elected President IvÃ¡n Duque took office on Tuesday, pledging to unite the country and improve economic growth. The conservative political newcomer was elected in June after a divisive election campaign where he saw off left-wing rival Gustavo Petro. In his inaugural address, the former lawyer pledged changes to tackle corruption and invigorate the economy. The leader has also vowed to change the peace deal with the Farc rebel group. The outgoing President Juan Manuel Santos has urged Mr Duque to respect the deal, which was negotiated in 2016 to bring an end to the country's brutal five-decade civil conflict.

"Tesla's Model S (left) and Model X are both priced at more than $70,000 Tesla boss Elon Musk is considering taking the electric-car firm private, a move he claimed was the ""best path forward"" for the company. He said de-listing from the stock exchange meant Tesla, currently valued at $63.8bn (Â£50bn), would no longer be under the glare of Wall Street. In an unusual move, Mr Musk first made the announcement on Twitter rather than via an official regulatory disclosure. But analysts are sceptical about what would be the biggest buyout in history. Since Tesla floated on the stock market, Mr Musk has clashed with analysts and complained that quarterly scrutiny of the firm's finances encourages short-term thinking. Tesla shares ended the day 11% up at almost $380 per share - close to their all-time high. Mr Musk said shareholders would be offered $420 per share, valuing the business at more than $80bn, including debt. A buyout at that value would make it by far the biggest such deal. The current biggest is the purchase of utility TXU Corp in 2007 for $44bn by a consortium that included KKR and TPG. Elon Musk is playing a dangerous game Musk declares Tesla 'a real car company' Tesla to slash thousands of jobs Mr Musk claimed to have secured funding to buy out shareholders, but did not provide details. However, he also warned that ""a final decision has not been made"" about the move. Any buy-out would need a shareholder vote. BBC business editor Simon Jack said that if it emerges that Mr Musk did not have solid financial backing for a buyout he could be in trouble with regulators for share price manipulation.

While Twitter was an unconventional way to make the announcement, the US market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, allows firms to use social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter in this way provided investors have been told which social media outlets will be used. In 2013,Tesla flagged Mr Musk's Twitter account as a source of information,external. The firm subsequently shareda message from Mr Musk to employees,externalthat explained the thinking behind his announcement. Mr Musk, who owns almost 20% of the company, said he hoped the move would shield the firm from distracting swings in the share price and the pressure to meet quarterly financial targets. He also said he wanted to end ""negative propaganda"" from short sellers, investors who bet on the shares of a firm going down. ""Basically, I'm trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible,""he wrote,external. Mr Musk has discussed the drawbacks of being a public company before. But his tweets stirred confusion initially, given his history of informal use of the social media service. For example, on April Fool's Day, he joked on Twitter about Tesla going bankrupt. Mr Musk's plan would allow investors to choose to retain their holdings. He planned to hold onto his shares and hoped to continue as chief executive, he added. Gene Munster, an analyst at Loup Ventures, said Mr Musk had a ""one-in-three chance"" of managing to succeed with his plan. ""The 16% premium to the current share price may not be high enough to incentivise existing shareholders to support the sale,"" he added. And Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity, said it would be difficult for Mr Musk to raise finance when Tesla has still not made a profit. ""The company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Elon Musk had better have the money lined up to take Tesla private or he could be in serious trouble with regulators. There is never a dull moment with the mercurial Mr Musk, but he excelled himself on Tuesday, stunning the markets by tweeting that he was considering taking the company private by buying publicly available shares for $420 each. The shares surged, which will have left the people who have been betting the shares would fall nursing very heavy losses. It will have given Mr Musk great pleasure to get one over on the naysayers. But he's playing a potentially dangerous game. If it turns out his Twitter promise - that he has secured the tens of billions of dollars he would need to buy out public shareholders - is in any way shaky, then he could find himself accused of price manipulation. It's a very serious charge, which can land you in jail. Read Simon's blog. Mr Musk's disclosure stirred further speculation about Tesla's future. The firm is spending heavily as it ramps up production of its latest car, the Model 3. It reported a record loss in its most recent quarter, and some analysts say it will need to raise money in order to survive. However, Mr Musk has said he has no plans to do so and promised that the firm will be profitable in the second half of the year, barring any unforeseen events. The tweets came after a separate report in the Financial Times that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund had taken a 3%-5% stake in Tesla, a holding worth at least $1.9bn. The article said the state fund, overseen by the powerful crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, had been interested in buying newly issued shares.

"Mr Jones and his InfoWars Twitter accounts have shared 100,000 tweets on the platform The CEO of Twitter says it will not ban InfoWars or its founder Alex Jones because their accounts do not violate the social media platform's rules. A number of tech giants, including YouTube and Facebook, deleted the right-wing conspiracy theorist's content this week, citing hate speech. Mr Jones has accused the platforms of unfair censorship of his accounts. The radio host is best known for spreading unsubstantiated allegations about tragic events, including 9/11.

Mr Dorsey said the accounts had not violated the platform's rules, but vowed to suspend them if they ever did so. In his explanation, Mr Dorsey said it would be wrong to ""succumb and simply react to outside pressure"" instead of sticking to the company's codified principles. He also implied one-off actions risked fuelling new conspiracy theories in the long-run, and said it was critical for journalists to ""document, validate and refute"" unsubstantiated rumours like the ones spread by Mr Jones ""so people can form their own opinions"". Mr Jones mostly uses his Twitter account to share content and videos from InfoWars with his 850,000 followers, and promotes conspiracy theories against liberals, Muslims and migrants.

"Paul Manafort entering court back in February Ex-Trump aide Paul Manafort's lawyer has told a court his deputy led a ""secret life"" and told so many lies he could not keep track of them all. Mr Manafort's defence team was cross-examining his former right-hand man, Rick Gates, who is now star witness for the prosecution. Gates told the court on Monday that Mr Manafort ordered him to commit fraud. This is the first criminal trial to come from the Department of Justice-led inquiry into alleged Russian meddling. Ex-Manafort deputy details their 'crimes' Mr Manafort, 69, has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud and tax fraud. Gates, 46, struck a plea deal with prosecutors in February, admitting two charges of conspiracy and lying to the FBI. The case arises from the pair's consultancy work for Russian-backed Ukrainian politicians. Mr Manafort's legal team sought to undercut Gates' credibility on Tuesday, day six of the trial. Defence attorney Kevin Downing asked about the witness's co-operation with special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. ""After all the lies you told you expect this jury to believe you?"" Mr Downing asked Gates. ""I'm here to tell the truth,"" the witness replied. ""Mr Manafort had the same path. I'm here."" Mr Manafort has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud and tax fraud The defence lawyer pointed out Gates had lied to investigators before entering his guilty plea. ""Have they confronted you with so many lies that you can't remember?"" Mr Downing added. The defence lawyer also pressed Gates on his adultery. ""There was another Richard Gates, isn't that right?"" Mr Downing asked. ""A secret Richard Gates?"" The witness responded that he had had an extramarital affair over 10 years ago. Gates acknowledged keeping a flat in London for two months during those trysts, and listing luxury hotels as a business expense. He also said he had possibly submitted personal expenses to President Donald Trump's inaugural committee for his work on the election campaign. And he conceded he had penned a fraudulent letter to prospective investors for a movie project. Gates - pictured here in February - has already pleaded guilty to two criminal charges One text exchange drew laughter from the court when a message was read out revealing Mr Manafort's dismay at his high tax rate. Beginning with an expletive, he wrote: ""You told me you were on top of this... This is a disaster."" The two former business partners were indicted last October for hiding millions of dollars they made lobbying for Russian-backed Ukrainian politicians. The charges relating to the pair's political consulting largely predate the Trump 2016 election campaign they worked on together. Gates told the Alexandria, Virginia, court on Monday he was helping prosecutors in the hope of leniency. Gates still faces up to six years in prison under the terms of his plea deal. He has avoided all eye contact with Mr Manafort in his two days of testimony, according to reporters in court. Who's who in Russia drama? How Trump-Russia scandal has unfolded What is the special counsel? Who is Paul Manafort? Tensions are running high in the courtroom, and not just on the witness stand. On Monday the judge accused the prosecutor of getting weepy as the pair argued, according to a court transcript. The dispute began as Judge TS Ellis told Greg Andres his line of questioning was not relevant. ""Look at me when you're talking to me,"" the judge reprimanded Mr Andres, out of earshot of the jury. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? The prosecutor protested that he did not ""want to get in trouble for some facial expression"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson 'has caused offence', PM says Boris Johnson has stood by his remarks about the burka after the Conservative Party chairman told him to apologise. The former foreign secretary has been criticised for saying Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"" and comparing them to ""bank robbers"". PM Theresa May has backed calls for Mr Johnson to apologise, saying the remarks have ""clearly caused offence"". But a source close to Mr Johnson said he ""won't be apologising"", adding it was ""ridiculous"" to attack his views. ""We must not fall into the trap of shutting down the debate on difficult issues,"" the source added. ""We have to call it out. If we fail to speak up for liberal values then we are simply yielding ground to reactionaries and extremists."" Johnson burka 'letter box' jibe sparks anger What's the difference between a hijab, niqab and burka? Mr Johnson's remarks,in a Daily Telegraph article,external, have provoked criticism from Muslim groups, some Tory MPs and opposition parties. This video can not be played Senior Conservative Muslim peer Lord Sheikh calls on party to take whip away from Johnson In the article, Mr Johnson said full-face veils should not be banned but that it was ""ridiculous"" people chose to wear them. However, the founder of the Conservative Muslim Forum said the remarks would harm community relations. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said he agreed with Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt that there had been degree of offence in Mr Johnson's comments, and called on the former London mayor to apologise.

By BBC political correspondent Susana Mendonca The criticism pitted at Boris Johnson has largely been around the words that he used - ""letter boxes"" and ""bank robbers"" to describe Muslim women wearing face veils. But Mr Johnson hasn't directly responded to the accusation that it is his language which caused the offence. Instead, the statement that has come from a source close to him suggests Mr Johnson wants to turn this into a debate about whether or not women should wear the burka at all. Keeping a high profile is important to Mr Johnson. He is seen by some in the Conservative Party as a contender for leadership - particularly since his resignation in which he criticised the prime minister's plan for Brexit. But he risks being seen as weak if he is forced into an apology by the party chairman. So his refusal to apologise, and an attempt to now put himself on the side of ""liberal values"", could be an example of Mr Johnson trying to save face while maintaining his profile. Former Conservative chairwoman Baroness Warsi, the first Muslim woman to sit in a British cabinet, welcomed Mr Lewis's intervention and called for disciplinary action against Mr Johnson if he did not apologise. She described the remarks as ""offensive and deliberately provocative, but very clever politics"". A debate about the burka should be had ""in a serious way"", she said, rather than ""trying to get airtime and attention on an issue which he knows will resonate with a certain part of the Tory Party"". This video can not be played Shazia Awan-Scully on Johnson Shazia Awan-Scully, a Muslim who ran as a Conservative candidate in 2010, said she did not agree with wearing the burka but it was up to women to make up their own minds. She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""Some women choose to wear it, some women are conditioned to wear it, but it's certainly out of the question for me to tell a woman what to wear."" She added that the language used by Mr Johnson showed he was ""pandering to this Islamophobic attitude bubbling away in the Conservative Party"", which she said she had experienced herself.

Conservative backbench MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Johnson had raised an important subject in a ""light-hearted way"". The reaction ""says a lot about internal Conservative Party politics"", he told the BBC. Dr Qanta Ahmed, a British-American Muslim doctor who supports banning face veils, said Mr Johnson had been ""tactless"". The 50-year-old said wearing a full-face veil was a ""new phenomenon"" and she didn't consider it a religious right, adding that she would be ""very opposed"" to it becoming normalised in British society. By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani Last year,Zaynab Hussein, a mother from Leicester, was left fighting for her lifeafter a man she didn't know smashed into her with his car - and then ran over her again. She was attacked because she was a Muslim. Tell Mama, the national organisation that collects anti-Muslim attack statistics, says that the majority of street victims of such abuse and violence are women, for the same reason that Mrs Hussein was singled out: some Muslim women are easily identifiable by their mode of dress - and therefore easy to target. Seven years ago Baroness Warsi said prejudice against Muslims had passed the ""dinner table test"". And Mr Johnson's critics regard his ""letter box"" and ""bank robber"" comments as part of the problem the peer defined: normalising prejudice and dehumanising women, rather than calmly debating the complexities of the veil in an open society. Since Baroness Warsi's warning, there has been the launch of a cross-departmental working group to tackle anti-Muslim hatred. But it has been criticised as toothless, not least because the government can't agree a definition for Islamophobia. In his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson - who last month quit the government in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit policy - was commenting on the introduction of a burka ban in Denmark. He said he felt ""fully entitled"" to expect women to remove face coverings when talking to him at his MP surgery - and schools and universities should be able to take the same approach if a student ""turns up... looking like a bank robber"". ""If you tell me that the burka is oppressive, then I am with you,"" he said. ""If you say that it is weird and bullying to expect women to cover their faces, then I totally agree - and I would add that I can find no scriptural authority for the practice in the Koran. ""I would go further and say that it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes."" He said businesses and government agencies should be able to ""enforce a dress code"" that allowed them to see customers' faces. Boris Johnson said he did not think face coverings should be banned but said the burka was ""oppressive"" But he said: ""Such restrictions are not quite the same as telling a free-born adult woman what she may or may not wear, in a public place, when she is simply minding her own business."" He said a total ban on face-covering veils would give a boost to radicals who said there was a ""clash of civilisations"" between Islam and the West, and could lead to ""a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation"".
