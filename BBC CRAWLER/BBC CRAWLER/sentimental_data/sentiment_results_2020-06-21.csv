"Efforts to increase the number of black managers at British companies have stalled, according to a business group. Just 1.5% of top bosses at UK companies are black. That compares to 3% of the population of England and Wales. While the ratio is an improvement on the 1.4% of 2014, there is much ground still to cover, said Sandra Kerr, race director at Business in the Community, which has campaigned for workplace racial equality for 25 years. ""It is clear that black people continue to be under-represented at a senior level,"" she said. ""Black livelihoods matter and employers need to take urgent action to ensure that their organisation is inclusive and a place where people of any ethnic background can thrive and succeed."" 'My African name stopped me getting job opportunities' The new figures coincide with the 72nd anniversary of the arrival of HMT Empire Windrush, which brought workers from the Caribbean to the UK. Employers should make their companies welcoming to black workers, said Sandra Kerr, race director at Business in the Community They also come amid global protests over racial inequality and as some older British companies come to terms with their historical links with the slave trade. Pub chain Greene King and insurance market Lloyd's of London apologised for those ties last week. One of Greene King's founders owned a number of plantations in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, maritime insurance - which was focused on Lloyd's - thrived on the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Lloyd's has said it will donate to charities representing black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups. Greene King said it would make a ""substantial investment to benefit the BAME community"". In March, a report from the Carnegie Trust, University College London's Centre for Longitudinal Studies and Operation Black Vote said young BAME members are 47% more likely to to be on a zero-hours contract. The researchers compared the experiences of 25-year-olds in England. They looked at people who are white, as well mixed-race, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black African and Caribbean, and other minority ethnicities, sometimes collectively known as BAME workers. That reportfollowed researchfrom February that about a third of FTSE 100 firms have no ethnic minority board members.

"The attack happened in a residential courtyard in Moss Side Two men have died in a shooting after a lockdown party of ""hundreds of people"". Police were called to reports that gun shots had been heard in Caythorpe Street in Moss Side, Manchester, at about 01:00 BST. The two victims, aged in their 20s and 30s, ""self-presented"" in hospital and died a short time later. Greater Manchester Police said the shooting happened at ""an unplanned event"" near to the location of an ""earlier community event"". No arrests have been made yet.

"The government will introduce new measures on Monday to protect businesses critical to public health from foreign takeovers. Changes to legislation would give ministers extra powers to protect those needed to help in future pandemics, who might be struggling now. The new powers will cover firms such as pharmaceutical companies. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""The UK is open for investment, but not for exploitation."" The government already has the power to scrutinise takeovers for several reasons, including national security or financial stability. It may block a takeover or seek assurances from a buyer about their plans for a company. But changes to the 2002 Enterprise Act will mean that the government can intervene if a business that is involved in a pandemic response - a personal protective equipment (PPE) manufacturer, for example - is the target of a takeover by a foreign firm. They will also expand the government's ability to scrutinise takeovers involving companies who work in artificial intelligence or encryption technology. ""I think it is a significant development,"" Peter Harper, partner in the competition, EU and trade team at law firm Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC. ""It gives them a greater power to intervene."" ""The government's track record of intervention has basically increased over time,"" he said. So far, the government hasn't stopped a deal based on national security grounds, he said, but they have imposed conditions on buyers. It brings the government into line with countries like France, Germany, Italy and Spain, he said, where the EU has been keeping a stricter eye on potential purchases. The economic disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic ""may mean that some businesses with critical capabilities are more susceptible to takeovers"", the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said in a statement. ""These powers will send an important signal to those seeking to take advantage of those struggling as a results of the pandemic that the UK government is prepared to act where necessary to protect our national security,"" Mr Sharma said. It follows the April announcement of European Union (EU) plans to help block foreign takeovers of European firms struggling with the virus downturn. It wants to allow governments to invest in ""weak"" companies, which could include some form of ownership. While it called them ""measures of last resort"", the European Commission said it was consulting member states. In March, the European Commission issued guidelines to ensure a strong EU-wide approach to foreign investment screening ""in a time of public health crisis and related economic vulnerability"". The UK formally left the EU on 31 January, but is currently in a transition period until the end of the year. During this period, the UK will continue to follow all of the EU's rules and its trading relationship will remain the same. 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented?

"Members of ""The Base"" posed for photos that were used as propaganda Secret efforts to groom and recruit teenagers by a neo-Nazi militant group have been exposed by covert recordings. They capture senior members of The Base interviewing young applicants and discussing how to radicalise them. The FBI has described the group as seeking to unite white supremacists around the world and incite a race war. The recordings were passed to US civil rights organisation, the Southern Poverty Law Center, before some were shared with BBC One's Panorama. Rinaldo Nazzaro, founder of The Base, is a 47-year-old American. Earlier this year the BBCrevealed he was directing the organisation from his upmarket flat in St. Petersburg, Russia. The interviews, which took place via conference call on an encrypted app, followed a pattern - prospective members were asked by Nazzaro about their personal history, ethnicity, radicalisation journey and experience with weapons, before a panel of senior members posed their own questions. Rinaldo Nazzaro is now living in Russia The would-be recruits were quizzed on what books they had read, including Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, and were encouraged to familiarise themselves with the group's white supremacist ideology, which predicts and seeks to accelerate racial warfare, requiring followers to prepare for conflict and social breakdown. During the calls, Nazzaro can be heard welcoming members of other extremist groups. The young applicants, who hide behind aliases and display varying degrees of ideological awareness, describe their radicalisation by online videos and propaganda. When interviewees left the calls, senior members discussed their potential before arranging to vet them in person at a later date. The recordings make clear that The Base sought to recruit soldiers from western militaries to draw on their training with tactics and firearms. Nazzaro, who the BBC investigation has been told used to work as an analyst for the FBI and as a contractor for the Pentagon, informed one British teenager that the idea of societal collapse was a ""guiding philosophy"". A European teenager was told that such a collapse would be desirable, even at a local level, if it offered a ""power vacuum that we can take advantage of"". One boy was told ""we have a goal of initially creating two to three man cells in as many areas as possible"" and that the ""UK is a place that we think there is a lot of potential"". During a post-interview discussion about a 17-year-old from Europe, one older man spoke of ""shaping"" his belief system, with Nazzaro saying he needed a ""little work ideologically"" but was ""definitely headed in the right direction"". Commenting on one British teenager, Nazzaro suggested he probably needed to ""mature ideologically"". Dr Cassie Miller, a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center, describes the recordings as a ""highly unusual glimpse"" into this extreme world, showing there was ""no singular pathway to radicalization"". She says those applying to The Base came from a variety of backgrounds. ""I think the fact that a lot of these people are so utterly normal is in itself significant. ""They didn't possess some traits that predispose them to want to become a terrorist or to become attracted to extremist ideology. ""I think it's really best to think of them as a reflection of a society that is so deeply politically polarized"". From left: Jacob Kaderli, Michael Helterbrand and Luke Austin Lane, face charges in Georgia In the American State of Georgia,three members of The Base are currently facing conspiracy chargesfor allegedly plotting to murder an anti-fascist couple. The Base is the latest underground organisation to emerge from an international neo-Nazi network originally generated by a now-defunct web forum called Iron March. Other organisations include the banned British groups National Action and the Sonnenkrieg Division, as well as the Atomwaffen Division in the USA, which has been dismantled by a nationwide FBI investigation. The BBC investigation reveals the real identity of a man who is both a senior member of The Base and the creator of a successor online forum linked to several UK terrorism prosecutions involving teenagers. Matthew Baccari, an unemployed 25-year-old from Southern California, used the alias 'Mathias' to run a notorious website called Fascist Forge, where terrorism and sexual violence were openly encouraged. He was a vocal presence on The Base interview calls and promoted the group on his website, which he took offline earlier this year following significant attention by law enforcement. Matthew Baccari (r), posing for a propaganda image, is an unemployed 25-year-old from California The forum was central to the case of a boy from Durham, who last year - aged 16 - becamethe youngest person convicted of planning a terror attack in the UK. Two other young British members of Fascist Forge, one aged 15, are separately making their way through the youth court system charged with a combined 25 terrorism offences. Baccari refused to leave his bedroom when a BBC team went to his house to ask questions. Baccari and Nazzaro did not respond to letters setting out the evidence against them.

"2 Sisters produces a third of all poultry products consumed in the UK The number of workers testing positive for coronavirus at an Anglesey chicken factory has risen to 158. All staff at the 2 Sisters meat processing plant in Llangefni are self-isolating after a number ofworkers were confirmed to have the virus on Thursday. A Welsh Government minister has not ruled out local lockdown measures to contain the outbreak. Public Health Wales (PHW) said the number of cases was expected to rise. Dr Christopher Johnson from PHW said 400 staff had been tested since the outbreak was confirmed on Thursday. ""As of 15:00 BST on Sunday 21 June we have recorded an increase of 83 confirmed positive cases identified over the past 24 hours,"" he said. ""Testing of employees continues, and it is likely that some additional cases will be identified in the coming days. ""The increase in cases is as we anticipated when a focused track and trace programme is implemented, and does not mean that the spread of infection is increasing."" Economy minister Ken Skates has said the fallout from the outbreak must be contained Travel restrictions in Wales are due to be lifted from 6 July,allowing people to ""travel as far as they like for all purposes"", as long as covid cases continue to fall. But speaking onBBC Wales Politics Show, the Economy Minister Ken Skates said it was essential to make sure the Anglesey outbreak was ""kept as local as possible"". Mr Skates did not rule out restrictions remaining in place in Anglesey, and said the council, PHW and Betsi Cadwaladr health board were ""right to contain the fallout from the 2 Sisters plant"" and ""making sure that spike is kept as local as possible"", He said: ""That will help contain the virus, and that, in turn, help Anglesey open up its economy sooner, and that is something I think the island will welcome and I think the entire population of Wales will welcome."" Anglesey council hasalready confirmed schools will not reopen as planned on 29 Junefollowing incidents at the plant. Testing sites were set up at Llangefni and Holyhead, and at an existing facility in Bangor, following the outbreak. All staff and contractors working at the processing plant, which has 560 workers, have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days, and are being contacted for testing. 2 Sisters is one of the largest food producers in the UK and processes about a third of all the poultry products eaten each day from its sites across Britain. It has suspended production and closed the factory, which supplies local authorities, hospitals, restaurants and small businesses, following the outbreak. 2 Sisters had said ""the health, safety and well-being of our colleagues is ultimately the thing that matters most at our business"". It added: ""We will not tolerate any unnecessary risks - however small - for our existing loyal workforce at the facility."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

PHW, who are responding to the outbreak, thanked the workforce and wider community for their ""swift co-operation"" with the test and trace process. ""This rapid response is providing vital information to help minimise the further spread of Covid-19 locally,"" said Dr Johnson. ""We must remember that Covid-19 has not gone away. ""Incidents like this show the potential for pockets of asymptomatic undiagnosed infection in the community, highlighting the importance of the adherence to social distancing and hygiene measures."" Dr Johnson said rapid test and trace facilities had ""helped identify this situation"" and said health teams would keep measures in place to ""bring the outbreak to a rapid conclusion"". He added: ""It therefore remains essential that all members of the public, including employees of 2 Sisters Food Group and their close contacts, continue to recognise the vital role they have in preventing the spread of coronavirus, to help keep Wales safe."" Anglesey council leader Llinos Medi said health and safety was the top priority Responding to the increase in confirmed cases, Anglesey council leader Llinos Medi said the outbreak was ""causing concern on Anglesey"". She said the authority's thoughts were ""with 2 Sisters' employees and their families at this uncertain time"" and urged all workers to get tested and to make sure they self-isolated. ""This is imperative to stop the spread and further positive cases in our communities,"" she said.""The county council is working with partners across the Island to ensure those who are self-isolating, who have no support networks, are helped during this challenging period."" The council leader said the authority would be holding discussions with the Welsh Government on Monday to see ""what local lockdown looks like"". ""How do we enforce local lockdown, and also how do we support those businesses that would not be able to operate during a local lockdown, as well,"" she added. The Food Standards Agency said there was no reason food would not be safe The Food Standards Agency said it was ""very unlikely you can catch coronavirus from food"" as the virus is a respiratory illness. It said the virus was ""not known to be transmitted by exposure to food or food packaging"". Do you work in a meat processing facility?

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""We're about to see another step in the plan"" The government will ""bring forward proposals"" on how to safely reduce the 2m social distancing rule in England this week, says Matt Hancock. The health secretary said the distance could be lowered with ""mitigations"" to cut the risk of transmission. Labour said it would support a change to 1m ""under certain circumstances"". Mr Hancock confirmed new easing of lockdown measures would be announced in the coming days, including whether pubs and restaurants can re-open on 4 July. Boris Johnson said the government was ""sticking like glue"" tothe roadmap it announced in May- when it said the venues could re-open on 4 July ""at the earliest"". He added: ""We are going step-by-step, making things easier for people, helping people to see more of each other, allowing more social contact, more social interaction, and we will be setting all that out. ""But it's very important that we don't lose our vice like grip on the disease. We have got to keep it on the floor where we have got it and so we have got to keep making those trade-offs."" A further 43 people who had tested positive for coronavirus have died in the UK, it was announced on Sunday. There was one death in Wales, but no deaths were recorded in Scotland or Northern Ireland over the previous 24 hours. Is it safe to relax the 2m rule? Result of 2m rule review to come next week - Sunak Mr Johnson announced a review into the 2m rule last week, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak confirming on Saturday its conclusion would be published this week. But speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Mr Hancock appeared to go further, saying: ""The proposals we'll bring forward are how you can safely reduce the 2m with the sort of mitigations we've been talking about."" He said there were ""all sorts"" of measures that could be introduced, referring to the use of face masks on public transport, Perspex screens in shops, and studies on the reduction of transmission risk when people sit side-by-side or back-to-back. But while the health secretary said he ""very much hopes"" to reduce the distance, the government would be ""guided by the science"", and would only make changes ""in a way that is safe and doesn't lead to resurgence of virus"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""On social distancing... watch this space, you won't have very much more to wait now"" The government has faced pressure from leaders of the hospitality sector and its own MPs to lessen the 2m rule, withwidespread concerns around the impactit would have on the UK economy. The World Health Organisationrecommends a distance of at least 1m,external(just over 3ft), but the UK government's scientific advisers say that being 1m apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. The other nations of the UK are yet to announce any plans to change the 2m distance rule. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidshe is looking at the evidence, and Northern Ireland's Economy Minister Diane Dodds has saidshe is open to changing it. A coronavirus adviser to the Welsh government saidthe risk in reducing the distance ""isn't very big"". Officially, the review is still under way. But it now seems inevitable the result will be a move from a 2m social distancing rule in England to 1m. The government is set to announce this in the week ahead - probably alongside a confirmed date in early July for pubs and restaurants to reopen, under certain conditions. Scientists seem relaxed about this change - the chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance having indicated that, ultimately, this is a political decision, with no continuing body of evidence to stand in the way of the move. A member of Sage, Professor Calum Semple, says he has changed his mind and it is now reasonable to ""relax these rules"". It's understood there will need to be ""mitigation"" - requirements to stop overcrowding in bars, taking contact details of people booking restaurant tables and a more widespread use of face coverings, for example. But as the eminent microbiologist Prof Peter Piot reminded us today, the virus won't just fade away. He said it will be with us for some time and a second spike of some sort was highly likely. The pubs and bars may reopen in England and Northern Ireland within weeks (Scotland and Wales are keeping the issue under review). But no health or scientific official or adviser will be celebrating any time soon. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said his party were ""prepared to look at [the proposals] carefully"", adding that if a change was ""backed by the science, then that'll be an understandable move"". But he said countries who have lower social distance rules also have a ""broader combination of measures"", such as face shields and tracing apps, and his support would depend on other mitigations being introduced. 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Mr Hancock also said pubs and restaurants would find out this week whether they can re-open on 4 July. He said the potential date was ""part of the plan that we've been working through"" since it was announced last month as a possible next step. The health secretary added: ""The plan is clearly working because the number of new infections is coming down, the number of people on ventilated beds in hospital is coming down and, thankfully, the number of people who are dying is coming down."" Mr Hancock said he ""wouldn't rule out"" following in the footsteps of countries like New Zealand - where customers need to register their details before going to the venues - as it could be ""an additional way that you can do contact tracing so that you can find people who might be at risk"". But he said there were ""lots of ideas out there"" and the government would confirm its plans this week.

"Boris Johnson will announce his plans in Parliament on Tuesday Boris Johnson is expected to announce on Tuesday if the hospitality sector can reopen on 4 July, and that the 2m distancing rule in England will be relaxed, with some conditions. Non-essential shops have reopened in England already, withretail resuming in Walesfrom today. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said England is ""clearly on track"" to further ease lockdown restrictions. But No 10 warned the moves would be reversed if they led to a virus surge. The PM discussed England's approach to the changes with the Covid-19 Strategy Committee on Monday, ahead of an announcement in Parliament on Tuesday. Kuenssberg: Next stage brings new challenges Government to 'bring forward proposals' on 2m rule Tory MPs urge change in 2m social distancing rule Is it safe to relax the 2m rule? Mr Johnson is also expected to announce a reduction in the 2m social distancing rule to 1m, with some mitigating measures. The change to the rule, which follows agovernment review, is expected to come into effect on 4 July. Ministers are also expected to bring forward legislation this week aiming to help businesses cope with social distancing requirements. The PM's spokesman said the Business and Planning Bill would help firms ""adjust to new ways of working, and help them capitalise on the summer months"". Labour MPs have called for ministers to be transparent on the findings of the 2m rule review. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth has said the party's support would depend on mitigations being introduced on face-shielding, and testing and tracing. Earlier Security Minister James Brokenshire said the 2m rule review would be informed by scientific evidence but also ""experience around the world as well"". He told BBC Breakfast it was also important to recognise the importance of other factors on safety, such as whether people are indoors or outside, or whether they are wearing face coverings. He added that the review would also take into account the latest understanding of how the virus is transmitted, which ""has evolved over the last number of weeks"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Mr Hancock has suggested that customers may have to register when entering pubs and bars so they can easily be traced if they come into contact with a coronavirus case. Asked on Sunday about plans for registration and ordering drinks through smartphone apps, he said: ""I wouldn't rule it out. It isn't a decision we've taken yet, but there are other countries in the world that take that approach."" He added that he ""very much hoped"" the 2m rule can be lowered, with ""mitigations"" to cut the risk of transmission. The government has come under pressure from the hospitality sector to lower the rule, with many saying it would be impossible to trade under the current restrictions. This video can not be played One and two metre social distancing - what does it look like? Some Tory MPs and members of the hospitality sector have been appealing to the government to lower the 2m rule to 1m, as many venues say they would be unable to open otherwise. The World Health Organization recommends a distance of at least 1m (just over 3ft), but the UK government's scientific advisers say that distance carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. The other nations of the UK are yet to announce any plans to change the 2m distance rule. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has asked scientific advisors toreview the circumstancesin which it might be reduced alongside ""additional mitigations"". In Northern Ireland, where hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes are set to reopen from 3 July, Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said she isopen to changing it. A change has alsonot been ruled outin Wales - where First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would support a reduction if Welsh advisers said it was safe. This video can not be played Boris Johnson said the government was ""sticking like glue"" to its roadmap In his speech on Tuesday, the PM is expected to warn the public they must continue to follow social distancing guidelines to ""keep the coronavirus under control"". He will also reiterate pledges to use the NHS Test and Trace system to detect and control local outbreaks through ""targeted lockdowns"". A No 10 spokesman said: ""The reason we are able to move forward this week is because the vast majority of people have taken steps to contain the virus. ""The more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing rules. ""We will not hesitate to put the handbrake on to stop the virus running out of control.""

"The attack happened in a residential courtyard in Moss Side Two men have died in a shooting after a lockdown party of ""hundreds of people"". Police were called to reports that gun shots had been heard in Caythorpe Street in Moss Side, Manchester, at about 01:00 BST. The two victims, aged in their 20s and 30s, ""self-presented"" in hospital and died a short time later. Greater Manchester Police said the shooting happened at ""an unplanned event"" near to the location of an ""earlier community event"". No arrests have been made yet. A local resident said the shooting followed a lockdown party with a DJ and ""hundreds of people"". Footage on social media showed crowds dancing to loud music in a courtyard. A heavy police presence was deployed overnight A cordon was placed around a courtyard between Caythorpe Street, Broadfield Road and Bowes Street. A teacher, who lives nearby, said he heard music from about 22:00 BST into the early hours on Sunday. The man, who did not wish to be named, said: ""It's a really normal neighbourhood with an occasional spike in violence. ""I had a walk out to see what was happening and I would say there were hundreds of people around but I did see police patrols. Later, we heard a helicopter overhead."" Officers gather evidence at a courtyard where ""hundreds"" of people attended a party He said people who rang police were told that officers were unable to break up the party because it was too large. Det Insp Andrew Butterworth said: ""We are aware that, a number of hours before this incident, there was a community event in Moss Side. ""This event was attended by Greater Manchester Police along with local people and partner agencies - it was not an illegal rave and it had concluded prior to this incident. ""It does appear that the incident took place at what we believe was an unplanned event near to the location of the earlier community event."" On Sunday, a forensic tent was seen partially covering a car, with alcohol bottles and canisters of laughing gas surrounding the area. Since the 1980s, Moss Side has been associated with problems due to drugs and violence, although in recent years, there have been fewer shootings and money has been spent on redeveloping the area. Thousands attended raves last weekend in Greater Manchester (above), despite gatherings of more than six people being illegal due to coronavirus Earlier this week, Greater Manchester Police said it would take ""serious action"" to deter more illegal gatherings afterraves in Trafford and Oldham last weekend, when a 20-year-old man died of a suspected drug overdose and an 18-year-old woman was raped. More than 6,000 people attended the events, where three men were stabbed. Asst Ch Con Nick Bailey said prevention was the key to controlling illegal parties but conceded that senior officers could decide it was more dangerous to close an event because of its scale, and factors such as terrain and darkness.

Two-metre rule no longer? The government is set to announce its review We're almost done but before we go here's a recap of  Sunday's major developments: Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Apple has said it is âcommitted to working with the UK
governmentâ. Its statement follows claims by Health Secretary Matt Hancock
that his original plan to launch a contact-tracing app might have
worked had it not been for Appleâs unwillingness to compromise over
restrictions it places on third-party appsâ use of Bluetooth on iPhones. On Thursday, the government abandoned its original plan andswitched to a technology co-developed by Apple and Google. Apple's statement was prompted by an interview Mr Hancock gave to
Sky News on Sunday morning in which he said: ""Apple have in the past
also been intransigent in the face of perfectly reasonable requests from
democratically-elected governments to work with them on solving particular
problems, whether that's about solutions to terrorism, or other technical
problems."" In response, Apple said: ""Weâve been
constant collaborators with NHSX and will continue working with them on ways to
further optimise the technology while protecting our customersâ privacy. Many
countries have successfully launched Exposure Notification apps and we look
forward to helping the UK government do the same.â  World number 19 tennis player Grigor Dimitrov has tested positive for coronavirus. The Bulgarian, 29, , played in both of Novak Djokovic's recent Adria Tour events, withdrew fromthe second tournament in Zadar, Croatiaon Saturday with sickness after his opening loss to Borna Coric. ""I am so sorry for any harm I might have caused,"" he said. Sunday's final, which would have featured world number one Djokovic, has been cancelled. A lockdown ban on weddings and civil partnerships in Wales will be lifted from Monday - but there will be no big celebrations allowed. The announcement was added tonew rules published by the Welsh government.,external However, the ban on social gatherings remains, as do social distancing rules and staying local, which advise travelling no more than five miles. Non-essential shops will also reopen on Monday, as moves to relax the Covid-19 restrictions in Wales continue. The new wedding measures follow calls from couples to marry, even if it means a ceremony with just witnesses and a registrar. Dubai is easing more coronavirus-related restrictions Dubai has announced that residents will be allowed to return from Monday, as restrictions imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus are eased. According to a series of measures announced, they will all be tested at airports upon arrival. For those infected, a 14-day quarantine will be mandatory. Tourists will be allowed in from 7 July, although they will be required to present a recent Covid-19 negative certificate or undergo testing at Dubai airports. Again, for those infected, a 14-day quarantine will be imposed. You can find out more details here.,external  The government is facing calls to ease the social-distancing rule in England The government will outline proposals on how to safely
reduce the two-metre social-distancing rule in England this week. The distance could be lowered with ""mitigations"",
so people can be closer without a higher risk of transmission, Health Secretary
Matt Hancock told the BBC. But
what does the science say?Find out more here. There have been more than 300,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 42,500 people have died, government figures show. However, these numbers only include people who have been tested and the total number of deaths relating to the virus is likely to be higher. Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the weekly number of recorded deaths has returned to close to normal levels for the time of year. You can check on the number of cases and deaths in your area here. The coronavirus reproduction
rate in Germany, known as the R number, jumped to 2.88 on Sunday, compared to 1.79 a day earlier, according to the country's Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health. The RKI said the figure was based on a four-day average, and the spike is mainly because of local outbreaks, such as at the meat processing plant in in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where more than 1,300 workers have been infected. The R number is the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average. In Germany, this now means that out of 100 people with Covid-19, a further 288 will be infected. An R value of less than one is needed to gradually contain the disease. Our colleague James Gallagher has looked intohow the R number is calculated. A two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UK is now in place What do you need to know if you're planning to fly during the Covid-19 pandemic? A two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UK is now being enforced. Passengers arriving in the UK by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals -will be asked to provide an address,externalwhere they will self-isolate for 14 days. Travellers can be fined Â£100 for failing to fill in a form with these details. 
Surprise visits will be used to check they are following the rules. Those in Englandcould be fined up to Â£1,000 if they fail to self-isolate.

Cadi Thomas and boyfriend Yusef Rustem, pictured before lockdown, live in separate shared houses We all have had to adapt to life under lockdown. No to families, friends, gatherings... the almost endless list of restrictions goes on. Our colleagues at BBC Wales have talked to three couples about what they have faced trying to maintain relationships. With Wales about to enter its fourth month since severe restrictions were imposed on people's lives,some couples have been unable to see each other. And althoughlockdown measures have been eased, some had to decide whether to move in together or risk not seeing each other indefinitely - in Wales, people from two different households can meet outside, but must remain two metres apart. Truly lockdown love dilemmas. People in Scotland are being advised to stay local for leisure and recreation Scotland has entered the second phase of easing lockdown restrictions. Over the coming weeks shops will start to reopen, work will resume in certain industries, and some of the rules about meeting other people will be relaxed. But not all the changes will take place at the same time, so what can you do in Phase 2, and when? You can read the key details here. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris The number of Covid-19 cases continues to fall in France, so the government is proceeding with the next  step back to normality.   There may be only two more weeks left of term, but from Monday going to school will be compulsory for everyone up to the age of 15, for the first time since March. Only lycÃ©es - which cover the last three years of school education - are not affected.   Schools have in fact been open for several weeks but only on a voluntary basis, and for most it has only been possible to attend for a day or two a week. The change to full schooling is possible because the government has relaxed rules about social distancing between pupils. Also on Monday, cinemas, casinos, swimming pools and holiday centres are opening.  Campsites have been open for two weeks already.  Group sports are also permitted, but not combat sports. With cafes and restaurants all open, and no restrictions on travel, life is for many French beginning to resume its regular rhythms. Life in France is slowly going back to normal A limited schedule is in place until the end of June East Midlands Airport is resuming passenger flightsfor the first time since lockdown measures were introduced in March, with a Ryanair service from Alicante scheduled to be the first to arrive. It is the first time passengers have set foot inside the airport in Castle Donington, Leicestershire, for 12 weeks. The airport is a major UK cargo hub and its freight operations saw it become one of Europe's 10 busiest airports during lockdown. This included flights bringing medical and personal protective equipment to the UK. Chris Lewis, when he was still on the island with his dog Jet A former British paratrooper has left the previously uninhabited island where he had been isolating after lockdown measures were introduced during a fundraising challenge. Chris Lewis, from Swansea, had walked 12,000 miles (19,300km) of the UK coastline after setting off from Wales in August 2017. He was given special permission to live in the only house on Hildasay, Shetland, with his dog Jet,external. ""I feel I left a part of me behind,"" he said. The 39-year-old was originally sleeping in a tent on mainland Shetland when lockdown restrictions were imposed on 23 March. This is the only house on the island He was offered the keys to a former shepherd's hut on Hildasay when its owners heard he was camping. The hut had no running water, heating or electricity. A regular boat brought him fresh water and coal. He collected driftwood, foraged and fished for food, and always made sure he had a three-week supply of dog food for Jet. He said he had been ""the happiest I've ever been"" while living on the island. The new powers will cover firms such as pharmaceutical companies The UK government will introduce new measures on Monday toprotect businesses critical to public health from foreign takeovers. Legal changes would give ministers extra powers to protect those needed to help in future pandemics, who might be struggling now. The new powers will cover firms such as pharmaceutical companies. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""The UK is open for investment, but not for exploitation."" Some much-needed inspiring news: South Korean golfer Ryu So-yeon won the Korean Open by a shot and then donated her $200,000 (Â£160,000) prize to coronavirus charities. Ryu, a former world number one who has previously given her winnings to charity, said the idea had come to her the previous evening. ""Before the awards ceremony, I called my mom. I told her that I'm going to make the announcement so don't get too surprised. She was just as happy I was,"" she told local media. ""Since this tournament has a lot of meaning to me and I thought that I may be able to play better if I had a positive goal, I came up with it last night."" Well done! All shops in Northern Ireland have been able to reopen since Friday Northern Ireland's chief medical officer has cautioned against complacency after latest figures showed no further coronavirus-linked deaths being reported on Sunday. Dr Michael McBride said progress was being made in ""forcing the virus into retreat"" but warned that ""now is not the time to drop guard"". The overall death toll recorded by Northern Ireland's Department of Health remains at 545. The suppression of the virus there has prompted Stormont ministers to quicken alocal exit out of lockdown. From 26 June, caravan parks, campsites and self-contained tourist accommodation will be able to reopen. A week later on 3 July, hotels, restaurants, cafes, coffee shops, pubs and bars will be able to welcome customers back. Church services are set to resume on 29 June. Quarantined workers in the town of Verl clashed with police on Saturday The leader of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia has ruled out sweeping local lockdown measures despite an outbreak centred on a meat processing plant near the town of GÃ¼tersloh that has caused at least 1,300 new cases. Armin Laschet said there was an ""enormous pandemic risk"" but the outbreak was ""clearly centred on the firm"" and there was no ""significant tranmission"" to the wider population. Laschet said a lockdown could not be ruled out entirely but efforts would focus on preventing infections spreading to the population at large and this would enable more targeted measures to deal with the outbreak. On Saturday disturbances broke out at accommodation used by TÃ¶nnies staff in the nearby town of Verl where 700 people had been put into quarantine. ""Around 200 people tried to get out, but 500 people complied
with quarantine rules,"" Uwe lÃ¼hrig, head of police in the GÃ¶ttingen area, told reporters. Eight police officers were injured during clashes with residents wielding bottles, fireworks and metal bars, he said. Some 6,500 workers and their families have been told to go into quarantine to contain the outbreak. Holiday spots in Wales like Tenby have suffered from a lack of visitors Britain'slockdown ruleshave had a devastating effect on its tourism industry and the chances of having a summer break abroad seem remote. Theholiday industry in parts of the UKlooks set to start operating again during July and tourism chiefs in Wales say they are ready to capitalise on any opportunities to resume business. ""We have lost an awful lot... we've lost Easter, we've lost two bank holidays,"" said Andrew Campbell of the Wales Tourism Alliance. He said that 97% of businesses within the industry in Wales have closed due to the pandemic and 80% of staff have been furloughed. ""People are suffering,"" he added. Â© 2025 BBC.

James Furlong, head of history at Holt School in Wokingham, was described as ""a very kind and gentle man"" with ""a real sense of duty"". ""He truly inspired everyone he taught,"" wrote co-heads Anne Kennedy and Katie Pearce, in a statement. Three people died in the attack and three others were injured.

Police have described the killing of three people in Reading's Forbury Gardens as an ""horrific act"". Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) said in a statement: ""Our thoughts and prayers
continue to be with the families who will be mourning loved ones after this
horrific act, and to all those who have been affected by it."" They added the investigation ""continues to move at a fast pace"". Police cordons will continue to remain in place in Reading town centre while detectives work through the crime scene. They also confirmed that the 25-year-old man from
Reading, who was arrested initially on suspicion of murder, has now
been re-arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 by detectives from
CTPSE, which gives them more time to hold him in custody.  Khairi Saadallah held over three deaths came to the attention of security services in 2019, sources say. Andre Rhoden-PaulBBC News Some of Reading's busiest streets and thoroughfares lay eerily quiet this afternoon, as a maze of police cordons around the town blocked them off to the public. Those cordons with a view of Forbury Gardens attracted onlookers: not for its tranquil and pruned gardens but as a place now associated with three killings being treated as a ""terrorist incident"". Photographers could be seen snapping pictures of scene of crime officers in white boiler suits, while TV news crews - some from foreign networks - were using the park as a backdrop for live reports. Reading is front and centre-stage. Tomorrow's lessons have been cancelled at the school were James Furlong worked. The Holt School will remain open and counsellors will be available for all pupils and staff. Support staff will also be on hand for all year groups at the site in Wokingham between 08:30 and 15:15 BST on Monday. Meanwhile, the nearby St Paul's Church will be open from 09:00, for pupils wishing to light a candle, say a prayer, or talk. The school says it will create
a book of memories for Mr Furlong, to which members of the school can contribute. Pupils taught by James Furlong and their parents, have paid tribute to him after the news he was killed in the Reading terror attack. Jade Simon, a pupil at The Holt school from 2012-2017, told the PA news agency: ""He really was an incredible teacher. ""He was funny and kind and always made history fun and entertaining. History was always one of my favourite subjects and Mr Furlong always encouraged it."" Keith Power, whose daughter attends the school, said: ""He was a wonderful man. He was so helpful and supportive of my daughter. He had a real passion for history and teaching and was so caring of his pupils. ""It's so senseless. So much hatred in the world right now. I fear for my kids' futures."" ""He truly inspired everyone he taught,"" wrote co-heads Anne Kennedy and Katie Pearce, of their head of history James Furlong. In a letter to parents they added: ""He was determined that our students would develop a critical awareness of global issues
and in doing so, become active citizens and have a voice."" Mr Furlong wasone of three people killed in the attackon Saturday. James Furlonghas been named as one of the victimsof the attack in Reading. Mr Furlong was a teacher at Holt School in Wokingham, where he was head of history, government and politics. A letter was sent to parents of children at the school describing him as ""a very kind and gentle man"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Linda SerckBBC South As a police helicopter flies overhead, people in Reading have been reacting to the news that last night's stabbings are being considered a terror incident. Oliver Connor, from Tilehurst, Reading said the attacks were ""shocking"". ""It's not something you expect
from a town like Reading. I think people have been so preoccupied by the
pandemic that people forget that this sort of risk exists,"" she added. Belle Tunheim, from Slough, said: ""I'm in disbelief. It could
be that he might have a mental issue. You can never tell until it's been
investigated properly."" Harry McCarthy, who has lived in Reading for eight years,
said: ""I'm disgusted with the way things are going in this country. What's going on in our society?"" The UK prime minister says that if there are lessons to learn after the terror attack the government will learn them. Police and counter terror officers have urged members of the public not to post footage or images of the attack on social media. Assistant commissioner for Metroplitan Police, Neil Basu, instead asked for footage to be shared with police. He said the risk of terror attacks remained ""substantial"". However, he said members of the public should be ""alert not alarmed"" and report anything suspicious. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent Security sources have told the BBC that the man
suspected of carrying out the Reading attack was brought to the attention of
MI5 in 2019. Sources say that Khairi Saadallah came to the attention of the
security services after they received information that he had aspirations to
travel abroad, potentially for terrorism. When the information was further
investigated, as the first stage of looking into a potential lead, no genuine
threat or immediate risk was identified. No case file was opened which would
have made him a target for further investigation. Greg Wilton said he was having a picnic in the park with his wife and friends when the attacks happened. He said: ""At
one point without much noise we noticed a commotion on the other side of the
park. ""We ran over and without seeing an attacker we found three men lying on the
floor bleeding profusely from what we thought was their heads, necks or body. ""Another member of the public took off his T-shirt and tried to stop the
bleeding alongside someone we assume to be his girlfriend. ""Me and my friend Tom
put a second victim in the recovery position and tried to stem his bleeding
from his ear with my canvas shopping bag. ""His breathing became increasingly
irregular, and shallower until the police and paramedic arrived to help us. ""Another friend of mine Ranveer helped an Asian man who had also been stabbed in
the face. ""This was in another part of the park from the victims we were helping
and so we were separated. ""My wife Amy and I are obviously very shocked and
shaken by what happened."" Three people have died in a stabbing attack in Reading's town centre. Here is what we also know, so far: Lawrence Wort told the BBC he saw a man stab several people in Forbury Gardens in the town. He said he thought it was a scuffle between the attacker and a group in the park. ""He stood up and I saw a massive knife in his hand. Probably at least 5in minimum. ""And then he turned and started looking towards us and that's when I just started shouting 'run'."" This video can not be played The Labour leader Sir Keir
Starmer has said ""people are united in their grief"" following the terror
attack in Reading. ""This was a horrific
incident, our thoughts and our hearts go out to all those affected,
particularly the family and friends of those who tragically died,"" he said. ""I think
across Reading, across the country, people are united in their grief at this
incident.â ""Itâs very important that the
investigation runs its course, but I will want to work with the government in
response to this, to look at whether thereâs lessons that can be learned,
whether there need to be changes to the law. ""This is not a time for party
politics."" Chief Constable John Campbell from Thames Valley Police said ""lives have been devastated"" by the attack in Reading. He said a suspect was apprehended within five minutes of the attack starting and praised the bravery of his officers. ""A number of members of the public"" also helped at the scene, he said, thanking them. He said there was ""no wider risk to the public"" and it was believed ""no-one else is involved"". People have left flowers and messages near the scene of the stabbings in Reading. One reads: ""There are no words that anyone can say to express how horrible and senseless this was."" While another simply states: ""Reading weeps."" Three people died and three others were taken to hospitalafter the attack in Forbury Gardens on Saturday evening. On Sunday morning large parts of the town centre remained cordoned off as police continue their investigation. Police have arrested one man and declared the stabbings that left three people dead a terrorist incident. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The black is where we still need modern measurements at a reasonable resolution We've just become a little less ignorant about Planet Earth. The initiative that seeks to galvanise the creation of a full map of the ocean floor says one-fifth of this task has now been completed. When theNippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project,externalwas launched in 2017, only 6% of the global ocean bottom had been surveyed to what might be called modern standards. That number now stands at 19%, up from 15% in just the last year. Some 14.5 million sq km of new bathymetric (depth) data was included in the GEBCO grid in 2019 - an area equivalent to almost twice that of Australia. It does, however, still leave a great swathe of the planet in need of mapping to an acceptable degree. ""Today we stand at the 19% level. That means we've got another 81% of the oceans still to survey, still to map. That's an area about twice the size of Mars that we have to capture in the next decade,"" project director Jamie McMichael-Phillips told BBC News. Son repeats father's historic ocean dive 'Stunning' seafloor ridges record Antarctic retreat Satellites find 'thousands' of new ocean mountains Robot duo wins ocean-mapping XPRIZE A state-of-the-art multibeam echosounder is slung below a survey ship The map at the top of this page illustrates the challenge faced by GEBCO in the coming years. Black represents those areas where we have yet to get direct echosounding measurements of the shape of the ocean floor. Blues correspond to water depth (deeper is purple, shallower is lighter blue). It's not true to say we have no idea of what's in the black zones; satellites have actually taught us a great deal. Certain spacecraft carryaltimeter instruments that can infer seafloor topographyfrom the way its gravity sculpts the water surface above - but this only gives a best resolution at over a kilometre, and Seabed 2030 has a desire for a resolution of at least 100m everywhere. Satellites: The shape of the sea surface traces at coarse resolution the shape of the seafloor Better seafloor maps are needed for a host of reasons. They are essential for navigation, of course, and for laying underwater cables and pipelines. They are also important for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around the underwater mountains that wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot. In addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water. This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a critical role in moving heat around the planet. And if you want to understand precisely how sea-levels will rise in different parts  of the world, good ocean-floor maps are a must. Much of the data that's been imported into the GEBCO grid recently has been in existence for some time but was ""sitting on a shelf"" out of the public domain. The companies, institutions and governments that were holding this information have now handed it over - and there is probably a lot more of this hidden resource still to be released. The Mariana Trench in the Pacific is the deepest ocean location on Earth - but very well mapped But new acquisitions will also be required. Some of these will come from a great crowdsourcing effort - from ships, big and small, routinely operating their echo-sounding equipment as they transit the globe. Even small vessels - fishing boats and yachts - can play their part by attaching data-loggers to their sonar and navigation equipment. One very effective strategy is evidenced by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), which operates in the more remote parts of the globe - and that is simply to mix up the routes taken by ships. ""Very early on we adopted the ethos that data should be collected on passage - on the way to where we were going, not just at the site of interest,"" explained BAS scientist Dr Rob Larter. ""A beautiful example of this isthe recent bathymetric map of the Drake Passage area,external(between South America and Antarctica). A lot of that was acquired by different research projects as they fanned out and moved back and forth to the places they were going."" Artwork: Robot vessels can help close the gaps New technology will be absolutely central to the GEBCO quest. Ocean Infinity, a prominent UK-US company that conducts seafloor surveys, is currently buildinga fleet of robotic surface vesselsthrough a subsidiary it calls Armada. This start-up's MD, Dan Hook, says low-cost, uncrewed vehicles may be the only way to close some of the gaps in the more out-of-the-way locations in the 2030 grid. He told BBC News: ""When you look at the the mapping of the seabed in areas closer to shore, you see the business case very quickly. Whether it's for wind farms or cable-laying - there are lots of people that want to know what's down there. But when it's those very remote areas of the planet, the case then is really only a scientific one."" Jamie McMichael-Phillips is confident his project's target can be met if everyone pulls together. ""I am confident, but to do it we will need partnerships. We need governments, we need industry, we need academics, we need philanthropists, and we need citizen scientists. We need all these individuals to come together if we're to deliver an ocean map that is absolutely fundamental and essential to humankind."" GEBCO stands for General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans. It is the only intergovernmental organisation with a mandate to map the entire ocean floor. The latest status of its Seabed 2030 project was announced to coincide with World Hydrography Day.

The government is set to announce its review We're almost done but before we go here's a recap of  Sunday's major developments: Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Apple has said it is âcommitted to working with the UK
governmentâ. Its statement follows claims by Health Secretary Matt Hancock
that his original plan to launch a contact-tracing app might have
worked had it not been for Appleâs unwillingness to compromise over
restrictions it places on third-party appsâ use of Bluetooth on iPhones. On Thursday, the government abandoned its original plan andswitched to a technology co-developed by Apple and Google. Apple's statement was prompted by an interview Mr Hancock gave to
Sky News on Sunday morning in which he said: ""Apple have in the past
also been intransigent in the face of perfectly reasonable requests from
democratically-elected governments to work with them on solving particular
problems, whether that's about solutions to terrorism, or other technical
problems."" In response, Apple said: ""Weâve been
constant collaborators with NHSX and will continue working with them on ways to
further optimise the technology while protecting our customersâ privacy. Many
countries have successfully launched Exposure Notification apps and we look
forward to helping the UK government do the same.â  World number 19 tennis player Grigor Dimitrov has tested positive for coronavirus.

A lockdown ban on weddings and civil partnerships in Wales will be lifted from Monday - but there will be no big celebrations allowed. The announcement was added tonew rules published by the Welsh government.,external However, the ban on social gatherings remains, as do social distancing rules and staying local, which advise travelling no more than five miles. Non-essential shops will also reopen on Monday, as moves to relax the Covid-19 restrictions in Wales continue. The new wedding measures follow calls from couples to marry, even if it means a ceremony with just witnesses and a registrar. Dubai is easing more coronavirus-related restrictions Dubai has announced that residents will be allowed to return from Monday, as restrictions imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus are eased. According to a series of measures announced, they will all be tested at airports upon arrival. For those infected, a 14-day quarantine will be mandatory. Tourists will be allowed in from 7 July, although they will be required to present a recent Covid-19 negative certificate or undergo testing at Dubai airports. Again, for those infected, a 14-day quarantine will be imposed. You can find out more details here.,external  The government is facing calls to ease the social-distancing rule in England The government will outline proposals on how to safely
reduce the two-metre social-distancing rule in England this week. The distance could be lowered with ""mitigations"",
so people can be closer without a higher risk of transmission, Health Secretary
Matt Hancock told the BBC. But
what does the science say?Find out more here. There have been more than 300,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 42,500 people have died, government figures show. However, these numbers only include people who have been tested and the total number of deaths relating to the virus is likely to be higher. Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the weekly number of recorded deaths has returned to close to normal levels for the time of year. You can check on the number of cases and deaths in your area here. The coronavirus reproduction
rate in Germany, known as the R number, jumped to 2.88 on Sunday, compared to 1.79 a day earlier, according to the country's Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health. The RKI said the figure was based on a four-day average, and the spike is mainly because of local outbreaks, such as at the meat processing plant in in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where more than 1,300 workers have been infected. The R number is the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average. In Germany, this now means that out of 100 people with Covid-19, a further 288 will be infected. An R value of less than one is needed to gradually contain the disease. Our colleague James Gallagher has looked intohow the R number is calculated. A two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UK is now in place What do you need to know if you're planning to fly during the Covid-19 pandemic? A two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UK is now being enforced. Passengers arriving in the UK by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals -will be asked to provide an address,externalwhere they will self-isolate for 14 days. Travellers can be fined Â£100 for failing to fill in a form with these details. 
Surprise visits will be used to check they are following the rules. Those in Englandcould be fined up to Â£1,000 if they fail to self-isolate.

But not all the changes will take place at the same time, so what can you do in Phase 2, and when? You can read the key details here. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris The number of Covid-19 cases continues to fall in France, so the government is proceeding with the next  step back to normality.   There may be only two more weeks left of term, but from Monday going to school will be compulsory for everyone up to the age of 15, for the first time since March. Only lycÃ©es - which cover the last three years of school education - are not affected.   Schools have in fact been open for several weeks but only on a voluntary basis, and for most it has only been possible to attend for a day or two a week. The change to full schooling is possible because the government has relaxed rules about social distancing between pupils. Also on Monday, cinemas, casinos, swimming pools and holiday centres are opening.  Campsites have been open for two weeks already.  Group sports are also permitted, but not combat sports. With cafes and restaurants all open, and no restrictions on travel, life is for many French beginning to resume its regular rhythms. Life in France is slowly going back to normal A limited schedule is in place until the end of June East Midlands Airport is resuming passenger flightsfor the first time since lockdown measures were introduced in March, with a Ryanair service from Alicante scheduled to be the first to arrive. It is the first time passengers have set foot inside the airport in Castle Donington, Leicestershire, for 12 weeks. The airport is a major UK cargo hub and its freight operations saw it become one of Europe's 10 busiest airports during lockdown. This included flights bringing medical and personal protective equipment to the UK. Chris Lewis, when he was still on the island with his dog Jet A former British paratrooper has left the previously uninhabited island where he had been isolating after lockdown measures were introduced during a fundraising challenge. Chris Lewis, from Swansea, had walked 12,000 miles (19,300km) of the UK coastline after setting off from Wales in August 2017. He was given special permission to live in the only house on Hildasay, Shetland, with his dog Jet,external. ""I feel I left a part of me behind,"" he said. The 39-year-old was originally sleeping in a tent on mainland Shetland when lockdown restrictions were imposed on 23 March. This is the only house on the island He was offered the keys to a former shepherd's hut on Hildasay when its owners heard he was camping. The hut had no running water, heating or electricity. A regular boat brought him fresh water and coal. He collected driftwood, foraged and fished for food, and always made sure he had a three-week supply of dog food for Jet. He said he had been ""the happiest I've ever been"" while living on the island. The new powers will cover firms such as pharmaceutical companies The UK government will introduce new measures on Monday toprotect businesses critical to public health from foreign takeovers. Legal changes would give ministers extra powers to protect those needed to help in future pandemics, who might be struggling now. The new powers will cover firms such as pharmaceutical companies.

Ryu, a former world number one who has previously given her winnings to charity, said the idea had come to her the previous evening. ""Before the awards ceremony, I called my mom. I told her that I'm going to make the announcement so don't get too surprised. She was just as happy I was,"" she told local media.

All shops in Northern Ireland have been able to reopen since Friday Northern Ireland's chief medical officer has cautioned against complacency after latest figures showed no further coronavirus-linked deaths being reported on Sunday. Dr Michael McBride said progress was being made in ""forcing the virus into retreat"" but warned that ""now is not the time to drop guard"". The overall death toll recorded by Northern Ireland's Department of Health remains at 545. The suppression of the virus there has prompted Stormont ministers to quicken alocal exit out of lockdown. From 26 June, caravan parks, campsites and self-contained tourist accommodation will be able to reopen. A week later on 3 July, hotels, restaurants, cafes, coffee shops, pubs and bars will be able to welcome customers back. Church services are set to resume on 29 June. Quarantined workers in the town of Verl clashed with police on Saturday The leader of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia has ruled out sweeping local lockdown measures despite an outbreak centred on a meat processing plant near the town of GÃ¼tersloh that has caused at least 1,300 new cases. Armin Laschet said there was an ""enormous pandemic risk"" but the outbreak was ""clearly centred on the firm"" and there was no ""significant tranmission"" to the wider population. Laschet said a lockdown could not be ruled out entirely but efforts would focus on preventing infections spreading to the population at large and this would enable more targeted measures to deal with the outbreak. On Saturday disturbances broke out at accommodation used by TÃ¶nnies staff in the nearby town of Verl where 700 people had been put into quarantine. ""Around 200 people tried to get out, but 500 people complied
with quarantine rules,"" Uwe lÃ¼hrig, head of police in the GÃ¶ttingen area, told reporters. Eight police officers were injured during clashes with residents wielding bottles, fireworks and metal bars, he said. Some 6,500 workers and their families have been told to go into quarantine to contain the outbreak. Holiday spots in Wales like Tenby have suffered from a lack of visitors Britain'slockdown ruleshave had a devastating effect on its tourism industry and the chances of having a summer break abroad seem remote. Theholiday industry in parts of the UKlooks set to start operating again during July and tourism chiefs in Wales say they are ready to capitalise on any opportunities to resume business. ""We have lost an awful lot... we've lost Easter, we've lost two bank holidays,"" said Andrew Campbell of the Wales Tourism Alliance. He said that 97% of businesses within the industry in Wales have closed due to the pandemic and 80% of staff have been furloughed. ""People are suffering,"" he added. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The government will introduce new measures on Monday to protect businesses critical to public health from foreign takeovers. Changes to legislation would give ministers extra powers to protect those needed to help in future pandemics, who might be struggling now. The new powers will cover firms such as pharmaceutical companies. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""The UK is open for investment, but not for exploitation."" The government already has the power to scrutinise takeovers for several reasons, including national security or financial stability. It may block a takeover or seek assurances from a buyer about their plans for a company. But changes to the 2002 Enterprise Act will mean that the government can intervene if a business that is involved in a pandemic response - a personal protective equipment (PPE) manufacturer, for example - is the target of a takeover by a foreign firm. They will also expand the government's ability to scrutinise takeovers involving companies who work in artificial intelligence or encryption technology. ""I think it is a significant development,"" Peter Harper, partner in the competition, EU and trade team at law firm Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC. ""It gives them a greater power to intervene."" ""The government's track record of intervention has basically increased over time,"" he said. So far, the government hasn't stopped a deal based on national security grounds, he said, but they have imposed conditions on buyers. It brings the government into line with countries like France, Germany, Italy and Spain, he said, where the EU has been keeping a stricter eye on potential purchases. The economic disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic ""may mean that some businesses with critical capabilities are more susceptible to takeovers"", the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said in a statement. ""These powers will send an important signal to those seeking to take advantage of those struggling as a results of the pandemic that the UK government is prepared to act where necessary to protect our national security,"" Mr Sharma said. It follows the April announcement of European Union (EU) plans to help block foreign takeovers of European firms struggling with the virus downturn. It wants to allow governments to invest in ""weak"" companies, which could include some form of ownership. While it called them ""measures of last resort"", the European Commission said it was consulting member states. In March, the European Commission issued guidelines to ensure a strong EU-wide approach to foreign investment screening ""in a time of public health crisis and related economic vulnerability"". The UK formally left the EU on 31 January, but is currently in a transition period until the end of the year. During this period, the UK will continue to follow all of the EU's rules and its trading relationship will remain the same. 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented?

"The black is where we still need modern measurements at a reasonable resolution We've just become a little less ignorant about Planet Earth. The initiative that seeks to galvanise the creation of a full map of the ocean floor says one-fifth of this task has now been completed. When theNippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project,externalwas launched in 2017, only 6% of the global ocean bottom had been surveyed to what might be called modern standards. That number now stands at 19%, up from 15% in just the last year. Some 14.5 million sq km of new bathymetric (depth) data was included in the GEBCO grid in 2019 - an area equivalent to almost twice that of Australia. It does, however, still leave a great swathe of the planet in need of mapping to an acceptable degree. ""Today we stand at the 19% level. That means we've got another 81% of the oceans still to survey, still to map. That's an area about twice the size of Mars that we have to capture in the next decade,"" project director Jamie McMichael-Phillips told BBC News. Son repeats father's historic ocean dive 'Stunning' seafloor ridges record Antarctic retreat Satellites find 'thousands' of new ocean mountains Robot duo wins ocean-mapping XPRIZE A state-of-the-art multibeam echosounder is slung below a survey ship The map at the top of this page illustrates the challenge faced by GEBCO in the coming years. Black represents those areas where we have yet to get direct echosounding measurements of the shape of the ocean floor. Blues correspond to water depth (deeper is purple, shallower is lighter blue). It's not true to say we have no idea of what's in the black zones; satellites have actually taught us a great deal. Certain spacecraft carryaltimeter instruments that can infer seafloor topographyfrom the way its gravity sculpts the water surface above - but this only gives a best resolution at over a kilometre, and Seabed 2030 has a desire for a resolution of at least 100m everywhere. Satellites: The shape of the sea surface traces at coarse resolution the shape of the seafloor Better seafloor maps are needed for a host of reasons. They are essential for navigation, of course, and for laying underwater cables and pipelines. They are also important for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around the underwater mountains that wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot. In addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water. This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a critical role in moving heat around the planet. And if you want to understand precisely how sea-levels will rise in different parts  of the world, good ocean-floor maps are a must. Much of the data that's been imported into the GEBCO grid recently has been in existence for some time but was ""sitting on a shelf"" out of the public domain. The companies, institutions and governments that were holding this information have now handed it over - and there is probably a lot more of this hidden resource still to be released. The Mariana Trench in the Pacific is the deepest ocean location on Earth - but very well mapped But new acquisitions will also be required. Some of these will come from a great crowdsourcing effort - from ships, big and small, routinely operating their echo-sounding equipment as they transit the globe. Even small vessels - fishing boats and yachts - can play their part by attaching data-loggers to their sonar and navigation equipment. One very effective strategy is evidenced by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), which operates in the more remote parts of the globe - and that is simply to mix up the routes taken by ships. ""Very early on we adopted the ethos that data should be collected on passage - on the way to where we were going, not just at the site of interest,"" explained BAS scientist Dr Rob Larter. ""A beautiful example of this isthe recent bathymetric map of the Drake Passage area,external(between South America and Antarctica). A lot of that was acquired by different research projects as they fanned out and moved back and forth to the places they were going."" Artwork: Robot vessels can help close the gaps New technology will be absolutely central to the GEBCO quest. Ocean Infinity, a prominent UK-US company that conducts seafloor surveys, is currently buildinga fleet of robotic surface vesselsthrough a subsidiary it calls Armada. This start-up's MD, Dan Hook, says low-cost, uncrewed vehicles may be the only way to close some of the gaps in the more out-of-the-way locations in the 2030 grid. He told BBC News: ""When you look at the the mapping of the seabed in areas closer to shore, you see the business case very quickly. Whether it's for wind farms or cable-laying - there are lots of people that want to know what's down there. But when it's those very remote areas of the planet, the case then is really only a scientific one."" Jamie McMichael-Phillips is confident his project's target can be met if everyone pulls together. ""I am confident, but to do it we will need partnerships. We need governments, we need industry, we need academics, we need philanthropists, and we need citizen scientists. We need all these individuals to come together if we're to deliver an ocean map that is absolutely fundamental and essential to humankind."" GEBCO stands for General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans. It is the only intergovernmental organisation with a mandate to map the entire ocean floor. The latest status of its Seabed 2030 project was announced to coincide with World Hydrography Day.

"In Room 3324 of Moscow's Metropol hotel, Paul Whelan was getting dressed for a friend's wedding when Russian intelligence officers burst in. The American disappeared without trace for three days until his twin stumbled across a news report announcing that his brother had been charged with espionage. That was New Year's Eve 2018 and the start of a case that would embroil four western governments and pile pressure on relations with Russia that had already sunk to a post-Cold War low. Almost 18 months later, Whelan has been convicted of spying - receiving Russian state secrets - after a short trial conducted entirely behind closed doors. The former US Marine - who also has British, Irish and Canadian citizenship - has always insisted on his innocence, and in court this week he described himself the victim of ""greasy, slimy Russian politics"". As his family step-up their appeals to bring him home, officials in Moscow are already hinting at a possible prisoner swap adding to suspicions that the man from Michigan is a pawn in a political game that has yet to play out. On 15 June, it took the chief judge just 1 minute 20 seconds to reach the key words in his verdict. ""Moscow City Courtâ¦finds Paul Nicholas Whelan guilty,"" he read from the typed sheet, adding that the 16-year sentence would be served in a high-security facility for the most dangerous offenders. The judge then turned to address the defendant, who was standing in a glass cage guarded by two FSB security officers in black balaclavas. Watching from the wooden courtroom benches, socially distanced and in medical facemasks, were the ambassadors of the US, UK and Canada. ""Whelan, do you understand the sentence?"" he asked. Paul Whelan's sentencing in court The American, whose glasses, side parting and blue sweater that he wore to each court appearance gave him the look of a neat, middle-aged librarian, looked back at the judge blankly. His Russian wasn't up to this. ""Nothing's translated, Your Honour,"" the 50-year-old protested, sending an interpreter scurrying over to explain his fate. The three judges swept off the podium and out of court. It was a flat, abrupt end to a spy trial that had taken just a handful of closed hearings. Moscow's Covid-19 lockdown had cloaked proceedings in an even thicker layer of secrecy, with both press and public barred from the building right up until the final verdict. The first time I saw Whelan in court, well over a year ago, he arrived with a weak smile and a brown cardboard box hugged to his chest containing a packed prison lunch. He was flanked by FSB guards, faces covered so they couldn't be identified. State TV crews, hovering for their shots in the hallway, were already referring to the accused man as ""the American spy"". Paul Whelan would be brought for multiple custody hearings and appeals over the months and we squeezed in almost every time. Although we were only allowed to attend for the opening remarks, we managed to snatch several conversations with him. That first day, though - in a cage, with a dozen cameras trained on him - he looked tense and spoke little. Almost two months had passed since his arrest, and he said he was coping ""fine"". But when I asked for his side of the story, his eyes flicked towards the guards. ""If I do that, I'll be in a bad way,"" Whelan told me, warily. ""They don't want me to speak with you."" A member of his defence team has since revealed that he was coming under intense pressure from the FSB to confess, interrogated several times without his lawyers present. ""[They'd say] things like, 'There's no hope for you, tell us the truth. You're a spy, you'll be convicted,'"" Olga Karlova told me last summer. The American refused and as his time in custody was extended repeatedly, he gradually grew bolder in court. Paul Whelan arrives handcuffed and holds a personal statement up in court Whelan, who at the time of his arrest was the head of global security for a US-based car parts firm, began to denounce the charge of espionage as ""ridiculous"", and declare that he was being tried by a ""kangaroo court"". He'd prepare a speech for each session, writing it out on a sheet of paper vetted and stamped by the prison censors. ""Russia says it caught James Bond on a spy mission,"" Whelan announced one day, as we waited for the judge. ""In reality, they abducted Mr Bean on holiday."" By then, we'd learned that the American had visited Russia multiple times. On his latest trip, in December 2018, he was in Moscow for the wedding of a fellow ex-Marine to a Russian woman. But Whelan never made it to the ceremony. He was arrested in his room, just hours after showing some of the other wedding guests around the grounds of the Kremlin. Paul Whelan's Instagram posts So, at a court hearing late last year, I raised my voice over a wall of bailiffs to ask him once again what had happened. He paused a little, before calling back. ""I'm not allowed to give you details, but I can tell you I was set-up. I did not commit a crime,"" Whelan said, telling me that a friend had turned-up at his hotel that evening unannounced. When Whelan was arrested, the FSB found a USB drive in his pocket containing the classified information it alleges he had requested. He now told me his friend had planted the device in his pocket, without him realising. ""That person was an FSB officer. He's someone I've known for ten years,"" he revealed for the first time. ""There's absolutely no reason he should have been in my room and no reason he should have given me any sort of device."" When the judge returned to court, to extend his stay in prison once again, Whelan's frustration erupted. ""I can talk louder than you, Your Honour,"" he shouted from the cage. ""As my cousins in England would say, this is complete bollocks."" At that, the judge ordered the TV cameras to be removed from court. Filming was barred at all future hearings to stop the press capturing any more protests. The Russian government declared Paul Whelan guilty long ago. Just two weeks after his arrest, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov declared that the American had been caught ""red-handed"" conducting a ""concrete, illegal act"". The case was immediately big news that grew further when it emerged that Whelan was a citizen of four countries. Born in Canada to British parents of Irish heritage, he later moved to the US entitling him to multiple passports as a result. Paul Whelan was a US police officer when he was younger In early 2019, the drama of his now multi-national arrest was developing against a hostile political backdrop, with mutual sanctions over the Ukraine crisis and East-West tension not felt since Soviet times. Nine months earlier, the UK had accused Russia of poisoning Sergei Skripal, a former double-agent, on the streets of Salisbury. At the same time, Washington was still accusing Moscow of meddling in its elections. So when Whelan's plight became public, there was speculation that he could be the human collateral. The FSB was already dripping details of the case it would make in court. The Russian Rosbalt news agency quoted a source claiming that Whelan was working directly for US intelligence, tasked with obtaining a list of personnel at ""one of Russia's secret institutions"". It said that information was the object of ""intense interest"" to the Americans, and that Whelan had been cultivating potential contacts, online, for over a decade. Spy trials in Russia are not only heard in secret, the defence lawyers have to sign non-disclosure agreements covering the entire case. So no evidence - the wire taps or surveillance footage the case is reportedly based on - has been made public. In Whelan's case, there's the added nuance that his defence team were appointed and paid for by the Russian state. His family decided not to change them, reasoning that a bill of over $150,000 (Â£121,000) was ""an awful lot of resources for what would have been zero impact"". ""Secrecy, provocation and falsification, that's the arsenal of our opponents,"" says Ivan Pavlov, a human rights lawyer who has gone up against the FSB in many espionage cases. He mostly represents Russians accused of selling secrets to the West and says the number of such cases has grown significantly since the political climate turned cold again in 2014. The lawyer warns that the FSB is the ""mightiest secret service, not only in Russia,"" and uses its own experts to examine any evidence for the court. ""If you've got mixed up in something like this, then you're in the most complicated story of your life,"" Ivan Pavlov says. ""It will be very difficult to mount a defence."" Paul Whelan's travels in Russia began more than a decade ago. ""This is 'Lubyanka' where the KGB has our spies locked in the basement!!"", he joked in 2007 on a personal website. The image was of the headquarters of Russia's notorious security services, now known as the FSB. Eleven years later, its officers would drive him there for interrogation. Lubyanka, FSB headquarters in Moscow The photograph dates from Whelan's first trip to Moscow, made while he was serving with the US military in Iraq. That year he told a Marines news site that he'd taken advantage of a programme that funded a two-week break abroad for those on long deployments. Whelan had plumped to visit Russia, explaining that, for a ""single man like me"" the scheme was ""an opportunity to travel throughout the worldâ¦and experience the diversity of culture"". Since his arrest, the Marine Corps has disclosed that he was discharged in 2008 for bad conduct, a revelation that ""absolutely stunned"" his twin brother David. ""He was always absolutely positive about the [Marines] experience. There's a Marines' flag flying right below the American flag on my parents' property the whole time,"" David told the BBC from Canada. Paul Whelan as a US marine and the front gate at his parents' property And yet, unknown to those closest to him, Paul had been court-martialled for trying to steal more than $10,000 from the US government. It was with this scandal breaking behind the scenes, that he first headed for Moscow. ""Having grown up during the Cold War, it was a dream of mine to visit Russia and meet some of the sneaky Russians who had kept the western world at bay for so long!!"" Whelan joked back then on his website, which has since been archived. Its pages document the trip with shots of tourist spots and captions laden with exclamation marks. A decade later, he would message home regularly from trips to Russia displaying similar almost child-like wonder at new discoveries. The website content does support later descriptions of Paul Whelan by contacts, colleagues and family as an enthusiastic world traveller who ""made friends pretty much everywhere"" and had an interest in Russian culture. ""I remember making small talk once and I said, 'You travel a lot for work, where do you travel for fun?',"" a former colleague, Skotti Fietsam, told the BBC. ""He said Russia!"" She recalled her surprise at his reply. ""He said it's beautiful and he liked the cold and he had quite a few friends there."" An entire section of his old website is dedicated to the cute cartoon character Cheburashka, describing the big-eared, wide-eyed creature as ""one good thing to come from the Soviet era"". Another link leads to a homemade guide to the Cyrillic alphabet and some basic first words in Russian. Cartoon character Cheburashka The pages also reveal his first friends in the Russian military. Russia would later insinuate, via anonymous sources quoted in the press, that the CIA had selected candidates for Paul Whelan to cultivate for intelligence. It was noticeable, one such report said, that he chose only to befriend men and not ""pretty Russian girls"". Whelan was friends with young servicemen in the US, though, too. His website describes his ""respect and admiration"" for three Naval Academy graduates who'd just joined the Marines. And he didn't hide his interests and encounters. In 2009, he took his own parents to visit Russia, where they've told me they met several of his young friends in military uniform. Paul Whelan with his parents in Moscow Meanwhile, the front page of his website invited visitors to click on the image of a young Russian soldier to learn more about his ""hobbies and military service"". The link led to Maxim, who explained that his new friend, Paul Whelan, was helping with his English which he planned to study at university. The Russian described the two spending several days ""touring Moscow"" together, eating sushi and caviar-filled pancakes. Whelan went on to seek out more Russian friends, using the country's social networking service VK among others. A scroll through their profiles, soon after his arrest, revealed almost all to be men - most considerably younger than him. Some do have clear military connections - including photographs in uniform - though not all, and no-one who replied to my messages had seen any reason to doubt Whelan's motives. One replied to tell me he'd been a student and supermarket night-guard when the American first made contact. The two met in person for a few hours in 2008 when Whelan was touring Russia, visiting multiple friends in various cities. ""I don't believe that Paul is a spy,"" the man wrote to me. ""Iâ¦ don't know anything what [sic] might be interesting to foreign spy."" Paul Whelan photographed with a friend Another man gave his friend a sightseeing tour of his own town that same year. He has no apparent link to the military himself and joked to me via VK that the American ""didn't request to see anything suspicious :))"" A Moscow hairdresser, meanwhile, was contacted by Whelan on Instagram around five years back. They talked about foreign travel and never met. One VK friend still in the military told me the American first messaged when he was a cadet and the two have chatted online two or three times a week ever since. ""He seemed nice and was fascinated by our country, its history and our traditions and people!"" the man replied to my enquiries, adding that his own interest was in the ex-Marine's time in Iraq. He had no idea his friend had been arrested. ""No way? He's the kindest soul! If he's a spy, then I'm Michael Jackson!!!!"" he wrote. The man Whelan accuses of framing him was one of his oldest friends in Russia. He is also a serving intelligence officer. Defence lawyers disclosed some details of the men's relationship early on in the case, including how the American had visited his friend's house in Sergiev Posad outside Moscow for ""saunas and kebabs"" the winter before his arrest. They also said he owed Whelan around 80,000 roubles ($1,147; Â£930) which the FSB claimed was advance payment for intelligence. The defence team said the Russian had requested a loan to buy a gift for his wife, as part of his trap. The town of Sergiev Posad is home to the spiritual centre of the Russian Orthodox Church - the Trinity Lavra of St Sergius The Whelan family eventually found a name and even a photograph. As he still works for the FSB, I can't identify him so I'll call him ""Dmitry"". But Whelan chatted openly to relatives on email about his friend, including which ""FSB school"" he'd attended. '''Dmitry' says hello!"", Whelan breezily told his parents after one Facetime chat with the Russian. It seems unusual behaviour if he was trying to recruit the man for US intelligence. It's possible he even introduced his parents to ""Dmitry"" on their 2009 trip to Russia, they can't be sure. In messages home from Moscow in January 2018 - a free holiday to use up his air miles - the American described visiting restaurants with his agent-friend, as well as the museums of the Kremlin and even a British pub. A year later, just days before his arrest, Mr Whelan took ""Dmitry"" and another man for Christmas dinner at a restaurant opposite his hotel. He snapped a picture of his guests, ""Dmitry"" smiling with a glass of wine and his fork raised over a juicy steak. Labelling it ""Dinner with Tovarishi"", or comrades, he messaged the image to a third Russian friend - even as he was supposedly discussing how to transfer classified intelligence. ""It all sounds incredibly naÃ¯ve now,"" his brother concedes of the relationship, after finally obtaining the passwords for Paul's computers and trawling through his files. He says his brother's VK messages were deleted after his arrest. ""He has friends in other countries with a military background, I think it was a social thing,"" David Whelan argues. ""The FSB thing wasn't a big deal, until he was entrapped."" Paul Whelan's twin brother David Paul Whelan's lawyers have now confirmed that he was being watched for some time and his communications monitored. A recent newspaper report claimed that the American had come to FSB attention over a decade ago when, as Kommersant's source says, he ""actively"" began contacting Russian servicemen. But the espionage case was based entirely on Whelan's ties to one officer, with all the evidence gathered in 2018 shortly before his arrest. ""Had this been an independent court, they would have reached only one decision - not guilty,"" his lawyer, Vladimir Zherebyonkov said after the verdict. He said the evidence was only ever examined by ""incompetent and interested parties"". Paul Whelan's lawyers Vladimir Zherebyonkov and Olga Karlova Ivan Pavlov believes Whelan's claim he was framed is ""always possible"" with FSB intelligence officers. ""The temptation is high: to rise in rank; for promotion; for more stars on your epaulettes,"" the lawyer says. ""This is how FSB careers are made; people rise on the back of such cases, like mushrooms after the rain."" Officers typically bide their time, he explains, calling it ""calf-rearing"", before a target is culled. If so, it appears that Paul Whelan was blind to the threat. In one email exchange during his early 2018 trip to Moscow, a relative joked: ""Don't get into any trouble we can't get you out of, haha!"" ""I will be with guys from the FSB, so should be okay!"", the American wrote back. The surge in East-West tensions has made espionage both more complex - and more urgent - in recent years. After the Salisbury poisoning in early 2018, more than 100 Russian diplomats identified as intelligence agents were expelled from embassies around the world in a co-ordinated act of protest. Russia responded with a mirror mass expulsion of Western diplomats. At the time, one ambassador told me the move had hit Moscow's spying capacity hard. But the same is presumably true in reverse. There were signs of problems even earlier. Almost exactly a year before Paul Whelan's arrest, a Norwegian staying at the same central Moscow hotel was arrested and charged with espionage. A retired border guard, Frode Berg admitted to delivering envelopes of cash and spy instructions on behalf of Norwegian military intelligence agency. Norwegian citizen Frode Berg in a Moscow courtroom, January 2019 His arrest and 14-year prison sentence caused a scandal back home when it emerged that civilians with no diplomatic cover were being used for high-risk espionage. There were even allegations that Norway was under pressure to obtain the information from its partners in Nato. Former CIA officers have dismissed any suggestion that Whelan could be involved in something similar, operating without diplomatic immunity: the idea, floated by one retired Russian officer, that his arrest was a ""great failure"" of US intelligence. The US Embassy and government have been very vocal about Whelan's detention. ""Paul Whelan is innocent,"" Ambassador John Sullivan told me emphatically last week, calling the trial a ""mockery of justice"". US Ambassador John Sullivan outside court after Paul Whelan's sentencing In Frode Berg's case, the Norwegian government stayed quiet. And while Paul Whelan's dishonourable discharge from the Marines shows there are parts of his life of which even his family have no idea, his supporters point to the theft charge as a positive. ""The intelligence community would never use someone with that past, especially in a situation like this when you'd be sent into a very, very difficult environment,"" argues Ryan Fayhee, the family's lawyer in the US who cites intelligence contacts from his days prosecuting cases of counter-espionage. ""It just wouldn't happen,"" Fayhee believes. ""Trust is the most important thing when you are out there, living on the edge."" Perhaps Whelan enjoyed the element of danger that came from flirting with the FSB, hanging out with intelligence officers. One friend who didn't want to be named told me he was ""a little quirky"", and liked to ""push the line a bit"". He wondered whether some comment, or joke might have been disastrously misconstrued. Whelan's own defence lawyer once hinted at that possibility. Skotti Fietsam, his former colleague, found Whelan serious and supportive, but also laughed at how he would insist on using heavily armed guards when he visited the factory she managed in Mexico, even posting them outside restaurants while they ate. ""I don't know if it was machismo; to show off,"" Fietsam said. ""But it was very unusual."" On Whelan's old website, alongside Harry Potter books and War and Peace, his recommended reading includes a long list of Cold War thrillers by Tom Clancy. But there's nothing glamorous about prison life in Lefortovo. The high wall and barbed wire of Lefortovo jail ""The porridge, some days it goes direct to the toilet,"" Frode Berg wrote to me from northern Norway of life in the FSB prison. He's now back home after a prisoner-swap. His own cellmate in Lefortovo used to joke that the inmates were fed dog food in the mornings. ""We never see or meet other prisoners. When we go to a meeting, prisoners were hidden from each other,"" Berg describes the lonely routine of life inside the K-shape jail, whose tall outer walls now butt-up against Soviet apartment blocks. The K-shaped buildings of Moscow's Lefortovo prison Paul Whelan is being held in the renovated wing, where the Norwegian says there is hot water in the cells now as well as a fridge, TV and toilet. But the space measures 9.5 square metres between two prisoners and exercise is one hour a day on the roof. Cellmates get to shower once a week, together, in the basement. One light remains on in the cell 24/7. Whelan and his family say letters have been held back for months by investigators and parcels returned. He wasn't allowed a phone call home for 16 months. And adding to his discomfort was chronic pain from a hernia that eventually strangulated, resulting in emergency surgery.

""No-one's hiding that, everyone talks about it, all the officials,"" he told the press. So the prisoner who has always called himself a political hostage is now looking to the politicians to do a deal for his release.

"In Room 3324 of Moscow's Metropol hotel, Paul Whelan was getting dressed for a friend's wedding when Russian intelligence officers burst in. The American disappeared without trace for three days until his twin stumbled across a news report announcing that his brother had been charged with espionage. That was New Year's Eve 2018 and the start of a case that would embroil four western governments and pile pressure on relations with Russia that had already sunk to a post-Cold War low. Almost 18 months later, Whelan has been convicted of spying - receiving Russian state secrets - after a short trial conducted entirely behind closed doors. The former US Marine - who also has British, Irish and Canadian citizenship - has always insisted on his innocence, and in court this week he described himself the victim of ""greasy, slimy Russian politics"". As his family step-up their appeals to bring him home, officials in Moscow are already hinting at a possible prisoner swap adding to suspicions that the man from Michigan is a pawn in a political game that has yet to play out. On 15 June, it took the chief judge just 1 minute 20 seconds to reach the key words in his verdict. ""Moscow City Courtâ¦finds Paul Nicholas Whelan guilty,"" he read from the typed sheet, adding that the 16-year sentence would be served in a high-security facility for the most dangerous offenders. The judge then turned to address the defendant, who was standing in a glass cage guarded by two FSB security officers in black balaclavas. Watching from the wooden courtroom benches, socially distanced and in medical facemasks, were the ambassadors of the US, UK and Canada. ""Whelan, do you understand the sentence?"" he asked. Paul Whelan's sentencing in court The American, whose glasses, side parting and blue sweater that he wore to each court appearance gave him the look of a neat, middle-aged librarian, looked back at the judge blankly. His Russian wasn't up to this. ""Nothing's translated, Your Honour,"" the 50-year-old protested, sending an interpreter scurrying over to explain his fate. The three judges swept off the podium and out of court. It was a flat, abrupt end to a spy trial that had taken just a handful of closed hearings. Moscow's Covid-19 lockdown had cloaked proceedings in an even thicker layer of secrecy, with both press and public barred from the building right up until the final verdict. The first time I saw Whelan in court, well over a year ago, he arrived with a weak smile and a brown cardboard box hugged to his chest containing a packed prison lunch. He was flanked by FSB guards, faces covered so they couldn't be identified. State TV crews, hovering for their shots in the hallway, were already referring to the accused man as ""the American spy"". Paul Whelan would be brought for multiple custody hearings and appeals over the months and we squeezed in almost every time. Although we were only allowed to attend for the opening remarks, we managed to snatch several conversations with him. That first day, though - in a cage, with a dozen cameras trained on him - he looked tense and spoke little. Almost two months had passed since his arrest, and he said he was coping ""fine"". But when I asked for his side of the story, his eyes flicked towards the guards. ""If I do that, I'll be in a bad way,"" Whelan told me, warily. ""They don't want me to speak with you."" A member of his defence team has since revealed that he was coming under intense pressure from the FSB to confess, interrogated several times without his lawyers present. ""[They'd say] things like, 'There's no hope for you, tell us the truth. You're a spy, you'll be convicted,'"" Olga Karlova told me last summer. The American refused and as his time in custody was extended repeatedly, he gradually grew bolder in court. Paul Whelan arrives handcuffed and holds a personal statement up in court Whelan, who at the time of his arrest was the head of global security for a US-based car parts firm, began to denounce the charge of espionage as ""ridiculous"", and declare that he was being tried by a ""kangaroo court"". He'd prepare a speech for each session, writing it out on a sheet of paper vetted and stamped by the prison censors. ""Russia says it caught James Bond on a spy mission,"" Whelan announced one day, as we waited for the judge. ""In reality, they abducted Mr Bean on holiday."" By then, we'd learned that the American had visited Russia multiple times. On his latest trip, in December 2018, he was in Moscow for the wedding of a fellow ex-Marine to a Russian woman. But Whelan never made it to the ceremony. He was arrested in his room, just hours after showing some of the other wedding guests around the grounds of the Kremlin. Paul Whelan's Instagram posts So, at a court hearing late last year, I raised my voice over a wall of bailiffs to ask him once again what had happened. He paused a little, before calling back. ""I'm not allowed to give you details, but I can tell you I was set-up. I did not commit a crime,"" Whelan said, telling me that a friend had turned-up at his hotel that evening unannounced. When Whelan was arrested, the FSB found a USB drive in his pocket containing the classified information it alleges he had requested. He now told me his friend had planted the device in his pocket, without him realising. ""That person was an FSB officer. He's someone I've known for ten years,"" he revealed for the first time. ""There's absolutely no reason he should have been in my room and no reason he should have given me any sort of device."" When the judge returned to court, to extend his stay in prison once again, Whelan's frustration erupted. ""I can talk louder than you, Your Honour,"" he shouted from the cage. ""As my cousins in England would say, this is complete bollocks."" At that, the judge ordered the TV cameras to be removed from court. Filming was barred at all future hearings to stop the press capturing any more protests. The Russian government declared Paul Whelan guilty long ago. Just two weeks after his arrest, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov declared that the American had been caught ""red-handed"" conducting a ""concrete, illegal act"". The case was immediately big news that grew further when it emerged that Whelan was a citizen of four countries. Born in Canada to British parents of Irish heritage, he later moved to the US entitling him to multiple passports as a result. Paul Whelan was a US police officer when he was younger In early 2019, the drama of his now multi-national arrest was developing against a hostile political backdrop, with mutual sanctions over the Ukraine crisis and East-West tension not felt since Soviet times. Nine months earlier, the UK had accused Russia of poisoning Sergei Skripal, a former double-agent, on the streets of Salisbury. At the same time, Washington was still accusing Moscow of meddling in its elections. So when Whelan's plight became public, there was speculation that he could be the human collateral. The FSB was already dripping details of the case it would make in court. The Russian Rosbalt news agency quoted a source claiming that Whelan was working directly for US intelligence, tasked with obtaining a list of personnel at ""one of Russia's secret institutions"". It said that information was the object of ""intense interest"" to the Americans, and that Whelan had been cultivating potential contacts, online, for over a decade. Spy trials in Russia are not only heard in secret, the defence lawyers have to sign non-disclosure agreements covering the entire case. So no evidence - the wire taps or surveillance footage the case is reportedly based on - has been made public. In Whelan's case, there's the added nuance that his defence team were appointed and paid for by the Russian state. His family decided not to change them, reasoning that a bill of over $150,000 (Â£121,000) was ""an awful lot of resources for what would have been zero impact"". ""Secrecy, provocation and falsification, that's the arsenal of our opponents,"" says Ivan Pavlov, a human rights lawyer who has gone up against the FSB in many espionage cases. He mostly represents Russians accused of selling secrets to the West and says the number of such cases has grown significantly since the political climate turned cold again in 2014. The lawyer warns that the FSB is the ""mightiest secret service, not only in Russia,"" and uses its own experts to examine any evidence for the court. ""If you've got mixed up in something like this, then you're in the most complicated story of your life,"" Ivan Pavlov says. ""It will be very difficult to mount a defence."" Paul Whelan's travels in Russia began more than a decade ago. ""This is 'Lubyanka' where the KGB has our spies locked in the basement!!"", he joked in 2007 on a personal website. The image was of the headquarters of Russia's notorious security services, now known as the FSB. Eleven years later, its officers would drive him there for interrogation. Lubyanka, FSB headquarters in Moscow The photograph dates from Whelan's first trip to Moscow, made while he was serving with the US military in Iraq. That year he told a Marines news site that he'd taken advantage of a programme that funded a two-week break abroad for those on long deployments. Whelan had plumped to visit Russia, explaining that, for a ""single man like me"" the scheme was ""an opportunity to travel throughout the worldâ¦and experience the diversity of culture"". Since his arrest, the Marine Corps has disclosed that he was discharged in 2008 for bad conduct, a revelation that ""absolutely stunned"" his twin brother David. ""He was always absolutely positive about the [Marines] experience. There's a Marines' flag flying right below the American flag on my parents' property the whole time,"" David told the BBC from Canada. Paul Whelan as a US marine and the front gate at his parents' property And yet, unknown to those closest to him, Paul had been court-martialled for trying to steal more than $10,000 from the US government. It was with this scandal breaking behind the scenes, that he first headed for Moscow. ""Having grown up during the Cold War, it was a dream of mine to visit Russia and meet some of the sneaky Russians who had kept the western world at bay for so long!!"" Whelan joked back then on his website, which has since been archived. Its pages document the trip with shots of tourist spots and captions laden with exclamation marks. A decade later, he would message home regularly from trips to Russia displaying similar almost child-like wonder at new discoveries. The website content does support later descriptions of Paul Whelan by contacts, colleagues and family as an enthusiastic world traveller who ""made friends pretty much everywhere"" and had an interest in Russian culture. ""I remember making small talk once and I said, 'You travel a lot for work, where do you travel for fun?',"" a former colleague, Skotti Fietsam, told the BBC. ""He said Russia!"" She recalled her surprise at his reply. ""He said it's beautiful and he liked the cold and he had quite a few friends there."" An entire section of his old website is dedicated to the cute cartoon character Cheburashka, describing the big-eared, wide-eyed creature as ""one good thing to come from the Soviet era"". Another link leads to a homemade guide to the Cyrillic alphabet and some basic first words in Russian. Cartoon character Cheburashka The pages also reveal his first friends in the Russian military. Russia would later insinuate, via anonymous sources quoted in the press, that the CIA had selected candidates for Paul Whelan to cultivate for intelligence. It was noticeable, one such report said, that he chose only to befriend men and not ""pretty Russian girls"". Whelan was friends with young servicemen in the US, though, too. His website describes his ""respect and admiration"" for three Naval Academy graduates who'd just joined the Marines. And he didn't hide his interests and encounters. In 2009, he took his own parents to visit Russia, where they've told me they met several of his young friends in military uniform. Paul Whelan with his parents in Moscow Meanwhile, the front page of his website invited visitors to click on the image of a young Russian soldier to learn more about his ""hobbies and military service"". The link led to Maxim, who explained that his new friend, Paul Whelan, was helping with his English which he planned to study at university. The Russian described the two spending several days ""touring Moscow"" together, eating sushi and caviar-filled pancakes. Whelan went on to seek out more Russian friends, using the country's social networking service VK among others. A scroll through their profiles, soon after his arrest, revealed almost all to be men - most considerably younger than him. Some do have clear military connections - including photographs in uniform - though not all, and no-one who replied to my messages had seen any reason to doubt Whelan's motives. One replied to tell me he'd been a student and supermarket night-guard when the American first made contact. The two met in person for a few hours in 2008 when Whelan was touring Russia, visiting multiple friends in various cities. ""I don't believe that Paul is a spy,"" the man wrote to me. ""Iâ¦ don't know anything what [sic] might be interesting to foreign spy."" Paul Whelan photographed with a friend Another man gave his friend a sightseeing tour of his own town that same year. He has no apparent link to the military himself and joked to me via VK that the American ""didn't request to see anything suspicious :))"" A Moscow hairdresser, meanwhile, was contacted by Whelan on Instagram around five years back. They talked about foreign travel and never met. One VK friend still in the military told me the American first messaged when he was a cadet and the two have chatted online two or three times a week ever since. ""He seemed nice and was fascinated by our country, its history and our traditions and people!"" the man replied to my enquiries, adding that his own interest was in the ex-Marine's time in Iraq. He had no idea his friend had been arrested. ""No way? He's the kindest soul! If he's a spy, then I'm Michael Jackson!!!!"" he wrote. The man Whelan accuses of framing him was one of his oldest friends in Russia. He is also a serving intelligence officer. Defence lawyers disclosed some details of the men's relationship early on in the case, including how the American had visited his friend's house in Sergiev Posad outside Moscow for ""saunas and kebabs"" the winter before his arrest. They also said he owed Whelan around 80,000 roubles ($1,147; Â£930) which the FSB claimed was advance payment for intelligence. The defence team said the Russian had requested a loan to buy a gift for his wife, as part of his trap. The town of Sergiev Posad is home to the spiritual centre of the Russian Orthodox Church - the Trinity Lavra of St Sergius The Whelan family eventually found a name and even a photograph. As he still works for the FSB, I can't identify him so I'll call him ""Dmitry"". But Whelan chatted openly to relatives on email about his friend, including which ""FSB school"" he'd attended. '''Dmitry' says hello!"", Whelan breezily told his parents after one Facetime chat with the Russian. It seems unusual behaviour if he was trying to recruit the man for US intelligence. It's possible he even introduced his parents to ""Dmitry"" on their 2009 trip to Russia, they can't be sure. In messages home from Moscow in January 2018 - a free holiday to use up his air miles - the American described visiting restaurants with his agent-friend, as well as the museums of the Kremlin and even a British pub. A year later, just days before his arrest, Mr Whelan took ""Dmitry"" and another man for Christmas dinner at a restaurant opposite his hotel. He snapped a picture of his guests, ""Dmitry"" smiling with a glass of wine and his fork raised over a juicy steak. Labelling it ""Dinner with Tovarishi"", or comrades, he messaged the image to a third Russian friend - even as he was supposedly discussing how to transfer classified intelligence. ""It all sounds incredibly naÃ¯ve now,"" his brother concedes of the relationship, after finally obtaining the passwords for Paul's computers and trawling through his files. He says his brother's VK messages were deleted after his arrest. ""He has friends in other countries with a military background, I think it was a social thing,"" David Whelan argues. ""The FSB thing wasn't a big deal, until he was entrapped."" Paul Whelan's twin brother David Paul Whelan's lawyers have now confirmed that he was being watched for some time and his communications monitored. A recent newspaper report claimed that the American had come to FSB attention over a decade ago when, as Kommersant's source says, he ""actively"" began contacting Russian servicemen. But the espionage case was based entirely on Whelan's ties to one officer, with all the evidence gathered in 2018 shortly before his arrest. ""Had this been an independent court, they would have reached only one decision - not guilty,"" his lawyer, Vladimir Zherebyonkov said after the verdict. He said the evidence was only ever examined by ""incompetent and interested parties"". Paul Whelan's lawyers Vladimir Zherebyonkov and Olga Karlova Ivan Pavlov believes Whelan's claim he was framed is ""always possible"" with FSB intelligence officers. ""The temptation is high: to rise in rank; for promotion; for more stars on your epaulettes,"" the lawyer says. ""This is how FSB careers are made; people rise on the back of such cases, like mushrooms after the rain."" Officers typically bide their time, he explains, calling it ""calf-rearing"", before a target is culled. If so, it appears that Paul Whelan was blind to the threat. In one email exchange during his early 2018 trip to Moscow, a relative joked: ""Don't get into any trouble we can't get you out of, haha!"" ""I will be with guys from the FSB, so should be okay!"", the American wrote back. The surge in East-West tensions has made espionage both more complex - and more urgent - in recent years. After the Salisbury poisoning in early 2018, more than 100 Russian diplomats identified as intelligence agents were expelled from embassies around the world in a co-ordinated act of protest. Russia responded with a mirror mass expulsion of Western diplomats. At the time, one ambassador told me the move had hit Moscow's spying capacity hard. But the same is presumably true in reverse. There were signs of problems even earlier. Almost exactly a year before Paul Whelan's arrest, a Norwegian staying at the same central Moscow hotel was arrested and charged with espionage. A retired border guard, Frode Berg admitted to delivering envelopes of cash and spy instructions on behalf of Norwegian military intelligence agency. Norwegian citizen Frode Berg in a Moscow courtroom, January 2019 His arrest and 14-year prison sentence caused a scandal back home when it emerged that civilians with no diplomatic cover were being used for high-risk espionage. There were even allegations that Norway was under pressure to obtain the information from its partners in Nato. Former CIA officers have dismissed any suggestion that Whelan could be involved in something similar, operating without diplomatic immunity: the idea, floated by one retired Russian officer, that his arrest was a ""great failure"" of US intelligence. The US Embassy and government have been very vocal about Whelan's detention. ""Paul Whelan is innocent,"" Ambassador John Sullivan told me emphatically last week, calling the trial a ""mockery of justice"". US Ambassador John Sullivan outside court after Paul Whelan's sentencing In Frode Berg's case, the Norwegian government stayed quiet. And while Paul Whelan's dishonourable discharge from the Marines shows there are parts of his life of which even his family have no idea, his supporters point to the theft charge as a positive. ""The intelligence community would never use someone with that past, especially in a situation like this when you'd be sent into a very, very difficult environment,"" argues Ryan Fayhee, the family's lawyer in the US who cites intelligence contacts from his days prosecuting cases of counter-espionage. ""It just wouldn't happen,"" Fayhee believes. ""Trust is the most important thing when you are out there, living on the edge."" Perhaps Whelan enjoyed the element of danger that came from flirting with the FSB, hanging out with intelligence officers. One friend who didn't want to be named told me he was ""a little quirky"", and liked to ""push the line a bit"". He wondered whether some comment, or joke might have been disastrously misconstrued. Whelan's own defence lawyer once hinted at that possibility. Skotti Fietsam, his former colleague, found Whelan serious and supportive, but also laughed at how he would insist on using heavily armed guards when he visited the factory she managed in Mexico, even posting them outside restaurants while they ate. ""I don't know if it was machismo; to show off,"" Fietsam said. ""But it was very unusual."" On Whelan's old website, alongside Harry Potter books and War and Peace, his recommended reading includes a long list of Cold War thrillers by Tom Clancy. But there's nothing glamorous about prison life in Lefortovo. The high wall and barbed wire of Lefortovo jail ""The porridge, some days it goes direct to the toilet,"" Frode Berg wrote to me from northern Norway of life in the FSB prison. He's now back home after a prisoner-swap. His own cellmate in Lefortovo used to joke that the inmates were fed dog food in the mornings. ""We never see or meet other prisoners. When we go to a meeting, prisoners were hidden from each other,"" Berg describes the lonely routine of life inside the K-shape jail, whose tall outer walls now butt-up against Soviet apartment blocks. The K-shaped buildings of Moscow's Lefortovo prison Paul Whelan is being held in the renovated wing, where the Norwegian says there is hot water in the cells now as well as a fridge, TV and toilet. But the space measures 9.5 square metres between two prisoners and exercise is one hour a day on the roof. Cellmates get to shower once a week, together, in the basement. One light remains on in the cell 24/7. Whelan and his family say letters have been held back for months by investigators and parcels returned. He wasn't allowed a phone call home for 16 months. And adding to his discomfort was chronic pain from a hernia that eventually strangulated, resulting in emergency surgery. Sentenced to a high-security prison, Paul Whelan won't be leaving Lefortovo just yet. His lawyers do plan to appeal against the verdict but other, bigger forces are already at play. The minute the American was convicted, the focus shifted to a possible prisoner swap. ""They want Yaroshenko and Bout, that's who they want back,"" Paul Whelan claimed, naming two high-profile Russian prisoners in America as the court bailiffs ushered me and my microphone out of the room. ""That's the only reason they've done this,"" he alleged. Lawyer Vladimir Zherebyonkov was soon saying the same, now claiming the FSB had been planning a swap all along. ""No-one's hiding that, everyone talks about it, all the officials,"" he told the press. So the prisoner who has always called himself a political hostage is now looking to the politicians to do a deal for his release.

"The attack happened in a residential courtyard in Moss Side Two men have died in a shooting after a lockdown party of ""hundreds of people"". Police were called to reports that gun shots had been heard in Caythorpe Street in Moss Side, Manchester, at about 01:00 BST. The two victims, aged in their 20s and 30s, ""self-presented"" in hospital and died a short time later. Greater Manchester Police said the shooting happened at ""an unplanned event"" near to the location of an ""earlier community event"". No arrests have been made yet. A local resident said the shooting followed a lockdown party with a DJ and ""hundreds of people"". Footage on social media showed crowds dancing to loud music in a courtyard. A heavy police presence was deployed overnight A cordon was placed around a courtyard between Caythorpe Street, Broadfield Road and Bowes Street. A teacher, who lives nearby, said he heard music from about 22:00 BST into the early hours on Sunday. The man, who did not wish to be named, said: ""It's a really normal neighbourhood with an occasional spike in violence. ""I had a walk out to see what was happening and I would say there were hundreds of people around but I did see police patrols. Later, we heard a helicopter overhead."" Officers gather evidence at a courtyard where ""hundreds"" of people attended a party He said people who rang police were told that officers were unable to break up the party because it was too large. Det Insp Andrew Butterworth said: ""We are aware that, a number of hours before this incident, there was a community event in Moss Side. ""This event was attended by Greater Manchester Police along with local people and partner agencies - it was not an illegal rave and it had concluded prior to this incident. ""It does appear that the incident took place at what we believe was an unplanned event near to the location of the earlier community event."" On Sunday, a forensic tent was seen partially covering a car, with alcohol bottles and canisters of laughing gas surrounding the area. Since the 1980s, Moss Side has been associated with problems due to drugs and violence, although in recent years, there have been fewer shootings and money has been spent on redeveloping the area. Thousands attended raves last weekend in Greater Manchester (above), despite gatherings of more than six people being illegal due to coronavirus Earlier this week, Greater Manchester Police said it would take ""serious action"" to deter more illegal gatherings afterraves in Trafford and Oldham last weekend, when a 20-year-old man died of a suspected drug overdose and an 18-year-old woman was raped. More than 6,000 people attended the events, where three men were stabbed. Asst Ch Con Nick Bailey said prevention was the key to controlling illegal parties but conceded that senior officers could decide it was more dangerous to close an event because of its scale, and factors such as terrain and darkness.

"There can be no post-pandemic economic recovery without a strong and healthy steel industry, according to Labour MP Stephen Kinnock. Opposition MPs are calling on the UK government to provide loans to steel firms experiencing a sudden drop in demand due to coronavirus. It said it was ""committed to supporting the sector's economic recovery"". Aberavon MP Mr Kinnock toldBBC Politics Walessupport was needed in ""days not weeks"" to help the industry. In May,10 Welsh MPs wrote to the chancellorasking for extra support for the sector during the pandemic. As shops start reopening, and pressure builds on the government to outline its plans for the UK's economic recovery, big questions still remain about the part steel will play in the country's economic bounce back. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Newport East Labour MP Jessica Morden told Boris Johnson: ""Plants like Tata's Llanwern and the Orb steel works - the only electrical steel plant in the UK - can play a key part in that recovery, but three months into this crisis and steel companies are still waiting for government liquidity support which is critical. ""Will the prime minister commit to address this now?"" Mr Johnson said ministers would do ""everything they can"" to maintain UK steel production, but no bailout has been promised yet. Mr Kinnock said steel was the ""backbone of our manufacturing sector"". ""Nothing, really, can work in this country in terms of the manufacturing sector without steel,"" he said. ""Steel is in the offices we work in, the cars that we drive, the trains that we ride, even the cutlery that we eat our food with."" Stephen Kinnock: ""Nothing, really, can work in this country in terms of the manufacturing sector without steel"" Demand for steel has dropped massively during the coronavirus crisis, especially with industries like car manufacturing grinding to a halt. Before the pandemic,Tata Steel had suffered Â£371m in pre-tax losseslast year and there was continuing uncertainty for the wider industry because of Brexit. There have been reports the UK government may consider so-called""last resort"" loansfor viable companies, if their failure would disproportionately harm the economy. But ministers will want some certainty any loans will be paid back to ""protect"" the taxpayer. Mr Kinnock said he believed loans to steel firms would be returned and he has urged the government to consider the costs to the taxpayer of not stepping in to support them. ""We are urging the government to support the industry now and also think about the cost of doing nothing,"" he said. ""There are 4,000 relatively well paid men and women working in the Port Talbot steel works, thousands more relatively well paid jobs in the steel industry across the country. Shops expected to reopen in Wales from Monday Fear pubs 'will go bust' because of two-metre rule ""Imagine the cost of losing those jobs. ""Imagine the cost of decommissioning a steelworks with blast furnaces and the vast cost that would cause the government. ""So we are saying to the government - give the temporary loan. ""It is a loan that will be paid back in order to avoid the massive cost of doing nothing."" Steel industry analyst Dr Kathryn Ringwald-Wildman said the pandemic has hit firms at an already tough time. ""We've got uncertainty building on uncertainty,"" she said. ""The position of the steel industries is quite desperate at the moment and they will need government support to survive. Tata's Port Talbot steelworks provide well-paid jobs in the area ""They would've needed government support without the pandemic. ""If they are to weather this particular storm they will need support. ""The question is: this is taxpayer's money. Is this a bridge over the pandemic crisis or is it a bridge over the pandemic crisis only to find the economic situation post-pandemic is much more serious globally than we might imagine?"" Beyond questions around the cost of recovery, withTata Steel reportedly needing at least Â£500m through the pandemic, government decisions to support steel or not are inherently political - with the effect on areas like Port Talbot hanging in the mix. ""You take the steel industry out of Port Talbot you have got nothing. You haven't got anything to take its place,"" said Dr Ringwald-Wildman. ""The decision that's made now will resonate for many years. ""It may be that the politicians will decide to defer the decision to end steel manufacturing in the UK - let the companies sink or swim. Government draws up rescue plan for key companies Tata Steel 'needs Â£500m government support' ""They might choose to defer that because of the consequences down the line. ""It would take a very brave government to say we don't need a steel industry in the UK. ""The emphasis has been, in conversations around the edge of the Brexit decision, we will make our own steel, use our own steel, buy our own steel. ""We will, of course, be trading on the international market. ""But the notion that our domestic steel industry would be one of our major suppliers to our manufacturing industry was fundamental."" A spokesperson for Tata Steel, which has furloughed about 2,400 staff across UK sites, said: ""The ultimate impact of coronavirus has been the sudden drop in demand for steel. ""But it is a storm that we are weathering, and we're looking to come out of the other side. ""We are in negotiations with both UK and Welsh governments to seek all available support that we can."" A UK government spokesperson said it has ""engaged with businesses across the economy, and has already increased the scope and scale of many of our support schemes, including loans to steel companies with a turnover of over Â£45m"". ""We recognise that economic conditions continue to be challenging and we are committed to supporting the sector's economic recovery.""

A lockdown ban on weddings and civil partnerships in Wales will be lifted from Monday - but there will be no big celebrations allowed. The announcement was added tonew rules published by the Welsh government.,external However, the ban on social gatherings remains, as do social distancing rules and staying local, which advise travelling no more than five miles. Non-essential shops will also reopen on Monday, as moves to relax the Covid-19 restrictions in Wales continue.

According to a series of measures announced, they will all be tested at airports upon arrival. For those infected, a 14-day quarantine will be mandatory. Tourists will be allowed in from 7 July, although they will be required to present a recent Covid-19 negative certificate or undergo testing at Dubai airports. Again, for those infected, a 14-day quarantine will be imposed. You can find out more details here.,external  The government is facing calls to ease the social-distancing rule in England The government will outline proposals on how to safely
reduce the two-metre social-distancing rule in England this week. The distance could be lowered with ""mitigations"",
so people can be closer without a higher risk of transmission, Health Secretary
Matt Hancock told the BBC. But
what does the science say?Find out more here. There have been more than 300,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 42,500 people have died, government figures show. However, these numbers only include people who have been tested and the total number of deaths relating to the virus is likely to be higher. Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the weekly number of recorded deaths has returned to close to normal levels for the time of year. You can check on the number of cases and deaths in your area here. The coronavirus reproduction
rate in Germany, known as the R number, jumped to 2.88 on Sunday, compared to 1.79 a day earlier, according to the country's Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health. The RKI said the figure was based on a four-day average, and the spike is mainly because of local outbreaks, such as at the meat processing plant in in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where more than 1,300 workers have been infected. The R number is the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average. In Germany, this now means that out of 100 people with Covid-19, a further 288 will be infected. An R value of less than one is needed to gradually contain the disease. Our colleague James Gallagher has looked intohow the R number is calculated. A two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UK is now in place What do you need to know if you're planning to fly during the Covid-19 pandemic? A two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UK is now being enforced. Passengers arriving in the UK by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals -will be asked to provide an address,externalwhere they will self-isolate for 14 days. Travellers can be fined Â£100 for failing to fill in a form with these details. 
Surprise visits will be used to check they are following the rules. Those in Englandcould be fined up to Â£1,000 if they fail to self-isolate.

Cadi Thomas and boyfriend Yusef Rustem, pictured before lockdown, live in separate shared houses We all have had to adapt to life under lockdown. No to families, friends, gatherings... the almost endless list of restrictions goes on. Our colleagues at BBC Wales have talked to three couples about what they have faced trying to maintain relationships. With Wales about to enter its fourth month since severe restrictions were imposed on people's lives,some couples have been unable to see each other. And althoughlockdown measures have been eased, some had to decide whether to move in together or risk not seeing each other indefinitely - in Wales, people from two different households can meet outside, but must remain two metres apart. Truly lockdown love dilemmas. People in Scotland are being advised to stay local for leisure and recreation Scotland has entered the second phase of easing lockdown restrictions. Over the coming weeks shops will start to reopen, work will resume in certain industries, and some of the rules about meeting other people will be relaxed. But not all the changes will take place at the same time, so what can you do in Phase 2, and when? You can read the key details here. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris The number of Covid-19 cases continues to fall in France, so the government is proceeding with the next  step back to normality.   There may be only two more weeks left of term, but from Monday going to school will be compulsory for everyone up to the age of 15, for the first time since March. Only lycÃ©es - which cover the last three years of school education - are not affected.   Schools have in fact been open for several weeks but only on a voluntary basis, and for most it has only been possible to attend for a day or two a week. The change to full schooling is possible because the government has relaxed rules about social distancing between pupils. Also on Monday, cinemas, casinos, swimming pools and holiday centres are opening.  Campsites have been open for two weeks already.  Group sports are also permitted, but not combat sports. With cafes and restaurants all open, and no restrictions on travel, life is for many French beginning to resume its regular rhythms. Life in France is slowly going back to normal A limited schedule is in place until the end of June East Midlands Airport is resuming passenger flightsfor the first time since lockdown measures were introduced in March, with a Ryanair service from Alicante scheduled to be the first to arrive. It is the first time passengers have set foot inside the airport in Castle Donington, Leicestershire, for 12 weeks. The airport is a major UK cargo hub and its freight operations saw it become one of Europe's 10 busiest airports during lockdown. This included flights bringing medical and personal protective equipment to the UK. Chris Lewis, when he was still on the island with his dog Jet A former British paratrooper has left the previously uninhabited island where he had been isolating after lockdown measures were introduced during a fundraising challenge. Chris Lewis, from Swansea, had walked 12,000 miles (19,300km) of the UK coastline after setting off from Wales in August 2017. He was given special permission to live in the only house on Hildasay, Shetland, with his dog Jet,external. ""I feel I left a part of me behind,"" he said. The 39-year-old was originally sleeping in a tent on mainland Shetland when lockdown restrictions were imposed on 23 March. This is the only house on the island He was offered the keys to a former shepherd's hut on Hildasay when its owners heard he was camping. The hut had no running water, heating or electricity. A regular boat brought him fresh water and coal. He collected driftwood, foraged and fished for food, and always made sure he had a three-week supply of dog food for Jet. He said he had been ""the happiest I've ever been"" while living on the island. The new powers will cover firms such as pharmaceutical companies The UK government will introduce new measures on Monday toprotect businesses critical to public health from foreign takeovers. Legal changes would give ministers extra powers to protect those needed to help in future pandemics, who might be struggling now. The new powers will cover firms such as pharmaceutical companies. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""The UK is open for investment, but not for exploitation."" Some much-needed inspiring news: South Korean golfer Ryu So-yeon won the Korean Open by a shot and then donated her $200,000 (Â£160,000) prize to coronavirus charities. Ryu, a former world number one who has previously given her winnings to charity, said the idea had come to her the previous evening. ""Before the awards ceremony, I called my mom. I told her that I'm going to make the announcement so don't get too surprised. She was just as happy I was,"" she told local media. ""Since this tournament has a lot of meaning to me and I thought that I may be able to play better if I had a positive goal, I came up with it last night."" Well done! All shops in Northern Ireland have been able to reopen since Friday Northern Ireland's chief medical officer has cautioned against complacency after latest figures showed no further coronavirus-linked deaths being reported on Sunday. Dr Michael McBride said progress was being made in ""forcing the virus into retreat"" but warned that ""now is not the time to drop guard"". The overall death toll recorded by Northern Ireland's Department of Health remains at 545. The suppression of the virus there has prompted Stormont ministers to quicken alocal exit out of lockdown. From 26 June, caravan parks, campsites and self-contained tourist accommodation will be able to reopen. A week later on 3 July, hotels, restaurants, cafes, coffee shops, pubs and bars will be able to welcome customers back. Church services are set to resume on 29 June. Quarantined workers in the town of Verl clashed with police on Saturday The leader of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia has ruled out sweeping local lockdown measures despite an outbreak centred on a meat processing plant near the town of GÃ¼tersloh that has caused at least 1,300 new cases. Armin Laschet said there was an ""enormous pandemic risk"" but the outbreak was ""clearly centred on the firm"" and there was no ""significant tranmission"" to the wider population. Laschet said a lockdown could not be ruled out entirely but efforts would focus on preventing infections spreading to the population at large and this would enable more targeted measures to deal with the outbreak. On Saturday disturbances broke out at accommodation used by TÃ¶nnies staff in the nearby town of Verl where 700 people had been put into quarantine. ""Around 200 people tried to get out, but 500 people complied
with quarantine rules,"" Uwe lÃ¼hrig, head of police in the GÃ¶ttingen area, told reporters. Eight police officers were injured during clashes with residents wielding bottles, fireworks and metal bars, he said. Some 6,500 workers and their families have been told to go into quarantine to contain the outbreak. Holiday spots in Wales like Tenby have suffered from a lack of visitors Britain'slockdown ruleshave had a devastating effect on its tourism industry and the chances of having a summer break abroad seem remote. Theholiday industry in parts of the UKlooks set to start operating again during July and tourism chiefs in Wales say they are ready to capitalise on any opportunities to resume business. ""We have lost an awful lot... we've lost Easter, we've lost two bank holidays,"" said Andrew Campbell of the Wales Tourism Alliance. He said that 97% of businesses within the industry in Wales have closed due to the pandemic and 80% of staff have been furloughed. ""People are suffering,"" he added. Â© 2025 BBC.

The health secretary said the distance could be lowered with ""mitigations"" to cut the risk of transmission. Labour said it would support a change to 1m ""under certain circumstances"". Mr Hancock confirmed new easing of lockdown measures would be announced in the coming days, including whether pubs and restaurants can re-open on 4 July.

He added: ""We are going step-by-step, making things easier for people, helping people to see more of each other, allowing more social contact, more social interaction, and we will be setting all that out. ""But it's very important that we don't lose our vice like grip on the disease. We have got to keep it on the floor where we have got it and so we have got to keep making those trade-offs.""

But speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Mr Hancock appeared to go further, saying: ""The proposals we'll bring forward are how you can safely reduce the 2m with the sort of mitigations we've been talking about."" He said there were ""all sorts"" of measures that could be introduced, referring to the use of face masks on public transport, Perspex screens in shops, and studies on the reduction of transmission risk when people sit side-by-side or back-to-back.

But it now seems inevitable the result will be a move from a 2m social distancing rule in England to 1m.

Scientists seem relaxed about this change - the chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance having indicated that, ultimately, this is a political decision, with no continuing body of evidence to stand in the way of the move. A member of Sage, Professor Calum Semple, says he has changed his mind and it is now reasonable to ""relax these rules"". It's understood there will need to be ""mitigation"" - requirements to stop overcrowding in bars, taking contact details of people booking restaurant tables and a more widespread use of face coverings, for example. But as the eminent microbiologist Prof Peter Piot reminded us today, the virus won't just fade away. He said it will be with us for some time and a second spike of some sort was highly likely. The pubs and bars may reopen in England and Northern Ireland within weeks (Scotland and Wales are keeping the issue under review). But no health or scientific official or adviser will be celebrating any time soon. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said his party were ""prepared to look at [the proposals] carefully"", adding that if a change was ""backed by the science, then that'll be an understandable move"". But he said countries who have lower social distance rules also have a ""broader combination of measures"", such as face shields and tracing apps, and his support would depend on other mitigations being introduced. 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented?

"The attack happened in a residential courtyard in Moss Side Two men have died in a shooting after a lockdown party of ""hundreds of people"". Police were called to reports that gun shots had been heard in Caythorpe Street in Moss Side, Manchester, at about 01:00 BST. The two victims, aged in their 20s and 30s, ""self-presented"" in hospital and died a short time later. Greater Manchester Police said the shooting happened at ""an unplanned event"" near to the location of an ""earlier community event"". No arrests have been made yet. A local resident said the shooting followed a lockdown party with a DJ and ""hundreds of people"". Footage on social media showed crowds dancing to loud music in a courtyard. A heavy police presence was deployed overnight A cordon was placed around a courtyard between Caythorpe Street, Broadfield Road and Bowes Street. A teacher, who lives nearby, said he heard music from about 22:00 BST into the early hours on Sunday. The man, who did not wish to be named, said: ""It's a really normal neighbourhood with an occasional spike in violence. ""I had a walk out to see what was happening and I would say there were hundreds of people around but I did see police patrols. Later, we heard a helicopter overhead."" Officers gather evidence at a courtyard where ""hundreds"" of people attended a party He said people who rang police were told that officers were unable to break up the party because it was too large. Det Insp Andrew Butterworth said: ""We are aware that, a number of hours before this incident, there was a community event in Moss Side. ""This event was attended by Greater Manchester Police along with local people and partner agencies - it was not an illegal rave and it had concluded prior to this incident. ""It does appear that the incident took place at what we believe was an unplanned event near to the location of the earlier community event."" On Sunday, a forensic tent was seen partially covering a car, with alcohol bottles and canisters of laughing gas surrounding the area. Since the 1980s, Moss Side has been associated with problems due to drugs and violence, although in recent years, there have been fewer shootings and money has been spent on redeveloping the area. Thousands attended raves last weekend in Greater Manchester (above), despite gatherings of more than six people being illegal due to coronavirus Earlier this week, Greater Manchester Police said it would take ""serious action"" to deter more illegal gatherings afterraves in Trafford and Oldham last weekend, when a 20-year-old man died of a suspected drug overdose and an 18-year-old woman was raped. More than 6,000 people attended the events, where three men were stabbed. Asst Ch Con Nick Bailey said prevention was the key to controlling illegal parties but conceded that senior officers could decide it was more dangerous to close an event because of its scale, and factors such as terrain and darkness.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""We're about to see another step in the plan"" The government will ""bring forward proposals"" on how to safely reduce the 2m social distancing rule in England this week, says Matt Hancock. The health secretary said the distance could be lowered with ""mitigations"" to cut the risk of transmission. Labour said it would support a change to 1m ""under certain circumstances"". Mr Hancock confirmed new easing of lockdown measures would be announced in the coming days, including whether pubs and restaurants can re-open on 4 July. Boris Johnson said the government was ""sticking like glue"" tothe roadmap it announced in May- when it said the venues could re-open on 4 July ""at the earliest"". He added: ""We are going step-by-step, making things easier for people, helping people to see more of each other, allowing more social contact, more social interaction, and we will be setting all that out. ""But it's very important that we don't lose our vice like grip on the disease. We have got to keep it on the floor where we have got it and so we have got to keep making those trade-offs.""

"In Room 3324 of Moscow's Metropol hotel, Paul Whelan was getting dressed for a friend's wedding when Russian intelligence officers burst in. The American disappeared without trace for three days until his twin stumbled across a news report announcing that his brother had been charged with espionage. That was New Year's Eve 2018 and the start of a case that would embroil four western governments and pile pressure on relations with Russia that had already sunk to a post-Cold War low. Almost 18 months later, Whelan has been convicted of spying - receiving Russian state secrets - after a short trial conducted entirely behind closed doors. The former US Marine - who also has British, Irish and Canadian citizenship - has always insisted on his innocence, and in court this week he described himself the victim of ""greasy, slimy Russian politics"". As his family step-up their appeals to bring him home, officials in Moscow are already hinting at a possible prisoner swap adding to suspicions that the man from Michigan is a pawn in a political game that has yet to play out. On 15 June, it took the chief judge just 1 minute 20 seconds to reach the key words in his verdict. ""Moscow City Courtâ¦finds Paul Nicholas Whelan guilty,"" he read from the typed sheet, adding that the 16-year sentence would be served in a high-security facility for the most dangerous offenders. The judge then turned to address the defendant, who was standing in a glass cage guarded by two FSB security officers in black balaclavas. Watching from the wooden courtroom benches, socially distanced and in medical facemasks, were the ambassadors of the US, UK and Canada. ""Whelan, do you understand the sentence?"" he asked. Paul Whelan's sentencing in court The American, whose glasses, side parting and blue sweater that he wore to each court appearance gave him the look of a neat, middle-aged librarian, looked back at the judge blankly. His Russian wasn't up to this. ""Nothing's translated, Your Honour,"" the 50-year-old protested, sending an interpreter scurrying over to explain his fate. The three judges swept off the podium and out of court. It was a flat, abrupt end to a spy trial that had taken just a handful of closed hearings. Moscow's Covid-19 lockdown had cloaked proceedings in an even thicker layer of secrecy, with both press and public barred from the building right up until the final verdict. The first time I saw Whelan in court, well over a year ago, he arrived with a weak smile and a brown cardboard box hugged to his chest containing a packed prison lunch. He was flanked by FSB guards, faces covered so they couldn't be identified. State TV crews, hovering for their shots in the hallway, were already referring to the accused man as ""the American spy"". Paul Whelan would be brought for multiple custody hearings and appeals over the months and we squeezed in almost every time. Although we were only allowed to attend for the opening remarks, we managed to snatch several conversations with him. That first day, though - in a cage, with a dozen cameras trained on him - he looked tense and spoke little. Almost two months had passed since his arrest, and he said he was coping ""fine"". But when I asked for his side of the story, his eyes flicked towards the guards. ""If I do that, I'll be in a bad way,"" Whelan told me, warily. ""They don't want me to speak with you."" A member of his defence team has since revealed that he was coming under intense pressure from the FSB to confess, interrogated several times without his lawyers present. ""[They'd say] things like, 'There's no hope for you, tell us the truth. You're a spy, you'll be convicted,'"" Olga Karlova told me last summer. The American refused and as his time in custody was extended repeatedly, he gradually grew bolder in court. Paul Whelan arrives handcuffed and holds a personal statement up in court Whelan, who at the time of his arrest was the head of global security for a US-based car parts firm, began to denounce the charge of espionage as ""ridiculous"", and declare that he was being tried by a ""kangaroo court"". He'd prepare a speech for each session, writing it out on a sheet of paper vetted and stamped by the prison censors. ""Russia says it caught James Bond on a spy mission,"" Whelan announced one day, as we waited for the judge. ""In reality, they abducted Mr Bean on holiday."" By then, we'd learned that the American had visited Russia multiple times. On his latest trip, in December 2018, he was in Moscow for the wedding of a fellow ex-Marine to a Russian woman. But Whelan never made it to the ceremony. He was arrested in his room, just hours after showing some of the other wedding guests around the grounds of the Kremlin. Paul Whelan's Instagram posts So, at a court hearing late last year, I raised my voice over a wall of bailiffs to ask him once again what had happened. He paused a little, before calling back. ""I'm not allowed to give you details, but I can tell you I was set-up. I did not commit a crime,"" Whelan said, telling me that a friend had turned-up at his hotel that evening unannounced. When Whelan was arrested, the FSB found a USB drive in his pocket containing the classified information it alleges he had requested. He now told me his friend had planted the device in his pocket, without him realising. ""That person was an FSB officer. He's someone I've known for ten years,"" he revealed for the first time. ""There's absolutely no reason he should have been in my room and no reason he should have given me any sort of device."" When the judge returned to court, to extend his stay in prison once again, Whelan's frustration erupted. ""I can talk louder than you, Your Honour,"" he shouted from the cage. ""As my cousins in England would say, this is complete bollocks."" At that, the judge ordered the TV cameras to be removed from court. Filming was barred at all future hearings to stop the press capturing any more protests. The Russian government declared Paul Whelan guilty long ago. Just two weeks after his arrest, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov declared that the American had been caught ""red-handed"" conducting a ""concrete, illegal act"". The case was immediately big news that grew further when it emerged that Whelan was a citizen of four countries. Born in Canada to British parents of Irish heritage, he later moved to the US entitling him to multiple passports as a result. Paul Whelan was a US police officer when he was younger In early 2019, the drama of his now multi-national arrest was developing against a hostile political backdrop, with mutual sanctions over the Ukraine crisis and East-West tension not felt since Soviet times. Nine months earlier, the UK had accused Russia of poisoning Sergei Skripal, a former double-agent, on the streets of Salisbury. At the same time, Washington was still accusing Moscow of meddling in its elections. So when Whelan's plight became public, there was speculation that he could be the human collateral. The FSB was already dripping details of the case it would make in court. The Russian Rosbalt news agency quoted a source claiming that Whelan was working directly for US intelligence, tasked with obtaining a list of personnel at ""one of Russia's secret institutions"". It said that information was the object of ""intense interest"" to the Americans, and that Whelan had been cultivating potential contacts, online, for over a decade. Spy trials in Russia are not only heard in secret, the defence lawyers have to sign non-disclosure agreements covering the entire case. So no evidence - the wire taps or surveillance footage the case is reportedly based on - has been made public. In Whelan's case, there's the added nuance that his defence team were appointed and paid for by the Russian state. His family decided not to change them, reasoning that a bill of over $150,000 (Â£121,000) was ""an awful lot of resources for what would have been zero impact"". ""Secrecy, provocation and falsification, that's the arsenal of our opponents,"" says Ivan Pavlov, a human rights lawyer who has gone up against the FSB in many espionage cases. He mostly represents Russians accused of selling secrets to the West and says the number of such cases has grown significantly since the political climate turned cold again in 2014. The lawyer warns that the FSB is the ""mightiest secret service, not only in Russia,"" and uses its own experts to examine any evidence for the court. ""If you've got mixed up in something like this, then you're in the most complicated story of your life,"" Ivan Pavlov says. ""It will be very difficult to mount a defence."" Paul Whelan's travels in Russia began more than a decade ago. ""This is 'Lubyanka' where the KGB has our spies locked in the basement!!"", he joked in 2007 on a personal website. The image was of the headquarters of Russia's notorious security services, now known as the FSB. Eleven years later, its officers would drive him there for interrogation. Lubyanka, FSB headquarters in Moscow The photograph dates from Whelan's first trip to Moscow, made while he was serving with the US military in Iraq. That year he told a Marines news site that he'd taken advantage of a programme that funded a two-week break abroad for those on long deployments. Whelan had plumped to visit Russia, explaining that, for a ""single man like me"" the scheme was ""an opportunity to travel throughout the worldâ¦and experience the diversity of culture"". Since his arrest, the Marine Corps has disclosed that he was discharged in 2008 for bad conduct, a revelation that ""absolutely stunned"" his twin brother David. ""He was always absolutely positive about the [Marines] experience. There's a Marines' flag flying right below the American flag on my parents' property the whole time,"" David told the BBC from Canada. Paul Whelan as a US marine and the front gate at his parents' property And yet, unknown to those closest to him, Paul had been court-martialled for trying to steal more than $10,000 from the US government. It was with this scandal breaking behind the scenes, that he first headed for Moscow. ""Having grown up during the Cold War, it was a dream of mine to visit Russia and meet some of the sneaky Russians who had kept the western world at bay for so long!!"" Whelan joked back then on his website, which has since been archived. Its pages document the trip with shots of tourist spots and captions laden with exclamation marks. A decade later, he would message home regularly from trips to Russia displaying similar almost child-like wonder at new discoveries. The website content does support later descriptions of Paul Whelan by contacts, colleagues and family as an enthusiastic world traveller who ""made friends pretty much everywhere"" and had an interest in Russian culture. ""I remember making small talk once and I said, 'You travel a lot for work, where do you travel for fun?',"" a former colleague, Skotti Fietsam, told the BBC. ""He said Russia!"" She recalled her surprise at his reply. ""He said it's beautiful and he liked the cold and he had quite a few friends there."" An entire section of his old website is dedicated to the cute cartoon character Cheburashka, describing the big-eared, wide-eyed creature as ""one good thing to come from the Soviet era"". Another link leads to a homemade guide to the Cyrillic alphabet and some basic first words in Russian. Cartoon character Cheburashka The pages also reveal his first friends in the Russian military. Russia would later insinuate, via anonymous sources quoted in the press, that the CIA had selected candidates for Paul Whelan to cultivate for intelligence. It was noticeable, one such report said, that he chose only to befriend men and not ""pretty Russian girls"". Whelan was friends with young servicemen in the US, though, too. His website describes his ""respect and admiration"" for three Naval Academy graduates who'd just joined the Marines. And he didn't hide his interests and encounters. In 2009, he took his own parents to visit Russia, where they've told me they met several of his young friends in military uniform. Paul Whelan with his parents in Moscow Meanwhile, the front page of his website invited visitors to click on the image of a young Russian soldier to learn more about his ""hobbies and military service"". The link led to Maxim, who explained that his new friend, Paul Whelan, was helping with his English which he planned to study at university. The Russian described the two spending several days ""touring Moscow"" together, eating sushi and caviar-filled pancakes. Whelan went on to seek out more Russian friends, using the country's social networking service VK among others. A scroll through their profiles, soon after his arrest, revealed almost all to be men - most considerably younger than him. Some do have clear military connections - including photographs in uniform - though not all, and no-one who replied to my messages had seen any reason to doubt Whelan's motives. One replied to tell me he'd been a student and supermarket night-guard when the American first made contact. The two met in person for a few hours in 2008 when Whelan was touring Russia, visiting multiple friends in various cities. ""I don't believe that Paul is a spy,"" the man wrote to me. ""Iâ¦ don't know anything what [sic] might be interesting to foreign spy."" Paul Whelan photographed with a friend Another man gave his friend a sightseeing tour of his own town that same year. He has no apparent link to the military himself and joked to me via VK that the American ""didn't request to see anything suspicious :))"" A Moscow hairdresser, meanwhile, was contacted by Whelan on Instagram around five years back. They talked about foreign travel and never met. One VK friend still in the military told me the American first messaged when he was a cadet and the two have chatted online two or three times a week ever since. ""He seemed nice and was fascinated by our country, its history and our traditions and people!"" the man replied to my enquiries, adding that his own interest was in the ex-Marine's time in Iraq. He had no idea his friend had been arrested. ""No way? He's the kindest soul! If he's a spy, then I'm Michael Jackson!!!!"" he wrote. The man Whelan accuses of framing him was one of his oldest friends in Russia. He is also a serving intelligence officer. Defence lawyers disclosed some details of the men's relationship early on in the case, including how the American had visited his friend's house in Sergiev Posad outside Moscow for ""saunas and kebabs"" the winter before his arrest. They also said he owed Whelan around 80,000 roubles ($1,147; Â£930) which the FSB claimed was advance payment for intelligence. The defence team said the Russian had requested a loan to buy a gift for his wife, as part of his trap. The town of Sergiev Posad is home to the spiritual centre of the Russian Orthodox Church - the Trinity Lavra of St Sergius The Whelan family eventually found a name and even a photograph. As he still works for the FSB, I can't identify him so I'll call him ""Dmitry"". But Whelan chatted openly to relatives on email about his friend, including which ""FSB school"" he'd attended. '''Dmitry' says hello!"", Whelan breezily told his parents after one Facetime chat with the Russian. It seems unusual behaviour if he was trying to recruit the man for US intelligence. It's possible he even introduced his parents to ""Dmitry"" on their 2009 trip to Russia, they can't be sure. In messages home from Moscow in January 2018 - a free holiday to use up his air miles - the American described visiting restaurants with his agent-friend, as well as the museums of the Kremlin and even a British pub. A year later, just days before his arrest, Mr Whelan took ""Dmitry"" and another man for Christmas dinner at a restaurant opposite his hotel. He snapped a picture of his guests, ""Dmitry"" smiling with a glass of wine and his fork raised over a juicy steak. Labelling it ""Dinner with Tovarishi"", or comrades, he messaged the image to a third Russian friend - even as he was supposedly discussing how to transfer classified intelligence. ""It all sounds incredibly naÃ¯ve now,"" his brother concedes of the relationship, after finally obtaining the passwords for Paul's computers and trawling through his files. He says his brother's VK messages were deleted after his arrest. ""He has friends in other countries with a military background, I think it was a social thing,"" David Whelan argues. ""The FSB thing wasn't a big deal, until he was entrapped."" Paul Whelan's twin brother David Paul Whelan's lawyers have now confirmed that he was being watched for some time and his communications monitored. A recent newspaper report claimed that the American had come to FSB attention over a decade ago when, as Kommersant's source says, he ""actively"" began contacting Russian servicemen. But the espionage case was based entirely on Whelan's ties to one officer, with all the evidence gathered in 2018 shortly before his arrest. ""Had this been an independent court, they would have reached only one decision - not guilty,"" his lawyer, Vladimir Zherebyonkov said after the verdict. He said the evidence was only ever examined by ""incompetent and interested parties"". Paul Whelan's lawyers Vladimir Zherebyonkov and Olga Karlova Ivan Pavlov believes Whelan's claim he was framed is ""always possible"" with FSB intelligence officers. ""The temptation is high: to rise in rank; for promotion; for more stars on your epaulettes,"" the lawyer says. ""This is how FSB careers are made; people rise on the back of such cases, like mushrooms after the rain."" Officers typically bide their time, he explains, calling it ""calf-rearing"", before a target is culled. If so, it appears that Paul Whelan was blind to the threat. In one email exchange during his early 2018 trip to Moscow, a relative joked: ""Don't get into any trouble we can't get you out of, haha!"" ""I will be with guys from the FSB, so should be okay!"", the American wrote back. The surge in East-West tensions has made espionage both more complex - and more urgent - in recent years. After the Salisbury poisoning in early 2018, more than 100 Russian diplomats identified as intelligence agents were expelled from embassies around the world in a co-ordinated act of protest. Russia responded with a mirror mass expulsion of Western diplomats. At the time, one ambassador told me the move had hit Moscow's spying capacity hard. But the same is presumably true in reverse. There were signs of problems even earlier. Almost exactly a year before Paul Whelan's arrest, a Norwegian staying at the same central Moscow hotel was arrested and charged with espionage. A retired border guard, Frode Berg admitted to delivering envelopes of cash and spy instructions on behalf of Norwegian military intelligence agency. Norwegian citizen Frode Berg in a Moscow courtroom, January 2019 His arrest and 14-year prison sentence caused a scandal back home when it emerged that civilians with no diplomatic cover were being used for high-risk espionage. There were even allegations that Norway was under pressure to obtain the information from its partners in Nato. Former CIA officers have dismissed any suggestion that Whelan could be involved in something similar, operating without diplomatic immunity: the idea, floated by one retired Russian officer, that his arrest was a ""great failure"" of US intelligence. The US Embassy and government have been very vocal about Whelan's detention. ""Paul Whelan is innocent,"" Ambassador John Sullivan told me emphatically last week, calling the trial a ""mockery of justice"". US Ambassador John Sullivan outside court after Paul Whelan's sentencing In Frode Berg's case, the Norwegian government stayed quiet. And while Paul Whelan's dishonourable discharge from the Marines shows there are parts of his life of which even his family have no idea, his supporters point to the theft charge as a positive. ""The intelligence community would never use someone with that past, especially in a situation like this when you'd be sent into a very, very difficult environment,"" argues Ryan Fayhee, the family's lawyer in the US who cites intelligence contacts from his days prosecuting cases of counter-espionage. ""It just wouldn't happen,"" Fayhee believes. ""Trust is the most important thing when you are out there, living on the edge."" Perhaps Whelan enjoyed the element of danger that came from flirting with the FSB, hanging out with intelligence officers. One friend who didn't want to be named told me he was ""a little quirky"", and liked to ""push the line a bit"". He wondered whether some comment, or joke might have been disastrously misconstrued. Whelan's own defence lawyer once hinted at that possibility. Skotti Fietsam, his former colleague, found Whelan serious and supportive, but also laughed at how he would insist on using heavily armed guards when he visited the factory she managed in Mexico, even posting them outside restaurants while they ate. ""I don't know if it was machismo; to show off,"" Fietsam said. ""But it was very unusual."" On Whelan's old website, alongside Harry Potter books and War and Peace, his recommended reading includes a long list of Cold War thrillers by Tom Clancy. But there's nothing glamorous about prison life in Lefortovo. The high wall and barbed wire of Lefortovo jail ""The porridge, some days it goes direct to the toilet,"" Frode Berg wrote to me from northern Norway of life in the FSB prison. He's now back home after a prisoner-swap. His own cellmate in Lefortovo used to joke that the inmates were fed dog food in the mornings. ""We never see or meet other prisoners. When we go to a meeting, prisoners were hidden from each other,"" Berg describes the lonely routine of life inside the K-shape jail, whose tall outer walls now butt-up against Soviet apartment blocks. The K-shaped buildings of Moscow's Lefortovo prison Paul Whelan is being held in the renovated wing, where the Norwegian says there is hot water in the cells now as well as a fridge, TV and toilet. But the space measures 9.5 square metres between two prisoners and exercise is one hour a day on the roof. Cellmates get to shower once a week, together, in the basement. One light remains on in the cell 24/7. Whelan and his family say letters have been held back for months by investigators and parcels returned. He wasn't allowed a phone call home for 16 months. And adding to his discomfort was chronic pain from a hernia that eventually strangulated, resulting in emergency surgery. Sentenced to a high-security prison, Paul Whelan won't be leaving Lefortovo just yet. His lawyers do plan to appeal against the verdict but other, bigger forces are already at play. The minute the American was convicted, the focus shifted to a possible prisoner swap. ""They want Yaroshenko and Bout, that's who they want back,"" Paul Whelan claimed, naming two high-profile Russian prisoners in America as the court bailiffs ushered me and my microphone out of the room. ""That's the only reason they've done this,"" he alleged. Lawyer Vladimir Zherebyonkov was soon saying the same, now claiming the FSB had been planning a swap all along. ""No-one's hiding that, everyone talks about it, all the officials,"" he told the press. So the prisoner who has always called himself a political hostage is now looking to the politicians to do a deal for his release. All the signs so far suggest Moscow is opening with a high bid - Viktor Bout, a weapons dealer serving 25 years in America and Konstantin Yaroshenko, sentenced to 20 years for drugs smuggling. Undated photo of Konstantin Yaroshenko (left) and Viktor Bout in 2010 On Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman called on Washington to show ""humanity"" and release Yaroshenko ""and other unjustly convicted"" Russians. The US has said repeatedly the two men were convicted in open and fair trials. ""We are not looking for an exchange, we are looking for justice for Paul,"" US Ambassador John Sullivan insisted, emerging from the verdict at Moscow City Court to a wall of microphones and cameras. Whelan's family are already pushing for action after a sentence that his brother, David, called ""a gut punch'. But he knows it took months of complex, confidential diplomacy to arrange a suitable swap for Frode Berg that eventually involved Russian agents in prison in Lithuania. Norway wasn't holding any convicted spies to trade and neither is America. ""I'm trying to focus on immediate goals, so I don't get distracted by how awful it is that he could spend 16 years behind bars,"" David Whelan told me, imagining how his twin would have felt, convicted of spying and heading back to his prison cell. ""I think Paul will be taking it very hard. It is an extraordinarily long time."" Paul Whelan US 'outraged' as Russia jails American for spying Â© 2025 BBC.

"The black is where we still need modern measurements at a reasonable resolution We've just become a little less ignorant about Planet Earth. The initiative that seeks to galvanise the creation of a full map of the ocean floor says one-fifth of this task has now been completed. When theNippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project,externalwas launched in 2017, only 6% of the global ocean bottom had been surveyed to what might be called modern standards. That number now stands at 19%, up from 15% in just the last year. Some 14.5 million sq km of new bathymetric (depth) data was included in the GEBCO grid in 2019 - an area equivalent to almost twice that of Australia. It does, however, still leave a great swathe of the planet in need of mapping to an acceptable degree. ""Today we stand at the 19% level. That means we've got another 81% of the oceans still to survey, still to map. That's an area about twice the size of Mars that we have to capture in the next decade,"" project director Jamie McMichael-Phillips told BBC News. Son repeats father's historic ocean dive 'Stunning' seafloor ridges record Antarctic retreat Satellites find 'thousands' of new ocean mountains Robot duo wins ocean-mapping XPRIZE A state-of-the-art multibeam echosounder is slung below a survey ship The map at the top of this page illustrates the challenge faced by GEBCO in the coming years. Black represents those areas where we have yet to get direct echosounding measurements of the shape of the ocean floor. Blues correspond to water depth (deeper is purple, shallower is lighter blue). It's not true to say we have no idea of what's in the black zones; satellites have actually taught us a great deal. Certain spacecraft carryaltimeter instruments that can infer seafloor topographyfrom the way its gravity sculpts the water surface above - but this only gives a best resolution at over a kilometre, and Seabed 2030 has a desire for a resolution of at least 100m everywhere. Satellites: The shape of the sea surface traces at coarse resolution the shape of the seafloor Better seafloor maps are needed for a host of reasons. They are essential for navigation, of course, and for laying underwater cables and pipelines. They are also important for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around the underwater mountains that wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot. In addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water. This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a critical role in moving heat around the planet. And if you want to understand precisely how sea-levels will rise in different parts  of the world, good ocean-floor maps are a must. Much of the data that's been imported into the GEBCO grid recently has been in existence for some time but was ""sitting on a shelf"" out of the public domain. The companies, institutions and governments that were holding this information have now handed it over - and there is probably a lot more of this hidden resource still to be released. The Mariana Trench in the Pacific is the deepest ocean location on Earth - but very well mapped But new acquisitions will also be required. Some of these will come from a great crowdsourcing effort - from ships, big and small, routinely operating their echo-sounding equipment as they transit the globe. Even small vessels - fishing boats and yachts - can play their part by attaching data-loggers to their sonar and navigation equipment. One very effective strategy is evidenced by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), which operates in the more remote parts of the globe - and that is simply to mix up the routes taken by ships. ""Very early on we adopted the ethos that data should be collected on passage - on the way to where we were going, not just at the site of interest,"" explained BAS scientist Dr Rob Larter. ""A beautiful example of this isthe recent bathymetric map of the Drake Passage area,external(between South America and Antarctica). A lot of that was acquired by different research projects as they fanned out and moved back and forth to the places they were going."" Artwork: Robot vessels can help close the gaps New technology will be absolutely central to the GEBCO quest. Ocean Infinity, a prominent UK-US company that conducts seafloor surveys, is currently buildinga fleet of robotic surface vesselsthrough a subsidiary it calls Armada. This start-up's MD, Dan Hook, says low-cost, uncrewed vehicles may be the only way to close some of the gaps in the more out-of-the-way locations in the 2030 grid. He told BBC News: ""When you look at the the mapping of the seabed in areas closer to shore, you see the business case very quickly. Whether it's for wind farms or cable-laying - there are lots of people that want to know what's down there. But when it's those very remote areas of the planet, the case then is really only a scientific one."" Jamie McMichael-Phillips is confident his project's target can be met if everyone pulls together. ""I am confident, but to do it we will need partnerships. We need governments, we need industry, we need academics, we need philanthropists, and we need citizen scientists. We need all these individuals to come together if we're to deliver an ocean map that is absolutely fundamental and essential to humankind."" GEBCO stands for General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans. It is the only intergovernmental organisation with a mandate to map the entire ocean floor. The latest status of its Seabed 2030 project was announced to coincide with World Hydrography Day.

""And then he turned and started looking towards us and that's when I just started shouting 'run'."" This video can not be played The Labour leader Sir Keir
Starmer has said ""people are united in their grief"" following the terror
attack in Reading. ""This was a horrific
incident, our thoughts and our hearts go out to all those affected,
particularly the family and friends of those who tragically died,"" he said. ""I think
across Reading, across the country, people are united in their grief at this
incident.â ""Itâs very important that the
investigation runs its course, but I will want to work with the government in
response to this, to look at whether thereâs lessons that can be learned,
whether there need to be changes to the law. ""This is not a time for party
politics."" Chief Constable John Campbell from Thames Valley Police said ""lives have been devastated"" by the attack in Reading. He said a suspect was apprehended within five minutes of the attack starting and praised the bravery of his officers. ""A number of members of the public"" also helped at the scene, he said, thanking them. He said there was ""no wider risk to the public"" and it was believed ""no-one else is involved"". People have left flowers and messages near the scene of the stabbings in Reading. One reads: ""There are no words that anyone can say to express how horrible and senseless this was."" While another simply states: ""Reading weeps."" Three people died and three others were taken to hospitalafter the attack in Forbury Gardens on Saturday evening. On Sunday morning large parts of the town centre remained cordoned off as police continue their investigation. Police have arrested one man and declared the stabbings that left three people dead a terrorist incident. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Pro-democracy activists fear Beijing's law will undermine Hong Kong's freedoms China's new security law for Hong Kong envisages setting up an office in the territory to gather intelligence and handle crimes against national security, state media say. The new security law will also override any local laws that conflict with it, Xinhua news agency reported. The planned law has sparked protests and drawn international condemnation. Critics say it will destroy the freedoms Hong Kong enjoys but which are not available in mainland China. On Friday the European Parliament voted to take China to the International Court of Justice in The Hague if the law was imposed. But China says the law is needed to tackle separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign elements and rejects criticism a interference in its affairs. The city of two masks faces a new crisis China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997 under an agreement centring on a ""one country, two systems"" principle that guaranteed certain freedoms for Hong Kong and that do not apply in the mainland. Details were published after a three-day meeting of the main decision-making body in China's parliament, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. A new national security office in Hong Kong would deal with national security cases, but would also have other powers such as overseeing education about national security in Hong Kong schools. Xinhua also said that Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam would be able to appoint specific judges to hear national security cases. Ms Lam has backed the proposed law and has denied that Hong Kong's freedoms under the ""one country, two systems"" will be affected. The Hong Kong government will be required to carry out most enforcement under the new law, but Beijing will be able to overrule the Hong Kong authorities in some cases. ""If the local laws... are inconsistent with this Law, the provisions of this Law shall apply. The power to interpret this law belongs to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress,"" Xinhua said. The process of creating and finalising legislation in China usually takes some years, BBC Reality Check's Wanyuan Song says, with one law for Taiwan taking five years to pass from when it was first proposed. But state media says the new security law planned for Hong Kong could be published this summer, although it was proposed just a few months ago, she adds. By Celia Hatton, Asia-Pacific editor, BBC News In one short but powerful document, Beijing initiated the most dramatic changes to Hong Kong's power structure since the territory was handed back from Britain in 1997. The new law says unequivocally that it will override any divergent legislation in Hong Kong, effectively wiping out the Chinese territory's own body of laws and regulations. Chinese leaders contend the law will target only a handful of terrorists and separatists, but key details have yet to be released: namely, what falls under the umbrella of national security and what constitutes a crime. The legislation won't be imposed without a fight: many in Hong Kong are fiercely opposed to the law, fearing it will erase their existing freedoms. And if the national security law does become a reality, Beijing faces international ramifications. The US says the law means Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to merit special treatment under US law. This potentially paves the way for Hong Kong to be stripped of trading privileges, such as lower tariffs, meaning that the US would treat it the same as any other mainland Chinese city for trading purposes. Meanwhile the UK says it will change its immigration rules and offer millions of people in Hong Kong ""a route to citizenship"" if China imposes the new law. What if the US removes Hong Kong's special status? The 1997 handover agreement between the UK and China - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle - envisages Hong Kong rights that include freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights which no other part of mainland China has. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Under the same agreement, Hong Kong is expected to enact its own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law. But its unpopularity means it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after protests. Then, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement. China doesn't want to see that happen again.

According to a series of measures announced, they will all be tested at airports upon arrival. For those infected, a 14-day quarantine will be mandatory.

reduce the two-metre social-distancing rule in England this week. The distance could be lowered with ""mitigations"",
so people can be closer without a higher risk of transmission, Health Secretary
Matt Hancock told the BBC. But
what does the science say?Find out more here. There have been more than 300,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 42,500 people have died, government figures show. However, these numbers only include people who have been tested and the total number of deaths relating to the virus is likely to be higher. Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the weekly number of recorded deaths has returned to close to normal levels for the time of year. You can check on the number of cases and deaths in your area here. The coronavirus reproduction
rate in Germany, known as the R number, jumped to 2.88 on Sunday, compared to 1.79 a day earlier, according to the country's Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health. The RKI said the figure was based on a four-day average, and the spike is mainly because of local outbreaks, such as at the meat processing plant in in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where more than 1,300 workers have been infected. The R number is the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average. In Germany, this now means that out of 100 people with Covid-19, a further 288 will be infected. An R value of less than one is needed to gradually contain the disease. Our colleague James Gallagher has looked intohow the R number is calculated.

Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris The number of Covid-19 cases continues to fall in France, so the government is proceeding with the next  step back to normality.   There may be only two more weeks left of term, but from Monday going to school will be compulsory for everyone up to the age of 15, for the first time since March. Only lycÃ©es - which cover the last three years of school education - are not affected.   Schools have in fact been open for several weeks but only on a voluntary basis, and for most it has only been possible to attend for a day or two a week. The change to full schooling is possible because the government has relaxed rules about social distancing between pupils. Also on Monday, cinemas, casinos, swimming pools and holiday centres are opening.  Campsites have been open for two weeks already.  Group sports are also permitted, but not combat sports. With cafes and restaurants all open, and no restrictions on travel, life is for many French beginning to resume its regular rhythms. Life in France is slowly going back to normal A limited schedule is in place until the end of June East Midlands Airport is resuming passenger flightsfor the first time since lockdown measures were introduced in March, with a Ryanair service from Alicante scheduled to be the first to arrive. It is the first time passengers have set foot inside the airport in Castle Donington, Leicestershire, for 12 weeks. The airport is a major UK cargo hub and its freight operations saw it become one of Europe's 10 busiest airports during lockdown. This included flights bringing medical and personal protective equipment to the UK. Chris Lewis, when he was still on the island with his dog Jet A former British paratrooper has left the previously uninhabited island where he had been isolating after lockdown measures were introduced during a fundraising challenge. Chris Lewis, from Swansea, had walked 12,000 miles (19,300km) of the UK coastline after setting off from Wales in August 2017. He was given special permission to live in the only house on Hildasay, Shetland, with his dog Jet,external. ""I feel I left a part of me behind,"" he said. The 39-year-old was originally sleeping in a tent on mainland Shetland when lockdown restrictions were imposed on 23 March. This is the only house on the island He was offered the keys to a former shepherd's hut on Hildasay when its owners heard he was camping. The hut had no running water, heating or electricity. A regular boat brought him fresh water and coal. He collected driftwood, foraged and fished for food, and always made sure he had a three-week supply of dog food for Jet. He said he had been ""the happiest I've ever been"" while living on the island. The new powers will cover firms such as pharmaceutical companies The UK government will introduce new measures on Monday toprotect businesses critical to public health from foreign takeovers. Legal changes would give ministers extra powers to protect those needed to help in future pandemics, who might be struggling now. The new powers will cover firms such as pharmaceutical companies. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""The UK is open for investment, but not for exploitation."" Some much-needed inspiring news: South Korean golfer Ryu So-yeon won the Korean Open by a shot and then donated her $200,000 (Â£160,000) prize to coronavirus charities. Ryu, a former world number one who has previously given her winnings to charity, said the idea had come to her the previous evening. ""Before the awards ceremony, I called my mom. I told her that I'm going to make the announcement so don't get too surprised. She was just as happy I was,"" she told local media. ""Since this tournament has a lot of meaning to me and I thought that I may be able to play better if I had a positive goal, I came up with it last night."" Well done! All shops in Northern Ireland have been able to reopen since Friday Northern Ireland's chief medical officer has cautioned against complacency after latest figures showed no further coronavirus-linked deaths being reported on Sunday. Dr Michael McBride said progress was being made in ""forcing the virus into retreat"" but warned that ""now is not the time to drop guard"". The overall death toll recorded by Northern Ireland's Department of Health remains at 545. The suppression of the virus there has prompted Stormont ministers to quicken alocal exit out of lockdown. From 26 June, caravan parks, campsites and self-contained tourist accommodation will be able to reopen. A week later on 3 July, hotels, restaurants, cafes, coffee shops, pubs and bars will be able to welcome customers back. Church services are set to resume on 29 June. Quarantined workers in the town of Verl clashed with police on Saturday The leader of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia has ruled out sweeping local lockdown measures despite an outbreak centred on a meat processing plant near the town of GÃ¼tersloh that has caused at least 1,300 new cases. Armin Laschet said there was an ""enormous pandemic risk"" but the outbreak was ""clearly centred on the firm"" and there was no ""significant tranmission"" to the wider population. Laschet said a lockdown could not be ruled out entirely but efforts would focus on preventing infections spreading to the population at large and this would enable more targeted measures to deal with the outbreak. On Saturday disturbances broke out at accommodation used by TÃ¶nnies staff in the nearby town of Verl where 700 people had been put into quarantine. ""Around 200 people tried to get out, but 500 people complied
with quarantine rules,"" Uwe lÃ¼hrig, head of police in the GÃ¶ttingen area, told reporters. Eight police officers were injured during clashes with residents wielding bottles, fireworks and metal bars, he said. Some 6,500 workers and their families have been told to go into quarantine to contain the outbreak. Holiday spots in Wales like Tenby have suffered from a lack of visitors Britain'slockdown ruleshave had a devastating effect on its tourism industry and the chances of having a summer break abroad seem remote. Theholiday industry in parts of the UKlooks set to start operating again during July and tourism chiefs in Wales say they are ready to capitalise on any opportunities to resume business. ""We have lost an awful lot... we've lost Easter, we've lost two bank holidays,"" said Andrew Campbell of the Wales Tourism Alliance. He said that 97% of businesses within the industry in Wales have closed due to the pandemic and 80% of staff have been furloughed. ""People are suffering,"" he added. Â© 2025 BBC.

Chris Lewis, when he was still on the island with his dog Jet A former British paratrooper has left the previously uninhabited island where he had been isolating after lockdown measures were introduced during a fundraising challenge. Chris Lewis, from Swansea, had walked 12,000 miles (19,300km) of the UK coastline after setting off from Wales in August 2017. He was given special permission to live in the only house on Hildasay, Shetland, with his dog Jet,external. ""I feel I left a part of me behind,"" he said. The 39-year-old was originally sleeping in a tent on mainland Shetland when lockdown restrictions were imposed on 23 March. This is the only house on the island He was offered the keys to a former shepherd's hut on Hildasay when its owners heard he was camping. The hut had no running water, heating or electricity. A regular boat brought him fresh water and coal. He collected driftwood, foraged and fished for food, and always made sure he had a three-week supply of dog food for Jet. He said he had been ""the happiest I've ever been"" while living on the island. The new powers will cover firms such as pharmaceutical companies The UK government will introduce new measures on Monday toprotect businesses critical to public health from foreign takeovers. Legal changes would give ministers extra powers to protect those needed to help in future pandemics, who might be struggling now. The new powers will cover firms such as pharmaceutical companies.

Some much-needed inspiring news: South Korean golfer Ryu So-yeon won the Korean Open by a shot and then donated her $200,000 (Â£160,000) prize to coronavirus charities. Ryu, a former world number one who has previously given her winnings to charity, said the idea had come to her the previous evening. ""Before the awards ceremony, I called my mom. I told her that I'm going to make the announcement so don't get too surprised. She was just as happy I was,"" she told local media.

All shops in Northern Ireland have been able to reopen since Friday Northern Ireland's chief medical officer has cautioned against complacency after latest figures showed no further coronavirus-linked deaths being reported on Sunday. Dr Michael McBride said progress was being made in ""forcing the virus into retreat"" but warned that ""now is not the time to drop guard"". The overall death toll recorded by Northern Ireland's Department of Health remains at 545. The suppression of the virus there has prompted Stormont ministers to quicken alocal exit out of lockdown. From 26 June, caravan parks, campsites and self-contained tourist accommodation will be able to reopen. A week later on 3 July, hotels, restaurants, cafes, coffee shops, pubs and bars will be able to welcome customers back. Church services are set to resume on 29 June. Quarantined workers in the town of Verl clashed with police on Saturday The leader of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia has ruled out sweeping local lockdown measures despite an outbreak centred on a meat processing plant near the town of GÃ¼tersloh that has caused at least 1,300 new cases. Armin Laschet said there was an ""enormous pandemic risk"" but the outbreak was ""clearly centred on the firm"" and there was no ""significant tranmission"" to the wider population. Laschet said a lockdown could not be ruled out entirely but efforts would focus on preventing infections spreading to the population at large and this would enable more targeted measures to deal with the outbreak. On Saturday disturbances broke out at accommodation used by TÃ¶nnies staff in the nearby town of Verl where 700 people had been put into quarantine. ""Around 200 people tried to get out, but 500 people complied
with quarantine rules,"" Uwe lÃ¼hrig, head of police in the GÃ¶ttingen area, told reporters. Eight police officers were injured during clashes with residents wielding bottles, fireworks and metal bars, he said. Some 6,500 workers and their families have been told to go into quarantine to contain the outbreak. Holiday spots in Wales like Tenby have suffered from a lack of visitors Britain'slockdown ruleshave had a devastating effect on its tourism industry and the chances of having a summer break abroad seem remote. Theholiday industry in parts of the UKlooks set to start operating again during July and tourism chiefs in Wales say they are ready to capitalise on any opportunities to resume business. ""We have lost an awful lot... we've lost Easter, we've lost two bank holidays,"" said Andrew Campbell of the Wales Tourism Alliance. He said that 97% of businesses within the industry in Wales have closed due to the pandemic and 80% of staff have been furloughed. ""People are suffering,"" he added. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Eyewitness Lawrence Wort on Reading stabbing attack: 'I saw a massive knife in his hand... at least five inches minimum' Three people have died and three more have been seriously injured after stabbings in a park in Reading, police confirmed. A 25-year-old man from Reading has been arrested on suspicion of murder after being detained at the scene. The attack happened at Forbury Gardens at about 19:00 BST where several people were stabbed. Police are not currently treating the incident as terror-related, but counter terrorism officers were called. Security sources have told the BBC a man arrested at the scene is thought to be Libyan. Home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said he had been told the man had previously been in prison in the UK for a relatively minor conviction, not a terrorism offence. What we know so far In pictures One eyewitness told the BBC how he saw a man moving between groups of people in the park, trying to stab them. There were reports a police officer had ""rugby tackled"" the suspect to the ground, according tothe Sunday Mirror,external. Police gather at a cordon close to the scene Det Chf Supt Ian Hunter, from Thames Valley Police, said police were not looking for any other people in connection with the attack, adding that officers were ""keeping an open mind as to the motivation for the incident"". Police have asked anyone with mobile phone footage of the attack to come forward and people have been urged not to share videos and photos online ""out of respect for the victims' families"". Thames Valley Police said the incident was not connected to an earlier Black Lives Matter (BLM) protest in the park. At 20:00 BST, officers arrived at a block of flats in Basingstoke Road in Reading and secured the scene, leaving residents waiting outside. More than a dozen armed police officers carrying shields were seen entering the block at about 23:00 BST. BBC News Home Affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani, who was outside the block of flats, said he heard a loud bang at the scene about an hour and a half later, after which several armed officers left. By Linda Serck, BBC News A large cordon remains in place following the incident Reading appears desolate and in mourning this morning. Large areas outside the gardens are taped up and there are not many people here, mainly journalists and their TV cameras. A strong wind is rattling litter in grey, deserted streets, most of which are being patrolled by armed police. Commuters are struggling to get to work as so many roads have been cordoned off with police tape. The few people arriving from Reading station expressed ""shock"". Marie Castro from Slough works at a Costa coffee shop in Reading and said: ""I was scared to be here but I have to be here for work."" The attack ""doesn't seem right for Reading"", she added. ""It's multicultural and really friendly. I was really shocked when I heard the news"". Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsaid,externalhis ""thoughts are with all of those affected by the appalling incident in Reading"". ""My thanks to the emergency services on the scene,"" he added. Emergency air ambulances were called to the scene and five ambulance crews from South Central Ambulance Service attended. Laurence Wort, 20, who was visiting Reading for the day, told the BBC he was about 10m away when the attack started. ""The park was pretty full, a lot of people sat around drinking with friends when one lone person walked through, suddenly shouted some unintelligible words and went round a large group trying to stab them. ""He stabbed three of them and then turned and started running towards me, when we turned and started running. ""When he realised that he couldn't catch us he tried to stab another group sat down. ""He got one in the back of the neck and then when he realised everyone was starting to run, he ran out the park."" This video can not be played Armed police went to a block of flats in Reading following the stabbings in Forbury Gardens Claire Gould, a freelance journalist who lives in Reading, said she walked past Forbury Gardens at about 18:40 BST ""and everything seemed calm"". She then saw an air ambulance land in King's Meadow - another park close to the scene - at about 19:00 BST, followed by a second about 10 minutes later. ""There were multiple sirens from 19:00 going on for the next couple of hours and police helicopters [were] circling,"" she added. Police at Forbury Gardens in Reading town centre Home Secretary Priti Pateltweeted,externalto say she was ""deeply concerned"" about the incident. Ms Patel later issued a statement condemning the stabbings as a ""senseless attack on people simply enjoying a Saturday evening with family and friends"".

"There can be no post-pandemic economic recovery without a strong and healthy steel industry, according to Labour MP Stephen Kinnock. Opposition MPs are calling on the UK government to provide loans to steel firms experiencing a sudden drop in demand due to coronavirus. It said it was ""committed to supporting the sector's economic recovery"". Aberavon MP Mr Kinnock toldBBC Politics Walessupport was needed in ""days not weeks"" to help the industry. In May,10 Welsh MPs wrote to the chancellorasking for extra support for the sector during the pandemic. As shops start reopening, and pressure builds on the government to outline its plans for the UK's economic recovery, big questions still remain about the part steel will play in the country's economic bounce back. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Newport East Labour MP Jessica Morden told Boris Johnson: ""Plants like Tata's Llanwern and the Orb steel works - the only electrical steel plant in the UK - can play a key part in that recovery, but three months into this crisis and steel companies are still waiting for government liquidity support which is critical. ""Will the prime minister commit to address this now?"" Mr Johnson said ministers would do ""everything they can"" to maintain UK steel production, but no bailout has been promised yet. Mr Kinnock said steel was the ""backbone of our manufacturing sector"". ""Nothing, really, can work in this country in terms of the manufacturing sector without steel,"" he said. ""Steel is in the offices we work in, the cars that we drive, the trains that we ride, even the cutlery that we eat our food with."" Stephen Kinnock: ""Nothing, really, can work in this country in terms of the manufacturing sector without steel"" Demand for steel has dropped massively during the coronavirus crisis, especially with industries like car manufacturing grinding to a halt. Before the pandemic,Tata Steel had suffered Â£371m in pre-tax losseslast year and there was continuing uncertainty for the wider industry because of Brexit. There have been reports the UK government may consider so-called""last resort"" loansfor viable companies, if their failure would disproportionately harm the economy. But ministers will want some certainty any loans will be paid back to ""protect"" the taxpayer. Mr Kinnock said he believed loans to steel firms would be returned and he has urged the government to consider the costs to the taxpayer of not stepping in to support them. ""We are urging the government to support the industry now and also think about the cost of doing nothing,"" he said. ""There are 4,000 relatively well paid men and women working in the Port Talbot steel works, thousands more relatively well paid jobs in the steel industry across the country. Shops expected to reopen in Wales from Monday Fear pubs 'will go bust' because of two-metre rule ""Imagine the cost of losing those jobs. ""Imagine the cost of decommissioning a steelworks with blast furnaces and the vast cost that would cause the government. ""So we are saying to the government - give the temporary loan. ""It is a loan that will be paid back in order to avoid the massive cost of doing nothing."" Steel industry analyst Dr Kathryn Ringwald-Wildman said the pandemic has hit firms at an already tough time. ""We've got uncertainty building on uncertainty,"" she said. ""The position of the steel industries is quite desperate at the moment and they will need government support to survive. Tata's Port Talbot steelworks provide well-paid jobs in the area ""They would've needed government support without the pandemic. ""If they are to weather this particular storm they will need support. ""The question is: this is taxpayer's money. Is this a bridge over the pandemic crisis or is it a bridge over the pandemic crisis only to find the economic situation post-pandemic is much more serious globally than we might imagine?"" Beyond questions around the cost of recovery, withTata Steel reportedly needing at least Â£500m through the pandemic, government decisions to support steel or not are inherently political - with the effect on areas like Port Talbot hanging in the mix. ""You take the steel industry out of Port Talbot you have got nothing. You haven't got anything to take its place,"" said Dr Ringwald-Wildman. ""The decision that's made now will resonate for many years. ""It may be that the politicians will decide to defer the decision to end steel manufacturing in the UK - let the companies sink or swim. Government draws up rescue plan for key companies Tata Steel 'needs Â£500m government support' ""They might choose to defer that because of the consequences down the line. ""It would take a very brave government to say we don't need a steel industry in the UK. ""The emphasis has been, in conversations around the edge of the Brexit decision, we will make our own steel, use our own steel, buy our own steel. ""We will, of course, be trading on the international market. ""But the notion that our domestic steel industry would be one of our major suppliers to our manufacturing industry was fundamental."" A spokesperson for Tata Steel, which has furloughed about 2,400 staff across UK sites, said: ""The ultimate impact of coronavirus has been the sudden drop in demand for steel. ""But it is a storm that we are weathering, and we're looking to come out of the other side. ""We are in negotiations with both UK and Welsh governments to seek all available support that we can."" A UK government spokesperson said it has ""engaged with businesses across the economy, and has already increased the scope and scale of many of our support schemes, including loans to steel companies with a turnover of over Â£45m"". ""We recognise that economic conditions continue to be challenging and we are committed to supporting the sector's economic recovery.""

continue to be with the families who will be mourning loved ones after this
horrific act, and to all those who have been affected by it."" They added the investigation ""continues to move at a fast pace"". Police cordons will continue to remain in place in Reading town centre while detectives work through the crime scene. They also confirmed that the 25-year-old man from
Reading, who was arrested initially on suspicion of murder, has now
been re-arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 by detectives from
CTPSE, which gives them more time to hold him in custody.  Khairi Saadallah held over three deaths came to the attention of security services in 2019, sources say. Andre Rhoden-PaulBBC News Some of Reading's busiest streets and thoroughfares lay eerily quiet this afternoon, as a maze of police cordons around the town blocked them off to the public. Those cordons with a view of Forbury Gardens attracted onlookers: not for its tranquil and pruned gardens but as a place now associated with three killings being treated as a ""terrorist incident"". Photographers could be seen snapping pictures of scene of crime officers in white boiler suits, while TV news crews - some from foreign networks - were using the park as a backdrop for live reports. Reading is front and centre-stage. Tomorrow's lessons have been cancelled at the school were James Furlong worked. The Holt School will remain open and counsellors will be available for all pupils and staff. Support staff will also be on hand for all year groups at the site in Wokingham between 08:30 and 15:15 BST on Monday. Meanwhile, the nearby St Paul's Church will be open from 09:00, for pupils wishing to light a candle, say a prayer, or talk. The school says it will create
a book of memories for Mr Furlong, to which members of the school can contribute. Pupils taught by James Furlong and their parents, have paid tribute to him after the news he was killed in the Reading terror attack. Jade Simon, a pupil at The Holt school from 2012-2017, told the PA news agency: ""He really was an incredible teacher. ""He was funny and kind and always made history fun and entertaining. History was always one of my favourite subjects and Mr Furlong always encouraged it."" Keith Power, whose daughter attends the school, said: ""He was a wonderful man. He was so helpful and supportive of my daughter. He had a real passion for history and teaching and was so caring of his pupils. ""It's so senseless. So much hatred in the world right now. I fear for my kids' futures."" ""He truly inspired everyone he taught,"" wrote co-heads Anne Kennedy and Katie Pearce, of their head of history James Furlong.

Linda SerckBBC South As a police helicopter flies overhead, people in Reading have been reacting to the news that last night's stabbings are being considered a terror incident. Oliver Connor, from Tilehurst, Reading said the attacks were ""shocking"". ""It's not something you expect
from a town like Reading. I think people have been so preoccupied by the
pandemic that people forget that this sort of risk exists,"" she added. Belle Tunheim, from Slough, said: ""I'm in disbelief. It could
be that he might have a mental issue. You can never tell until it's been
investigated properly."" Harry McCarthy, who has lived in Reading for eight years,
said: ""I'm disgusted with the way things are going in this country. What's going on in our society?"" The UK prime minister says that if there are lessons to learn after the terror attack the government will learn them. Police and counter terror officers have urged members of the public not to post footage or images of the attack on social media. Assistant commissioner for Metroplitan Police, Neil Basu, instead asked for footage to be shared with police. He said the risk of terror attacks remained ""substantial"". However, he said members of the public should be ""alert not alarmed"" and report anything suspicious. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent Security sources have told the BBC that the man
suspected of carrying out the Reading attack was brought to the attention of
MI5 in 2019. Sources say that Khairi Saadallah came to the attention of the
security services after they received information that he had aspirations to
travel abroad, potentially for terrorism. When the information was further
investigated, as the first stage of looking into a potential lead, no genuine
threat or immediate risk was identified. No case file was opened which would
have made him a target for further investigation. Greg Wilton said he was having a picnic in the park with his wife and friends when the attacks happened. He said: ""At
one point without much noise we noticed a commotion on the other side of the
park. ""We ran over and without seeing an attacker we found three men lying on the
floor bleeding profusely from what we thought was their heads, necks or body. ""Another member of the public took off his T-shirt and tried to stop the
bleeding alongside someone we assume to be his girlfriend. ""Me and my friend Tom
put a second victim in the recovery position and tried to stem his bleeding
from his ear with my canvas shopping bag. ""His breathing became increasingly
irregular, and shallower until the police and paramedic arrived to help us. ""Another friend of mine Ranveer helped an Asian man who had also been stabbed in
the face. ""This was in another part of the park from the victims we were helping
and so we were separated. ""My wife Amy and I are obviously very shocked and
shaken by what happened."" Three people have died in a stabbing attack in Reading's town centre. Here is what we also know, so far: Lawrence Wort told the BBC he saw a man stab several people in Forbury Gardens in the town. He said he thought it was a scuffle between the attacker and a group in the park. ""He stood up and I saw a massive knife in his hand. Probably at least 5in minimum. ""And then he turned and started looking towards us and that's when I just started shouting 'run'."" This video can not be played The Labour leader Sir Keir
Starmer has said ""people are united in their grief"" following the terror
attack in Reading. ""This was a horrific
incident, our thoughts and our hearts go out to all those affected,
particularly the family and friends of those who tragically died,"" he said. ""I think
across Reading, across the country, people are united in their grief at this
incident.â ""Itâs very important that the
investigation runs its course, but I will want to work with the government in
response to this, to look at whether thereâs lessons that can be learned,
whether there need to be changes to the law. ""This is not a time for party
politics."" Chief Constable John Campbell from Thames Valley Police said ""lives have been devastated"" by the attack in Reading. He said a suspect was apprehended within five minutes of the attack starting and praised the bravery of his officers. ""A number of members of the public"" also helped at the scene, he said, thanking them. He said there was ""no wider risk to the public"" and it was believed ""no-one else is involved"". People have left flowers and messages near the scene of the stabbings in Reading. One reads: ""There are no words that anyone can say to express how horrible and senseless this was."" While another simply states: ""Reading weeps."" Three people died and three others were taken to hospitalafter the attack in Forbury Gardens on Saturday evening. On Sunday morning large parts of the town centre remained cordoned off as police continue their investigation. Police have arrested one man and declared the stabbings that left three people dead a terrorist incident. Â© 2025 BBC.
