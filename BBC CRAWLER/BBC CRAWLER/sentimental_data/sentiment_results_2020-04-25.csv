"Coronavirus tests offered to UK key workers were booked up within an hour - apart from some in Scotland. The tests, which are targeted at those who are self-isolating, allow people to return to work as quickly as possible. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said testing is part of ""getting Britain back on her feet"". But the government website closed to new applicants within hours of the Friday launch, after 46,000 people tried to access it. Home testing kits became unavailable less than 15 minutes after bookings reopened on Saturday morning. Some 16,000 bookings were made. Tests at drive-through sites in England were booked up within an hour on Saturday morning, with spaces not becoming available again until the evening. Requests for drive-through tests in Scotland are still currently available on the site. Key workers inWales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalcannot currently book tests online. Both nations appear as options on the government's online system but with a label saying no slots are available. For key workers in England and Scotland with symptoms of the virus, and anyone in their household with symptoms, tests at drive-through centres and home testing kits will become available each day from 08:00 BST, Downing Street has said. Testing extended to include key workers in Scotland Essential workers can also request a test through their employers. The tests offered are swab tests that determine whether people currently have the virus - rather than whether they have had it in the past.

Prof Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, urged key workers showing Covid-19 symptoms to book a test online.

Anyoneclassified as an ""essential worker"",externalwho is showing symptoms can request a test in England. The list includes NHS and social care staff, teachers, police officers and transport workers. They and their family can also request a test if someone in their household shows symptoms. If a child in the same household as an essential worker needs a test, the child's parent or guardian must book it on their behalf. The test involves taking a swab of the nose and the back of the throat. There are two ways to get a test: at a testing site, or with a home testing kit. Home kits will initially be limited but are being sent to NHS staff. Most people will get their test results by text within two days.

"The father of one of Scotland's largest families - Roy Hann - has tested positive for Covid-19 When lockdown measures were first announced, Roy and Emma Hann gave their children strict routines and organised family activities in a valiant effort to maintain order. The Hanns from Dundee areknown as one of Scotland's largest families- and with 10 of their 13 children living at home, their household was large enough to form two basketball teams. Despite the parents' best efforts, all order ""went out the window"" after the novelty wore off. Shattered nerves and bickering ensued as the family tried to cope with a less-than-peaceful new normal. But all tension subsided on Thursday when they learned Roy had tested positive for Covid-19. Roy in full PPE as he works with high acuity patients at Ninewells Hospital ""I'm a few days in and it's very mild,"" said Roy, a nurse practitioner at Ninewells Hospital. ""I was really surprised when I tested positive. ""I'm around so many Covid patients but I wear protective equipment and we're very proactive with testing in Tayside - so much so we're now listed as a hotspot. ""But we joke in work you're more likely to catch it from the supermarket - I just feel bad for being off."" The Hann household is now going through a 14-day quarantine - apart from Roy who will isolate for seven days. While the 50-year-old has type 2 diabetes, he says he generally keeps ""very well"" - he expects to return to full health and is keen to get back on the frontline of the pandemic. ""My life hadn't really changed, I just get to see my children more,"" he said. ""I'm actually glad I've had it, it makes me feel more confident about going back to work. ""There's so many in our house, we joke we're going for herd immunity."" Lockdown life - the Hanns have kept themselves entertained with family games With Roy in the house full-time, family life has become more manageable for cafÃ© owner Emma - but it's not without its challenges. The Hann children's ages range from five to 28 - at one stage the family got through 50 pints of milk, 21 loaves of bread and five large boxes of cereal each week. Now with social distancing at supermarkets and caps on products, buying food is more difficult than ever. ""The fact that we're a big family means social distancing guidelines are challenging for us,"" said Emma. ""To go to the shop and only buy three of an item means we need to go more often which exposes us more. To me it's quite a daunting situation."" Emma encouraged the youngest children to decorate a 'tuck shop' blackboard - which she now uses for 'bargaining' With work on hiatus, Emma's sole focus is looking after her children - her 28 years of experience has stood her in good stead, but the pressures of lockdown life have occasionally been overwhelming. She said: ""I went a walk the day before Roy tested positive and I started to hit a wall - I started crying. ""I thought I'm done and I just wanted a break because it was too hard. ""Weirdly the next morning when I told the family about Roy, they all took a bit of a moment - the last couple of days everyone has been pulling together a bit more."" Scotland's 'superfamily' set to welcome first grandchild With their sense of togetherness renewed, the Hanns continue to play basketball most nights in their garden. It's a simple pleasure - but one that has made all the difference. ""We feel very privileged,"" Emma said. ""We're very aware we have a garden. We've been in a situation where we had five kids in a flat and the idea of doing that now is terrible. ""I thought at the beginning of lockdown that structure would get me through it - but the reality is it doesn't work like that. ""My 14-year-old son is on his X-box for most of the night, while my daughter gets up at 6am to work from home - I didn't like it at first but it's actually easier to feed people in shifts. ""It's better to be flexible, we just have to do what we can."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"People should seek medical care when they need it and not be put off by the coronavirus epidemic, say doctors, charities and the health service. Anyone who delays seeking treatment is putting their long-term health at risk, as well as their life, they warn. Half the usual number of people are going to A&E and treatment for heart attacks and strokes is down. Seeking medical help is one of the four reasons people can safely leave home, government guidance says. NHS England's medical director Stephen Powis said he was concerned by the reduced numbers. ""If you do have symptoms of stroke, chest pain and think it might be a heart attack, a sick child who is deteriorating, if you are a pregnant woman and the baby is not moving as much as it used to - it is important you don't delay,"" he said. Coronavirus: Latest news from around the world Prof Powis suggested the falling numbers were due to people worrying about bothering the NHS and fears of catching the virus in a medical environment. But he said he wanted to reassure people that A&E departments and GPs' surgeries had made changes to keep staff and patients safe, for example GPs talking through a patient's symptoms on the phone before asking them to go into a surgery. A&E visits down 29% during epidemic in England A public information campaign persuading people to use the health service will feature NHS staff and start next week. It comes as the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty warns of the impact of deaths from causes other than Covid-19 during the lockdown. As of 17:00 BST on 24 April, 20,319 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died in UK hospitals. Four other countries to date have announced an official number of coronavirus-related deaths exceeding 20,000 - the US, Spain, Italy and France. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government needed to move to testing and tracing those who had come into contact with the virus as soon as possible so that people's lives could return to normal. ""Either we are in lockdown for that 18 months which is clearly unsustainable for the economy and it means other health issues build up,"" he told BBC's Breakfast. ""People are not going to hospital, peoples' treatment is cancelled, people with cancer are not getting the treatment they need."" Contact your GP practice, use NHS 111 online or call 111 if you need medical help Call 999 in emergencies Go to hospital if you are told you should Figures suggest half the number of people will go to Accident and Emergency departments in hospitals in England this month, compared with April 2019 - down to just over one million visits. And experts say they are concerned people are not getting potentially life-saving treatment for heart attacks and strokes, with a 50% fall in the number of people seeking medical help for heart symptoms. Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said it was ""vitally important"" that the many thousands of people in the UK with existing heart conditions accessed care ""immediately"" if their condition worsened. Ryan Wallace, from Limavady, in County Londonderry, did not want to be a burden on the health service when he felt chest pains. But after doctors warned he was close to having a major heart attack he has told others not to put off going to hospital. ""Coronavirus was worrying, yes, but I also didn't want to put more burden on the NHS and putting more stress on their already stretched resources. ""Their first words were 'you're a lucky boy you came in here.' They showed me in black-and-white on the screen after the procedure and they said I was hanging on by a thread."" Mr Wallace required three stents to be inserted and said those who stayed away would ""only be storing up problems down the line"". There are also concerns that children may be missing out on medical care during the pandemic. ""Children are unlikely to be unwell with Covid, but they do get sick and when this happens we want to see them,"" said Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? There is also a warning that people should not dismiss strokes as ""just a funny turn"". Juliet Bouverie, from the Stroke Association, said a stroke was a medical emergency. ""The quicker you're diagnosed and treated for a stroke, the better your chances of making a good recovery,"" she said. If you suspect that you, or someone else could be having a stroke, call 999. Prof Powis said that now the NHS was seeing fewer patients with coronavirus, it was time to start building up its services again. ""The NHS has done a magnificent job responding to coronavirus, we have not been overwhelmed in the way seen in other countries, now it is important to start stepping up again to ensure we are not delaying other procedures,"" he said. In other developments: Applauding NHS workers, police and firefightersis ""not enough"" and they must get better pay and treatment, a union leader has said The prime minister's chief adviser Dominic Cummings comes under criticism forattending meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which has helped shape the UK's response to the pandemic Coronavirus tests for UK key workers wereunavailable through the government's website within an hour of it reopening, except for some in Scotland How have you been affected by coronavirus?

"Cafes and shops closed in Brixton market, south London. Former chancellor Philip Hammond has urged the government to set out its plan to restart the economy. Ministers have been reluctant to discuss a lockdown exit strategy, arguing that it might undermine the message for people to stay at home. Mr Hammond said the country cannot afford to wait until a vaccine is developed and called on the government to start easing lockdown measures. But Conservative MP Damian Green said the government was acting ""sensibly"". Mr Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The reality is that we have to start reopening the economy. But we have to do it living with Covid. ""We can't wait until a vaccine is developed, produced in sufficient quantity and rolled out across the population. The economy won't survive that long."" Many businesses around the UK have shut up shop, withmore than 140,000 firmsapplying for help to pay their wage bill through the government's job retention scheme. UK borrowing in 'colossal increase' to fight virus UK inflation falls as lockdown begins to bite More than 140,000 firms claim wage bill help Those businesses left in limbo now need to be told what requirements they will have to fulfil when the economy starts to reopen, so they can start preparing, Mr Hammond said. ""If we are all going to have to wear face masks travelling on public transport, businesses need to know that now so that businesses that have capacity to manufacture products like that can start planning to do so,"" he said. ""If restaurants, when they eventually reopen, are going to have to operate with many fewer tables, they need to start thinking about how they adapt their business model to be able to do that."" The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies told the BBC this week thatthe economic impact of coronavirus was likelyto push the deficit to as high as Â£260bn. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Mr Hammond said there will be a debate about how to pay for the crisis, whether through higher taxes, restrictions on spending or increased borrowing. Details of how the government plans to ease the country out of lockdown have not been publicly revealed, but Mr Hammond said easing the measures will require ""skilful political leadership"". Former Cabinet Office Minister Mr Green said ministers were behaving ""sensibly"". He said the public has largely obeyed the lockdown and that ""putting that at risk"" could damage the public's health and the economy. Addressing concerns around transparency and whether the public were being treated as children, Mr Green said: ""I don't think the government is treating the public like children at all."" Mr Green added: ""I think the government has taken the view, which is a sensible view, that they have established a successful lockdown and that putting that at risk would actually damage the country more than anything else.""

Mr Wallace required three stents to be inserted and said those who stayed away would ""only be storing up problems down the line"". There are also concerns that children may be missing out on medical care during the pandemic.

"Millions of Indian households depend on neighbourhood shops for essentials India has allowed small local stores to reopen more than a month after the country went into lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic. The interior ministry said only half of staff should work and they had to follow precautions such as wearing face masks and observing social distancing. However shopping malls must remain closed and businesses in coronavirus hotspots will also stay shut. The move is part of Delhi's attempt to gradually restart economic activity. India has nearly 25,000 confirmed cases of the virus and 780 people have died. Covid-19 doctors: Notes on hope, fear and longing Is social distancing an oxymoron in India? Millions of Indian households depend on their local shops for their day-to-day groceries and other essentials. All shops in rural areas except those in shopping malls were allowed to reopen from Saturday, as are stores in urban areas. However shops in markets are to remain closed.

Tata Steel needs about Â£500m of government support to get through the coronavirus pandemic, the MP for Aberavon Stephen Kinnock has said. Sky News has reported Tata has approached the UK and Welsh Governments for the money after many customers halted production during the crisis. Tata employs 8,385 people in the UK, including about 4,000 people in Port Talbot and 2,800 elsewhere in Wales. The UK and Tata have been approached for comment. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We continue to have ongoing discussions with Tata Steel about what support it needs to sustain a strong steel-making presence in the UK and in Wales."" Mr Kinnock said: ""The Â£50m cap on loans that are now available under the government support scheme is only about 10% of what Tata Steel actually needs."" He raised the matter in the House of Commons on Wednesday.
Responding to him, First Secretary of State Dominic Raab said: ""I know that the chancellor is looking carefully at the steel sector in the hon. gentleman's constituency, and at all those who are not directly benefitting from this particular scheme to ensure that in the round we are providing the measures that we need in a targeted way to support all the different crucial elements of the economy."" More than 20,000 people have now
died with coronavirus in UK hospitals -the fifth country to pass that
milestone. Former Wales international rugby star Ryan Jones has raised Â£50,000 for NHS charities by running 100 miles on his treadmill from his kitchen.

He said it ""may be an indication of the effectiveness of lockdown measures"". ""However, it is still too early to tell for sure, and it is too soon to end the current social distancing rules,"" he added.  Another 23 people in Wales have died with coronavirus - taking the total number to 774, Public Health Wales has said. On Saturday, the latest update from PHW showed there were 299 confirmed new cases, taking the total to 8,900. The true number is likely to be higher as many with symptoms are not tested. It said: ""Following data cleaning, we have today removed 22 previously reported deaths which do not have a positive test result."" A total of 23 more people who tested positive for coronavirus have died, taking Wales' total to 774. The daily figure announced by Public Health Wales includes deaths in hospitals and may also include some deaths recorded in community settings such as care homes. An additional 299 people have test positive for coronanvirus, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 8,900, although the true figure is expected to be higher because not everyone is tested.

on new field hospitals for coronavirus patients are no longer being given free
parking by the UKâs biggest parking company. NCP launched Free Parking for NHS Heroes at selected car parks close to hospitals during the pandemic. But the company said economic
pressures meant it had to bring back charges for people such as contractors working on sites like Dragonâs Heart Hospital, at the
Principality Stadium in Cardiff. NHS employees and health volunteers will still get free parking, but other drivers will be charged a maximum Â£5 for 24 hours at many of its sites. The company said the fee was âdesigned with key workers in mind and is the lowest possible tariff we could offer currentlyâ. It added it was âdelightedâ that thousands of NHS and other key workers had taken advantage of
its offer in the past month, and it would continue to give free parking to
health staff. Cardiff and Vale
health board said other free parking sites were being offered to contractors
working at Dragonâs Heart Hospital.  Police are stopping vehicles in Pantygasseg in Pontypool, Torfaen. Gwent Police tweeted it was ""not acceptable""to visit the area from Newport.

People have been told to stay away from Wales' tourist hotspots until the lockdown lifts Small tourism businesses could ""go bankrupt"" or suffer ""enormous hardship"" because of changes to a coronavirus grant system, according to Conservative politicians. New guidance on eligibility for the grants was introduced earlier this week following claims that somesecond-home owners were using a ""loophole"" to claim cash. Businesses in the hospitality sector are eligible fornon-repayable grantsof Â£10,000 or Â£25,000 depending on the size of their premises. In a letter to the first minister, Clwyd West MP David Jones said concern ""that the grant might be available to second home owners"" was ""entirely understandable and proper"". Conservative AM for Aberconwy, Janet Finch-Saunders, who has also written to the first minister about the issue, said: ""This is not the time to be penalising genuine self-catering businesses in an effort to catch some of those individuals who have succeeded to take advantage of the rules for qualify second homes for business rates. ""The chaos caused could see some genuine self-catering businesses go bankrupt."" The Welsh government said: âMany local authorities were unhappy with what they perceived as a policy which rewarded second home owners who derived an income from letting their properties. ""As a result, and in agreement with the local authorities, we have refined some of the eligibility criteria. ""However, local authorities have discretion about awarding the grant and the evidence business owners need to provide to support their claim. Queries should be directed to local authorities.â Five councils - Gwynedd,  Anglesey, Conwy, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire - called on Welsh ministers to change advice so second-home owners who pay business rates rather than council tax could not claim. A mother has spoken out about the difficulties of coping with daily life during the pandemic for those with additional needs. Iola Gruffudd's son Guto Llewelyn Jones, 20, has cerebral palsy and epilepsy and his additional needs mean that he relies on a very strict and repetitive structure. He usually enjoys going to the library near his home in Waunfawr near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, every Saturday but as this is no longer possible a special library has been created at home for him to exchange books. ""We also try and use the daily structures that already exist like Radio Cymru and S4C timetables - these are what give Guto reassurances and the structure he needs,"" says Iola. ""The whole situation has caused so much uncertainty for Guto and he asks the same questions about what happens next.""  Â© 2025 BBC.

"The lockdown has caused a surge in the number of people contacting the Revenge Porn Helpline, the government-funded service for adults experiencing intimate image abuse. Traffic to the helpline's website nearly doubled in the week beginning Monday 23 March and more cases were opened in the following four weeks than in any previous four-week period. Campaigners are calling for extra funding for the helpline, which has only two full-time members of staff, to help it cope with the rising workload. Intimate image abuse - or the threat of it - is one way an abuser can still impose control even if they are not isolating with their partner or ex-partner. Stress, break-ups and job loss can all aggravate pre-existing abusive behaviour and coercive control, says Clare McGlynn, Professor of Law at Durham University. She attributes the rise in cases of intimate image abuse to ""the increased use of the internet and social media, as well as heightened emotions"" during lockdown. Sophie Mortimer, manager of the Revenge Porn Helpline, told the BBC that over half of the cases since lockdown clearly originated in ""an abusive or controlling relationship"". ""The level of distress caused shouldn't be underestimated. We are frequently hearing from people seeking our help that they are contemplating suicide or self-harm, the impact of the abuse seems so overwhelming,"" she said. When the messages lit up her phone Ava, 21, immediately started to panic. One read, ""Can't even get the same satisfaction from leaking your nudes now you're an actual hoe [whore]."" Surely he was bluffing, she remembers thinking. ""I don't care what happens to me as long as I ruin your life,"" another message read. It quickly became clear that her ex was enraged by the fact that she was isolating with her new boyfriend, and that his threats to post intimate pictures and videos from their two-year-long relationship had to be taken seriously. ""I just cried hysterically, I felt so sick, I was having a full-on panic attack, I couldn't breathe,"" she says. Because Ava and her ex work together, she had to inform her manager. She also told her family. ""It was absolutely heart-breaking,"" she says. Ava thinks the lockdown has given her ex ""more time to be vindictive"". ""I've spent my days going through different porn sites, just in case. I've just been feeling worthless, it's made me feel like I just want to disappear."" The Revenge Porn Helpline opened more than 200 cases in the four weeks from 23 March, and more last week than in any week since 2015, when it came into existence as a consequence of section 33 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act - the law making intimate image abuse a criminal offence for the first time. Charities are worried that one effect of the lockdown will be an increase in ""sexting"" from couples who are not isolating together, which then increases the likelihood of intimate image abuse arising as a result. Where this affects under-18s, the incident falls under the Sexual Offences Act, and offenders may be guilty of the serious charge of sharing an indecent image of a minor. The Internet Watch Foundation, an organisation that removes child sexual abuse imagery online, said: ""We are very worried that the increased number of children online, as well as an increased number of criminals who may be looking to exploit this, could put children in danger."" Tink Palmer, CEO of The Marie Collins Foundation, urged parents and guardians not to ""victim blame"" if their child reveals that they have been the victim of abuse. A week after the UK-wide lockdown was announced, Maya, 25, woke up to an influx of friend requests from men she didn't know. Her stomach sank, it was happening again. For the first time since last summer, nudes taken when she was a teenager had been reposted on a well-known website used for intimate image abuse. Her full name and her school were in the captions. She spotted a message at the top of the website: ""We currently have a 24-hour backlog of memberships due to the sheer volume coming in. Keep up the amazing posting everyoneâ¦ We would like to thank every one of our contributing users for all the effort put in to keep us all a steady stream of fresh porn to view over the lockdowns that are carrying on all over the world."" Maya is worried that her pictures will be shared and seen by more people this time, because of the lockdown. ""Every time they come up, I get so worried about someone seeing them, and how that could actually impact my job as a teacher. Now I feel like I have to keep checking it all the time."" When a website is hosted abroad, police in the UK have little power to help. Instead victims have to go through a complicated process to ask site admins to delete the posts. Maya was shown how to do this by the Revenge Porn Helpline and the images have now been taken down. ""The Revenge Porn Helpline do a fantastic job of assisting victims in getting content off websites and assisting them in emotional support. The helpline itself however deserves much more funding than they currently get - as cases increase funding ought to follow,"" said Kate Isaacs, founder of #NotYourPorn, which campaigns for tighter regulation of pornography websites. The Revenge Porn Helpline said: ""The helpline is busier than it has ever been but the service is very much open to offer help, advice and support."" A Home Office press officer urged any victims of intimate image abuse to report it to the police. Commenting on the call for the helpline to be given extra funding, the press officer said: ""We already provide funding to the National Revenge Porn Helpline and we are in close contact with charities to ensure they bid for the Â£750m in support announced for the charity sector."" But manager Sophie Mortimer said she had not yet heard whether the helpline would be entitled to any of the government's charity support package. Louise's ex-boyfriend posted intimate pictures and videos of her on Snapchat just before the lockdown - a week after they broke up. People then sent the 24-year-old screenshots of her ex threatening to ""pay someone to rape her"" and a voice note in which he vividly described how he would beat her up in the street. ""When it first happened I spiralled hard - I was really suicidal and felt so trapped because I didn't know what to do,"" she says. ""I don't know if he's posted them anywhere else, I don't know whether he's sold the video to websites. It's something that's completely out of my control."" On 30 March Louise reported him to the police, because the lockdown made her feel safer. ""I've seen what he gets like when he's angry and I am really scared of him but I knew because we were in lockdown he wouldn't come to my house."" The police said there wasn't enough evidence to take the case further.

Not the Queen, that's for sure, who went on to show her youngest son how to play the incongruous card with her winning James Bond spoof at the London Olympics. The Royal Family's infamous day out at Alton Towers was in 1987, 30 years after the comedian Frank Skinner was born, a fact I learnt from listening to his new podcast, which is another example of the light-entertainment-meets-highfalutin genre. Frank Skinner's Poetry Podcast,externalis knowingly tapping into the surprising-juxtaposition game, following the likes of Lenny Henry who has successfully evolved from kids' show clown to serious Shakespearian actor. ""Yes, yes, poetry"" Skinner says in his introduction, acknowledging it might seem an unlikely subject for a man still shaking off a '90s laddish image. The comedian and actor, Frank Skinner says he developed his love of poetry while studying English at Birmingham Polytechnic Actually, it's not in the least bit strange that he should be drawn to poetry or Lenny Henry to Shakespeare. There are two common attributes shared by the majority of successful comedians: the first being an intellectual curiosity, and the second, an understanding and appreciation of language and its use. It is a mark of how the Arts have allowed themselves to become segregated - broadly along class lines - between what is seen as cheap entertainment and classy culture. It is a perception, not a reality. Rock, pop, and rap are as worthy an art form as classical music, and stand-up comedy could justifiably be considered performance art. The division between the different artistic forms of human expression is a nonsense. Frank Skinner shouldn't have to defend his love of poetry, nor the fact that he is approaching it as a fan and not as an academic. Poetry and comedy are natural bedfellows - a fact that Skinner demonstrates in this one-man-no-guests podcast peppered with amusing asides and left-of-field references - from the absurdist dramatist EugÃ¨ne Ionesco to a whippet dog called Frank Skinner. First up on the first episode of the first series (I hope there are plenty more) is the 20th Century British poet and artist Stevie Smith (1902 - 1971) and her 1957 classicNot Waving but Drowning,external, a three-verse meditation on someone with a jolly public persona hiding a desperate soul: Nobody heard him, the dead man, But still he lay moaning: I was much further out than you thought And not waving but drowning. Skinner's approach is to personalise the poems he discusses, arguing, not unreasonably, that his response is a coming together of his viewpoint with that of the poet. It's a familiar argument made particularly well in an essay called the Creative Act, written by Marcel Duchamp in the same year as Smith produced Not Waving but Drowning. Stevie Smith's Not Waving but Drowning was first published in 1957, and was voted Britain's fourth favourite poem in a poll in 1995 It is a very good poem, the title of which has become part of our everyday lexicon. I remember sitting on the beach at Bude in Cornwall, keeping half an eye on my kids bodyboarding while staring out at sea and contemplating what flavour of ice-cream I fancied. I saw a woman waving from her surf board and mentioned the friendly gesture to my wife, who, paraphrasing Smith, said ""she's not waving, she's drowning"". And so she was. Two guys in red swimming trunks, neither of whom looked remotely like David Hasselhoff, surfed out and rescued her. It was very dramatic, but not, Skinner speculates, the real subject of Smith's poem. It is not literally about drowning at sea but a distant character who stands outside the swim of daily life: a man who - to all appearances - is waving enthusiastically when in reality he is drowning in obscurity (""I was much further out than you thought"" the dead man reports). This Skinner can relate to, and tells us the thing he most enjoyed about being famous, was neither the money nor the trappings, but being noticed, being ""heard"": I was much too far out all my life And not waving but drowning. It is not easy to relay the meaning and rhythm of poem while retaining a voice that doesn't sound like a cliche of a worthy 1970s round-table poetry group. Skinner nails the task, bringing the poet's words to life before veering off on an anecdote or explaining that poetry is broken up into lumps known as verses (fancy language is banished, which is why, perhaps, he chose Smith who used simple language to communicate ideas and feelings of great complexity). The show is not perfect, but then it is only one episode old. Having got our attention and established his chatty approach, there's scope for Skinner to go a little deeper into the text. Not Waving but Drowning is a timely poem to study, not just because it speaks to our current anxieties, but also that in 12 short lines Smith introduces three separate voices who tell us the ambiguous story in words chosen specifically for their weaselly slipperiness. Fake news, and all that. There is also room for a bit more biographical detail. Obviously, this is Skinner's informal take on poetry, with the way it touches him a large part of the show's structure, but it could be rebalanced to allow the poet to share some the limelight. We learn very little about Smith, and almost nothing about William Carlos Williams (1883 - 1963), the American modernist poet who wrote Skinner's second choice of the week,Danse Russe,external(1916). The American poet, William Carlos Williams once wrote ""The purpose of an artist, whatever it is, is to take the life, whatever he sees, and to raise it up to an elevated position where it has dignity"" It is another terrific selection. A little longer than Smith's, but not by much. It shares the subject of loneliness, but from the other side of the desolate coin. This time our male protagonist is watching the sun rise as his wife and children sleep. He is enjoying a moment of sensual euphoria, suppressed from full expression perhaps, to keep the genie of his genius in the bottle: ""I am lonely, lonely. I was born to be lonely, I am best so!"" If I admire my arms, my face, my shoulders, flanks, buttocks against the yellow drawn shades,â Who shall say I am not the happy genius of my household? It would have helped to have some biographical detail; to have known that Williams was a paediatrician by day and a poet by night (the genius of the household?): that he was searching for a new American idiom that established a language independent from European influences, and that the poem was indebted to the French Symbolist poet StÃ©phane MallarmÃ©'s L'aprÃ¨s-midi d'un faune (Williams spent time living in France). Claude Debussy then wrote a piece of music in response to MallarmÃ©, which was subsequently turned into a dance for the Ballets Russes (hence the title of Williams's poem) by Vaslav Nijinsky, which Williams saw performed in New York having known it'd caused a furore in Paris years earlier when Nijinsky started writhing in ecstasy, alone on the stage, to howls of derision and gasps of delight. The influence of StÃ©phane MallarmÃ©'s poem L'aprÃ¨s-midi d'un faune can be seen in William Carlos Williams' Danse Russe Vaslav Nijinsky choreographed and danced in L'AprÃ©s-midi d'un faune for the Ballets Russes in 1912, which William Carlos Williams saw years later Skinner only touches on this back story and isn't entirely accurate on all his factual details (I don't think Williams lived in New York, he was a man of Rutherford, New Jersey). To an extent that's forgivable, our host says he doesn't go much for background info because he wants to have a relationship with the work of art not the person who made it or what might have influenced it. He then humbly adds, ""that might be an error on my part"". I suspect it is. The more you repeat read a poem, which Skinner rightly encourages us to do, the more you want to comprehend, and that usually means going beyond the page to the person holding the pen. That's the way into the rest of the writer's work, and the discovering of little jewels like Williams'sThis is Just to Say,external, which for some reason reminds me of a Cezanne still life: I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox Paul CÃ©zanne's Still Life with Fruit Dish (1879-80) First-episode teething troubles are to be expected and should not detract from a very welcome new addition to the cultural landscape: a simple idea without any fancy production presented by someone who brings insight and enthusiasm to an art form that is enjoying a resurgence in popularity.

"People should seek medical care when they need it and not be put off by the coronavirus epidemic, say doctors, charities and the health service. Anyone who delays seeking treatment is putting their long-term health at risk, as well as their life, they warn. Half the usual number of people are going to A&E and treatment for heart attacks and strokes is down. Seeking medical help is one of the four reasons people can safely leave home, government guidance says. NHS England's medical director Stephen Powis said he was concerned by the reduced numbers. ""If you do have symptoms of stroke, chest pain and think it might be a heart attack, a sick child who is deteriorating, if you are a pregnant woman and the baby is not moving as much as it used to - it is important you don't delay,"" he said. Coronavirus: Latest news from around the world Prof Powis suggested the falling numbers were due to people worrying about bothering the NHS and fears of catching the virus in a medical environment. But he said he wanted to reassure people that A&E departments and GPs' surgeries had made changes to keep staff and patients safe, for example GPs talking through a patient's symptoms on the phone before asking them to go into a surgery. A&E visits down 29% during epidemic in England A public information campaign persuading people to use the health service will feature NHS staff and start next week. It comes as the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty warns of the impact of deaths from causes other than Covid-19 during the lockdown. As of 17:00 BST on 24 April, 20,319 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died in UK hospitals. Four other countries to date have announced an official number of coronavirus-related deaths exceeding 20,000 - the US, Spain, Italy and France. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government needed to move to testing and tracing those who had come into contact with the virus as soon as possible so that people's lives could return to normal. ""Either we are in lockdown for that 18 months which is clearly unsustainable for the economy and it means other health issues build up,"" he told BBC's Breakfast. ""People are not going to hospital, peoples' treatment is cancelled, people with cancer are not getting the treatment they need."" Contact your GP practice, use NHS 111 online or call 111 if you need medical help Call 999 in emergencies Go to hospital if you are told you should Figures suggest half the number of people will go to Accident and Emergency departments in hospitals in England this month, compared with April 2019 - down to just over one million visits. And experts say they are concerned people are not getting potentially life-saving treatment for heart attacks and strokes, with a 50% fall in the number of people seeking medical help for heart symptoms. Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said it was ""vitally important"" that the many thousands of people in the UK with existing heart conditions accessed care ""immediately"" if their condition worsened. Ryan Wallace, from Limavady, in County Londonderry, did not want to be a burden on the health service when he felt chest pains. But after doctors warned he was close to having a major heart attack he has told others not to put off going to hospital. ""Coronavirus was worrying, yes, but I also didn't want to put more burden on the NHS and putting more stress on their already stretched resources. ""Their first words were 'you're a lucky boy you came in here.' They showed me in black-and-white on the screen after the procedure and they said I was hanging on by a thread."" Mr Wallace required three stents to be inserted and said those who stayed away would ""only be storing up problems down the line"". There are also concerns that children may be missing out on medical care during the pandemic. ""Children are unlikely to be unwell with Covid, but they do get sick and when this happens we want to see them,"" said Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? There is also a warning that people should not dismiss strokes as ""just a funny turn"". Juliet Bouverie, from the Stroke Association, said a stroke was a medical emergency. ""The quicker you're diagnosed and treated for a stroke, the better your chances of making a good recovery,"" she said. If you suspect that you, or someone else could be having a stroke, call 999. Prof Powis said that now the NHS was seeing fewer patients with coronavirus, it was time to start building up its services again. ""The NHS has done a magnificent job responding to coronavirus, we have not been overwhelmed in the way seen in other countries, now it is important to start stepping up again to ensure we are not delaying other procedures,"" he said. In other developments: Applauding NHS workers, police and firefightersis ""not enough"" and they must get better pay and treatment, a union leader has said The prime minister's chief adviser Dominic Cummings comes under criticism forattending meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which has helped shape the UK's response to the pandemic Coronavirus tests for UK key workers wereunavailable through the government's website within an hour of it reopening, except for some in Scotland How have you been affected by coronavirus?

Tata Steel needs about Â£500m of government support to get through the coronavirus pandemic, the MP for Aberavon Stephen Kinnock has said. Sky News has reported Tata has approached the UK and Welsh Governments for the money after many customers halted production during the crisis. Tata employs 8,385 people in the UK, including about 4,000 people in Port Talbot and 2,800 elsewhere in Wales. The UK and Tata have been approached for comment. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We continue to have ongoing discussions with Tata Steel about what support it needs to sustain a strong steel-making presence in the UK and in Wales."" Mr Kinnock said: ""The Â£50m cap on loans that are now available under the government support scheme is only about 10% of what Tata Steel actually needs."" He raised the matter in the House of Commons on Wednesday.
Responding to him, First Secretary of State Dominic Raab said: ""I know that the chancellor is looking carefully at the steel sector in the hon. gentleman's constituency, and at all those who are not directly benefitting from this particular scheme to ensure that in the round we are providing the measures that we need in a targeted way to support all the different crucial elements of the economy.""

He said it ""may be an indication of the effectiveness of lockdown measures"". ""However, it is still too early to tell for sure, and it is too soon to end the current social distancing rules,"" he added.  Another 23 people in Wales have died with coronavirus - taking the total number to 774, Public Health Wales has said. On Saturday, the latest update from PHW showed there were 299 confirmed new cases, taking the total to 8,900. The true number is likely to be higher as many with symptoms are not tested. It said: ""Following data cleaning, we have today removed 22 previously reported deaths which do not have a positive test result."" A total of 23 more people who tested positive for coronavirus have died, taking Wales' total to 774. The daily figure announced by Public Health Wales includes deaths in hospitals and may also include some deaths recorded in community settings such as care homes. An additional 299 people have test positive for coronanvirus, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 8,900, although the true figure is expected to be higher because not everyone is tested.

on new field hospitals for coronavirus patients are no longer being given free
parking by the UKâs biggest parking company. NCP launched Free Parking for NHS Heroes at selected car parks close to hospitals during the pandemic. But the company said economic
pressures meant it had to bring back charges for people such as contractors working on sites like Dragonâs Heart Hospital, at the
Principality Stadium in Cardiff. NHS employees and health volunteers will still get free parking, but other drivers will be charged a maximum Â£5 for 24 hours at many of its sites. The company said the fee was âdesigned with key workers in mind and is the lowest possible tariff we could offer currentlyâ. It added it was âdelightedâ that thousands of NHS and other key workers had taken advantage of
its offer in the past month, and it would continue to give free parking to
health staff. Cardiff and Vale
health board said other free parking sites were being offered to contractors
working at Dragonâs Heart Hospital.  Police are stopping vehicles in Pantygasseg in Pontypool, Torfaen. Gwent Police tweeted it was ""not acceptable""to visit the area from Newport.

People have been told to stay away from Wales' tourist hotspots until the lockdown lifts Small tourism businesses could ""go bankrupt"" or suffer ""enormous hardship"" because of changes to a coronavirus grant system, according to Conservative politicians. New guidance on eligibility for the grants was introduced earlier this week following claims that somesecond-home owners were using a ""loophole"" to claim cash. Businesses in the hospitality sector are eligible fornon-repayable grantsof Â£10,000 or Â£25,000 depending on the size of their premises. In a letter to the first minister, Clwyd West MP David Jones said concern ""that the grant might be available to second home owners"" was ""entirely understandable and proper"". Conservative AM for Aberconwy, Janet Finch-Saunders, who has also written to the first minister about the issue, said: ""This is not the time to be penalising genuine self-catering businesses in an effort to catch some of those individuals who have succeeded to take advantage of the rules for qualify second homes for business rates. ""The chaos caused could see some genuine self-catering businesses go bankrupt."" The Welsh government said: âMany local authorities were unhappy with what they perceived as a policy which rewarded second home owners who derived an income from letting their properties. ""As a result, and in agreement with the local authorities, we have refined some of the eligibility criteria. ""However, local authorities have discretion about awarding the grant and the evidence business owners need to provide to support their claim. Queries should be directed to local authorities.â Five councils - Gwynedd,  Anglesey, Conwy, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire - called on Welsh ministers to change advice so second-home owners who pay business rates rather than council tax could not claim. A mother has spoken out about the difficulties of coping with daily life during the pandemic for those with additional needs. Iola Gruffudd's son Guto Llewelyn Jones, 20, has cerebral palsy and epilepsy and his additional needs mean that he relies on a very strict and repetitive structure. He usually enjoys going to the library near his home in Waunfawr near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, every Saturday but as this is no longer possible a special library has been created at home for him to exchange books. ""We also try and use the daily structures that already exist like Radio Cymru and S4C timetables - these are what give Guto reassurances and the structure he needs,"" says Iola.

"Odd combinations have long been a staple of the entertainment industry. For those old enough to have seen it (still available on YouTube), who can forget Prince Edward's cringe-inducing toe-dip into television production with the culture-clash that was It's A Royal knockout? Not the Queen, that's for sure, who went on to show her youngest son how to play the incongruous card with her winning James Bond spoof at the London Olympics. The Royal Family's infamous day out at Alton Towers was in 1987, 30 years after the comedian Frank Skinner was born, a fact I learnt from listening to his new podcast, which is another example of the light-entertainment-meets-highfalutin genre. Frank Skinner's Poetry Podcast,externalis knowingly tapping into the surprising-juxtaposition game, following the likes of Lenny Henry who has successfully evolved from kids' show clown to serious Shakespearian actor. ""Yes, yes, poetry"" Skinner says in his introduction, acknowledging it might seem an unlikely subject for a man still shaking off a '90s laddish image. The comedian and actor, Frank Skinner says he developed his love of poetry while studying English at Birmingham Polytechnic Actually, it's not in the least bit strange that he should be drawn to poetry or Lenny Henry to Shakespeare. There are two common attributes shared by the majority of successful comedians: the first being an intellectual curiosity, and the second, an understanding and appreciation of language and its use. It is a mark of how the Arts have allowed themselves to become segregated - broadly along class lines - between what is seen as cheap entertainment and classy culture. It is a perception, not a reality. Rock, pop, and rap are as worthy an art form as classical music, and stand-up comedy could justifiably be considered performance art. The division between the different artistic forms of human expression is a nonsense. Frank Skinner shouldn't have to defend his love of poetry, nor the fact that he is approaching it as a fan and not as an academic. Poetry and comedy are natural bedfellows - a fact that Skinner demonstrates in this one-man-no-guests podcast peppered with amusing asides and left-of-field references - from the absurdist dramatist EugÃ¨ne Ionesco to a whippet dog called Frank Skinner. First up on the first episode of the first series (I hope there are plenty more) is the 20th Century British poet and artist Stevie Smith (1902 - 1971) and her 1957 classicNot Waving but Drowning,external, a three-verse meditation on someone with a jolly public persona hiding a desperate soul: Nobody heard him, the dead man, But still he lay moaning: I was much further out than you thought And not waving but drowning. Skinner's approach is to personalise the poems he discusses, arguing, not unreasonably, that his response is a coming together of his viewpoint with that of the poet. It's a familiar argument made particularly well in an essay called the Creative Act, written by Marcel Duchamp in the same year as Smith produced Not Waving but Drowning. Stevie Smith's Not Waving but Drowning was first published in 1957, and was voted Britain's fourth favourite poem in a poll in 1995 It is a very good poem, the title of which has become part of our everyday lexicon. I remember sitting on the beach at Bude in Cornwall, keeping half an eye on my kids bodyboarding while staring out at sea and contemplating what flavour of ice-cream I fancied. I saw a woman waving from her surf board and mentioned the friendly gesture to my wife, who, paraphrasing Smith, said ""she's not waving, she's drowning"". And so she was. Two guys in red swimming trunks, neither of whom looked remotely like David Hasselhoff, surfed out and rescued her. It was very dramatic, but not, Skinner speculates, the real subject of Smith's poem. It is not literally about drowning at sea but a distant character who stands outside the swim of daily life: a man who - to all appearances - is waving enthusiastically when in reality he is drowning in obscurity (""I was much further out than you thought"" the dead man reports). This Skinner can relate to, and tells us the thing he most enjoyed about being famous, was neither the money nor the trappings, but being noticed, being ""heard"": I was much too far out all my life And not waving but drowning. It is not easy to relay the meaning and rhythm of poem while retaining a voice that doesn't sound like a cliche of a worthy 1970s round-table poetry group. Skinner nails the task, bringing the poet's words to life before veering off on an anecdote or explaining that poetry is broken up into lumps known as verses (fancy language is banished, which is why, perhaps, he chose Smith who used simple language to communicate ideas and feelings of great complexity). The show is not perfect, but then it is only one episode old. Having got our attention and established his chatty approach, there's scope for Skinner to go a little deeper into the text. Not Waving but Drowning is a timely poem to study, not just because it speaks to our current anxieties, but also that in 12 short lines Smith introduces three separate voices who tell us the ambiguous story in words chosen specifically for their weaselly slipperiness. Fake news, and all that. There is also room for a bit more biographical detail. Obviously, this is Skinner's informal take on poetry, with the way it touches him a large part of the show's structure, but it could be rebalanced to allow the poet to share some the limelight. We learn very little about Smith, and almost nothing about William Carlos Williams (1883 - 1963), the American modernist poet who wrote Skinner's second choice of the week,Danse Russe,external(1916). The American poet, William Carlos Williams once wrote ""The purpose of an artist, whatever it is, is to take the life, whatever he sees, and to raise it up to an elevated position where it has dignity"" It is another terrific selection. A little longer than Smith's, but not by much. It shares the subject of loneliness, but from the other side of the desolate coin. This time our male protagonist is watching the sun rise as his wife and children sleep. He is enjoying a moment of sensual euphoria, suppressed from full expression perhaps, to keep the genie of his genius in the bottle: ""I am lonely, lonely. I was born to be lonely, I am best so!"" If I admire my arms, my face, my shoulders, flanks, buttocks against the yellow drawn shades,â Who shall say I am not the happy genius of my household? It would have helped to have some biographical detail; to have known that Williams was a paediatrician by day and a poet by night (the genius of the household?): that he was searching for a new American idiom that established a language independent from European influences, and that the poem was indebted to the French Symbolist poet StÃ©phane MallarmÃ©'s L'aprÃ¨s-midi d'un faune (Williams spent time living in France). Claude Debussy then wrote a piece of music in response to MallarmÃ©, which was subsequently turned into a dance for the Ballets Russes (hence the title of Williams's poem) by Vaslav Nijinsky, which Williams saw performed in New York having known it'd caused a furore in Paris years earlier when Nijinsky started writhing in ecstasy, alone on the stage, to howls of derision and gasps of delight. The influence of StÃ©phane MallarmÃ©'s poem L'aprÃ¨s-midi d'un faune can be seen in William Carlos Williams' Danse Russe Vaslav Nijinsky choreographed and danced in L'AprÃ©s-midi d'un faune for the Ballets Russes in 1912, which William Carlos Williams saw years later Skinner only touches on this back story and isn't entirely accurate on all his factual details (I don't think Williams lived in New York, he was a man of Rutherford, New Jersey). To an extent that's forgivable, our host says he doesn't go much for background info because he wants to have a relationship with the work of art not the person who made it or what might have influenced it. He then humbly adds, ""that might be an error on my part"". I suspect it is. The more you repeat read a poem, which Skinner rightly encourages us to do, the more you want to comprehend, and that usually means going beyond the page to the person holding the pen. That's the way into the rest of the writer's work, and the discovering of little jewels like Williams'sThis is Just to Say,external, which for some reason reminds me of a Cezanne still life: I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox Paul CÃ©zanne's Still Life with Fruit Dish (1879-80) First-episode teething troubles are to be expected and should not detract from a very welcome new addition to the cultural landscape: a simple idea without any fancy production presented by someone who brings insight and enthusiasm to an art form that is enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Roll on Monday for the second instalment. I think it's going to get better and better.

"Coronavirus tests offered to UK key workers were booked up within an hour - apart from some in Scotland. The tests, which are targeted at those who are self-isolating, allow people to return to work as quickly as possible. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said testing is part of ""getting Britain back on her feet"". But the government website closed to new applicants within hours of the Friday launch, after 46,000 people tried to access it. Home testing kits became unavailable less than 15 minutes after bookings reopened on Saturday morning. Some 16,000 bookings were made. Tests at drive-through sites in England were booked up within an hour on Saturday morning, with spaces not becoming available again until the evening. Requests for drive-through tests in Scotland are still currently available on the site. Key workers inWales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalcannot currently book tests online. Both nations appear as options on the government's online system but with a label saying no slots are available. For key workers in England and Scotland with symptoms of the virus, and anyone in their household with symptoms, tests at drive-through centres and home testing kits will become available each day from 08:00 BST, Downing Street has said. Testing extended to include key workers in Scotland Essential workers can also request a test through their employers. The tests offered are swab tests that determine whether people currently have the virus - rather than whether they have had it in the past. Applications to the UK government website was initially open only to people in England,but tests became available to people in Scotland on Saturday. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Dr Simon Eccles, chief clinical information officer at NHS Digital, said an ""amazing team"" had worked ""all night"" to enable the site to reopen on Saturday. After home testing kits were booked up,he wrote on Twitter,external: ""I know it's frustrating but we're developing more lab, supply and logistics capacity every day. ""If we'd waited until we had the full 100k, to launch, no-one would have had a test today."" How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? Prof Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, urged key workers showing Covid-19 symptoms to book a test online. He told BBC Breakfast there was now capacity for more than 50,000 daily tests - and that reaching 100,000 a day by Thursday remained ""the aim"". ""The NHS has committed to capacity of 25,000 within NHS laboratories and we are on trajectory for that capacity to be in place,"" he said. Natalie Orton-Rose, from Leicester, said she managed to book a test on Friday but was turned away after she arrived at the drive-through centre. The property manager for Poundstretcher, who is classed as a key worker, said she has been self-isolating after being told by her doctor that it was likely she had Covid-19. Natalie, 34, said she requested a test at 07:00 BST on Friday and ""finally"" got a code to book an appointment at 15:00. ""I drove an hour from my home in Leicester [to the test centre in Nottingham] and sat waiting for half an hour in the queue only to be told actually they had no more tests left,"" she said. ""I am absolutely disgusted. It is bad enough that my closest test centre is an hour away but then to waste my time and fuel... I think the government and public need to be aware that just because you have an appointment and turn up doesn't mean you'll get the very much needed test."" Anyoneclassified as an ""essential worker"",externalwho is showing symptoms can request a test in England. The list includes NHS and social care staff, teachers, police officers and transport workers. They and their family can also request a test if someone in their household shows symptoms. If a child in the same household as an essential worker needs a test, the child's parent or guardian must book it on their behalf. The test involves taking a swab of the nose and the back of the throat. There are two ways to get a test: at a testing site, or with a home testing kit. Home kits will initially be limited but are being sent to NHS staff. Most people will get their test results by text within two days. Provided you and/or those in your household have not tested positive, you can go back to work. That is so long as you are well enough and have not had a high temperature for 48 hours. Of course, you can only go to work if you are defined as a key worker - or you work in a job that is notamong those that has been ordered to stop by the government,external, and you cannot work from home.

"UK companies face a cash flow crisis as many have been forced to close due to the lockdown Payouts to UK firms over coronavirus could cost Â£1.2bn, initial estimates from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) indicate. Close to Â£900m will go to a small number of firms that have infectious disease insurance, the ABI says. Watchdogs are predicting a rise in disputes between companies and insurers over whether their cover includes the financial fallout of Covid-19. The Treasury Select Committee is urging insurers to be fair with claimants. Most of the Â£1.2bn figure is made up of business interruption insurance, but only to those companies which took out specialist policies, such asWimbledon organisersthe All England Club, . The organisers of the Wimbledon Championship cancelled its lucrative sporting fixture, but will be covered by insurance ABI chief executive Huw Evans explained why some claims will not result in a payment to firms. ""Most business interruption insurance policies that most businesses have are very much designed to protect them from fire and floor every day risks that protect their businesses and in the small number of cases it's designed to cover illnesses that come on your premises for a short duration they're not intended and not priced to cover a global pandemic."" However Mr Evans also said there will be claims that have to go to arbitration between insurers and claimants over whether they are covered for the pandemic. If insurers and companies cannot settle a dispute between themselves it goes to the Financial Ombudsman to sort it out. The ABI says its early estimate also includes a record Â£275m paid to customers in cancellation claims on travel insurance, and Â£25m for claims relating to weddings, school trips and events. The initial estimate of Â£1.2bn in payouts does not include claims made through the major insurance market Lloyd's of London. Commenting on the ABI's claims, Commons Treasury Select Committee chair Mel Stride said MPs had heard of many UK businesses struggling to get money from their insurers. ""The ABI has estimated that its members will pay out Â£900m in business interruption claims relating to coronavirus. ""Yet, the Committee continues to receive evidence concerning the difficulties that firms are facing in making a successful claim. ""For example, [Pub and dining firm lobby group] UKHospitality told us that 71% of its members have had claims rejected, with only 1% having any success. Pubs, bars and restaurants have been virtually empty across the UK for more than a month ""There may be many instances where individuals and businesses believe they are covered, but in reality may not be. ""However, we are concerned that the insurance sector goes the extra mile in meeting claims wherever possible. For example, where there may be grey areas within policies."" Last week the Financial Conduct Authority ordered insurance companies to pay out claims to firms ""as soon as possible"" or explain themselves to the watchdog. The British Chambers of Commerce's head of economics, Suren Thiru, said cash flow was an 'urgent concern' for its member businesses ""so it is particularly disappointing that many are facing an uphill struggle to access such a vital lifeline.

"Millions of Indian households depend on neighbourhood shops for essentials India has allowed small local stores to reopen more than a month after the country went into lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic. The interior ministry said only half of staff should work and they had to follow precautions such as wearing face masks and observing social distancing. However shopping malls must remain closed and businesses in coronavirus hotspots will also stay shut. The move is part of Delhi's attempt to gradually restart economic activity. India has nearly 25,000 confirmed cases of the virus and 780 people have died. Covid-19 doctors: Notes on hope, fear and longing Is social distancing an oxymoron in India?

All shops in rural areas except those in shopping malls were allowed to reopen from Saturday, as are stores in urban areas. However shops in markets are to remain closed.

"Some workers could make the permanent move to work from home, which will lead to lower commuter numbers The number of people using public transport in Britain's cities could be 20% lower than normal after the end of the coronavirus lockdown. In London, commuters using buses and tubes could fall by as much as 40% from pre-lockdown levels. Rail use could drop by 27%, a poll for transport consultants SYSTRA has found. The survey results capture people's current attitudes about returning to work, but some changes may be carried on into the long term. The results are bad news for the government, which wants more people touse public transport to cut emissionsthat are fuelling climate heating. It could lead to more people driving to work. It's also challenging for public transport operators, which will face a sharp drop in income until public confidence returns. But the survey offers a glimmer of good news too. It suggests that of those expecting to reduce their use of buses and trains,  24% said they plan to work from home more, which will reduce emissions. They said they wanted to save on the commute time and cost, and to strike a better work-life balance. There's a major boost for video-conferencing, too. As many as 67% of people in the 1,500-strong survey said they believe virtual meetings will replace some or all business trips or meetings. Katie Hall from SYSTRA said: ""Our climate emergency has not been cancelled. There is no doubt that this situation has opened up different ways of working for many, but if people start rejecting public transport over the car for work and leisure trips - that's a massive step backwards. Public transport operators must rise to this challenge."" She said public transport operators must work hard to convince commuters that they'll be safe from the virus. Transport for London has has cut many services since the coronavirus outbreak swept through the capital But she also said transport planners would need to think hard about how travel patterns may change permanently after lockdown. The AA's head Edmund King told BBC News he expected that trafficlevels would fall overall. That has implications for the government's Â£28bn roads programme which is predicated on 1% annual growth in transport demand. There could also be a boom in walking and cycling in a population that may be more interested in health messages. The government recentlycut red tapeon issuing urban road closures to allow councils to exclude cars and create space for walkers and cyclists more easily.

Tata Steel needs about Â£500m of government support to get through the coronavirus pandemic, the MP for Aberavon Stephen Kinnock has said. Sky News has reported Tata has approached the UK and Welsh Governments for the money after many customers halted production during the crisis. Tata employs 8,385 people in the UK, including about 4,000 people in Port Talbot and 2,800 elsewhere in Wales. The UK and Tata have been approached for comment. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We continue to have ongoing discussions with Tata Steel about what support it needs to sustain a strong steel-making presence in the UK and in Wales."" Mr Kinnock said: ""The Â£50m cap on loans that are now available under the government support scheme is only about 10% of what Tata Steel actually needs."" He raised the matter in the House of Commons on Wednesday.
Responding to him, First Secretary of State Dominic Raab said: ""I know that the chancellor is looking carefully at the steel sector in the hon. gentleman's constituency, and at all those who are not directly benefitting from this particular scheme to ensure that in the round we are providing the measures that we need in a targeted way to support all the different crucial elements of the economy.""

Another 23 people in Wales have died with coronavirus - taking the total number to 774, Public Health Wales has said. On Saturday, the latest update from PHW showed there were 299 confirmed new cases, taking the total to 8,900. The true number is likely to be higher as many with symptoms are not tested. It said: ""Following data cleaning, we have today removed 22 previously reported deaths which do not have a positive test result."" A total of 23 more people who tested positive for coronavirus have died, taking Wales' total to 774.

on new field hospitals for coronavirus patients are no longer being given free
parking by the UKâs biggest parking company. NCP launched Free Parking for NHS Heroes at selected car parks close to hospitals during the pandemic. But the company said economic
pressures meant it had to bring back charges for people such as contractors working on sites like Dragonâs Heart Hospital, at the
Principality Stadium in Cardiff. NHS employees and health volunteers will still get free parking, but other drivers will be charged a maximum Â£5 for 24 hours at many of its sites. The company said the fee was âdesigned with key workers in mind and is the lowest possible tariff we could offer currentlyâ. It added it was âdelightedâ that thousands of NHS and other key workers had taken advantage of
its offer in the past month, and it would continue to give free parking to
health staff. Cardiff and Vale
health board said other free parking sites were being offered to contractors
working at Dragonâs Heart Hospital.  Police are stopping vehicles in Pantygasseg in Pontypool, Torfaen. Gwent Police tweeted it was ""not acceptable""to visit the area from Newport.

People have been told to stay away from Wales' tourist hotspots until the lockdown lifts Small tourism businesses could ""go bankrupt"" or suffer ""enormous hardship"" because of changes to a coronavirus grant system, according to Conservative politicians. New guidance on eligibility for the grants was introduced earlier this week following claims that somesecond-home owners were using a ""loophole"" to claim cash. Businesses in the hospitality sector are eligible fornon-repayable grantsof Â£10,000 or Â£25,000 depending on the size of their premises. In a letter to the first minister, Clwyd West MP David Jones said concern ""that the grant might be available to second home owners"" was ""entirely understandable and proper"". Conservative AM for Aberconwy, Janet Finch-Saunders, who has also written to the first minister about the issue, said: ""This is not the time to be penalising genuine self-catering businesses in an effort to catch some of those individuals who have succeeded to take advantage of the rules for qualify second homes for business rates. ""The chaos caused could see some genuine self-catering businesses go bankrupt."" The Welsh government said: âMany local authorities were unhappy with what they perceived as a policy which rewarded second home owners who derived an income from letting their properties. ""As a result, and in agreement with the local authorities, we have refined some of the eligibility criteria. ""However, local authorities have discretion about awarding the grant and the evidence business owners need to provide to support their claim. Queries should be directed to local authorities.â Five councils - Gwynedd,  Anglesey, Conwy, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire - called on Welsh ministers to change advice so second-home owners who pay business rates rather than council tax could not claim.

He usually enjoys going to the library near his home in Waunfawr near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, every Saturday but as this is no longer possible a special library has been created at home for him to exchange books. ""We also try and use the daily structures that already exist like Radio Cymru and S4C timetables - these are what give Guto reassurances and the structure he needs,"" says Iola.

"Coronavirus tests offered to UK key workers were booked up within an hour - apart from some in Scotland. The tests, which are targeted at those who are self-isolating, allow people to return to work as quickly as possible. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said testing is part of ""getting Britain back on her feet"". But the government website closed to new applicants within hours of the Friday launch, after 46,000 people tried to access it. Home testing kits became unavailable less than 15 minutes after bookings reopened on Saturday morning. Some 16,000 bookings were made. Tests at drive-through sites in England were booked up within an hour on Saturday morning, with spaces not becoming available again until the evening. Requests for drive-through tests in Scotland are still currently available on the site. Key workers inWales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalcannot currently book tests online. Both nations appear as options on the government's online system but with a label saying no slots are available. For key workers in England and Scotland with symptoms of the virus, and anyone in their household with symptoms, tests at drive-through centres and home testing kits will become available each day from 08:00 BST, Downing Street has said. Testing extended to include key workers in Scotland Essential workers can also request a test through their employers. The tests offered are swab tests that determine whether people currently have the virus - rather than whether they have had it in the past. Applications to the UK government website was initially open only to people in England,but tests became available to people in Scotland on Saturday. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

""If we'd waited until we had the full 100k, to launch, no-one would have had a test today."" How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? Prof Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, urged key workers showing Covid-19 symptoms to book a test online. He told BBC Breakfast there was now capacity for more than 50,000 daily tests - and that reaching 100,000 a day by Thursday remained ""the aim"". ""The NHS has committed to capacity of 25,000 within NHS laboratories and we are on trajectory for that capacity to be in place,"" he said. Natalie Orton-Rose, from Leicester, said she managed to book a test on Friday but was turned away after she arrived at the drive-through centre. The property manager for Poundstretcher, who is classed as a key worker, said she has been self-isolating after being told by her doctor that it was likely she had Covid-19. Natalie, 34, said she requested a test at 07:00 BST on Friday and ""finally"" got a code to book an appointment at 15:00. ""I drove an hour from my home in Leicester [to the test centre in Nottingham] and sat waiting for half an hour in the queue only to be told actually they had no more tests left,"" she said. ""I am absolutely disgusted. It is bad enough that my closest test centre is an hour away but then to waste my time and fuel... I think the government and public need to be aware that just because you have an appointment and turn up doesn't mean you'll get the very much needed test."" Anyoneclassified as an ""essential worker"",externalwho is showing symptoms can request a test in England. The list includes NHS and social care staff, teachers, police officers and transport workers. They and their family can also request a test if someone in their household shows symptoms. If a child in the same household as an essential worker needs a test, the child's parent or guardian must book it on their behalf. The test involves taking a swab of the nose and the back of the throat. There are two ways to get a test: at a testing site, or with a home testing kit. Home kits will initially be limited but are being sent to NHS staff. Most people will get their test results by text within two days. Provided you and/or those in your household have not tested positive, you can go back to work. That is so long as you are well enough and have not had a high temperature for 48 hours.

"Salons and spas were allowed to reopen in Georgia Three US states have allowed some shops to reopen after measures imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, as the country's death toll passed 51,000. Salons and spas could reopen in Georgia and Oklahoma while Alaska lifted restrictions on restaurants. On Friday, President Donald Trump walked out of a shorter than usual briefing, refusing to take questions. He has faced criticism after suggesting that disinfectant could potentially be used to treat the virus. His remarkshave been condemned as dangerous by doctors and manufacturers.Disinfectants are hazardous substances and can be poisonous if ingested, and even external exposure can be dangerous to the skin, eyes and respiratory system. Mr Trump said on Friday that the comments - made at a news conference one day earlier - were sarcastic and taken out of context. This video can not be played Doctors dismantle Trump's treatment comments Customers visiting the newly reopened businesses in Georgia, Oklahoma and Alaska will be expected to continue adhering to social distancing measures. But some cities and areas have decided to keep their lockdowns in place. In Georgia, which has one of the fastest reopening timetables in the country, bowling alleys, spas, hair and nail salons, tattoo parlours and other personal care businesses will be allowed to resume operations. On Monday, dine-in restaurants and theatres will be allowed to re-open. With unemployment claims reaching 26 million people - or around 15% of the population  - since mid-March, many US states are feeling the pressure to resume trading. But health experts have warned that the steps might be happening too soon, amid fears they could spark another wave of infections. After being criticised by Mr Trump, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp tightened some of the sanitation and social distancing requirements for restaurants. In the White House briefing that lasted just over 20 minutes, President Trump asked people to continue to follow rules around social distancing and the use of face masks. Also on Friday, Mr Trump signed a $484bn (Â£391bn) economic stimulus bill into law, saying he wanted to ""rush economic relief to our citizens"". It is the fourth Covid-19 relief package passed by Washington, and allocates funds towards greater testing, hospitals and a small business loan programme. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? LEADING THE WAY:How California kept ahead of the curve ON FRONTLINE:The young doctors being asked to play god FACTORY HOTSPOT:The untold story behind America's biggest outbreak REASON TO HOPE:The good that may come out of this crisis The US has by far the highest death toll and case count in the world - more than 50,000 deaths and 890,000 confirmed cases. But European countries, including Spain and Italy, have recorded more deaths per capita than the US which has a population of 330 million. Recent steep rises in the daily US death toll are also partly due to the inclusion of ""probable"" virus deaths - on 14 April, the US Centers for Disease Control said their case counts would include both confirmed and probable cases and deaths. A probable Covid-19 death is one that meets clinical and epidemiological criteria but has not been confirmed by testing. It is also important to note that many mild cases remain unreported, so the death rate from confirmed cases is not the same as the disease's overall death rate. Testing efforts are key to tracking the actual mortality and spread of the disease. Vice-President Mike Pence, the Covid-19 taskforce leader, said the US had conducted 4.9 million tests thus far, and that the government was working with governors to expand testing.

Scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia The coronavirus can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face. For eight out of 10 people who catch it, all they will experience is a mild disease, with symptoms such as fever and a cough. However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19 and some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe. It is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill. Covid-19 can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely. There have been further demands for recycling centres to

In England, more than 18,000 hospital patients have now died after testing positive for coronavirus. NHS England has announced 711 new deaths, bringing the total to 18,084. Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit The latest figures from NHS England this afternoon reveal a further 711 deaths of people with Covid-19. The NHS also publishes the number of deaths by the dates the patient died. This is important because some of those whose deaths were announced today died more than a week ago, while 69 people died in March. These figures also only refer to those who died in hospitals. This chart shows the deaths by the dates the patient died and you can see how those announced today are adding to previous days' figures.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus test website designed to close and reopen with more slots - Shapps The government website for key workers to apply for coronavirus tests has reopened after ""exceptional demand"". Speaking at Friday's daily briefing, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps insisted the site closed after ""the slots for today were taken up"". It came back online on Friday evening, allowing key workers to apply for tests at drive-through centres, before being suspended again. More slots were available on Saturday morning. However, home testing kits were no longer available after less than 15 minutes of the site being reopened. Some 16,000 bookings were made on the website on Friday. The site had toclose to new applicants within hours of launching, after 46,000 people tried to access it, but Mr Shapps said it had not crashed and that further tests would become available. He also stressed the test was only suitable to test if you think you currently have coronavirus, not if you have previously had it. No 10 has said appointments for tests at drive-through centres and home testing kits will become available from 08:00 BST each day, with their release staggered throughout the day. How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? Mr Shapps said ministers were ""encouraged"" by the initial demand for tests, and suggested that the government was on track to meet its target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April. ""It looks like the trajectory to 100,000 tests by the end of April is going to be met in terms of capacity,"" he said. ""I would say, after today, the demand is there, so if those two things come together we will have it being met."" He added that getting ""somewhere near"" the 100,000 tests a day target would be an achievement by international standards. Earlier, the prime minister's spokesman said 5,000 home testing kits had been ordered ""within two minutes"" of the website opening on Friday. Up to 18,000 home testing kits per day will be available by the end of next week. Downing Street said the government is trusting that those applying for tests are key workers, with no eligibility checks in place for online bookings. Under the expanded testing scheme announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday,all essential workers,externalin England and their families are eligible to register for tests on thegovernment's website,external, if they have virus symptoms. Up to 10 million key workers and their households are now eligible for testing, with the aim of allowing essential staff to safely return to work. Liz Christie, an education support worker from Slough, Berkshire, successfully applied for a coronavirus test early on Friday. She said was keen to get a test after developing a cough and sore throat, as she wanted to return to work at Slough Children's Services Trust. ""I don't want to infect the children and families I'm working with, plus my own family,"" she told BBC News. Speaking after her test at a drive-through centre in Wembley, north-west London, Ms Christie said the process was ""brilliant"" but added that there were not many other people getting tested at the same time. ""It looks like there's five stations set up,"" she said. ""All the stations were empty except mine, there were two cars in front of me and no-one behind me. ""They've got the infrastructure in place, they just need the people now."" Also speaking at the daily press briefing, the government's deputy chief medical adviser, Dr Jenny Harries, said the increased testing would mean there would be a less positive picture on the number of Covid -19 cases. She stressed that the test on offer to key workers was the ""have you got it now?"" test, and said it would be a ""wasted test"" if it was used by people who did not have symptoms, or people in their households. Friday's figures showed 28,532 tests were carried out, though the government says that capacity has reached more than 50,000 a day. The latest data also showed a further 684 people died with the virus in UK hospitals, bringing the total number of deaths to 19,506. Also at the briefing, Mr Shapps announced the government would subsidise key supply routes to ensure that essential medical supplies and food can be transported during the pandemic. With large sections of the economy frozen, volumes of freight coming in and out of Britain are significantly down. Up to Â£17m has been made available for supply routes between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and up to Â£10.5m for ferry and freight services to the Isle of Wight and Scilly Isles. Further support is available for critical routes between Britain and the European mainland, including Eurotunnel, Mr Shapps said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"This video can not be played Coronavirus test website designed to close and reopen with more slots - Shapps The government website for key workers to apply for coronavirus tests has reopened after ""exceptional demand"". Speaking at Friday's daily briefing, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps insisted the site closed after ""the slots for today were taken up"". It came back online on Friday evening, allowing key workers to apply for tests at drive-through centres, before being suspended again. More slots were available on Saturday morning. However, home testing kits were no longer available after less than 15 minutes of the site being reopened. Some 16,000 bookings were made on the website on Friday. The site had toclose to new applicants within hours of launching, after 46,000 people tried to access it, but Mr Shapps said it had not crashed and that further tests would become available. He also stressed the test was only suitable to test if you think you currently have coronavirus, not if you have previously had it. No 10 has said appointments for tests at drive-through centres and home testing kits will become available from 08:00 BST each day, with their release staggered throughout the day. How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? Mr Shapps said ministers were ""encouraged"" by the initial demand for tests, and suggested that the government was on track to meet its target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April. ""It looks like the trajectory to 100,000 tests by the end of April is going to be met in terms of capacity,"" he said. ""I would say, after today, the demand is there, so if those two things come together we will have it being met."" He added that getting ""somewhere near"" the 100,000 tests a day target would be an achievement by international standards. Earlier, the prime minister's spokesman said 5,000 home testing kits had been ordered ""within two minutes"" of the website opening on Friday. Up to 18,000 home testing kits per day will be available by the end of next week. Downing Street said the government is trusting that those applying for tests are key workers, with no eligibility checks in place for online bookings. Under the expanded testing scheme announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday,all essential workers,externalin England and their families are eligible to register for tests on thegovernment's website,external, if they have virus symptoms. Up to 10 million key workers and their households are now eligible for testing, with the aim of allowing essential staff to safely return to work. Liz Christie, an education support worker from Slough, Berkshire, successfully applied for a coronavirus test early on Friday. She said was keen to get a test after developing a cough and sore throat, as she wanted to return to work at Slough Children's Services Trust. ""I don't want to infect the children and families I'm working with, plus my own family,"" she told BBC News. Speaking after her test at a drive-through centre in Wembley, north-west London, Ms Christie said the process was ""brilliant"" but added that there were not many other people getting tested at the same time. ""It looks like there's five stations set up,"" she said. ""All the stations were empty except mine, there were two cars in front of me and no-one behind me. ""They've got the infrastructure in place, they just need the people now.""

"Salons and spas were allowed to reopen in Georgia Three US states have allowed some shops to reopen after measures imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, as the country's death toll passed 51,000. Salons and spas could reopen in Georgia and Oklahoma while Alaska lifted restrictions on restaurants. On Friday, President Donald Trump walked out of a shorter than usual briefing, refusing to take questions. He has faced criticism after suggesting that disinfectant could potentially be used to treat the virus. His remarkshave been condemned as dangerous by doctors and manufacturers.Disinfectants are hazardous substances and can be poisonous if ingested, and even external exposure can be dangerous to the skin, eyes and respiratory system. Mr Trump said on Friday that the comments - made at a news conference one day earlier - were sarcastic and taken out of context. This video can not be played Doctors dismantle Trump's treatment comments Customers visiting the newly reopened businesses in Georgia, Oklahoma and Alaska will be expected to continue adhering to social distancing measures. But some cities and areas have decided to keep their lockdowns in place. In Georgia, which has one of the fastest reopening timetables in the country, bowling alleys, spas, hair and nail salons, tattoo parlours and other personal care businesses will be allowed to resume operations. On Monday, dine-in restaurants and theatres will be allowed to re-open. With unemployment claims reaching 26 million people - or around 15% of the population  - since mid-March, many US states are feeling the pressure to resume trading. But health experts have warned that the steps might be happening too soon, amid fears they could spark another wave of infections. After being criticised by Mr Trump, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp tightened some of the sanitation and social distancing requirements for restaurants. In the White House briefing that lasted just over 20 minutes, President Trump asked people to continue to follow rules around social distancing and the use of face masks. Also on Friday, Mr Trump signed a $484bn (Â£391bn) economic stimulus bill into law, saying he wanted to ""rush economic relief to our citizens"". It is the fourth Covid-19 relief package passed by Washington, and allocates funds towards greater testing, hospitals and a small business loan programme. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? LEADING THE WAY:How California kept ahead of the curve ON FRONTLINE:The young doctors being asked to play god FACTORY HOTSPOT:The untold story behind America's biggest outbreak REASON TO HOPE:The good that may come out of this crisis The US has by far the highest death toll and case count in the world - more than 50,000 deaths and 890,000 confirmed cases. But European countries, including Spain and Italy, have recorded more deaths per capita than the US which has a population of 330 million. Recent steep rises in the daily US death toll are also partly due to the inclusion of ""probable"" virus deaths - on 14 April, the US Centers for Disease Control said their case counts would include both confirmed and probable cases and deaths. A probable Covid-19 death is one that meets clinical and epidemiological criteria but has not been confirmed by testing. It is also important to note that many mild cases remain unreported, so the death rate from confirmed cases is not the same as the disease's overall death rate. Testing efforts are key to tracking the actual mortality and spread of the disease. Vice-President Mike Pence, the Covid-19 taskforce leader, said the US had conducted 4.9 million tests thus far, and that the government was working with governors to expand testing.

Jay-Natalie La Santa, pictured here with her parents, is one of the youngest people to die of Covid-19 in the US The five-month-old daughter of New York City firefighter Jerel La Santa and Board of Education employee Lindsey La Santa died earlier this week of Covid-19, after a month in hospital, her family says. The baby, Jay-Natalie, had a preexisting heart condition, her grandmother, Wanda La Santa told US media, and was first admitted to a New York hospital on 21 March with a fever. ""She was a little angel with the most beautiful smile,"" Wanda told NBC News. ""Jay-Natalie had everybody wrapped around her finger."" After early signs of improvement, Jay-Natalie's condition quickly deteriorated, Wanda said. ""My granddaughter fought a big battle for a whole month in the hospital."" Jay-Natalie is one of the youngest people to die of Covid-19 in the US. According to a report from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, just three children between the ages of one and 14 had died of the virus as of 2 April. Both of the baby's parents tested negative for the virus. Jose Prosper, president of the Hispanic Society of FDNY said that Jay-Natalie's father - who joined the force the same month she was born - called her his ""warrior princess"". ""Please keep the La Santa family close in prayer,"" Prosper wrote. The commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Stephen Hahn, said at the White House briefing today that the agency had approved the US's first at-home virus test. So what do we know about the test? The FDA gave more details earlier this week,external. A nasal swab kit called Pixel will be made available first to health care workers and first responders, and is expected to go on sale to consumers - with a doctor's order - in most US states in the next few weeks. Patients will collect their own samples using the swab and then submit to a LabCorp lab for analysis. Each test kit costs $119 (Â£90). Buyers will have to complete a survey about their eligibility, with questions like if they are a healthcare worker, where they live, and if they have any virus symptoms.  Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Brett Crozier, the commander of the Theodore Roosevelt, sounded an alarm about infections on board his ship last month. In a letter to navy officials, he pleaded for additional resources to protect his crew. The letter wasleaked to a newspaper,external, and afterwards he was removed from command. But now the chief of naval operations, Admiral Michael Gilday, and the acting navy secretary, James McPherson, have recommended that Crozier be reinstated as commander. Their recommendation is a significant development in a story that has transfixed military people and others across the US, and it could mark the beginning of a dramatic turnaround for Crozier. It is extremely rare for a commander to be sacked, explains Gary Solis, a retired Marine Corps judge, and even more rare for his reputation to be restored. Like many who served in the military, Solis does not approve of the way Crozier addressed the problems on his ship. But Solis says his heart was in the right place. âItâs clear that he had the best interests of the ship and the crew - and also national defence - in mind,â Solis says. The Pentagon said in a statement that Defence Secretary Mark Esper would ""thoroughly review"" the preliminary inquiry into the virus outbreak onboard before meeting with Navy leaders to determine next steps.  The USS Theodore Roosevelt is docked at Naval Base Guam in Apra Harbor on 10 April, 2020 Millions of Americans have been promised a stimulus cheque of up to $1,200 (Â£970) as part of the federal government's rescue package. So how will they spend it? Some BBC readers told us. For some - it will go to necessities. ""I will buy what we need, not spending it all at once,"" wrote Pearl Quintal, a grandmother from Hawaii. ""I will save some to make ends meet as far as $1,200 will carry myself and my two grandsons that I have been taking care of."" For others, it will be spent on something more specific: a bidet. ""Toilet paper shortages have convinced me that the Japanese and most Europeans had it right all along,"" Dirk Ducharme of Auburn, California told the BBC. Read about how more Americans plan to spend their money.  Belgium will gradually lift coronavirus restrictions during May, allowing businesses, schools and social life to resume in several phases. Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes says the lockdown will start to be eased from 4 May, when restrictions on open-air sports and public transport will be lifted. All businesses will be allowed to reopen from 11 May and schools from 18 May. Beyond that, other public venues, such as cafes, bars, restaurants, may be reopened gradually in June. Wilmes said the spread of the virus had slowed in Belgium, but stressed that the situation was still evolving day-by-day. ""Nothing is etched in stone,"" Wilmes said. Belgium declared a nationwide lockdown over the coronavirus crisis on 18 March, following the example of several European countries. As of Friday, there were 44,293 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 6,679 deaths related to the disease in the country, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. President Trump may cut back on his coronavirus taskforce briefings,according to news site Axios,external, citing four unnamed sources. A number of Trump's advisers have reportedly urged the president to curb his daily appearances - which have often lasted for more than an hour. Trump has previously boasted about the ""ratings"" for his White House briefings, comparing them to viewership for NFL games and reality show The Bachelor. But the president faced intense backlash for his comments on Thursday's briefing, where he suggested that ingesting disinfectant could potentially treat the virus. His comments were heavily criticised by doctors, while disinfectant producers warned consumers not to inject or ingest their products. On Friday, Mr Trump said that his comments at the briefing had been made ""sarcastically"". Vice-President Pence celebrates the ""extraordinary and rapid progress"" made by governors in their coronavirus response. This is ""one team, one mission"", Pence said, listing progress across US states, like New York, New Jersey and Missouri. ""We are slowing the spread. We are protecting the most vulnerable,"" Pence says. ""The day will soon come when we will heal our land."" He says that ""social distancing efforts"" are really making an impact, and thanks the ""millions of Americans who put the guidance into practice"". He and Trump leave the briefing without taking any questions from reporters. The coronavirus taskforce briefing lasted just over 20 minutes - which is unusually short compared to previous briefings, some of which have lasted more than 2.5 hours. Trump and Pence appeared without either Dr Anthony Fauci or Dr Deborah Birx, top US health experts and coronavirus response co-ordinators. Dr Stephen Hahn, who heads the US food and drug agency, says the president tasked him with cutting down ""as many barriers as we possibly could to get products into the medical community"". ""We have done that, of course recognising the urgency of the situation,"" Dr Hahn says. Dr Hahn announces the agency has authorised the first ""at-home test"" for diagnosing Covid-19. ""This is a test where, under certain circumstances with a doctor's supervision, a test can be mailed to a patient, and the patient can perform the self-swab and mail it back and get the results."" He says the agency has approved 63 tests thus far, and is currently working with over 400 test developers to authorise their products. When asked about antibody tests - which determine if someone has already had the virus and may be immune - Dr Hahn says they have authorised four and ""more are in the pipeline"". The lack of testing has been a key issue with the country's Covid-19 response. Governors across the nation have been requesting more tests in recent weeks, and initial tests put forth by the Centers for Disease Control were inaccurate. Existing drug administration regulations also made it harder at the onset for hospital laboratories across the country to develop new diagnostic tests. Read more on US testing: ""Testing is in the forefront of our minds,"" says Vice-President Mike Pence, taking the podium after President Trump. âOne month ago, all of the testing that had been done in America: 80,000 Americans had been tested,"" he says. ""But as of this morning, 5.1 million Americans have been tested for the coronavirus.â Pence urges Americans not to be ""discouraged"" by rising number of cases as testing increases. ""We continue to see positive progress,"" he says. Trump says his administration is sending ventilators to other countries in need as the US now has a ""tremendous capacity"" of its own. ""They're asking if we can send them ventilators and I'm agreeing to do it,"" Trump says of other countries. ""The federal government has 10,000 ventilators and we could have a lot more if we wanted to do that but we're helping Mexico, Honduras, Indonesia, France...We're sending to Spain, we're sending to Italy,"" Trump says. The president begins by saying the country is beginning to work on re-opening and asks Americans to ""maintain vigilance and hygiene, social distancing and voluntary use of face coverings"". Trump signed the Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act today - the fourth economic stimulus package passed by Congress due to Covid-19. Trump notes that $30bn (Â£24bn) of the funds will be reserved for smaller financial institutions and ""those that serve minority and distressed communities"", like African American and Hispanic American small business owners. The legislation also includes $75bn for hospitals. Trump also says more than 80 million Americans have already received their economic relief payments from the federal government. The typical family of four will get $3,400 he says. ""That's great, and you deserve it."" Want to follow along?Watch our livestream here. US President Donald Trump has started his daily coronavirus task force update, initially scheduled for 17:00 EST (22:00 BST). He is joined by Vice-President Mike Pence. Fashion houses Burberry, Mulberry and Barbour have all turned their focus from the catwalk to the UK's NHS. Burberry has announced its trench coat factory in Yorkshire is now a production line for surgical gowns, subject to sign-off by the government. Meanwhile, it is using its supply chain to secure 100,000 medical masks for the NHS. It also said it would not use the government's furlough scheme to pay staff who cannot work due to the virus. Handbag maker Mulberry said it would make 8,000 reusable gowns for the NHS in Bristol and outdoor brand Barbour has sent disposable gowns to a hospital in the north east of England. The UK death toll has risen by 768. The highest daily increase in recorded deaths in UK hospitals was 980 on 10 April. Since then, the daily increase has gone down slightly and then plateaued. Day-to-day there are often considerable variations in figures, but displayed in a graph like this it is possible to see the overall trend downwards. The line highlighted is the seven-day rolling average and this graphic includes the most recent figures reported earlier today. Wisconsin's protest against stay-at-home orders is thought to be the largest so far in the US Thousands of demonstrators in Wisconsin descended upon the state capitol in Madison earlier to protest against the governor's stay-at-home-orders, now extended until 26 May. Some wore face coverings in accordance with government guidance, many did not. Several carried signs critical of Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, others boasted banners in support of President Trump. The protest is thought to be the largest of its kind so far in the US. It comes almost three weeks after Wisconsin held an in-person election for the Democratic presidential nominee, among other state races. Since the 7 April election. at least 19 people who voted in person or volunteered as poll workers have tested positive for Covid-19. Protesters gather at Wisconsin's state capitol on Friday NBC has announced the stars of US sitcom Parks and Recreation are to reunite for a one-off coronavirus special. The half an hour show will raise money for Feeding America, a non-profit organisation that runs a network of food banks. Parks and Recreation came to an end five years ago. The special episode will centre around the character Leslie Knope, who is played by Amy Poehler. Knope is determined to stay in touch with her friends while social distancing measures are in place.

The US state of Maryland has sent out an emergency alert after receiving more than 100 calls to the state's emergency hotline about the use of disinfectant related to the coronavirus. âWe have received several calls regarding questions about disinfectant use and Covid-19,â the state's emergency agency wrote on Twitter. ""This is a reminder that under no circumstances should any disinfectant product be administered into the body through injection, ingestion or any other route.â The suggestion from President Trump that disinfectant could be used inside the body to treat the virus has been rejected extensively by scientists and medical experts. Trump later defended his comments, saying they were ""sarcastic"". Maryland has 16,616 confirmed cases to date, with 798 deaths. The US stock markets rallied on Friday at the end of a turbulent week. Three major indexes - S&P, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite - all climbed, although they remain down for the week overall. Dow was up 1.1% at 23,775.27, S&P 500 climbed 1.4% to end at 2,836.74, while Nasdaq finished 1.7% higher at 8,634.52. The coronavirus pandemic is still expected to cause deep damage to the American economy.

"People should seek medical care when they need it and not be put off by the coronavirus epidemic, say doctors, charities and the health service. Anyone who delays seeking treatment is putting their long-term health at risk, as well as their life, they warn. Half the usual number of people are going to A&E and treatment for heart attacks and strokes is down. Seeking medical help is one of the four reasons people can safely leave home, government guidance says. NHS England's medical director Stephen Powis said he was concerned by the reduced numbers. ""If you do have symptoms of stroke, chest pain and think it might be a heart attack, a sick child who is deteriorating, if you are a pregnant woman and the baby is not moving as much as it used to - it is important you don't delay,"" he said. Coronavirus: Latest news from around the world Prof Powis suggested the falling numbers were due to people worrying about bothering the NHS and fears of catching the virus in a medical environment. But he said he wanted to reassure people that A&E departments and GPs' surgeries had made changes to keep staff and patients safe, for example GPs talking through a patient's symptoms on the phone before asking them to go into a surgery. A&E visits down 29% during epidemic in England A public information campaign persuading people to use the health service will feature NHS staff and start next week. It comes as the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty warns of the impact of deaths from causes other than Covid-19 during the lockdown. As of 17:00 BST on 24 April, 20,319 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died in UK hospitals. Four other countries to date have announced an official number of coronavirus-related deaths exceeding 20,000 - the US, Spain, Italy and France. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government needed to move to testing and tracing those who had come into contact with the virus as soon as possible so that people's lives could return to normal. ""Either we are in lockdown for that 18 months which is clearly unsustainable for the economy and it means other health issues build up,"" he told BBC's Breakfast. ""People are not going to hospital, peoples' treatment is cancelled, people with cancer are not getting the treatment they need."" Contact your GP practice, use NHS 111 online or call 111 if you need medical help Call 999 in emergencies Go to hospital if you are told you should Figures suggest half the number of people will go to Accident and Emergency departments in hospitals in England this month, compared with April 2019 - down to just over one million visits. And experts say they are concerned people are not getting potentially life-saving treatment for heart attacks and strokes, with a 50% fall in the number of people seeking medical help for heart symptoms. Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said it was ""vitally important"" that the many thousands of people in the UK with existing heart conditions accessed care ""immediately"" if their condition worsened. Ryan Wallace, from Limavady, in County Londonderry, did not want to be a burden on the health service when he felt chest pains. But after doctors warned he was close to having a major heart attack he has told others not to put off going to hospital. ""Coronavirus was worrying, yes, but I also didn't want to put more burden on the NHS and putting more stress on their already stretched resources. ""Their first words were 'you're a lucky boy you came in here.' They showed me in black-and-white on the screen after the procedure and they said I was hanging on by a thread."" Mr Wallace required three stents to be inserted and said those who stayed away would ""only be storing up problems down the line"". There are also concerns that children may be missing out on medical care during the pandemic. ""Children are unlikely to be unwell with Covid, but they do get sick and when this happens we want to see them,"" said Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? There is also a warning that people should not dismiss strokes as ""just a funny turn"". Juliet Bouverie, from the Stroke Association, said a stroke was a medical emergency. ""The quicker you're diagnosed and treated for a stroke, the better your chances of making a good recovery,"" she said. If you suspect that you, or someone else could be having a stroke, call 999. Prof Powis said that now the NHS was seeing fewer patients with coronavirus, it was time to start building up its services again. ""The NHS has done a magnificent job responding to coronavirus, we have not been overwhelmed in the way seen in other countries, now it is important to start stepping up again to ensure we are not delaying other procedures,"" he said.
