"ITV ""failed in its responsibility towards reality show contributors"", according to a House of Commons committee investigating reality TV. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee viewed leaked backstage footage of an ""extremely upset"" Jeremy Kyle Show contributor being filmed. ""There was no safe space for anyone in a highly distressed state"", it added. ITV told the BBC: ""We cannot comment on accusations based on footage the select committee has not shared with ITV."" The inquiry is investigating whether enough support is offered during and after filming on reality TV. It was set up afterthe death of a man who had taken a lie detector test on The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the suicides of two former Love Island contestants. Jeremy Kyle guests 'treated like police suspects' Jeremy Kyle working on pilot for new ITV show ITV grilled over Kyle lie detectors How The Jeremy Kyle Show became a 'toxic brand' ITV added that ""the physical and mental health of everyone we work with is our highest priority"" and it was working across the industry to ""share best practice and continue to strengthen and evolve our duty of care processes"". The broadcaster said the participation of the public in TV  programmes has been right at the heart of TV since it began."" It said: ""We believe that these shows are all the better for the talent, energy and diversity of the members of the public who take part in them, and we are committed to continuing to ensure that their welfare is also at the heart of what we do."" However the committee said its expert advisers who viewed the leaked footage ""expressed deep concerns from a psychological perspective at a level of 'humiliation, denigration and provocation that a participant is subjected'"". ""Particular concerns are raised over failures to prioritise the welfare of participants, in one case a young man who is heard punching a wall,"" they added. Committee chair Damian Collins MP said: ""We've seen one contributor who was extremely upset take refuge backstage, only to have a camera thrust in his face to capture him holding his head in his hands."" Collins added the footage also showed how Kyle would use ""provocative and sometimes abusive language"", which would then be edited out. He said it also made ""a mockery"" of the aftercare the show claimed to provide. ITVcancelled The Jeremy Kyle Show in Mayand has stressed it will not bring it ""or any other show resembling its format"" back. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"The girl was hit by a VW Golf on Sceptre Road, Croxteth A girl who was out trick or treating has been hit by a car which had been shot at on Merseyside. The 12-year-old sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries when she was struck by a VW Golf on Sceptre Road, Croxteth, at 19:50 GMT. A man thought to have been driving the car later arrived at hospital having been ""shot in the face"", Merseyside Police said. His injury is not believed to be life threatening. No arrests have been made. Asst Ch Con Ian Critchley said: ""We are dealing today with an appalling, cowardly attack."" He said the driver of the car reversed into the girl after being shot at. ""That 12-year-old girl was out for Halloween, playing out with her friends, her family, having fun. ""She suffered significant injuries as a result of being hit by that car. ""Fortunately her friends and family courageously helped her,"" Mr Critchley said. He appealed for the public's help in tracing the gunman and the gun. Asst Ch Con Ian Critchley said police were speaking to witnesses and supporting the girl's family Referring to the shooting ofRhys Jones in Croxteth in 2007, Mr Critchely said the area had suffered the ""innocent death"" of a child previously and added: ""I know that the community will not tolerate it."" ""This is an extremely worrying incident, where the offenders have shown no thought for the general public and has resulted in an innocent young girl, who was out enjoying herself, experiencing this traumatic ordeal,"" he said.

"A potential successor, Abu al-Hasan al-Muhajir, was killed in an air strike hours after Baghdadi's death The jihadist group Islamic State (IS) has for the first time confirmed the death of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and named his successor. An IS outlet announced on the messaging service Telegram that Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurashi was the group's new leader and ""caliph"". US special forces tracked down Baghdadi in north-west Syria at the weekend and attacked his compound. The IS leader fled into a tunnel and killed himself with a suicide vest. The Iraqi had a $25m (Â£19m) bounty on his head and had been pursued by the US and its allies since the rise of IS five years ago. Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? What we know about the US raid IS also confirmed on Thursday the death of spokesman Abu al-Hasan al-Muhajir - who was killed in a joint operation in northern Syria by US and Syrian Kurdish forces hours after the one targeting Baghdadi. The Saudi national had been considered a potential successor. The new IS spokesman, Abu Hamza al-Qurashi, also called on Muslims to swear allegiance to Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi. Hashemi's name is not known to security forces, and is believed to be a nom de guerre. IS did not provide many details about the new leader or release a photo, but it did describe him as a ""prominent figure in jihad"". The statement also claimed Hashemi was a veteran jihadist fighter who had fought against the US in the past. With the name ""al-Qurashi"", the group also made clear that he claims to be descended from the Prophet Muhammad's Quraysh tribe - something generally held by pre-modern Sunni scholars as being a key qualification for becoming a caliph. Before the announcement, BBC jihadist media specialist Mina al-Lami said: ""If IS chooses to appoint someone who is not a Qurashi, then perhaps it is an implicit acknowledgement that the 'caliphate' is no more."" IS declared the creation of a ""caliphate"" - a state governed in accordance with Sharia, or Islamic law - after seizing control of huge swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014 and imposing its brutal rule on millions of civilians. It proclaimed Baghdadi as ""Caliph Ibrahim"" and demanded allegiance from Muslims worldwide. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself after US special forces found him in north-west Syria Despite the demise of its physical caliphate in March, IS remains a battle-hardened and well-disciplined force whose enduring defeat is not assured. The group still has between 14,000 and 18,000 ""members"" in Iraq and Syria, including up to 3,000 foreigners, according to a recent US report. In his statement, IS's new spokesman said the group's Shura Council met soon after Baghdadi's death was confirmed and pledged allegiance to Hashemi. The day before IS released the name of its new leader, the US military made public more information about the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a raid in Syria's Idlib province early on Sunday. In grainy footage, helicopters were seen firing at gunmen on the ground as they flew towards a compound where Baghdadi was hiding. On landing, US special forces commandos blew holes in the walls of the compound and called on Baghdadi to surrender, the military said. But he fled into a tunnel and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and two children he had taken with him. ""You can deduce what kind of person it is based on that activity,"" said the head of US Central Command, Gen Kenneth McKenzie. After the raid, the compound was destroyed in an air strike. This video can not be played The grainy footage shows troops closing in on the compound - and later an explosion destroying it Gen McKenzie said the destroyed buildings were left looking like ""a parking lot with large potholes"". He added that he could not confirm President Donald Trump's graphic description of Baghdadi whimpering and crying as he died.

"A protester in Malaga holds up a sign saying ""No means no"" in support of the Manresa victim A Barcelona court's decision to acquit five men accused of gang-raping a 14-year-old girl of the charge of sexual assault has provoked outrage. The court ruled out rape because the victim was in an ""unconscious state"" and the accused had not used violence or intimidation. This is a requirement under Spanish law for a charge of sexual assault, which is legally the equivalent of rape. Instead, they were convicted and jailed for the lesser crime of sexual abuse. The five were sentenced to between 10 and 12 years in prison. A conviction for sexual assault would have carried prison sentences of between 15 and 20 years. A review is currently taking place in Spain to decide whether to base rape cases on a woman's explicit consent to sex. A number of European countries have changed their laws in recent years to define rape as sex without consent. Sweden changed the law last year and Denmark is doing the same. The Barcelona verdict comes despitea ruling in a similar case by the Spanish Supreme Courtupgrading a conviction from sexual abuse to sexual assault. Barcelona's Mayor Ada Colau denounced it as an ""outrageous sentence"",externalon Twitter. ""I am not a judge and I do not know how many years in prison they deserve, what I do know is that it is not abuse, it is rape!"" Warning: Some readers may find details of this story disturbing Women's rights groups have similarly reacted to the ruling with anger and dismay. Furious social media users have been commenting on the case under hashtags like JusticiaPatriarcal (Patriarchal Justice) and NoEsAbusoEsViolacion (It's not abuse it's rape). The case is known as the ""Manada de Manresa"" - Manresa Wolf Pack - for its similarities toa 2016 gang attack on a teenagerwhich prompted widespread protests and an ongoing review of Spain's rape laws. Lila Corominas, a spokeswoman for the Manresa Feminist Strike Committee, told newspaper Nius Diario this was ""an obvious case of sexual assault and intimidation"". Leader of the MÃ¡s PaÃ­s political party ÃÃ±igo ErrejÃ³n said the sentence was ""shameful"", while Irene Montero, spokeswoman for Unidas Podemos, called for a change in the law ""so we can speak proudly of living in a feminist country"". Some activists are calling for a protest against the court decision,externalin Manresa on Saturday at 13:00 local time (12:00 GMT). The five men were found guilty of abusing the girl during a drinking session known in Spanish as a botellÃ³n at a disused factory in Manresa, a town in the north-eastern region of Catalonia, in October 2016. Prosecutors told the court the men - two Spaniards, two Cubans and one Argentine - took turns to attack the girl, who was under the influence of alcohol and drugs. One of the defendants, named only as Bryan AndrÃ©s M, was said to have told each of them: ""It's your turn. Fifteen minutes each and no delay."" At a previous court hearing, the girl said she remembered very little of what happened but that one of the men had been brandishing a gun. All the defendants denied the allegations, although the DNA of one of them was found on the girl's underwear. A similar case sparked fury in Spain, and was later overturned by the Supreme Court The court ruled that the victim did ""not know what she was and wasn't doing, and consequently, did not have the ability to agree to or oppose the sexual relations most of the defendants had with her"", El Pais reported. It added that the defendants ""were able to commit sexual acts without using any type of violence or intimidation"". The court eventually awarded the victim â¬12,000 (Â£10,300) damages for an attack it described as ""extremely severe and especially denigrating"". Judges expressed ""surprise"" that the prosecutors changed the charge at the last minute to sexual assault from the initial accusation of sexual abuse. They said they could not see the reasons for the more serious assault offence in the prosecution's arguments. A court in Navarra jailed five men for sexual abuse for a gang attack in Pamplona on an 18-year-old woman who was dragged into the hallway of a residential building. As she appeared ""passive or neutral"", according to a police report, the court decided no intimidation or violence had taken place. This video can not be played Activists say rage over the ""wolfpack"" case ignited a feminist revolution (Video from 2019) In June, the Spanish Supreme Court overturned that ruling, deciding it was sexual assault and that the men were rapists. The five saw their sentences of nine years increased to 15. Spain's prime minister last year appointed a panel to review the rape laws.

"The Bank of England may see its first female governor in over 300 years if the current government remains in power after the general election in December. The BBC understands that Egyptian-born Dame Minouche Shafik is the current government's favoured candidate to succeed Mark Carney when his term ends in January of next year. However, the government feels it would be inappropriate to name a successor to one of the most important economic posts in the UK before the results of the election on 12 December. A change of government in December would see a change in chancellor - the person who recommends the choice of governor. Bank of England governor announcement postponed Who will be the next Bank of England governor? Carney: Brexit deal 'positive' for UK economy The role of governor of the Bank of England is one of the most powerful positions in the UK. The bank is responsible for setting interest rates and policing the stability and behaviour of the UK's financial sector. Although the governor is only one of a committee of nine people who set interest rates, he or she wields enormous influence over the way the UK's financial system is run. Given the UK's position as arguably the world's most important financial centre, the job comes with global influence. Dame Nemat Talaat Shafik, who is 57 and more commonly referred to as Minouche, has already served as a deputy governor of the bank and is currently director of the London School of Economics. Other candidates for the role include Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority; Shriti Vadera, chair of Santander UK; and Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe and Paul Tucker - all former or current deputy governors at the Bank. One former Bank of England insider told the BBC ""she would be a very popular appointment internally. She has very good people skills which not all the other candidates do."" The most important question perhaps is whether this potential new governor is seen as a ""hawk"" or a ""dove"". A hawk is someone who would rather raise interest rates early to head off inflation by increasing the cost of loans to discourage borrowing and spending. A dove is someone who would rather wait and see whether cheap borrowing really leads to debt-fuelled spending before raising the rates at which consumers and home buyers can borrow. Dame Minouche - who received her damehood in 2015 - has described herself in the past as an ""owl"" who would be ""wise"" when setting the rates at which we all borrow. The incumbent government may have chosen its preferred governor. But it would perhaps be unwise to assume whether it gets to make that call.

"This video can not be played Survivors were treated at nearby hospitals in the hours after the blaze At least 74 people have died after a train travelling between the Pakistani cities of Karachi and Rawalpindi caught fire in the middle of its journey. Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said the fire started when a gas cylinder, which passengers were using to cook breakfast on board, exploded. The huge blaze spread to at least three carriages. According to officials cited in local media, many victims died as they tried to jump off the moving, burning train. Another 40 people were injured. Officials say the number of victims may still rise. Are rail accidents at a record high in Pakistan? BBC Urdu's Farhat Javed, who visited hospitals where victims are being treated, said many patients were too traumatised to speak. Survivor Shahid Imran told the BBC he realised a fire had broken out when he heard screaming. He pushed his wife out of a window and then jumped after her. Mr Imran was slightly hurt in the fall from the moving train, but his wife suffered severe head injuries. Another survivor told the BBC they pulled the emergency chain to get the train to stop, but it did not slow down. Doctors are treating people for burns, broken limbs and head injuries, our correspondent said. The accident happened near the town of Rahim Yar Khan in the south of Punjab province. Many passengers were pilgrims heading to Raiwind near Lahore for one of Pakistan's largest annual religious congregations, organised by the Tablighi Jamaat Sunni Muslim missionary movement. Three carriages were set alight, officials said, with 54 people in the 11th carriage and 78 each in carriages 12 and 13. Most of these passengers were on their way to the religious festival. Mohammad Ramzan, who was on board, told BBC Urdusome pilgrims were making tea when their gas cylinder exploded. He jumped from the train to safety. Survivor Jamshed Pathan told BBC Urdu he was in carriage 11 when they realised there was a fire, and that it had broken out just after they finished morning prayers. ""There was chaos everywhere,"" he said. ""It was very difficult for us to get out and save ourselves."" Another man, who gave his name as Ghaffar, said he could smell something in the night, ""but no one paid attention"". He and his friends helped rush injured passengers to hospital. ""I have no words to explain what we saw,"" he said. ""The rescue teams got there very late."" The injured were taken to hospitals including this one in Bahawalpur District deputy commissioner Jamil Ahmed said some of the victims had suffered such severe burns that they could not be identified without DNA testing. Evidence is now being collected at the scene and sent off for forensic tests, an anonymous official told BBC Urdu. ""Two cooking stoves blew up. They were cooking, they had [cooking] oil which added fuel to fire,"" Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said. Passengers bringing stoves onto trains in order to cook meals on long journeys was a common problem, the minister said. Though it is common to carry food on board, gas cylinders are banned. But other reports from the scene suggest electrical problems could have been the cause. Several survivors have reportedly said they believed a short-circuit on board may have been to blame. Prime Minister Imran Khan said he was ""deeply saddened by the terrible tragedy"",external, adding that he had ordered an ""immediate inquiry"" into the cause of the fire. After an earlier suspension in the wake of the blaze, the railways minister said services had now been restored. By Abid Hussain, BBC Urdu Train travel is one of the most popular means of transport in Pakistan, particularly among middle- and lower-income groups. Built by the British during pre-partition era, the railway tracks cover the length of the country. However, while some of the upscale trains have dedicated dining carriages, most of the country's trains are in poor condition and have barely functioning amenities. Therefore, passengers choose to bring things along with them, or refresh themselves where the trains stop. They also take advantage of the fact that inspection is more relaxed than at airports, bringing banned items like cooking stoves and oil canisters to keep themselves sustained during the long hours on board. This particular service - Tezgam - is one of the oldest and most popular, travelling between Karachi in the south and Rawalpindi in the north. The journey takes more than 25 hours,external, with each of its carriages boasting space for somewhere between 60 and 80 passengers on bunk beds. Tickets cost between 1,500 rupees ($9.60; Â£7.40) and 5,000 rupees ($32; Â£24.80), depending on the class. This is Pakistan's worst rail disaster in over a decade, but the country has a history of fatal railway accidents. Casualty figures are often high because trains are packed with far greater numbers of passengers than they were designed for.

"Foie gras is seen as a delicacy by some and as the product of cruelty by others New York's proposed foie gras ban has been met with fury by the food industry, with one wholesaler claiming it could backfire. Ariane Daguin from food manufacturer D'Artagnan said chefs were likely to order more ""because they are so mad"". On Wednesday the city council voted to ban sales of the controversial product, a move hailed by animal rights groups. Foie gras is made from the livers of ducks and geese that have traditionally been force-fed corn. Pub removes foie gras after 'bullying' Attempt to ban foie gras fails in Parliament The law, which would be introduced in 2022, now needs to be signed into effect by Mayor Bill de Blasio. Ms Daguin from D'Artagnan told the BBC she thought it was a ""very bad"" decision. ""There are 1,000 restaurateurs in New York City who have foie gras on their menu right now. They are all very incensed,"" she said. Izzy Yanay, co-founder and general manager of Hudson Valley Foie Gras, one of New York's state major foie gras producers, meanwhile told AFP the industry would fight back. ""We're going to kick their ass in court."" Council members approved the ban by 42 votes to six. Jeremy Unger, spokesman for council member Carlina Riviera, who introduced the bill, said: ""The council is banning a really cruel and inhumane practice."" Those found in violation of the law will be fined between $500 (Â£386) and $2,000. Matthew Dominguez from campaign group Voters for Animal Rights said Wednesday's vote marked a ""historic day for New York City"". While foie gras can be produced by natural feeding, in France it must be made by a process known as gavage in which ducks and geese are force-fed corn through a tube. The force-feeding occurs for about two weeks after the animals reach maturity. The practice is banned in some countries. Farmers in New York claim they use humane tactics to feed the animals However Ms Daguin said the farms she uses feed the ducks ""without stress and without harm"". ""These farmers respect the animals get good results because they do not stress the animals out. I have visited them several times and I know and am convinced in my heart that we are not harming those ducks,"" she said. ""This law is unfair, unjust and we think illegal."" She said that council members had been invited to tour the farms ahead of the vote but says not one member visited. New York isn't the first city to ban the product. California issued a ban on foie gras in 2012. Chicago issued a ban in 2006 which was reversed two years later after then-mayor Richard Daley called it the ""silliest ordinance"" ever passed in the city.

"Seven people were killed when a tram derailed near to Sandilands tram stop in November 2016 The driver of a tram that crashed in Croydon and killed seven people will not face prosecution for manslaughter. More than 50 people were injured when the tram derailed near Sandilands tram stop in south London in November 2016. Driver Alfred Dorris will not face action due to a lack of evidence, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. Corporate manslaughter charges will also not be brought against Transport for London (TfL) or the operator Tram Operations Ltd. Prosecutors said the available evidence ""does not support a prosecution"". Sixty-nine passengers were on the tram when it overturned on the morning of 9 November 2016. When it came off the tracks, before dawn and in heavy rain, the tram was travelling at almost four times the line's speed limit. The official report into the crash concluded Mr Dorris, then aged 42,probably dozed off moments before the tram left the tracks. Mark Smith, Dane Chinnery, Phil Seary and Dorota Rynkiewicz (l-r) all died in the crash The CPS agreed that driver fatigue was ""by far the most likely explanation of what happened"" but said ""it is clear that this was an unintended and involuntary act"". ""There was no compelling evidence that the driver had done anything which he ought to have known could adversely affect his concentration or make him susceptible to falling asleep,"" they said. The seven people killed in the crash were Dane Chinnery, 19, Philip Logan, 52, Philip Seary, 57, Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, and Robert Huxley, 63, all from New Addington, and Mark Smith, 35 and Donald Collett, 62, both from Croydon. Jenny Hopkins, head of the CPS special crime and counter terrorism division, said investigators ""fully recognise the impact this decision will have on families who have lost their loved ones"". Philip Logan (left), Donald Collett (centre) and Robert Huxley (right), also died On social media Tracy Angelo, daughter of Donald Collett who died in the crash, called the decision ""absolutely outrageous"". In a comment on Facebook she said: ""As a family we are disgusted in this decision that we have patiently waited almost 3 years for! There were so so many lives impacted that day."" Danielle Whetter, Philip Logan's granddaughter, said her family were planning to appeal the decision. The CPS said there was no evidence for bringing corporate manslaughter charges as it found no defects in either the tram or the track which could have caused the derailment. Det Supt Gary Richardson, of British Transport Police, said ""every scrap of possible evidence has been scrutinised"". ""We know that this latest update may not be the news that many, including the family members who lost loved ones, had hoped for,"" he added. TfL receives 87 claims over tram crash Tram crash was preventable, says widow Croydon tram crash: Who were the victims? Finn Brennan, ASLEF's organiser on Croydon Tramlink, called Mr Dorris ""one of the many victims of this terrible incident"" which he said was caused ""by a lack of adequate safety systems"". Jonathan Fox, TfL's director for rail and sponsored services, said the company ""continue to do everything we can to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again"". ""We have introduced additional safety measures on the tram network and are implementing all of the recommendations made by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch,"" he said Sixty-nine passengers were travelling on the tram when it overturned Details about an inquest into the crash are expected to be announced next week. A civic ceremony will take place in New Addington on 9 November to mark the third anniversary of the crash.

"Ross England was selected to stand for the Welsh Conservatives for the 2021 assembly election The Conservative Party has denied knowledge of Ross England's involvement in a rape trial collapse before he was selected as a candidate. Mr England was accused by a Crown Court judge of deliberately sabotaging the trial in April 2018, by making claims about the victim's sexual history. The defendant, James Hackett, was convicted following a retrial. Sources had told BBC Wales the party knew about his involvement, but the Welsh party chairman denied this. In the first of two statements issued on Thursday evening, Lord Davies of Gower said the party only became aware of the ""full extent of the proceedings"" when Hackett's appeal process ended earlier this month. He said: ""We were fully aware that Ross England was involved as a witness in a sensitive case. We are also aware of the responsibility we have as employers. ""Since the end of the Appeal Court case, we have now been made aware of the full extent of the proceedings."" In a second statement, he said he could ""categorically state"" that he and Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns were ""completely unaware of the details of the collapse of this trial until they became public this week"". Mr England used to work for Mr Cairns in the Vale of Glamorgan, and was selected as the party's candidate to fight for the constituency seat at the 2021 Welsh assembly elections. Mr Cairns also told BBC Wales he only became aware of Mr England's role in the trial's collapse when the story broke earlier this week. The party has suspended Mr England as a candidateand an employee and a full investigation will be conducted. He has said he acted honestly during the aborted trial, and was not aware that any evidence had been ruled inadmissible. Speaking to BBC Wales on Thursday, one Conservative Party source said they called the party's Cardiff headquarters on the day the trial collapsed to inform management that Mr England's actions had led to that happening. Tory assembly candidate 'sabotaged' rape trial PM faces calls to sack Tory candidate in trial row Rape trial 'sabotage' Tory candidate suspended He had been giving evidence at the trial of his friend, when he claimed to have had a casual sexual relationship with the victim, which she denies. The judge Stephen Hopkins QC stopped the trial, asking Mr England: ""Why did you say that, are you completely stupid?"" The judge continued: ""You have managed single-handed, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trialâ¦ get out of my court."" The judge added he would be writing to Mr England's political allies in the hope they would take ""appropriate action"". This video can not be played A rape victim says Ross England had a ""formulated plan"" to wreck the trial of her attacker A separate source told BBC Wales: ""Richard Minshull [Director, Welsh Conservatives] got a letter around this timeframe about Ross because the party were his employer. ""Whether this letter was from the judge or not, I'm not sure, but he was certainly speaking with both Alun [Cairns - Welsh Secretary] and Byron [Lord Davies, chairman of the Welsh Conservatives] regularly regarding 'what to do about Ross.'"" The victim has told BBC Wales that ""people in Conservative HQ know... I know that Alun Cairns knows what he did in court and they knew by that evening. ""Therefore for them to make him a candidate in their target seat for the Welsh assembly proves to me how little respect they have for me, how little respect they have for the criminal justice system."" Ross England speaking at Welsh Conservative conference in 2016 After three days of virtual silence, two statements from the Welsh Conservatives in two hours. The last emphatic in its denial that neither Lord Davies, the party chair, nor Alun Cairns, the Welsh Secretary had any knowledge of the details of the collapsed rape trial until they were reported in the media this week. The party will hope this draws a line under a hugely damaging row, just as they're about to embark on a general election campaign. In April 2018, Ross England was working for the party when a Crown Court judge accused him of deliberately sabotaging a rape trial, precipitating a retrial. The party say they were ""fully aware"" he was a witness in a sensitive trial and of their responsibility as an employer. If, despite that full awareness, his employers did not realise for 18 months he'd caused the collapse of a criminal trial and been thrown out of court by the judge, it raises fundamental questions about supervision, vetting and candidate selection processes. Mr Cairns has previously endorsed Mr England as a ""friend and colleague"" with whom ""it will be a pleasure to campaign"". On Thursday, he said he only became aware of the collapse of the trial ""some considerable time afterwards and had no knowledge of the role of Ross England"". Lord Davies said ""continued speculation from an unspecified source"" about what party officials or elected representatives knew was ""unhelpful"". He also said ""at no time"" had any party officials received any correspondence in relation to the matter. ""As soon as it came to my attention, we acted immediately,"" he added. ""As chairman of the Welsh Conservative Party, I take all allegations concerning members, officials and elected representatives extremely seriously.""

Kellinu Portelli, 54, from Leckwith, Cardiff, had been suffering from low blood oxygen levels during the trek and was being monitored by his guide. On Monday evening he attended a festival with local people before going to bed but a guide found him dead at the base camp on Tuesday morning. He had been raising money for a cancer charity after losing his mother-in-law and a close friend to the disease. The engineer, known as Kell, had messaged friends and family on WhatsApp to say he was feeling better after receiving medical treatment. His wife of 30 years Donna, 51, said: ""I said to him just be careful and he said 'I will be careful I promise'."" Mount Everest is 8,848m (29,000ft) tall She said she and their children, aged 26 and 20, were waiting for a post-mortem examination to be carried out. ""Kell was a real family man and he adored his grandson Luca,"" she said. ""He had been Facetiming us from Nepal and would be crying down the phone. He was such an emotional man and he'd cry because he missed us. ""But he was having a great time over there, he told his daughter it was a life-changing experience."" Mrs Portelli said her husband had been a keen member of Les Croupiers running club. ""When he was 40 he was quite overweight so took up running and exercise became a massive part of him,"" she said. ""He had completed seven marathons, loads of 10ks and other events and would always do Parkrun.""

"This video can not be played The moment US House votes for impeachment inquiry The US House of Representatives has passed a resolution to formally proceed with the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. The measure details how the inquiry will move into a more public phase. It was not a vote on whether the president should be removed from office. This was the first test of support in the Democratic-controlled House for the impeachment process. The White House condemned the vote, which passed along party lines. Only two Democrats - representing districts that Mr Trump won handily in 2016 - voted against the resolution, along with all Republicans, for a total count of 232 in favour and 196 against. The resolution also sets out due process rights for Mr Trump's lawyers under the congressional inquiry. The Republican president is accused of trying to pressure Ukraine into investigating unsubstantiated corruption claims against his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son who worked with Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Mr Trump denies wrongdoing. The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Republicans have criticised Democrats for the closed hearings - in which Republican lawmakers have also taken part. But Democrats insist they were needed to gather evidence ahead of the public stage of the investigation, and deny allegations they have been secretive. The resolution moves the inquiry to a new phase, which could eventually see articles of impeachment recommended against Mr Trump. If that happened, and the House voted to pass the articles, a trial would be held in the Senate. Republicans have been clamouring for weeks for the Democrats to hold a full vote that will formalise the impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. Now they got one. It won't alter the dynamic in Washington, however. Republicans will continue to object to what they see as an unfair process with a preordained result. Democrats will push ahead with an investigation that they always intended would culminate in dramatic public hearings and (perhaps) an impeachment vote. This doesn't mean that Thursday's proceedings are meaningless, however. For the first time since 1998, the House is taking a significant step toward impeaching a president. The resolution gives the public some idea what to expect in the days ahead - including lots of Intelligence Committee sparring between Democrats and Republicans, a look at the transcripts from some of the high-profile witness depositions already conducted and, at some point, a formal report that could serve as the basis of articles of impeachment. It's not exactly uncharted territory in US history, but the course being set leads toward a historic clash with the presidency at stake. In the first stage, the House Intelligence Committee will hold public hearings in the coming weeks. It will have the right to make public transcripts of depositions taken in private. This video can not be played Trump impeachment: Last week was the most dramatic so far In the second stage, a public report on the findings will be sent to the House Judiciary Committee which will conduct its own proceedings and report on ""such resolutions, articles of impeachment, or other recommendations as it deems proper"". President Trump's lawyers will be allowed to take part in the Judiciary Committee stage. Republicans will be able to subpoena documents or witnesses although they could still be blocked as both panels are controlled by Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is the most senior elected Democrat, said the procedures would allow lawmakers to decide whether to impeach Trump ""based on the truth"". ""I don't know why the Republicans are afraid of the truth,"" she added. But House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy argued that Democrats are trying to remove Trump ""because they are scared they cannot defeat him at the ballot box"" in next year's presidential election. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement: ""Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats have done nothing more than enshrine unacceptable violations of due process into House rules.""

At the heart of the investigation, which was announced by Mrs Pelosi last month, is a phone call on 25 July between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry last month A rough transcript of the call shows Mr Trump asking for an investigation into the Bidens. Joe Biden is a frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination ahead of next year's presidential election.

The aide corroborated last week's testimony by Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, that Mr Trump had tried to use his office to prod Ukraine into investigating Mr Biden.

Meanwhile,House investigators have invited former US National Security Adviser John Bolton to testifyon 7 November. Mr Bolton's lawyer said his client was not willing to appear voluntarily. No subpoena requiring him to testify has been issued so far. Mr Bolton had angrily referred to alleged White House political pressure on Ukraine as ""a drug deal"", according to US media.

"Measles has a devastating impact on the body's immune system that could make it harder to fight infections for years, a pair of studies show. The virus can cause ""immune amnesia"" - meaning the body forgets how to fight bugs it once knew how to beat. Measles also resets the immune system to a ""baby-like"" state, compromising its ability to devise ways of tackling new infections. Experts said the findings showed the importance of vaccination. Measles is a virus that initially causes a runny nose, sneezing and fever. A few days later it leads to a blotchy rash that starts off on the face and spreads across the body. Most people will recover, but measles can cause life-long disability. It can be deadly, especially if it causes pneumonia in the lungs or encephalitis (swelling in the brain). It is estimated that 110,000 people die from measles each year around the world. A rash is the most obvious symptom of a measles infection The findings were based on detailed analysis of unvaccinated children in an Orthodox Protestant community in the Netherlands. Blood samples were taken from the children, and then again two months after a measles outbreak in 2013. Research groups in the United States, UK and Netherlands were analysing the samples to assess the impact of measles on the immune system. The focus was on antibodies - the tiny proteins that stick to foreign invaders - and the white blood cells that make them. The immune system has a memory of the hostile invaders it has fought off before. Part of this memory is kept in memory B-cells, which are a type of immune cell that has specialised in producing just one type of antibody. But the measles virus can infect and destroy these cells, causing ""immune amnesia"". Researchers at Harvard Medical School looked at blood samples from 77 children. They used a tool, called VirScan, that is like a fancy fishing rod that can catch thousands of different types of antibodies. It allowed the team to build up an incredibly detailed picture of the children's immune system before and after a measles infection. Antibodies are tiny Y-shaped proteins that can stick to the surface of bacteria and viruses Results,published in the journal Science,external, showed the children lost 20% of their repertoire of antibodies on average. One child, who had a severe measles infections, lost 73% of the types of antibody they could produce. ""Measles is like the first 10 years of an untreated HIV infection compressed into a few weeks - that's the kind of immunological memory damage,"" Dr Michael Mina told the BBC. Not every antibody matters. An antibody might be one (of the huge number) that do very little, but another might completely neutralise a microscopic intruder. ""If you delete that one then you've got a problem,"" Prof Stephen Elledge told the BBC. Essentially, it is a game of chance but the more antibodies that get wiped out, the greater the chance of hitting a crucial one. And without it, your body may be vulnerable to infection once again. This video can not be played Jo Walton: 'My daughter's life was destroyed by measles' This was borne out in the study with one particularly well-known antibody (for neutralising respiratory syncytial virus) disappearing in some children. Prof Elledge said measles was even more dangerous than people realised, as there could be ""five times or more indirect deaths due to immune amnesia"" than the initial infection caused. The researchers think the biggest problem is in sub-Saharan Africa where malnourished children are more likely to have larger swathes of their immune system wiped out. The studies have not been done to prove this, but the US team fear the figure could exceed 90% of the antibodies. ""Those are the ones we think are the greatest concern,"" said Dr Mina. As well as memory B-cells there are naive B-cells and it is the latter we rely on to fight off something new. ""They are the armour underneath,"" said Dr Velislava Petrova, from the Sanger Institute said. Her study,published in Science Immunology,external, looked at 26 children and also showed that measles can wipe out the memory of previous infections. But the research also showed the virus had an effect on the naive B-cells too. These cells have their DNA rearranged - a process called somatic recombination - so the immune system can produce a diverse array of back-up antibodies. The hope is one of them will work against a new infection. Babies start off making a very narrow range of antibodies, which become more and more varied with age. Measles hits the reset button so the immune system only has a limited range of antibodies to work with. Dr Petrova said: ""The measles virus removed immune memory cells that are created in response to other pathogens they had seen before. ""They also returned the immune system back to a baby-like state where they have limited ability to respond to new pathogens."" The pair of studies focused only on the immediate aftermath of a measles infection. However, the research was partially inspired by astudy that came out in 2015,external, which provides some clues to what happens in the long term. It looked at patterns in causes of death in rich countries and showed that children were more likely to die for two-to-three years after a measles infection. Those results suggest it may take that long for the immune system to fully recover. The timescales may be different in poorer countries where diseases spread more readily, the researchers suggest. There are two answers to this question, and they are both vaccination. Being immunised against measles, often through the MMR jab, almost eliminates the risk of catching measles. But if somebody's immune system is devastated by measles then the researchers suggest they may need to have their childhood vaccines again. ""Revaccination against polio might not seem important in the UK or US, but in Afghanistan (one of the few places where the disease is still endemic) then you might want to vaccinate again,"" said Dr Mina. Yes. The study looked only at antibodies and the B-cells that produce them, but there are also equally important memory T-cells. Measles can infected these T-cells too, but the studies have not yet been done on what happens to them. ""We do have really interesting anecdotal evidence suggesting the T-cell response would be affected in a very similar way,"" said Dr Mina. Prof Arne Akbar, president of the British Society for Immunology, said the studies were ""elegant and thorough"". He highlighted the ""crucial"" finding that the MMR vaccine, which contains a weakened measles virus, did not cause immune amnesia. ""It is doubly important to make sure you and your children are vaccinated against measles,"" he said. Liam Sollis, from Unicef UK, said: ""With vaccination rates in the UK falling and recently losing our measles-free status, an outbreak is now a ticking time bomb. ""Vaccines are the safest and most effective preventative measures against highly infectious disease.""

"John Bercow is standing down as Commons Speaker on Thursday after 10 years in the job. His idiosyncratic turn of phrase and distinctive bellow - as he tries to silence the wall of sound emanating from MPs - has made him something of a cult figure on social media. His catchphrase, in fact the traditional cry of Commons speakers through the centuries, is ""Order!"", often elongated and twisted into an extraordinary sound that is all his own. To mark his retirement, the BBC has analysed 100 years of Hansard - the official Parliamentary record - to discover just how different he was to any previous occupant of the chair. The first thing we discovered is that he has said ""Order!"" nearly 14,000 times. But that is just the beginning of the Bercow story in statistics. This video can not be played John Bercow's most memorable moments as Speaker of the House We know John Bercow enjoys a rhetorical flourish, and often intervenes in rowdy Commons debates to deliver withering put-downs to backbench barrackers. But measuring the number of words spoken by the Speaker compared with all words spoken in Commons debates shows an extraordinary willingness to enter the Parliamentary fray compared with his predecessors. It is hard to know for sure whether this is because he has presided over more debates, taking - and providing detailed responses to - more points of order, or because he has a particularly unruly gaggle of MPs to keep in check, or whether he simply likes to talk, but the difference is striking. Not only does Mr Bercow speak more than previous Commons Speakers, his choice of words often stands out. One MP,quoted by the New York Times,external, said: ""It's as if he goes to bed every night, reads a thesaurus, inwardly digests it and then spews it out the next day."" There are many words the Speaker used that have not been uttered by any of his predecessors, certainly since 1916 - the earliest date that transcripts of debates are available on the House of Commons website. Excluding words that make up the names of people or government departments, these are the ones he said most frequently. Other words Mr Bercow has used that other MPs have said extremely rarely, or never, include: ""Demosthenian"", ""Einsteinian"", ""Flaubert"", ""Heidegger"", ""irascibility"", ""jackanapes"", ""rhapsodise"", ""susurrations"" and ""testicle"". Who is John Bercow? Nine MPs make pitch for Bercow's job Effigy of John Bercow to be set alight at bonfire In policy terms, Mr Bercow's time in office was defined by one issue. Counting the number of times particular words are used in Commons debates shows how this is true. His interventions on procedure during Brexit debates were both controversial and pivotal, and are likely to be the most important part of his legacy. Allowing backbench MPs to take control of debate, in order to pass Labour MP Hillary Benn's bill to take no-deal off the table, was just one example. It might seem like a small thing, but a noticeable shift in tone occurred under Mr Bercow's watch. Applauding other MPs in Commons debates used to be strictly forbidden, and there are no recorded instances of applause in the Commons until the then-Speaker Betty (later Baroness) Boothroyd announced her decision to stand down in 2000. Even as recently as 2015, Mr Bercowtold SNP MPs, many of whom were new to the Commons, to ""show some respect"" for the convention forbidding applause. A year later, he said: ""If, spontaneously, a large group of Members bursts into applause, sometimes the most prudent approach is to let it take its course. However, I would much prefer it if it did not happen."" MPs took note of the first part of the ruling, at least.

"A Â£100,000 grant given to a company owned by a US businesswoman - who is at the centre of conflict of interest claims against the PM - is ""appropriate"", the government says. The grant given to Jennifer Arcuri's firm Hacker House was reviewed after the claims were reported last month. Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan said the review found ""no impropriety in the awarding of the grant"". The PM insists he followed proper procedures and did nothing wrong. Ms Arcuri has said she had never discussed sponsorship or grants with Boris Johnson and he had nothing to do with the awarding of the Â£100,000 grant from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport in February this year. Jennifer Arcuri: What's the story about? Boris Johnson denies wrongdoing over Arcuri link The government review followed areport in the Sunday Times,externalthat Ms Arcuri - who knew Mr Johnson when he was London mayor - joined trade missions he led and received thousands of pounds in sponsorship grants. It said that among cash Ms Arcuri received was a grant from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport intended for ""English-based"" businesses. It was awarded earlier this year, but Ms Arcuri had moved back to the US in June 2018. The newspaper said it had found the registered address on the grant application form was a rented house in the UK and no longer connected to Ms Arcuri. The newspaper's report also prompted an investigation by the police watchdog, which is ongoing. The Independent Office of Police Conduct is deciding whether to investigate the prime minister for a potential criminal offence of misconduct in public office while he was London mayor, between 2008 and 2016, when he also had oversight of the Metropolitan Police. A separate inquiry by the London Assembly into alleged conflicts of interest has been paused until the watchdog's probe is concluded. The Government Internal Audit Agency review,externalfound that Hacker House had not met one of the initial requirements that the amount of funding sought should ""not exceed 50% of the lead applicant organisation's annual collective income"". The review also found that criminal record checks had not been carried out. But because of the low number of applications, these initial requirements were waived. The review concluded that ""the assessment of eligibility and subsequent reduced grant award to Hacker House Ltd was appropriate"". In an accompanying letter to DCMS select committee chairman Damian Collins, Ms Morgan pointed out that the grant decision did not involve ministers, and was made at a time when Mr Johnson was a backbench MP. ""I would like to emphasise again that any notion that the prime minister or his advisers influenced - whether directly or indirectly - any aspect of the due diligence, assessment or award of any grant funding made through the CSIIF (Cyber Skills Immediate Impact Fund) is simply not true,"" she wrote. ""The grant application in October 2018 and grant decision in February 2019 were, of course, at a time when the current prime minister was neither a member of the government nor the Mayor of London."" On the question of Hacker House's address, Ms Morgan said the company was UK registered, but that this was ""not a requirement of the grant"". Jennifer Arcuri: What's the story about?

"Richard Binkhorst found Holly after she ran from the crash site 16 days ago A missing dog has been reunited with her owner 16 days after fleeing from a car crash. Holly, the 18-month-old Springer spaniel, was flung from the wreckage following the crash on 14 October. Her owner Amanda Henry was seriously injured in the crash, on the Minishant to Crosshill road in Ayrshire. Holly was the last of three dogs to be found after the secure cage they were travelling in was thrown from the car and burst open. While two of the dogs were quickly recovered by a local farmer, Holly ran from the accident, prompting a widespread appeal to find and reunite her with her family. Holly was travelling in a secured cage when the crash happened Teams had been searching the area near the crash site after Holly was spotted by volunteers with thermal imaging scopes and trail cameras. However, she evaded capture, moving from place to place. Ms Henry confirmed on Wednesday that Holly had been found safe and well by a close friend. Holly, far right, and her two siblings Richard Binkhorst said he rescued the dog after finding her hiding spot and lying on his hands and knees to coax her out. He said: ""The dog knows me well, but it still requires a lot of trust for her to let me come close in the state she was in."" Mr Binkhorst said Holly was already settling back into her home and was due to visit the vet for a check-up, but was in ""surprisingly decent shape"". He added: ""Many people from the area, and further afield, have been keeping an eye out and helping search the area. ""There's been volunteers with drones out, people distributing posters, local farmers allowing us to search their properties and use their fields. The support has been overwhelming. "" Ms Henry, 47, from Maybole in Ayrshire, was taken to hospital following the crash. She was treated for a fractured spine and required 30 stitches in her head. She is still recovering but said on her Facebook page that she was ""feeling wonderful"" to have Holly home.

Jeremy Corbyn vowed to ""transform"" Britain by taking on ""the few who run a corrupt system"" as he kicked off Labour's election campaign. The party leader promised to ""rebuild"" public services and hit out at ""tax dodgers, dodgy landlords, bad bosses and big polluters"". In a speech, Mr Corbyn called the 12 December poll a ""once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country"". But Prime Minister Boris Johnson blamed Mr Corbyn for the delay to Brexit.

They'll throw everything at us because they know we're not afraid to take them on. ""So we're going after the tax dodgers. We're going after the dodgy landlords. We're going after the bad bosses. We're going after the big polluters. Because we know whose side we're on."" The December election was called for by the prime minister  and is taking place after Mr Corbyn agreed to it, following the EU's decision to delay Brexit. The Labour leader told the audience that, if elected prime minister, he would ""open negotiations with the EU about a sensible relationship with Europe"". This wasn't exactly a pitch for the centre ground by Jeremy Corbyn. His tone was uncompromising. It's designed in part - just like in 2017 - to enthuse younger voters and previous non-voters, convincing them that politics can make a difference. But he is also searching for a message that might appeal beyond Brexit - to potential Labour voters in both Leave and Remain areas. Labour launched its election campaign in the London seat of Battersea. It doggedly campaigned here in 2017, and won narrowly - it now leads the Conservatives by just 2,416 votes. It's a reminder that the party will have to work hard to defend seats - as well as targets held by its opponents.

"MP Antoinette Sandbach, who was expelled from the parliamentary Conservative Party last month, has joined the Liberal Democrats. The Remain-voting Cheshire MP was among 21 rebels who lost the Tory whip after rebelling against Boris Johnson in a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit. She will stand as a Liberal Democrat candidate in her Eddisbury constituency in December's general election. Explaining her decision, she said the Tory Party had ""moved their values"". Her move makes her the eighth MP to have joined the Lib Dems this year. Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, she said she had considered not standing for re-election. ""Like many of the MPs that have stood down, I have been subjected to abuse."" ""It has been incredibly difficult for my family and for me. But this is a critical time in our nation's history,"" she said. Announcing her decision earlier, as campaigning got under way ahead of the 12 December election, Ms Sandbach said: ""People have a very clear choice. ""The Conservative Party offers years of uncertainty, whilst the Liberal Democrats will stop Brexit. ""I will stand on my strong local record, helping to secure local investment, fighting for fair funding for our schools and to secure additional funding in local health services. ""Our country deserves so much better than Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn."" MP receives death threat after no confidence vote PM readmits 10 Brexit rebels to Tory party Ms Sandbach was not among the 10 rebels readmitted to the party last month, shortly before the Commons backed the legislation to approve the 12 December election. Earlier this month, she lost a confidence vote among her local party members - she described it as ""symbolic"" but added that ""it most likely means that I am not going to be the Conservative candidate in the next election"". Contesting her Eddisbury seat as a Conservative candidate in 2017, Ms Sandbach won a near-12,000 majority over Labour, with the Lib Dem candidate third with 2,804 votes. She was among 19 former Tories who backed the prime minister's Brexit deal legislation last week but voted against his proposed three-day timetable for it to be considered in the Commons ahead of the original Brexit deadline of 31 October. Speaking after joining the Lib Dems, she said she was concerned Mr Johnson's deal was ""a trap door to a no-deal Brexit"". She follows MPs Sarah Wollaston, Philip Lee and Sam Gyimah to become the fifth ex-Tory to join the Lib Dems in recent months.

"Just a day after the President of Chile said his country could no longer hold the world's annual climate conference, Spain has offered to host it in Madrid. The critical meeting, called COP25, was due to take place in Santiago for two weeks from 3 December. Chilean President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era said his government needed ""to prioritise re-establishing public order"" after serious anti-government protests. Spain's offer will be considered by the UN's climate body next week. The Spanish government said it considered multilateral action on climate change to be a priority for the UN. The annual Conference of the Parties (COP) is usually an important moment for taking stock of where the world stands on climate change. For a quarter of a century, negotiators from almost 200 countries have gathered to try to advance a global strategy for tackling rising temperatures. However, COP25 has become a problem with country after country finding reasons not to host. COP25 was originally supposed to be held in Brazil. But in November last year, just two months after being announced as the summit's host nation, then President-elect Jair Bolsonaro pulled out. Chile cancels global climate summit amid unrest The far-right leader said this was due to the change of government and budget restrictions, according to local media. However, he had recently chosen a foreign minister who claimed ""climate alarmism"" was just a plot by ""cultural Marxists"". A month later, Chile was selected to host the climate conference instead. Costa Rica, the other frontrunner, withdrew because of the costs involved in hosting. With tens of thousands of delegates making plans to travel to Chile for the meeting, the abrupt cancellation on Wednesday by President PiÃ±era was a real shock. Citing the need for public safety, he withdrew his country's offer to host both the COP and the Apec meeting, where President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping were due to meet. Many involved in climate negotiations presumed that the meeting would take place in Bonn, Germany, home to the UNFCCC secretariat, at some point in the near future. Now, according to a statement from acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Spain has volunteered Madrid as an alternative location. The Chileans have accepted and are recommending it to the UN. It seems that Chile will still hold the presidency of the COP but it will simply be held in Spain, if the UNFCCC agrees. There is a precedent for this approach, with the 2017 COP23 held in Bonn, but it was presided over by Fiji. Around 25,000 people are expected to attend the summit. One of the most celebrated is Greta Thunberg who had crossed the ocean by yacht in order to travel to Chile in the most low-carbon manner. She is now in Los Angeles - it remains to be seen if she will be able to get to Madrid on time if the Spanish capital is accepted as the new home of COP25. Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aid's global climate lead, said: ""It's a shame that COP25 won't be held in Latin America to highlight some of the grave climate impacts that affect the region. ""But hopefully a Madrid summit will be able to keep those in mind. Credit should be given to the Spanish government for offering to help at such short notice considering these often take more than a year to organise.

"Nigel Farage says there needs to be ""some kind of alliance"" between the Tories and the Brexit Party for the upcoming election. Reports have suggested Mr Farage's party would stand down hundreds of election candidates for December's poll to stop a split in the pro-Brexit vote. The Conservatives have consistently ruled out a formal pact with the party. It comes after President Donald Trump said Mr Farage and Boris Johnson shouldteam up as ""an unstoppable force"". The Brexit Party's launch for its official election campaign has just begun and Mr Farage is expected to announce the party's strategy. Chairman of the party, Richard Tice, said: ""We have a major role to play in the outcome of this general election."" The Brexit Party's MEP for the North West of England, Claire Fox, said she was ""really excited by this election because voters can take centre stage again"". In August,Mr Farage tweeted,externalthe party had ""635 men and women from all walks of life who are prepared to fight a general election"". And in September, the party issued a list of 409 candidates standing in England, Scotland and Wales. LIVE: Brexit Party campaign launch No 10 defends Brexit deal after Trump criticism Corbyn launches Labour campaign to 'transform' UK Johnson and Corbyn: The odd couple? Mr Farage has been critical of Mr Johnson's failure to deliver on his promise that the UK would leave the EU on 31 October. But earlier this week,the Telegraph reported,externalthe Brexit Party was considering removing candidates to help the Conservatives win a majority of seats in 12 December's election to ensure the UK leaves the EU. Instead, it said, they would focus their energies on Labour-held seats which voted Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. Mr Farage called the reports ""idle speculation"". But speaking about his party's launch on Friday morning, he told LBC radio: ""Most of what I will be saying will be about Boris' deal and the need, in my view, for some kind of alliance."" He refused to comment on whether the Brexit Party would be fielding ""20 or 200 candidates"". On the other side of the Brexit debate,Remain-supporting parties have been negotiating electoral pacts in certain constituencies. The potential agreements would see the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru stand aside for each other to ensure the election of as many MPs who back a second Brexit referendum as possible. Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said it was ""no secret"" that the his party was ""talking to the Lib Dems and Plaid"" but ""nothing has been finalised"".

"The UK is gearing up to hold a general election on Thursday. These national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years. But this would be the third since 2015. A total of 650 people will be chosen asmembers of Parliament (MPs), to decide laws and policies. Members of Parliament are elected by voters to represent the interests of their constituency in the House of Commons. Most belong to a political party, but some do stand as independents. There are 650 MPs in the House. MPs are elected to the House of Commons, one of two chambers of Parliament in London, where the government is based. The government passes laws that help it run the country. This compares with local governments which deal with issues such as bin collections and schools in each area. In a general election, the UK's 46 million voters are invited to choose an MP for their area - one of 650 constituencies. Anyone aged 18 or over can vote, as long as they are registered and a British citizen or qualifying citizen of the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland. Older people are more likely than younger ones to vote. At the 2017 general election, 59% of 20- to 24-year-olds voted, compared with 77% of 60- to 69-year-olds. However, about two-thirds of the more than 3.1 million people who registered to vote between the election being called and the registration deadline were under the age of 35, with more than a million of them under 25. Voting takes place at local polling stations, set up in places such as churches and school halls. Voters put a cross on the ballot paper beside the name of their chosen candidate and drop it into a sealed ballot box. Most people over 18 on polling day can stand as a candidate - as long as they are a British citizen or a qualifying Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland citizen resident in the UK. They must also pay a Â£500 deposit, which will be lost if they do not get at least 5% of the votes in their constituency. Candidates must meet certain conditions - prisoners, civil servants, judges and members of the police and armed forces cannot stand. A total of 3,322 candidates are standing across the 650 seats this year. There are 91 Davids standing for election - the most popular name among the candidates - while the first female name on the list is Sarah in 18th place. There are 22 candidates with that first name standing. The candidate with the most votes in each constituency is elected, even if they are chosen by less than half the electorate in their seat. Most MPs represent a political party but some stand for election as independent candidates. Any party with more than half the MPs (326) in the Commons usually forms the government. Parties with well below 50% of the national vote can take power as a result of theUK's voting system. The UK uses a first past the post voting system. It means a local candidate who receives the most votes wins â and the party with the most winning candidates forms a government. So the overall number of votes parties get nationally does not have any bearing on who wins the election. If no party has a majority of MPs, the one with the most can form a coalition - or partnership - with one or more other parties to gain control. The prime minister is not directly voted for by the public. He or she is chosen by the winning party's MPs and appointed bythe Queen, who is duty bound to follow their advice. The Queen is the UKâs head of state, although she is not in charge of the government. Elizabeth II is the countryâs longest-serving monarch, having ascended to the throne in 1952. She performs state duties, which include formally opening Parliament, representing the country at events such as the annual Remembrance Day parade, and making official visits overseas. She is also head of the armed forces and Church of England. Detailed proposals for everything from the economy to defence and policing are set out before any general election inmanifestos. A manifesto is basically a brochure containing all of a party's ideas and policies. Manifestos are usually published during the general election campaign. If a party wins the election, it is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver as a government. These come from the UK's political parties - groups of people with similar political beliefs who come together to try to win power. The issues UK voters care most about have changed a lot, according to the polls. TheNational Health Service (NHS)and immigration were the things that most concerned voters in 2015. The National Health Service (NHS), which started in 1948, is the government-funded national healthcare service that provides free diagnosis and treatment for UK citizens. TheEuropean Union (EU)was of far less interest. European Union: the political and economic union of 28 member states, which the UK is planning to leave. Now, however,Brexit- the UK's departure from the EU - is a huge issue. Short for British exit - refers to the UK leaving the European Union. Neither the Conservative orLabourparties had enough votes to form a majority government after the 2017 election. The Labour Party was founded by the trade union movement in 1900 to give workers a voice in Parliament. It believes in the redistribution of wealth and opportunity, greater rights for working people and strong, state-run public services. The Conservatives were the bigger of the two parties and formed a partnership with the Democratic Unionist PartyDUPin order to win votes in the Commons. The Democratic Unionist Party was founded in 1971, during the time of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. As unionists, the DUP support Northern Ireland being part of the UK and are known for their socially conservative beliefs on abortion and same-sex marriage. After the 2017 election, DUP MPs helped keep the Conservatives in power by agreeing to support them in Commons votes. Since the election, the Conservatives and Labour have both lost MPs, while theLiberal Democratshave made gains. Often called the Lib Dems, the Liberal Democrats were formed in 1988 by the merger of one of Britain's oldest political institutions, the Liberal Party, which stood for free trade and individual liberty, and the Social Democratic Party, a centrist offshoot of the Labour Party. The party likes to see itself as being on the centre ground of British politics. Parliament's second chamber is theHouse of Lords. The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Parliament. It is independent from the House of Commons but shares with it the role of making laws, while it also checks the governmentâs work. Members are given a title, such as Lord, are not elected, do not represent constituencies and most do not belong to any party. Its members are not elected but are appointed by the Queen, on the prime minister's advice. On general election day, voting takes place between 07:00 and 22:00. The results are declared through the night and the following day. When the overall result is known, the leader of the winning party, if there is one, visits Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen for permission to form a new government. Once they have that, which is a formality, they return to the traditional home of the prime minister10 Downing Street. This terraced house is the official residence and office of the UK prime minister. Often they will stand outside to deliver a speech about their party's plans for the coming years.

"A potential successor, Abu al-Hasan al-Muhajir, was killed in an air strike hours after Baghdadi's death The jihadist group Islamic State (IS) has for the first time confirmed the death of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and named his successor. An IS outlet announced on the messaging service Telegram that Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurashi was the group's new leader and ""caliph"". US special forces tracked down Baghdadi in north-west Syria at the weekend and attacked his compound. The IS leader fled into a tunnel and killed himself with a suicide vest. The Iraqi had a $25m (Â£19m) bounty on his head and had been pursued by the US and its allies since the rise of IS five years ago. Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? What we know about the US raid IS also confirmed on Thursday the death of spokesman Abu al-Hasan al-Muhajir - who was killed in a joint operation in northern Syria by US and Syrian Kurdish forces hours after the one targeting Baghdadi. The Saudi national had been considered a potential successor. The new IS spokesman, Abu Hamza al-Qurashi, also called on Muslims to swear allegiance to Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi. Hashemi's name is not known to security forces, and is believed to be a nom de guerre. IS did not provide many details about the new leader or release a photo, but it did describe him as a ""prominent figure in jihad"". The statement also claimed Hashemi was a veteran jihadist fighter who had fought against the US in the past. With the name ""al-Qurashi"", the group also made clear that he claims to be descended from the Prophet Muhammad's Quraysh tribe - something generally held by pre-modern Sunni scholars as being a key qualification for becoming a caliph. Before the announcement, BBC jihadist media specialist Mina al-Lami said: ""If IS chooses to appoint someone who is not a Qurashi, then perhaps it is an implicit acknowledgement that the 'caliphate' is no more."" IS declared the creation of a ""caliphate"" - a state governed in accordance with Sharia, or Islamic law - after seizing control of huge swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014 and imposing its brutal rule on millions of civilians. It proclaimed Baghdadi as ""Caliph Ibrahim"" and demanded allegiance from Muslims worldwide. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself after US special forces found him in north-west Syria Despite the demise of its physical caliphate in March, IS remains a battle-hardened and well-disciplined force whose enduring defeat is not assured. The group still has between 14,000 and 18,000 ""members"" in Iraq and Syria, including up to 3,000 foreigners, according to a recent US report. In his statement, IS's new spokesman said the group's Shura Council met soon after Baghdadi's death was confirmed and pledged allegiance to Hashemi. The day before IS released the name of its new leader, the US military made public more information about the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a raid in Syria's Idlib province early on Sunday. In grainy footage, helicopters were seen firing at gunmen on the ground as they flew towards a compound where Baghdadi was hiding. On landing, US special forces commandos blew holes in the walls of the compound and called on Baghdadi to surrender, the military said. But he fled into a tunnel and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and two children he had taken with him. ""You can deduce what kind of person it is based on that activity,"" said the head of US Central Command, Gen Kenneth McKenzie. After the raid, the compound was destroyed in an air strike. This video can not be played The grainy footage shows troops closing in on the compound - and later an explosion destroying it Gen McKenzie said the destroyed buildings were left looking like ""a parking lot with large potholes"". He added that he could not confirm President Donald Trump's graphic description of Baghdadi whimpering and crying as he died.

"Labour MP Keith Vaz has been suspended from the Commons for six months after he was found to have ""expressed willingness"" to purchase cocaine for male prostitutes. MPs approved the recommendation from the Commons standards body, which released its report earlier this week. It said there was ""compelling evidence"" he offered to pay for a class A drug and had paid-for sex in August 2016. Mr Vaz said he was receiving treatment for a serious mental health condition. A statement issued by his office said Mr Vaz had cooperated at all stages of the inquiry and he had been admitted to hospital on Monday. He was not present in the Commons on Thursday. Labour's Keith Vaz faces six-month suspension Keith Vaz police investigation closed Keith Vaz - the 'Teflon politician' MP Keith Vaz 'bullied Commons clerks' Labour's Chief Whip Nick Brown told MPs his party accepted the suspension recommendation, saying it is a ""sad day for us"". Standards Committee chairwoman Kate Green said she had written to ask the leader of the House in the next Parliament to bring forward the suspension again, if Mr Vaz is re-elected, so that he would have to serve the full six months. Earlier, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Mr Vaz should stand aside as the Labour candidate for Leicester East, the seat he has held since 1987, in the 12 December election. ""I think he himself should agree not to be a candidate,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It has been a very sad issue, not just for him but for his family and his children."" When it was put to her that Mr Vaz had not had the Labour whip withdrawn, and still remained a member of the Parliamentary party, she replied: ""Not yet."" In a scathing report,externalthe committee said there was ""convincing evidence"" that Mr Vaz was ""evasive or unhelpful"" during an investigation into his conduct by Commons standards commissioners Kathryn Hudson and Kathryn Stone. A statement on Mr Vaz's website ""vigorously"" rejected this allegation and said he cooperated at ""all stages of this process"". ""He holds the standards system in the highest regard and with the highest respect,"" it said. The revelations, first reported by the Sunday Mirror, led to Mr Vaz standing down as chairman of the Home Affairs Select committee - which at the time was conducting an inquiry into drug policy. It was alleged the MP had met two men at his London flat to engage in paid-for sex, and that during this encounter - which was covertly recorded by one of the men - he offered to buy illegal drugs for a third person to use. In her report, the commissioner said the recording ""contains evidence of Mr Vaz's apparent willingness to purchase controlled drugs for others to use"". ""While his comments regarding this may not amount to a criminal offence, he shows disregard for the law and that, in turn, is disrespectful to the House and fellow members, who collectively are responsible for making those laws."" At the time, Mr Vaz said he had met the men to discuss the redecoration of his flat. But the cross-party committee said Mr Vaz's characterisation of the meeting - in which he reportedly posed as a washing machine salesman - was ""not believable and ludicrous"". The MP's claim during the inquiry that his drink may have been spiked and that he had since suffered memory loss about the incident were ""not relevant"", the report found.

"Facebook says it will fact-check ads posted by one political candidate in California, after previously saying it would not do so for politicians. In September, the social network said it would not subject politicians or candidates to fact-checking. To test the policy, Californian Adriel Hampton registered as a candidate and tried to run a misleading ad. But Facebook blocked the ad and said Mr Hampton had ""registered as a candidate to get around our policies"". In September,Facebook clarified its fact-checking policyand said it would treat all posts by politicians as ""newsworthy content"" that should ""be seen and heard"". Critics said the move would give politicians complete freedom to create deliberately misleading advertisements that could be promoted to millions of people on the social network. In October, Facebook's chief executiveMark Zuckerberg was questionedby US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez about the policy. She asked whether she would be allowed to run ads on Facebook falsely claiming that Republican candidates had backed the ""Green New Deal"" environmental policy. ""I think probably,"" said Mr Zuckerberg. Mr Hampton, who runs a digital media agency, was inspired to create exactly such an advertisement. In the ad, footage of US senator Lindsey Graham was edited to look like he was speaking in support of the Green New Deal. It was posted on the Facebook page for a political campaign group called The Really Online Lefty League (Troll). The ad falsely claims senator Lindsey Graham supports the Green New Deal Facebook eventually took the advert down. Mr Hampton posted on Twitter, asking whether any US politician would run the false ad to test Facebook's policy. He then announced he had registered to stand in an election for governor of California and would try to run a false ad himself. But Facebook said in a statement: ""This person has made clear he registered as a candidate to get around our policies, so his content, including ads, will continue to be eligible for third-party fact-checking."" Mr Hampton said: ""Apparently, it's only OK to lie on Facebook if you don't tell them you're lying."" On Wednesday, Twitter announced it would be banning political advertising globally. Chief executive Jack Dorsey said the reach of political messages ""should be earned, not bought"". But Conservative MP Damian Collins, who is chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee investing fake news and disinformation online, said the move could have unintended consequences.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Whose side are you on?"" At first glance, Labour's campaign launch appeared like a replay of its 2017 election launch. Back then, Jeremy Corbyn attacked vested interests - and pledged that his party would be battling for the many not the few. Businessman Mike Ashley has had the honour - if that's the word - of featuring in Labour's rogues' gallery of ""bad bosses"" in both the 2017 general election campaign launch and again today. But the tone, if anything, is more strident now. Channelling the left-wing folk singer Pete Seeger, the Labour leader repeatedly - and rhetorically - asked his audience whose side they were on. He made it clear his party was against ""dodgy landlords"", big polluters, tax dodgers, rich media magnates. It looks like this will be something of an insurrectionary campaign. Corbyn launches Labour campaign to 'transform' UK Partly, this is to inoculate the party against the Conservative charge that it is siding with the political class against the people on Brexit - causing ""dither and delay"". So Jeremy Corbyn is trying to get his retaliation in first - by arguing it is Boris Johnson and Tories' financial backers who are really part of a privileged elite. But Labour's tone is a form of attack as well as defence. As in 2017, Labour is aiming to win over younger voters and those who rarely vote - and who need to be convinced that politics can make a difference. Hence the clear blue - or red - water between Labour and their opponents. Labour is hoping to focus voters' minds on non-Brexit issues And it's part of a wider strategy to try to appeal to potential Labour voters beyond the Brexit debate. Jeremy Corbyn for some time has argued that while working class voters may be divided on the EU, they can be united in support of better working conditions, fairer taxes, and more investment in public services. The strategy is to try almost to divorce Brexit from the other issues, arguing that can be settled further down the line in a referendum with a ""credible"" Leave option and Remain on the ballot. In Leave areas - where Labour is seriously worried about suffering losses - the hope is that however much the party's voters or ex-voters want Brexit done, they will prioritise other issues directly affecting their lives. So, Labour strategists believe it is essential on the wider non Brexit agenda to have as distinctive a message as possible. Now, some Labour MPs argue that - with circumstances rather different now than in 2017 -  Labour could have played this election differently. With an exodus of former Remainers from the Conservative ranks, technically the party could have blurred its more radical edge - don't forget, in 2017, the leadership claimed their manifesto's policies were in the tradition of mainstream European social democracy - and made a pitch for the centre ground, But that is unlikely to have passed the authenticity test with Jeremy Corbyn at the helm. Labour did better than many expected in 2017 And some in Labour's ranks have been saying privately that the uncompromising messaging and the forthcoming radical manifesto are designed to shore up, rather than greatly expand, the Labour contingent in Parliament. After all, the campaign launch was in Battersea - a marginal they hope to hold, rather than a seat they aspire to win. Policies that will motivate the party's foot soldiers will help in the defence of some seats won by very slim majorities last time round. And there are sophisticated methods being deployed by the left-wing group Momentum to move activists around to where they are most needed. There are, of course, different measures of what winning looks like. For Boris Johnson an overall majority is essential. If Labour, though, can become not outright winners but the largest party in a hung Parliament, it could very likely form a minority government with tacit support from the SNP and, possibly, the Liberal Democrats in order to deliver a new EU referendum. But, of course, Jeremy Corbyn insists he is fighting to win and that most opinion polls are probably as misleading now as they were two and a half years ago. And that even more now than then, middle as well as working-class voters do not feel, in their day-to-day lives, that austerity is over - whatever spending pledges are being made by the prime minister. So the potential reservoir of support could be greater than the current state of the polls suggest. But some challenges lie ahead for Labour - including how far the Brexit issue really can be contained within a ""cordon sanitaire"". And there remains a question - whatever the rhetoric - about just how radical Labour will be. Will a conference policy on abolishing private schools, and another on extending the free movement, really make it in to the manifesto? This is an election many Labour MPs didn't appear to want, with widespread abstentions in Tuesday evening's vote. But some of those closest to Jeremy Corbyn were champing at the bit for an election. They believe if Labour are currently being seen as also-rans, opponents will become complacent and in the end - however radical the party's message - progressive centre-left voters will be forced to back them if they want to stop Boris Johnson. In this election, though, there is no such thing as a sure thing.

"The UK's two main political parties are further apart in terms of policy than they have been for aeons. Labour and the Conservatives have entirely different priorities, and completely contrasting solutions for the country's problems, particularly on how to resolve the political deadlock and frustration of Brexit. This will not be an election where even the most fed up voter could credibly make the charge ""they're all the same"". But here's something strange, even though it would make them and their supporters splutter and rage, they actually have rather a lot in common. Corbyn launches Labour campaign to 'transform' UK But hold on, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn do seem to be bound together by some similar traits - they are the political odd couple of 2019. They've both been rebels in their own party, unwilling to toe the line, both with a habit of saying what they think. That sounds pretty straightforward but, trust me, it's not always that common in politics. And part of that habit of being direct has included very public criticisms of their party bosses before they made it to that perch themselves. The Labour leader is adored by his supporters Whether that was Mr Corbyn's campaigning against the Iraq War and much of Tony Blair's government, or Boris Johnson's years of provoking David Cameron when he was king across the water in London's City Hall, long before he was lurking behind Theresa May's shoulder. Both men have also been written off by their Westminster colleagues on plenty of occasions. The long guerrilla war between Jeremy Corbyn and his backbenchers has been one of the central features of his time in the job, but he has survived in the role for four and a half years despite multiple moments when it was predicted he would be off. Boris Johnson too was judged, not that long ago, by many of his Westminster colleagues to be a busted flush. But he built a campaign machine in the Commons that vaulted him into Number 10. The Conservative leader is also a big hit with his party faithful The two party leaders also share the kind of adulation from activists that is deeply rare in politics. In the room in south London where Mr Corbyn launched his campaign this morning you could almost touch and feel the personal devotion to him that some Labour members feel. It's the same feeling that you sense when the prime minister is in front of a crowd of Conservatives. That does not mean for a second that either of them can translate that to the wider public. People who take part in politics in a big way are very much in the minority in this country. You need only take a look at the men's personal ratings to see that. And it is worth looking taking a look athow the polls are moving here,external, with excellent analysis from my fantastic colleague Peter Barnes who'll be tracking it all for the next few weeks. But again, unlike many of their MP colleagues, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are both happy campaigners who simply soak up the attention and affection of their home crowd. And lastly, it looks like both men are willing to run pretty divisive campaigns. At Mr Corbyn's launch I lost count of the number of times that he asked his audience from the stage: ""Whose side are you on?"" And I've already lost track of the number of times I've heard Mr Johnson present this election as contest between ""the people"" (whoever they really are) and Parliament. They are both following a totally different grain to the more managerial politics we had become used. Last, in this crazily volatile climate neither Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn can be sure at all where they will end up. Two extremely different politicians, with more in common than they might care to admit.

"John Bercow has shouted ""order order"" for the last time in the House of Commons, as his 10-year reign as Speaker came to an end. He has presided over business in the chamber one final time before his successor is chosen on Monday. Mr Bercow, who is standing down as MP for Buckingham, has been a contentious figure, with some MPs questioning his impartiality when it comes to Brexit. But Boris Johnson said he had been an innovator and a ""great servant"" of MPs. The prime minister compared Mr Bercow - who is a huge tennis fan - to an interventionist umpire who had ""peppered"" the Commons with often ""unreturnable volleys and smashes"". During Mr Bercow's final Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also praised the Speaker's efforts to modernise the Commons and the role he had played in promoting parliamentary democracy abroad. John Bercow bows out as Commons Speaker Last orderrrrs! Speaker's career in numbers Effigy of John Bercow to be set alight at bonfire After their election on Monday, Mr Bercow's successor is only likely to have a day in the chair before Parliament is dissolved ahead of the 12 December election. The Speaker is always selected from the ranks of MPs but the convention - only occasionally broken by some parties - is that he or she stands unopposed in general elections. On Thursday, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg led the tributes to Mr Bercow, saying he believed the good he had done should be ""heralded"" on his final day in the chair. He said Mr Bercow's use of words such as ""chunter"" and ""dilate"" had been popularised during his time in the role and praised him as the ""backbenchers' champion"". Continuing the tributes, shadow leader of the House Valerie Vaz told Mr Bercow: ""The word 'order, order' is now used by parents around the country as the new naughty step."" And the SNP's shadow leader of the House Pete Wishart said: ""The way we do business in this chamber is now forever changed because of your speakership - you have pioneered and you have transformed."" But it wasn't all smiles during his final session in the chamber, after he locked horns with Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgen. This video can not be played Bercow: ""Don't mix it with the chair"" Mr Bercow announced his intention to stand down in September. The 56 year-old's exit was due to have coincided with the day the UK left the EU but Brexit has since been delayed until 31 January. Mr Bercow served as a Conservative MP for 12 years before being elected as Speaker in 2009. During his decade in the role, he has issued the Speaker's trademark ""order, order"" instruction to MPs around 14,000 times. He has given unprecedented powers to backbenchers to hold ministers to account and made controversial and far-reaching procedural decisions at key stages of the Brexit process. This video can not be played MPs pay tribute to John Bercow at his last Prime Minister's Questions However, his period in charge of the House of Commons also saw several revelations of parliamentary staff reporting allegations of bullying and harassment by MPs and other senior figures, including Mr Bercow himself - which he has always denied. All previous Speakers have automatically been given peerages upon their retirement and sat in the House of Lords. It has also been reported Mr Bercow will be in demand on the lecture circuit.

"This video can not be played Corbyn: ""NHS money is being siphoned off"" Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed over the NHS, Brexit and leadership at the last Prime Minister's Questions before the general election. The Labour leader said voters had a ""once in a generation"" chance to save the NHS, which was in ""greater danger"" than at any time in its history. But the PM warned of ""economic catastrophe"" if Labour got into power. Meanwhile, some senior MPs, including Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan, have said they will not be standing.

Meanwhile, peers have approved the legislation needed to bring about the 12 December election. The House of Lords passed the early election bill - which wasapproved by MPs on Tuesday- in less than four hours, with no changes. In their final encounter in Parliament before the election, the two leaders exchanged barbs over their political values and disputed their parties' respective records on the NHS. The Labour leader accused the PM - who he has challenged to a one-on-one TV debate - of running down the health service, saying cuts to funding had contributed to rising waiting times for cancer treatment and operations. He said a Labour government would reverse what he said was the growing privatisation of the NHS, saying it existed to ""make people better, not make the wealthy few richer"".

""Make no mistake, I stand ready to take on Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate to be prime minister,"" she said. Twitter bans all political advertising ""We have a bold vision to stop Brexit and build a better, brighter future for the country."" For the Scottish National Party, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said an election was anopportunity for the country to hold another independence referendum. ""A win for the SNP will be an unequivocal and irresistible demand for Scotland's right to choose our own future,"" she said. But the Scottish Conservatives claimed voting for their party would keep Scotland in the UK. Meanwhile, an attempt by Boris Johnson to unite his party by re-admitting 10 Tory Brexit rebels has been hit bya row over the party's refusal to give the whip backto Amber Rudd - the former home secretary who has said she is standing down as an MP. The smaller parties are already talking about striking deals with each other, which could see candidates standing aside in areas where their Remain-supporting rivals have a better chance of winning. Ms Swinson said there were a ""small number of seats"" where ""arrangements"" could be struck with other parties to give an anti-Brexit candidate the best chance of winning.

"The fast food chain confirmed the adverts have now been removed from its restaurants in Portugal McDonald's has apologised for a Halloween marketing campaign which promoted a dessert in Portugal with the words: ""Sundae Bloody Sundae"". The term Bloody Sunday is used to refer to one of the worst days of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, when 13 people were shot dead by the Army. The adverts sparked outrage when photos were shared on social media. McDonald's said the marketing campaign was not intended to be an ""insensitive reference to any historical event"". ""We sincerely apologise for any offence or distress this may have caused,"" a spokeswoman for McDonald's Portugal said. She explained the ""Bloody"" sundae adverts were designed as a Halloween celebration but the promotion has since been cancelled. Allow Twitter content?

Outrage at 'Bloody Sunday' cocktail McDonald's loses second 'Mc' trademark case It is not the first time a company has apologised for promoting products with the phrase. In 2013, abar in London's Covent Garden apologised for serving a ""Sundae Bloody Sundae cocktail"". The drink caused outrage among Irish customers as it was served with a plastic toy soldier. At the time, the cocktail promotion was also condemned by campaigner Kate Nash, whose brother William Nash was among the 13 people who died on Bloody Sunday. However, when contacted by BBC News NI on Thursday, Ms Nash said: ""I am aware of the McDonalds ad campaign. ""I have to say, it is not that offensive to me."" She added: ""This is in Portugal and highly unlikely that people there have sat down with the intention to offend about the events here in Ireland. ""Perhaps just in their innocence that they have settled on this slogan, without making any connection to Bloody Sunday."" In a statement, the McDonald's spokeswoman confirmed that all related promotion material had since been removed from its Portuguese restaurants.

"A wheelchair user crowd-surfs at California's Outside Lands festival For years, deaf and disabled music fans have faced huge barriers when it comes to booking concert tickets. Whether it's the requirement to call premium rate help lines, or having to provide evidence of their disabilities, the experience has put many fans off. Now Ticketmaster is introducing a new system that allows gig-goers to book tickets online ""like anyone else"". BBC reporter Alex Taylor, a wheelchair user who regularly attends concerts, called the move a ""huge step forward"". Ticketmaster's scheme allows fans to submit details of their disability online. Once validated, the information is bound to their profile, meaning they can book tickets for all future gigs without extra effort. In participating venues, accessible seats will be clearly labelled on the seat map like any other ticket - whether that's in the range of a hearing loop, or in a wheelchair-friendly zone, with a free companion ticket. Gigging in my wheelchair Disabled fans face ticketing barriers Disabled musicians 'failed by venues' ""It's something we've been seeking to address for some time now,"" Ticketmaster's MD, Andrew Parsons, told the BBC. ""Fundamentally, all fans deserve equal access to live entertainment. ""The plus side of this system is that, in the future, the fans won't have to do anything. They will be able to buy their tickets like anyone else."" The booking system was soft-launched in two venues, Glasgow's SEC and Cardiff's Motorpoint Arena, a fortnight ago. ""The feedback's been really, really positive,"" said Parsons. ""We're very keen to roll it out to a host of new venues now; and I'm challenging all of our teams on that."" He said that arenas in Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle would be enrolled in the scheme by the end of the year, with more venues in more countries to follow in 2020. ""This is fantastic news for disabled music fans, and we hope other businesses will follow Ticketmaster's lead,"" said Kristina Barrick, of the disability equality charity Scope. ""Buying tickets online is not just about convenience. For disabled people whose impairments mean they can't use a phone, this will be game-changing."" Alex Taylor recently enjoyed London's Lovebox festival Ticketmaster's new system is a huge step forward for the disabled community - the end of a needless digital divide. The traditional accessible ticket line route (specialist phone numbers open at set hours), is not only laughably cumbersome and time-consuming in the digital age, but also the opposite of accessible for disabled people, especially those who may have difficulty using the phone. Now, finally, a major player has begun to take the plunge (albeit tentatively), helping explore technology's full potential as an accessibility tool.  Of course this is not before time and could've happened sooner. Research by the UK charity Attitude is Everything has been vital in highlighting the issue and forcing companies to take their earplugs out. Enabling disabled customers makes financial sense: The purchasing power of the community, known as the purple pound, was estimated to be worth around Â£249bn to the economy in 2017. But more work needs to be done. Launching at SEC Hydro, Glasgow and Motorpoint Arena, Cardiff shows willing but far from a full UK-wide commitment (Birmingham, London?), although Ticketmaster promise further roll-outs. Ultimately, this is a first-step, a warm-up to a headline act of ticketing equality that I, as a wheelchair user, have longed for my whole life. The whole point of music, and art as a whole, is that it is accessible to all - and most powerful live. Ticketing shouldn't be a barrier, but a route in. I'll meet you at the front. More than three million disabled people attend a concert every year and disabled music fans make up 11% of the live music audience, according to government statistics. But the UK charity Attitude is Everything, recently found that82% of deaf and disabled music lovers had faced difficultiesattending live music events, while 83% had been discouraged from buying tickets because of inaccessible booking systems. In response, it launched theTicketing Without Barriers Coalition,external, and worked in conjunction with Ticketmaster to design its new system. ""I'm delighted that Ticketmaster's accessible ticket sales will go online,"" said the charity's CEO, Suzanne Bull in a statement. ""This is real progress for millions of disabled fans who are entitled to a variety of ways in which they can book their tickets"". A similar scheme also exists for the Birmingham NEC, Birmingham Arena and Resorts World Arena, viaThe Ticket Factory website,external. Ticketmaster stressed that their dedicated phone lines won't be closing - with the new system simply an option for fans who prefer to go online.

"Ross England was selected to stand for the Welsh Conservatives for the 2021 assembly election The Conservative Party has denied knowledge of Ross England's involvement in a rape trial collapse before he was selected as a candidate. Mr England was accused by a Crown Court judge of deliberately sabotaging the trial in April 2018, by making claims about the victim's sexual history. The defendant, James Hackett, was convicted following a retrial. Sources had told BBC Wales the party knew about his involvement, but the Welsh party chairman denied this. In the first of two statements issued on Thursday evening, Lord Davies of Gower said the party only became aware of the ""full extent of the proceedings"" when Hackett's appeal process ended earlier this month. He said: ""We were fully aware that Ross England was involved as a witness in a sensitive case. We are also aware of the responsibility we have as employers. ""Since the end of the Appeal Court case, we have now been made aware of the full extent of the proceedings."" In a second statement, he said he could ""categorically state"" that he and Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns were ""completely unaware of the details of the collapse of this trial until they became public this week"". Mr England used to work for Mr Cairns in the Vale of Glamorgan, and was selected as the party's candidate to fight for the constituency seat at the 2021 Welsh assembly elections. Mr Cairns also told BBC Wales he only became aware of Mr England's role in the trial's collapse when the story broke earlier this week. The party has suspended Mr England as a candidateand an employee and a full investigation will be conducted. He has said he acted honestly during the aborted trial, and was not aware that any evidence had been ruled inadmissible. Speaking to BBC Wales on Thursday, one Conservative Party source said they called the party's Cardiff headquarters on the day the trial collapsed to inform management that Mr England's actions had led to that happening. Tory assembly candidate 'sabotaged' rape trial PM faces calls to sack Tory candidate in trial row Rape trial 'sabotage' Tory candidate suspended He had been giving evidence at the trial of his friend, when he claimed to have had a casual sexual relationship with the victim, which she denies. The judge Stephen Hopkins QC stopped the trial, asking Mr England: ""Why did you say that, are you completely stupid?"" The judge continued: ""You have managed single-handed, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trialâ¦ get out of my court."" The judge added he would be writing to Mr England's political allies in the hope they would take ""appropriate action"". This video can not be played A rape victim says Ross England had a ""formulated plan"" to wreck the trial of her attacker A separate source told BBC Wales: ""Richard Minshull [Director, Welsh Conservatives] got a letter around this timeframe about Ross because the party were his employer. ""Whether this letter was from the judge or not, I'm not sure, but he was certainly speaking with both Alun [Cairns - Welsh Secretary] and Byron [Lord Davies, chairman of the Welsh Conservatives] regularly regarding 'what to do about Ross.'"" The victim has told BBC Wales that ""people in Conservative HQ know... I know that Alun Cairns knows what he did in court and they knew by that evening. ""Therefore for them to make him a candidate in their target seat for the Welsh assembly proves to me how little respect they have for me, how little respect they have for the criminal justice system."" Ross England speaking at Welsh Conservative conference in 2016 After three days of virtual silence, two statements from the Welsh Conservatives in two hours. The last emphatic in its denial that neither Lord Davies, the party chair, nor Alun Cairns, the Welsh Secretary had any knowledge of the details of the collapsed rape trial until they were reported in the media this week. The party will hope this draws a line under a hugely damaging row, just as they're about to embark on a general election campaign. In April 2018, Ross England was working for the party when a Crown Court judge accused him of deliberately sabotaging a rape trial, precipitating a retrial. The party say they were ""fully aware"" he was a witness in a sensitive trial and of their responsibility as an employer. If, despite that full awareness, his employers did not realise for 18 months he'd caused the collapse of a criminal trial and been thrown out of court by the judge, it raises fundamental questions about supervision, vetting and candidate selection processes. Mr Cairns has previously endorsed Mr England as a ""friend and colleague"" with whom ""it will be a pleasure to campaign"". On Thursday, he said he only became aware of the collapse of the trial ""some considerable time afterwards and had no knowledge of the role of Ross England"". Lord Davies said ""continued speculation from an unspecified source"" about what party officials or elected representatives knew was ""unhelpful"". He also said ""at no time"" had any party officials received any correspondence in relation to the matter. ""As soon as it came to my attention, we acted immediately,"" he added. ""As chairman of the Welsh Conservative Party, I take all allegations concerning members, officials and elected representatives extremely seriously.""

"This video can not be played The moment US House votes for impeachment inquiry The US House of Representatives has passed a resolution to formally proceed with the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. The measure details how the inquiry will move into a more public phase. It was not a vote on whether the president should be removed from office. This was the first test of support in the Democratic-controlled House for the impeachment process. The White House condemned the vote, which passed along party lines. Only two Democrats - representing districts that Mr Trump won handily in 2016 - voted against the resolution, along with all Republicans, for a total count of 232 in favour and 196 against. The resolution also sets out due process rights for Mr Trump's lawyers under the congressional inquiry. The Republican president is accused of trying to pressure Ukraine into investigating unsubstantiated corruption claims against his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son who worked with Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Mr Trump denies wrongdoing. The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Republicans have criticised Democrats for the closed hearings - in which Republican lawmakers have also taken part.

"This video can not be played The moment US House votes for impeachment inquiry The US House of Representatives has passed a resolution to formally proceed with the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. The measure details how the inquiry will move into a more public phase. It was not a vote on whether the president should be removed from office. This was the first test of support in the Democratic-controlled House for the impeachment process. The White House condemned the vote, which passed along party lines. Only two Democrats - representing districts that Mr Trump won handily in 2016 - voted against the resolution, along with all Republicans, for a total count of 232 in favour and 196 against. The resolution also sets out due process rights for Mr Trump's lawyers under the congressional inquiry. The Republican president is accused of trying to pressure Ukraine into investigating unsubstantiated corruption claims against his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son who worked with Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Mr Trump denies wrongdoing. The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story?

"Hugh Grant has hit back after being criticised for not shaking Chancellor Sajid Javid's hand at a film premiere. In aninterview with ES Magazine,external, Mr Javid said he put his hand out to the Hollywood star and said ""lovely to meet you"" - but Grant refused to shake it. ""I think that is incredibly rude,"" said the chancellor. On Twitter, Grant put across ""my side of the story"",,externalsaying he declined the handshake because he felt Mr Javid was dismissive to press abuse victims. Grant, 59, has been one of the leading voices in the campaign for stricter press regulation, after being one of the victims of the phone-hacking scandal. He said his exact words to Mr Javid were: ""If you don't mind, I won't shake your hand because you were rude and dismissive to the victims of press abuse when you met them as culture secretary."" Grant with his wife, Swedish TV producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein, at The Irishman premiere A spokesman for the actor said he was referring to a meeting when victims of the press said they felt Mr Javid's ""attitude in the meeting was 'borderline contemptuous'"". ""Hugh would like to point out that the victims in question were not celebrities,"" the spokesman added. ""They were people with personal family tragedies who had been abused by sections of the press."" In his interview, Mr Javid, 49, said he was at an event to promote Martin Scorsese's new film The Irishman earlier this month when the handshake incident happened. ""I recognised him and put my hand out and said, 'Lovely to meet you', and you know what he does? He refuses to shake my hand. ""He says, 'I am not shaking your hand'. I am completely shocked. ""He said, 'When you were culture secretary you didn't support my friends in (anti-media intrusion campaign) Hacked Off.' ""I think that is incredibly rude. ""I wonder if people like Hugh Grant think they are part of the elite and they look down on working class people no matter what station they reach in life."" Mr Javid was culture secretary for just over a year in 2014 and 2015. He later became home secretary before being appointed chancellor in July this year.

"A potential successor, Abu al-Hasan al-Muhajir, was killed in an air strike hours after Baghdadi's death The jihadist group Islamic State (IS) has for the first time confirmed the death of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and named his successor. An IS outlet announced on the messaging service Telegram that Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurashi was the group's new leader and ""caliph"". US special forces tracked down Baghdadi in north-west Syria at the weekend and attacked his compound. The IS leader fled into a tunnel and killed himself with a suicide vest. The Iraqi had a $25m (Â£19m) bounty on his head and had been pursued by the US and its allies since the rise of IS five years ago. Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? What we know about the US raid IS also confirmed on Thursday the death of spokesman Abu al-Hasan al-Muhajir - who was killed in a joint operation in northern Syria by US and Syrian Kurdish forces hours after the one targeting Baghdadi. The Saudi national had been considered a potential successor. The new IS spokesman, Abu Hamza al-Qurashi, also called on Muslims to swear allegiance to Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi. Hashemi's name is not known to security forces, and is believed to be a nom de guerre. IS did not provide many details about the new leader or release a photo, but it did describe him as a ""prominent figure in jihad"". The statement also claimed Hashemi was a veteran jihadist fighter who had fought against the US in the past. With the name ""al-Qurashi"", the group also made clear that he claims to be descended from the Prophet Muhammad's Quraysh tribe - something generally held by pre-modern Sunni scholars as being a key qualification for becoming a caliph. Before the announcement, BBC jihadist media specialist Mina al-Lami said: ""If IS chooses to appoint someone who is not a Qurashi, then perhaps it is an implicit acknowledgement that the 'caliphate' is no more."" IS declared the creation of a ""caliphate"" - a state governed in accordance with Sharia, or Islamic law - after seizing control of huge swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014 and imposing its brutal rule on millions of civilians. It proclaimed Baghdadi as ""Caliph Ibrahim"" and demanded allegiance from Muslims worldwide. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself after US special forces found him in north-west Syria Despite the demise of its physical caliphate in March, IS remains a battle-hardened and well-disciplined force whose enduring defeat is not assured. The group still has between 14,000 and 18,000 ""members"" in Iraq and Syria, including up to 3,000 foreigners, according to a recent US report. In his statement, IS's new spokesman said the group's Shura Council met soon after Baghdadi's death was confirmed and pledged allegiance to Hashemi. The day before IS released the name of its new leader, the US military made public more information about the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a raid in Syria's Idlib province early on Sunday. In grainy footage, helicopters were seen firing at gunmen on the ground as they flew towards a compound where Baghdadi was hiding. On landing, US special forces commandos blew holes in the walls of the compound and called on Baghdadi to surrender, the military said. But he fled into a tunnel and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and two children he had taken with him. ""You can deduce what kind of person it is based on that activity,"" said the head of US Central Command, Gen Kenneth McKenzie. After the raid, the compound was destroyed in an air strike. This video can not be played The grainy footage shows troops closing in on the compound - and later an explosion destroying it Gen McKenzie said the destroyed buildings were left looking like ""a parking lot with large potholes"". He added that he could not confirm President Donald Trump's graphic description of Baghdadi whimpering and crying as he died.

"Susanna Naylor and her husband Chris died in the crash Three British friends have died in a ""horrific"" car accident in South Africa. Miranda Harris, 66, Chris Naylor, 58, and Mr Naylor's wife Susanna, 54, died in the crash in Port Elizabeth on Monday, the Christian charity A Rocha International confirmed. Ms Harris's husband, Peter, 67, was being treated in hospital. Mr and Mrs Harris's home is in West Lavington, Wiltshire; while the Naylors lived near Burford, Oxfordshire. The charity said the deaths came ""as a profound shock to everyone"". ""Above all, their families and friends are held in our prayers,"" it said. The couples had travelled to South Africa to work and look for ""possibilities for partnership in wildlife conservation"", the charity said. Miranda Harris died and her husband Peter was injured The Rev Dave Bookless, director of theology at A Rocha International, said the deaths ""leave a huge and irreplaceable hole in our lives and our organisation"". Dr Bookless said: ""Each one of them was a remarkable and inspiring individual, and the loss of all three is incalculable. ""We have been overwhelmed with prayers, condolences and offers of practical support from every corner of the world."" Dr Bookless said Mr Harris was ""still sedated but stable"" in hospital in Port Elizabeth. He said that two of his children and others from the A Rocha family were at his bedside. A driver of the vehicle in which the four friends were travelling was also being treated in hospital. The car reportedly came off the Swartkops Bridge after it collided with another vehicle on the N2 motorway in Bluewater Bay. A Rocha International, which engages communities in nature conservation, said Mrs Harris had co-founded the charity with her husband after they had run its first field study centre and bird observatory in Portugal in 1983. Mr Naylor, a father-of-three, had been executive director since 2010. Susanna Naylor was a science teacher at Christ Church Cathedral School, Oxford. The Naylors had been involved with the charity since they co-founded A Rocha Lebanon in 1996, after previously working as teachers in the Middle East. The Foreign Office said it was supporting the couples' families.

"Vauxhall employs about 3,000 people in the UK Fiat Chrysler is to merge with Vauxhall's owner PSA to create the world's fourth largest car company. The two sides say they have yet to finalise all the details, but the 50-50 merger is expected to provide significant cost savings. That has raised concerns at Vauxhall, which employs 3,000 people in the UK, as it could be vulnerable to any restructuring. Unions called for talks with France's PSA, which owns Peugeot and Citroen. Fiat Chrysler, the Italian-US business behind Jeep, Alfa Romeo, and Maserati, has been looking for a big tie-up for years, believing that consolidation in the global industry is needed to cuts costs and overcapacity, and fund investment in electric vehicles. It has tried previously to form alliances with General Motors and Renault. A combined Fiat Chrysler-PSA will have a market value of about $50bn (Â£39.9bn) with annual sales of 8.7 million vehicles. The companies said there are no plans to shut factories, but UK unions are uneasy about the impact on Vauxhall. ""Merger talks combined with Brexit uncertainty is deeply unsettling for Vauxhall's UK workforce which is one of the most efficient in Europe,"" said Unite national officer Des Quinn. ""The fact remains, merger or not, if PSA wants to use a great British brand like Vauxhall to sell cars and vans in the UK, then it has to make them here in the UK."" Prof David Bailey, from the Birmingham Business School, told the BBC he was concerned about the prospects for Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port factory. Major cost cutting ""isn't going to be achievable without plant closures and significant job cuts"". Although Ellesmere Port is considered an efficient car plant, he believes the Italian government will be keen to keep Fiat's factories, and the French government is part-owner of PSA and so has an interest in protecting its own factories. He said: ""I have a real fear that if this merger goes ahead the likes of Ellesmere Port, which is a very efficient plant, could be sacrificed to get the sort of savings the company is looking for, especially in all the uncertainty over Brexit."" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire suggested his government would protect French interests. He welcomed the deal, saying it would give the two groups the critical mass needed to invest in cleaner technologies. And he added: ""The government will be particularly vigilant over preserving (the group's) industrial footprint in France."" The combined group, which will have its headquarters in the Netherlands, will have an 11-person board. This will include six members from Peugeot, including chief executive Carlos Tavares, and five from FCA, including chairman and billionaire John Elkann, a member of Italy's Agnelli family. Exor, the Agnelli family investment company, will have the largest stake in the merged group. Other large shareholders are the Peugeot family, China's Dongfeng Motor and the French state. Fiat Chrysler, having flirted heavily with Renault, is now getting serious with another French company. And on the face of it, this merger would make perfect sense. The two companies could pool their resources, at a time when the industry as a whole is facing huge challenges due to the development of electric cars, automated driving, connected technologies, and shared use models. Fiat Chrysler really needs access to an electric car platform. It would also combine PSA Group's strength in Europe with Fiat Chrysler's scale in North America. But there's a catch. Look how many different interests are involved. PSA Group's leading shareholders include a Chinese state-owned company and the French government - which has already undermined those earlier attempts to bring FCA and Renault together. So things could get political very quickly. Then there are the Agnelli and Peugeot dynasties - fully onside at the moment, but faced with diluted influence. Could they cause problems down the line? And regulators will have to give the plan the green light as well. So a merger might make sense, but it's far from being a done deal just yet.

"Hugh Grant has hit back after being criticised for not shaking Chancellor Sajid Javid's hand at a film premiere. In aninterview with ES Magazine,external, Mr Javid said he put his hand out to the Hollywood star and said ""lovely to meet you"" - but Grant refused to shake it. ""I think that is incredibly rude,"" said the chancellor. On Twitter, Grant put across ""my side of the story"",,externalsaying he declined the handshake because he felt Mr Javid was dismissive to press abuse victims. Grant, 59, has been one of the leading voices in the campaign for stricter press regulation, after being one of the victims of the phone-hacking scandal. He said his exact words to Mr Javid were: ""If you don't mind, I won't shake your hand because you were rude and dismissive to the victims of press abuse when you met them as culture secretary."" Grant with his wife, Swedish TV producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein, at The Irishman premiere A spokesman for the actor said he was referring to a meeting when victims of the press said they felt Mr Javid's ""attitude in the meeting was 'borderline contemptuous'"". ""Hugh would like to point out that the victims in question were not celebrities,"" the spokesman added. ""They were people with personal family tragedies who had been abused by sections of the press."" In his interview, Mr Javid, 49, said he was at an event to promote Martin Scorsese's new film The Irishman earlier this month when the handshake incident happened. ""I recognised him and put my hand out and said, 'Lovely to meet you', and you know what he does? He refuses to shake my hand. ""He says, 'I am not shaking your hand'. I am completely shocked. ""He said, 'When you were culture secretary you didn't support my friends in (anti-media intrusion campaign) Hacked Off.' ""I think that is incredibly rude. ""I wonder if people like Hugh Grant think they are part of the elite and they look down on working class people no matter what station they reach in life.""

"Tourism hotspot Rochester, in Kent, is one place that has made a request A scheme aimed at funding free-to-use ATMs in so-called cash deserts is facing overwhelming demand from communities across the UK. More than 100 areas have applied for a new cash machine, but the initial funding only covers 50 new ATMs. Criteria for successful bids include a lack of nearby ATMs, a safe location being found, and no Post Office access. The system, which is only fully launched on Thursday, is being run by Link, which oversees the ATM network. Critics have described the ""request an ATM"" service as a ""tiny bandage on a massive wound"" caused by Link cutting fees paid to operators. Industry figures show there were 52,358 free-to-use machines operating in the UK at the end of 2018. Another 11,002 pay-to-use machines were also in place. A total of 2.4 billion withdrawals were made from these machines last year, with Â£193bn of cash being taken out. But consumer groups and campaigners have raised concerns about the falling number of cash machines in the UK, denying some areas access to cash and causing difficulties for vulnerable people and businesses. In response, Link launched the scheme at the start of October, which now has itsown dedicated online portal,external, with a Â£1m pot of funding from banks and building societies to install ATMs in areas that need one. Selby, North Yorkshire, is another community making a claim That pot of money would only finance 40 to 50 machines, but Link said more could be levied from its members - the banks. So far, 86 areas in England, 16 in Scotland, nine in Wales, and two in Northern Ireland have applied to the scheme. Among them are Rochester in Kent, which attracts tourists owing to its links with Charles Dickens and its picturesque High Street, coastal community Cullen in Moray, and the military base at Catterick, North Yorkshire. John Howells, chief executive of Link, said ""It is great that we've had so much interest so far. Many of the applications show there are locations around the country where there is a cash access problem. We've already visited 10 of these locations and will be working hard to listen to every community that has got in touch. ""We want to hear from more communities that think they have an issue. Where there is a problem, Link will take action."" But independent operators say the reason why many communities have lost free-to-use ATMs is down to the actions of Link. When the request service was launched, Peter McNamara, chief executive of independent ATM operator NoteMachine, said Link had forced two cuts in the fees that banks pay the operators each time their customers use a non-bank machine. As a result, he argued, many cash machines had become uneconomic and were being taken out or switched from free-to-use to charging consumers. Do you live in an area without a cash machine?

Carl Marshall, 89, left his house in Glossop a year ago over fears it was bad for his health. It had no heating or carpets and was plagued by damp and mice - conditions that shocked those who saw it. To help, the community of the Derbyshire town came together over 11 months to completely rebuild the inside of the house.

""What a pleasure it is to be home, I'm thrilled."" Carl Marshall is a popular regular at The Oakwood in Glossop Mr Marshall had moved into an outhouse 28 years ago after selling his family home.

"This video can not be played The grainy footage shows troops closing in on the compound - and later an explosion destroying it The US military has published the first footage of the raid in northern Syria that resulted in the death of the leader of the Islamic State (IS) group. Grainy video showed troops firing at militants on the ground as they flew towards the compound where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hiding before they moved in on the ground. Baghdadi fled into a tunnel and killed himself by detonating a suicide vest. After the raid the compound was destroyed with munitions. The head of US Central Command, Gen Kenneth McKenzie, said the destroyed buildings were left looking like ""a parking lot with large potholes"". Gen McKenzie said two children had died with Baghdadi in the tunnel - not three as previously reported. He also could not confirm President Donald Trump's graphic description of Baghdadi whimpering and crying as he died. What we know about US raid Who was Baghdadi? Trump takes partisan line after Baghdadi raid IS leader 'identified by stolen underwear' ""He crawled into a hole with two small children and blew himself up while his people stayed on the ground. You can deduce what kind of person it is based on that activity,"" he told a news conference at the Pentagon. ""That would be my empirical observation of what he did.  I'm not able to confirm anything else about his last seconds. I just can't confirm that one way or another."" Gen McKenzie said four women - who were wearing suicide vests - and one man were killed at the compound. He said an unknown number of fighters also died after opening fire on US helicopters. He added: ""I want to make it clear that despite the high-pressure and high-profile nature of this assault that every effort was made to avoid civilian casualties and to protect children we suspected would be in the compound."" This video can not be played Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself during a raid by US commandos Gen McKenzie confirmed that the IS leader had been identified through his DNA - adding that samples had been on file since Baghdadi's detention in an Iraqi prison in 2004. He said Baghdadi's remains were flown back to a staging base for identification and were then buried at sea within 24 hours of his death ""in accordance with the laws of armed conflict"". Gen McKenzie also said that the US military expected IS to stage some kind of revenge attack for the death of its leader. ""We suspect they will try some form of retribution attack. And we are postured and prepared for that,"" he said. Baghdadi underwear 'proved identity' for US raid What to expect from IS after Baghdadi's death Where is IS still active around the world?

"Susanna Naylor and her husband Chris died in the crash Three British friends have died in a ""horrific"" car accident in South Africa. Miranda Harris, 66, Chris Naylor, 58, and Mr Naylor's wife Susanna, 54, died in the crash in Port Elizabeth on Monday, the Christian charity A Rocha International confirmed. Ms Harris's husband, Peter, 67, was being treated in hospital. Mr and Mrs Harris's home is in West Lavington, Wiltshire; while the Naylors lived near Burford, Oxfordshire. The charity said the deaths came ""as a profound shock to everyone"". ""Above all, their families and friends are held in our prayers,"" it said. The couples had travelled to South Africa to work and look for ""possibilities for partnership in wildlife conservation"", the charity said. Miranda Harris died and her husband Peter was injured The Rev Dave Bookless, director of theology at A Rocha International, said the deaths ""leave a huge and irreplaceable hole in our lives and our organisation"". Dr Bookless said: ""Each one of them was a remarkable and inspiring individual, and the loss of all three is incalculable. ""We have been overwhelmed with prayers, condolences and offers of practical support from every corner of the world."" Dr Bookless said Mr Harris was ""still sedated but stable"" in hospital in Port Elizabeth. He said that two of his children and others from the A Rocha family were at his bedside. A driver of the vehicle in which the four friends were travelling was also being treated in hospital. The car reportedly came off the Swartkops Bridge after it collided with another vehicle on the N2 motorway in Bluewater Bay. A Rocha International, which engages communities in nature conservation, said Mrs Harris had co-founded the charity with her husband after they had run its first field study centre and bird observatory in Portugal in 1983. Mr Naylor, a father-of-three, had been executive director since 2010. Susanna Naylor was a science teacher at Christ Church Cathedral School, Oxford. The Naylors had been involved with the charity since they co-founded A Rocha Lebanon in 1996, after previously working as teachers in the Middle East. The Foreign Office said it was supporting the couples' families.

"Dozens of prisons across England and Wales are failing to operate emergency telephone lines to help prevent suicide and self-harm, a report has revealed. The research shows a hotline for relatives of prisoners to call if they have concerns about an inmate was not being answered or had not even been set up in more than one third of jails. When there was an emergency line, most calls went to an answering machine. The Ministry of Justice said the findings were ""unacceptable"". In a statement, the MoJ pledged ""immediate action"" to address the problem and asked prisons to ensure that it is sorted out within the next 24 hours. The availability of adedicated ""safer custody"" telephone linefor families to flag concerns about a prisoner's physical or mental health was a key recommendation in a review by Lord Michael Farmer which had been commissioned by the government. The review was published in 2017 amid mounting concern about the rising tide of self-harm and suicides in prisons. Figures from the Ministry of Justice,externalfor the 12 months to September 2019 show there were 90 self-inflicted deaths, one more than the previous year, and in the 12 months to June, 60,594 incidents of self-harm - an increase of 22%. The Prison Reform Trust (PRT), together with the Prison Advice and Care Trust and the charity Inquest, conducted research by trying to call 119 jails to test whether Lord Farmer's proposal had been implemented. The research, seen by the BBC, found that: 22 prisons had no publicly advertised hotline In another 22, the number was not answered, was not working or was just transferred through to a general switchboard. Of the 75 numbers that were directed to safer custody departments, 62 went through to an answerphone - and only 13 calls were immediately picked up by a member of staff. Peter Dawson, director of the PRT, said: ""Lord Farmer's report demanded action, and the Prison Service promised it, but this report shows that the problem is a very long way from being solved."" The PRT said poor arrangements for families to get in touch with prisons had been identified in inquests into the deaths of prisoners, including that of Jordan Hullock. The 19-year-old died of natural causes at Doncaster Prison in 2015 but an inquest jury identified serious failures and shortcomings in his care. According to the PRT, the inquest heard evidence that ""when Jordan stopped communicating, his mother emailed and phoned the prison with her concerns, but to no avail"". An inquest jury found serious failures in Jordan Hullock's care Mr Dawson said: ""Lives may depend on the ability to get an urgent message through - every prison should have a system in place and be testing it regularly."" In another case, one family member told researchers they had contacted the safer custody line in a prison 20-25 times between January and June this year. ""About 40% of the time someone picks up and says that they will check on him and then ring me backâ¦but they have never rung me back,"" the relative said. ""On one occasion I left a message four times before they rang me back."" Prisoners to get phones in their cells One in seven prisons of 'serious concern' Less violence at 'wear own clothes' jail The Ministry of Justice said: ""The findings of this report are unacceptable and we have already taken immediate action to address the concerns, with governors ensuring that family members are able to speak to staff if they have information about a prisoner's wellbeing."" The department has asked senior managers to give a personal guarantee that ""effective communications systems"" are in place within each prison - and, to underline the urgency, have asked for this to be done by the end of the day. The study comes as a separate report by the Commons Justice Committee said the prison system is in an ""enduring crisis of safety and decency"". MPs criticised announcements about building new prison places to accommodate tougher sentences. ""Too often we have seen what might be called 'policy by press notice' without a clear vision for the future of the prison system,"" the report said. ""While new prison places are welcome, they do nothing to improve the condition of the current prison estate, much of which is in an appalling state of disrepair,"" it adds.

"This video can not be played The grainy footage shows troops closing in on the compound - and later an explosion destroying it The US military has published the first footage of the raid in northern Syria that resulted in the death of the leader of the Islamic State (IS) group. Grainy video showed troops firing at militants on the ground as they flew towards the compound where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hiding before they moved in on the ground. Baghdadi fled into a tunnel and killed himself by detonating a suicide vest. After the raid the compound was destroyed with munitions. The head of US Central Command, Gen Kenneth McKenzie, said the destroyed buildings were left looking like ""a parking lot with large potholes"". Gen McKenzie said two children had died with Baghdadi in the tunnel - not three as previously reported. He also could not confirm President Donald Trump's graphic description of Baghdadi whimpering and crying as he died. What we know about US raid Who was Baghdadi? Trump takes partisan line after Baghdadi raid IS leader 'identified by stolen underwear' ""He crawled into a hole with two small children and blew himself up while his people stayed on the ground. You can deduce what kind of person it is based on that activity,"" he told a news conference at the Pentagon. ""That would be my empirical observation of what he did.  I'm not able to confirm anything else about his last seconds. I just can't confirm that one way or another."" Gen McKenzie said four women - who were wearing suicide vests - and one man were killed at the compound. He said an unknown number of fighters also died after opening fire on US helicopters. He added: ""I want to make it clear that despite the high-pressure and high-profile nature of this assault that every effort was made to avoid civilian casualties and to protect children we suspected would be in the compound."" This video can not be played Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself during a raid by US commandos Gen McKenzie confirmed that the IS leader had been identified through his DNA - adding that samples had been on file since Baghdadi's detention in an Iraqi prison in 2004. He said Baghdadi's remains were flown back to a staging base for identification and were then buried at sea within 24 hours of his death ""in accordance with the laws of armed conflict"". Gen McKenzie also said that the US military expected IS to stage some kind of revenge attack for the death of its leader. ""We suspect they will try some form of retribution attack. And we are postured and prepared for that,"" he said. Baghdadi underwear 'proved identity' for US raid What to expect from IS after Baghdadi's death Where is IS still active around the world?

"This video can not be played Bronze Age monument discovered in Forest of Dean A previously unknown Bronze Age monument has been discovered hidden in woodland in the Forest of Dean following an airborne laser scan. The ritual monument, known as a ring cairn, dates back to about 2,000 BC. It consists of a circular bank with several small limestone standing stones on top. Archaeologist Jon Hoyle, who found it, said it was the only site of its kind known about in Gloucestershire, and was a ""very significant"" discovery. Archaeologist Jon Hoyle said nobody knows precisely what ring cairns were used for It was identified following a LiDAR (light detection and ranging) survey of the Forest of Dean. The technique used laser beams fired from an aeroplane to create a 3D record of the land surface, effectively removing the trees from the landscape. Mr Hoyle said when he studied the data, he spotted an ""extremely circular"" feature, which he thought initially might be a World War Two gun emplacement. After visiting the site, at a secret location near the village of Tidenham, he realised it was much older, dating to between 2,500 BC and 1,500 BC. A LiDAR survey of the forest revealed the circular feature beneath the trees ""It was very exciting. I was expecting to find quite a lot of new sites with the LiDAR, but nothing as interesting as this."" The ring cairn is about 25m (80ft) in diameter and made up of a 5m-wide (16ft) rubble bank, with at least 10 white limestone standing stones, each no more than 1m (3ft) high, standing on top. Mr Hoyle said ring cairns were ""common in upland areas, in places like Derbyshire, Northumberland and Wales"" but this was the only known one in Gloucestershire. Mr Hoyle said the discovery was ""very exciting"" ""Nobody knows precisely what they were used for. Some have been found in association with burials, and often there appear to be residues of charcoal in places like this, suggesting rituals that involved fire,"" he added. The discovery is featured in a new book by Mr Hoyle - Hidden Landscapes of the Forest of Dean. Pub regular, 89, 'thrilled' as locals fix up home Do these photographs show Banksy at work?

"Jack Dorsey said details would follow in November Twitter is to ban all political advertising worldwide, saying that the reach of such messages ""should be earned, not bought"". ""While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics,"" company CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted. Social media rivalFacebook recently ruled out a ban on political ads. News of the ban divided America's political camps for the 2020 election. Brad Parscale, manager of President Donald Trump's re-election campaign, said the ban was ""yet another attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives"". But Bill Russo, spokesman for the campaign to elect Democratic front-runner Joe Biden, said: ""When faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy,it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out,external."" Reacting to the move, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg defended his company's policy. ""In a democracy, I don't think it's right for private companies to censor politicians or the news,"" he said during a conference call with journalists. Twitter's ban will be enforced from 22 November, with full details released by 15 November. Mr Dorsey explained his position in a thread of tweets. Allow Twitter content?

Internet political ads, he said, presented ""entirely new challenges to civic discourse"". These challenges included ""machine learning-based optimisation of messaging"", ""micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes"". ""It's not credible,"" he wrote, ""for us to say: 'We're working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, but if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political adâ¦well...they can say whatever they want!'"" Countering the argument that the new policy might be seen as favouring leaders already in office, he pointed out that ""many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising"". Ads in support of voter registration would not be affected by the ban, he added. Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic candidate who lost to Mr Trump in the 2016 presidential election, welcomed Twitter's ban and appeared to challenge Facebook to rethink its stance.

Jack Dorsey's decision is more significant for its timing and the principle it upholds than the practical effects it will have on modern democracy. Political ads on Twitter are just a fraction, in scale and impact, of those on Facebook. Mr Dorsey knew - and his chief financial officer has since confirmed - that this decision would have little impact on the company's bottom line. They therefore calculated that they could win a thumbs up from regulators and public opinion at little cost to the business. And they could also mischievously provoke Facebook, who are in a more difficult position on the subject. It cannot be mere coincidence that Mr Dorsey's tweet was just a fortnight after Mark Zuckerberg's speech on the same subject. A dividing line between the companies is useful for Twitter. It puts the onus on Facebook to once again defend its stance. It is very easy to find damaging or deceitful ads online. But asking Californian companies to decide what should or shouldn't be in the public domain grants them enormous power that is hard to undo. They already make such decisions on things like violent or hateful content; asking them to go further is, in effect, turning them into editorial arbiters of public conversation. That is, journalists. Earlier this month, Mr Zuckerberg went before an audience of students in Washington DC to defend the firm's decision not to ban political adverts that contain falsehoods. He had considered barring all political ads on his platforms, but said he believed the move would favour incumbent politicians and whoever the media chose to cover. The company should ""err on the side of greater expression"", he argued. Zuckerberg gave his speech to an audience of students and others at Georgetown University in Washington DC Another spokesman for Mr Biden had criticised the firm for refusing to remove a video posted by Mr Trump's 2020 re-election campaign which promoted an unproven conspiracy theory involving the former vice-president and his son. ""It is unacceptable for any social media company to knowingly allow deliberately misleading material to corrupt its platform,""TJ Ducklo said,external. Fellow Democratic candidateSenator Elizabeth Warren then paid to run an intentionally misleading advert,externalon Facebook that claimed Mr Zuckerberg had personally endorsed Donald Trump for re-election. She said she had done so to protest against the firm's decision to allow politicians to run ads containing ""known lies"".

"Hugh Grant has hit back after being criticised for not shaking Chancellor Sajid Javid's hand at a film premiere. In aninterview with ES Magazine,external, Mr Javid said he put his hand out to the Hollywood star and said ""lovely to meet you"" - but Grant refused to shake it. ""I think that is incredibly rude,"" said the chancellor. On Twitter, Grant put across ""my side of the story"",,externalsaying he declined the handshake because he felt Mr Javid was dismissive to press abuse victims. Grant, 59, has been one of the leading voices in the campaign for stricter press regulation, after being one of the victims of the phone-hacking scandal. He said his exact words to Mr Javid were: ""If you don't mind, I won't shake your hand because you were rude and dismissive to the victims of press abuse when you met them as culture secretary."" Grant with his wife, Swedish TV producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein, at The Irishman premiere A spokesman for the actor said he was referring to a meeting when victims of the press said they felt Mr Javid's ""attitude in the meeting was 'borderline contemptuous'"". ""Hugh would like to point out that the victims in question were not celebrities,"" the spokesman added. ""They were people with personal family tragedies who had been abused by sections of the press."" In his interview, Mr Javid, 49, said he was at an event to promote Martin Scorsese's new film The Irishman earlier this month when the handshake incident happened. ""I recognised him and put my hand out and said, 'Lovely to meet you', and you know what he does? He refuses to shake my hand. ""He says, 'I am not shaking your hand'. I am completely shocked. ""He said, 'When you were culture secretary you didn't support my friends in (anti-media intrusion campaign) Hacked Off.' ""I think that is incredibly rude. ""I wonder if people like Hugh Grant think they are part of the elite and they look down on working class people no matter what station they reach in life.""

"Vauxhall employs about 3,000 people in the UK Fiat Chrysler is to merge with Vauxhall's owner PSA to create the world's fourth largest car company. The two sides say they have yet to finalise all the details, but the 50-50 merger is expected to provide significant cost savings. That has raised concerns at Vauxhall, which employs 3,000 people in the UK, as it could be vulnerable to any restructuring. Unions called for talks with France's PSA, which owns Peugeot and Citroen. Fiat Chrysler, the Italian-US business behind Jeep, Alfa Romeo, and Maserati, has been looking for a big tie-up for years, believing that consolidation in the global industry is needed to cuts costs and overcapacity, and fund investment in electric vehicles. It has tried previously to form alliances with General Motors and Renault. A combined Fiat Chrysler-PSA will have a market value of about $50bn (Â£39.9bn) with annual sales of 8.7 million vehicles. The companies said there are no plans to shut factories, but UK unions are uneasy about the impact on Vauxhall. ""Merger talks combined with Brexit uncertainty is deeply unsettling for Vauxhall's UK workforce which is one of the most efficient in Europe,"" said Unite national officer Des Quinn. ""The fact remains, merger or not, if PSA wants to use a great British brand like Vauxhall to sell cars and vans in the UK, then it has to make them here in the UK."" Prof David Bailey, from the Birmingham Business School, told the BBC he was concerned about the prospects for Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port factory. Major cost cutting ""isn't going to be achievable without plant closures and significant job cuts"". Although Ellesmere Port is considered an efficient car plant, he believes the Italian government will be keen to keep Fiat's factories, and the French government is part-owner of PSA and so has an interest in protecting its own factories. He said: ""I have a real fear that if this merger goes ahead the likes of Ellesmere Port, which is a very efficient plant, could be sacrificed to get the sort of savings the company is looking for, especially in all the uncertainty over Brexit."" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire suggested his government would protect French interests. He welcomed the deal, saying it would give the two groups the critical mass needed to invest in cleaner technologies. And he added: ""The government will be particularly vigilant over preserving (the group's) industrial footprint in France."" The combined group, which will have its headquarters in the Netherlands, will have an 11-person board. This will include six members from Peugeot, including chief executive Carlos Tavares, and five from FCA, including chairman and billionaire John Elkann, a member of Italy's Agnelli family. Exor, the Agnelli family investment company, will have the largest stake in the merged group. Other large shareholders are the Peugeot family, China's Dongfeng Motor and the French state. Fiat Chrysler, having flirted heavily with Renault, is now getting serious with another French company. And on the face of it, this merger would make perfect sense. The two companies could pool their resources, at a time when the industry as a whole is facing huge challenges due to the development of electric cars, automated driving, connected technologies, and shared use models. Fiat Chrysler really needs access to an electric car platform. It would also combine PSA Group's strength in Europe with Fiat Chrysler's scale in North America. But there's a catch. Look how many different interests are involved. PSA Group's leading shareholders include a Chinese state-owned company and the French government - which has already undermined those earlier attempts to bring FCA and Renault together. So things could get political very quickly. Then there are the Agnelli and Peugeot dynasties - fully onside at the moment, but faced with diluted influence. Could they cause problems down the line? And regulators will have to give the plan the green light as well. So a merger might make sense, but it's far from being a done deal just yet.

"Spiders use a kind of sticky glue to catch their prey on rainy days A double-sided tape designed to stick body tissue together after surgery has been inspired by the way spiders exude ""glue"" to catch their prey in the rain. Scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology noticed how the spiders' secretion absorbed water, helping to secure their next meal. The sticky tape does the same and was found to work within seconds in tests on pig skin and lungs. The team said with more research, it could be used in place of sutures. But they are still several years away from trials in humans. Getting tissues in the body to form a tight seal is difficult because water on their surface makes them slippery. The double-sided sticky tape was designed to act like duct tape for surgeons Sutures - stitches that hold a wound or cut together - don't always work well and can cause infections and pain. And tissue glues, which already exist, can take several minutes to work and may drip on to other body parts. So the scientists turned to nature for inspiration. Spiders secrete a sticky material containing charged polysaccharides that absorb water from the surface of an insect almost instantaneously, leaving a small dry patch the glue can then stick to. And, similarly, the researchers used polyacrylic acid on the tape to absorb water from wet body tissues, which then activated the glue to stick fast. Slimy slugs inspire medical glue 'Video games made me a better surgeon' Adding gelatin or chitosan, can make the tape hold its shape for a few days or a month depending on how long it needs to last, the researchers say. They have now tested it out on different types of rat and pig tissue, including small intestine, stomach, liver and skin. Study author Hyunwoo Yuk said: ""It's very challenging to suture soft or fragile tissues such as the lung and trachea - but with our double-sided tape, within five seconds we can easily seal them."" Hyunwoo Yuk holds the sticky tape he helped design It could potentially also be used to attach medical devices to organs such as the heart ""without causing damage or secondary complications from puncturing tissue"". The researchers now plan to perform more tests on animals. The study is published inNature,external.

"This video can not be played Survivors were treated at nearby hospitals in the hours after the blaze At least 74 people have died after a train travelling between the Pakistani cities of Karachi and Rawalpindi caught fire in the middle of its journey. Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said the fire started when a gas cylinder, which passengers were using to cook breakfast on board, exploded. The huge blaze spread to at least three carriages. According to officials cited in local media, many victims died as they tried to jump off the moving, burning train. Another 40 people were injured. Officials say the number of victims may still rise. Are rail accidents at a record high in Pakistan? BBC Urdu's Farhat Javed, who visited hospitals where victims are being treated, said many patients were too traumatised to speak. Survivor Shahid Imran told the BBC he realised a fire had broken out when he heard screaming. He pushed his wife out of a window and then jumped after her. Mr Imran was slightly hurt in the fall from the moving train, but his wife suffered severe head injuries. Another survivor told the BBC they pulled the emergency chain to get the train to stop, but it did not slow down. Doctors are treating people for burns, broken limbs and head injuries, our correspondent said. The accident happened near the town of Rahim Yar Khan in the south of Punjab province. Many passengers were pilgrims heading to Raiwind near Lahore for one of Pakistan's largest annual religious congregations, organised by the Tablighi Jamaat Sunni Muslim missionary movement. Three carriages were set alight, officials said, with 54 people in the 11th carriage and 78 each in carriages 12 and 13. Most of these passengers were on their way to the religious festival. Mohammad Ramzan, who was on board, told BBC Urdusome pilgrims were making tea when their gas cylinder exploded. He jumped from the train to safety. Survivor Jamshed Pathan told BBC Urdu he was in carriage 11 when they realised there was a fire, and that it had broken out just after they finished morning prayers. ""There was chaos everywhere,"" he said. ""It was very difficult for us to get out and save ourselves."" Another man, who gave his name as Ghaffar, said he could smell something in the night, ""but no one paid attention"". He and his friends helped rush injured passengers to hospital. ""I have no words to explain what we saw,"" he said. ""The rescue teams got there very late."" The injured were taken to hospitals including this one in Bahawalpur District deputy commissioner Jamil Ahmed said some of the victims had suffered such severe burns that they could not be identified without DNA testing. Evidence is now being collected at the scene and sent off for forensic tests, an anonymous official told BBC Urdu. ""Two cooking stoves blew up. They were cooking, they had [cooking] oil which added fuel to fire,"" Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said. Passengers bringing stoves onto trains in order to cook meals on long journeys was a common problem, the minister said. Though it is common to carry food on board, gas cylinders are banned. But other reports from the scene suggest electrical problems could have been the cause. Several survivors have reportedly said they believed a short-circuit on board may have been to blame. Prime Minister Imran Khan said he was ""deeply saddened by the terrible tragedy"",external, adding that he had ordered an ""immediate inquiry"" into the cause of the fire. After an earlier suspension in the wake of the blaze, the railways minister said services had now been restored. By Abid Hussain, BBC Urdu Train travel is one of the most popular means of transport in Pakistan, particularly among middle- and lower-income groups. Built by the British during pre-partition era, the railway tracks cover the length of the country. However, while some of the upscale trains have dedicated dining carriages, most of the country's trains are in poor condition and have barely functioning amenities. Therefore, passengers choose to bring things along with them, or refresh themselves where the trains stop. They also take advantage of the fact that inspection is more relaxed than at airports, bringing banned items like cooking stoves and oil canisters to keep themselves sustained during the long hours on board. This particular service - Tezgam - is one of the oldest and most popular, travelling between Karachi in the south and Rawalpindi in the north. The journey takes more than 25 hours,external, with each of its carriages boasting space for somewhere between 60 and 80 passengers on bunk beds. Tickets cost between 1,500 rupees ($9.60; Â£7.40) and 5,000 rupees ($32; Â£24.80), depending on the class. This is Pakistan's worst rail disaster in over a decade, but the country has a history of fatal railway accidents. Casualty figures are often high because trains are packed with far greater numbers of passengers than they were designed for. In July, 11 people died in an accident, with four dying in another accident in September. In 2007, at least 56 people were killed,externaland more than 120 injured in a crash near Mehrabpur.

"This video can not be played Rugby World Cup final: England will play without fear - Eddie Jones Rugby World Cup final: England v South Africa Venue:Yokohama International StadiumDate:Saturday, 2 NovemberKick-off:09:00 GMT Coverage:Live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. England head coach Eddie Jones says his team are ready to produce their finest hour after naming an unchanged team for Saturday's World Cup final against South Africa. Captain Owen Farrell, leading try-scorer Jonny May and prop Kyle Sinckler have all been passed fit after carrying knocks from the semi-final win over New Zealand. Farrell stays at inside centre with George Ford once again picked at fly-half, while scrum-half Ben Spencer is on the bench after flying out last weekend as emergency cover following an injury to Willi Heinz. Jones said: ""We know South Africa are going to come at us, and we're going to come at them even harder. ""I've got no doubt that they'll play better, but we'll play better - we will play with no fear. ""We're confident in the game we have and we're confident in the way we've prepared. ""We're ready to go. Hang on to your seats, because it's the last dip of the rollercoaster."" England produced what many critics described as the greatest performance in their history to see off three-time world champions New Zealand 19-7 last Saturday. SA wing Kolbe returns to face England 'George Ford has moved out of Owen Farrell's shadow' Wales v New Zealand: Owen Lane to start as one of nine changes Rugby Union Weekly at the World Cup The form shown by the 10-12 combination of Ford and Farrell and the outstanding displays of Sinckler, Maro Itoje, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill have persuaded Jones - in his 50th game in charge of the side - to stick with the same XV for the first time all tournament, despite the direct, muscular threat posed by the Springboks. Jones has the highest winning percentage of any coach to take charge of England, and a second World Cup triumph, 16 years after Sir Clive Woodward's team took the first, would be the ultimate valediction for his four sometimes controversial years in charge. He said: ""That was always our aim, to be here on 2 November in the Yokohama Stadium. ""So we've achieved one goal, but we know what's at stake in the final, and we're well prepared. ""South Africa are a different proposition - they're much more physical, they come through you at the front door, whereas New Zealand it's the front door and back door. ""We have to make adjustments, but we're ready for the brutality of the game. ""Our players have had the will to prepare. They've pushed themselves through some tough physical tasks. ""They've worked hard to get the right tactical game and they've worked hard to build the bonds between them."" Despite the youth of 21-year-old Curry and 23-year-old Underhill in the back row, this is an experienced England side, with a total of 731 caps in the starting XV. Back-row pair Sam Underhill (14) and Tom Curry (18) have just 32 caps between them And on Thursday those players were in relaxed mood despite the biggest game of their lives being just 48 hours away. Jones invited his entire 31-man squad and the English media together for morning coffee before the players were given time with their families and parents to go out around Shinjuku for lunch. On Friday they will go through one last light training run at Yokohama Stadium before returning to their hotel in central Tokyo and a team meeting led by skipper Farrell. It will be Jones' own third World Cup final after his Wallabies side were beaten by England in 2003 and the Springbok team he was helping to advise saw off England in Paris four years later. He said: ""I'll be looking back at the lessons of 2003 and 2007, and even 2011. ""You can never take anything for granted. You have to go out there and take the game. ""You might be favourites, but you have to go out there and win the game, and that's our approach on Saturday. ""I'm anxious, nervous, excited. It's always a blend of the two emotions. I'm sure South Africa are sitting in their hotel thinking the same way."" England team to play South Africa:Elliot Daly; Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell, Jonny May, George Ford, Ben Youngs; Mako Vunipola, Jamie George, Kyle Sinckler, Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Billy Vunipola Replacements:Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Marler, Dan Cole, George Kruis, Mark Wilson, Ben Spencer, Henry Slade, Jonathan Joseph Rugby World Cup England Rugby Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser FA Cup: Watch Everton v Peterborough plus two more games - and reaction to Dyche dismissal Everton sack manager Dyche with club 16th in Premier League Ryan Giggs - what happened?

"UK car production fell by 3.8% in September because of political uncertainty at home and weaker overseas demand, says the industry's trade body. Fears over a possible no-deal Brexit dampened demand in the UK, while exports fell 3.4%, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. Overall car output for the year to date plunged 15.6%, making it the weakest three quarters since 2011. SMMT added that British carmakers had spent Â£500m on no-deal Brexit measures. ""Another bitterly disappointing month reflects domestic and international market contraction,"" said SMMT's chief executive Mike Hawes. ""Most worrying of all, though, is the continued threat of a 'no-deal' Brexit, something which has caused international investment to stall and cost UK operations hundreds of millions of pounds, money that would have better been spent in meeting the technological challenges facing the global industry."" Brexit shutdown cuts car output by 45% Car industry investment plummets in UK What's behind the car industry crisis? The trade body said that the latest car production figures, which compare output with the same month a year earlier, capped a 15-month period of decline for the sector. In addition to dealing with escalating international trade tensions and technological challenges, British carmakers also had to ""divert huge resources"" to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, the SMMT said. The UK's automotive industry is closely integrated with European suppliers and markets. Many models rely on a stream of components imported from the EU. And eight out of 10 cars built in the UK are exported. BMW's mini factory in Oxford was closed during April to prepare for a Brexit which didn't happen The SMMT has previously suggested that leaving the EU with no transition deal in place would cause ""permanent devastation"" to the industry. The agreement to push back the UK's departure date until January 2020 has meant the immediate prospect of a no-deal Brexit has been avoided. The government has said it hopes to have a free-trade deal with the EU in place by the end of the Brexit transition period in December 2020. However, a general election to be held on 12 December will determine future Brexit policy. Mr Hawes added: ""A general election may ultimately provide some certainty, but does not yet remove the spectre of no-deal, which will continue to inhibit the UK industry's prospects unless we can agree and implement a new, ambitious and permanent relationship that safeguards free and frictionless trade.""

"This video can not be played Rugby World Cup final: England will play without fear - Eddie Jones Rugby World Cup final: England v South Africa Venue:Yokohama International StadiumDate:Saturday, 2 NovemberKick-off:09:00 GMT Coverage:Live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. England head coach Eddie Jones says his team are ready to produce their finest hour after naming an unchanged team for Saturday's World Cup final against South Africa. Captain Owen Farrell, leading try-scorer Jonny May and prop Kyle Sinckler have all been passed fit after carrying knocks from the semi-final win over New Zealand. Farrell stays at inside centre with George Ford once again picked at fly-half, while scrum-half Ben Spencer is on the bench after flying out last weekend as emergency cover following an injury to Willi Heinz. Jones said: ""We know South Africa are going to come at us, and we're going to come at them even harder. ""I've got no doubt that they'll play better, but we'll play better - we will play with no fear. ""We're confident in the game we have and we're confident in the way we've prepared. ""We're ready to go. Hang on to your seats, because it's the last dip of the rollercoaster."" England produced what many critics described as the greatest performance in their history to see off three-time world champions New Zealand 19-7 last Saturday. SA wing Kolbe returns to face England 'George Ford has moved out of Owen Farrell's shadow' Wales v New Zealand: Owen Lane to start as one of nine changes Rugby Union Weekly at the World Cup The form shown by the 10-12 combination of Ford and Farrell and the outstanding displays of Sinckler, Maro Itoje, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill have persuaded Jones - in his 50th game in charge of the side - to stick with the same XV for the first time all tournament, despite the direct, muscular threat posed by the Springboks. Jones has the highest winning percentage of any coach to take charge of England, and a second World Cup triumph, 16 years after Sir Clive Woodward's team took the first, would be the ultimate valediction for his four sometimes controversial years in charge. He said: ""That was always our aim, to be here on 2 November in the Yokohama Stadium. ""So we've achieved one goal, but we know what's at stake in the final, and we're well prepared. ""South Africa are a different proposition - they're much more physical, they come through you at the front door, whereas New Zealand it's the front door and back door. ""We have to make adjustments, but we're ready for the brutality of the game. ""Our players have had the will to prepare. They've pushed themselves through some tough physical tasks. ""They've worked hard to get the right tactical game and they've worked hard to build the bonds between them."" Despite the youth of 21-year-old Curry and 23-year-old Underhill in the back row, this is an experienced England side, with a total of 731 caps in the starting XV. Back-row pair Sam Underhill (14) and Tom Curry (18) have just 32 caps between them And on Thursday those players were in relaxed mood despite the biggest game of their lives being just 48 hours away. Jones invited his entire 31-man squad and the English media together for morning coffee before the players were given time with their families and parents to go out around Shinjuku for lunch. On Friday they will go through one last light training run at Yokohama Stadium before returning to their hotel in central Tokyo and a team meeting led by skipper Farrell. It will be Jones' own third World Cup final after his Wallabies side were beaten by England in 2003 and the Springbok team he was helping to advise saw off England in Paris four years later. He said: ""I'll be looking back at the lessons of 2003 and 2007, and even 2011. ""You can never take anything for granted. You have to go out there and take the game. ""You might be favourites, but you have to go out there and win the game, and that's our approach on Saturday. ""I'm anxious, nervous, excited. It's always a blend of the two emotions. I'm sure South Africa are sitting in their hotel thinking the same way."" England team to play South Africa:Elliot Daly; Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell, Jonny May, George Ford, Ben Youngs; Mako Vunipola, Jamie George, Kyle Sinckler, Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Billy Vunipola Replacements:Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Marler, Dan Cole, George Kruis, Mark Wilson, Ben Spencer, Henry Slade, Jonathan Joseph Rugby World Cup England Rugby Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser FA Cup: Watch Everton v Peterborough plus two more games - and reaction to Dyche dismissal Everton sack manager Dyche with club 16th in Premier League Ryan Giggs - what happened?

"This video can not be played Horses flee a burning ranch in Simi Valley, California Residents of San Bernardino awoke early on Thursday to a rapidly-spreading fire covering 200 acres, one of several raging in southern California. The Hillside fire, east of Los Angeles, spread faster than firefighters could contain it during intense winds. Another major blaze had erupted on Wednesday dozens of miles away on the far side of Los Angeles. The US National Weather Service said conditions were ""extremely critical and life threatening"". The strong gusts of wind fanning the flames have at times approached hurricane-level speeds of more than 74mph (119km/h). In San Bernardino, about 490 homes were evacuated â about 1,300 people, and those evacuations remained in effect by 06:00 local time (13:00 GMT) as more than 500 firefighters tackled the blaze. A car burns in a collapsing garage of a home in San Bernardino The Easy fire, in Simi Valley, was being battled by more than 700 people, Ventura County fire said, and had spread to cover 1,723 acres â an area twice the size of New York's Central Park. At one point on Wednesday it threatened to engulf the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Fires across California over the past week have led to mass evacuations and power cuts. Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state-wide emergency. California fires 'can now happen any year' Why do Santa Ana winds make wildfires worse? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external As the so-called Santa Ana winds swept in, the National Weather Service issued rare ""extreme red flag"" warnings for Los Angeles and Ventura counties. ""I don't know if I've ever seen us use this warning,"" said forecaster Marc Chenard. Palls of smoke from the wildfires could be seen from the International Space Station. Allow Twitter content?

Ventura County Fire's information officer, Mike DesForges, said that more than 1,000 firefighters had been deployed to battle the Easy Fire at one point. ""At the height of the fire, 7,000 homes were evacuated and were directly threatened by fire,"" he said. San Bernardino County Fire chief Kathleen Opliger urged residents to stay away from their homes during the evacuation order. ""We still have a lot of work to do up there to get rid of the hot spots and take care of that,"" she said on Thursday. ""This fire moves so fast, and continues to have the potential to move so quickly, that if folks don't evacuate when we ask them to it'll be very difficult to try to get them out when the fire is moving towards their home."" This home in the north of San Bernardino was engulfed early on Thursday The fire in Simi Valley also led to the evacuation of nearby homes Aircraft carrying water and fire-retardant joined the effort to protect the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, which is about 40 miles north-west of LA. Staff were advised to ""shelter in place"" as emergency crews tackled the flames. Library director Duke Blackwood later announced that the building was out of danger. He said artefacts had already been moved to safety to protect them. It was later revealed that a herd of goats probably helped to save the hilltop library. They had been hired to eat an area of flammable shrubs earlier this year, creating a fire break. In photos: Goats help save presidential library Goats near the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library also had to be rescued Ventura County's assistant fire chief Chad Cook said the Easy Fire had quickly ""outflanked"" crews fanned by the winds. ""We did experience gusts up to 65mph this morning which made long-range spotting very, very dangerous and also quickly outpaced the initial attack resources,"" he said. There are fears that the winds will also fan the nearby Getty Fire, which has already scorched 745 acres. Meanwhile, authorities in northern California said progress had been made in tackling the Kincade Fire which ignited last week. This video can not be played Smoke from Kincade Fire seen from space The fire covered 76,825 acres and triggered evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people. On Wednesday, officials said the blaze was 30% contained. Meanwhile, energy supplier Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) cut off power to nearly 400,000 more homes across California on Wednesday as a precaution against damaged power cables starting more fires. The utility has come in for strong criticism for pre-emptively shutting off power to thousands of properties. The company says it is a matter of public safety but critics say the precautionary blackouts have been too widespread and too disruptive.

"Carl Marshall is described as a ""loveable character"" who is well-known around the town A popular pub regular has thanked a town who rallied to give his ""appalling"" home a makeover. Carl Marshall, 89, left his house in Glossop a year ago over fears it was bad for his health. It had no heating or carpets and was plagued by damp and mice - conditions that shocked those who saw it. To help, the community of the Derbyshire town came together over 11 months to completely rebuild the inside of the house.

"Human Rights Watch based its report on dozens of witness and local resident accounts Afghan strike forces backed by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have committed abuses ""amounting to war crimes"", according to a new report. Human Rights Watch (HRW) alleges the troops ""committed summary executions and other grave abuses without accountability"". These include extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances and attacks on healthcare facilities. Afghanistan's government told the BBC the current situation was unacceptable. Disputing the report, the CIA said its covert operations were carried out in ""accordance with law and under a robust system of oversight"". The Afghan war: The short and long story A month of killing in Afghanistan What could peace in Afghanistan look like? Both the UN and the New York Times have previously highlighted allegations of abuses by Afghan strike teams. This latest report,externalcomes after peace talks between the US and the Taliban collapsed in September. Two Afghan men from Maidan Wardak province spoke to the BBC about alleged US-backed raids on their home. One man named Masihurahman said he lost 12 members of his family, including his wife, four daughters and three sons, when a ""huge bomb"" was dropped on his village. Masihurahman said a ""huge bomb"" was dropped on his village, killing many of his family members ""They martyred them all,"" he said. ""When I returned, I found my house in rubble."" Another man, Wahidullah, said troops broke into his home and dragged him and his family out. He said they took them to the top of a mountain, where Americans ""gave them the order"" to carry out killings. HRW's report is based on interviews with dozens of local residents and witnesses to raids throughout Afghanistan, as well as local human rights groups. In full, it is titled: ""They've shot many like this: Abusive night raids by CIA-backed Afghan strike forces"". Seen by the BBC before its release on Thursday, the report documents 14 individual cases between late 2017 and mid-2019 in which CIA-backed Afghan strike forces allegedly committed abuses. Forces conducted night raids, in which they dragged people out of their homes without prior warning. Among the allegations are claims they targeted medical staff who treated militants in contested or Taliban-controlled areas, and summarily executed or ""forcibly disappeared"" people in custody. This video can not be played Inside one of the country's busiest hospitals Moreover, the troops ""seem to have unlawfully targeted civilians because of mistaken identity, poor intelligence, or political rivalries in the locality"". Civilian casualties from these raids have dramatically increased in the past two years, the report says. ""They are illustrative of a larger pattern of serious laws-of-war violations - some amounting to war crimes - that extends to all provinces in Afghanistan where these paramilitary forces operate with impunity,"" it adds. Deadly US strikes on Afghan drug labs 'unlawful' Counting the cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan According to the report, the CIA has run counter-terrorism operations separate from the US military since 2001. It continues to recruit, arm, train and deploy paramilitary groups to tackle militants across the country, which one diplomat in the report referred to as ""death squads"". Since 2017, the US authorised these groups to call in air strikes even without US forces present, which HRW says has led to more strikes on residential buildings. HRW has called on the Afghan government to immediately disband all pro-government armed groups and strike forces, fully investigate the allegations, end attacks on medical facilities and provide compensation to civilian victims. A spokesman for the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, told the BBC the government was taking the allegations in the report seriously. Separately, Afghanistan's Office of the National Security Council said the HRW report ""reflected some realities"", but stressed there was ""some information that requires clarification"". ""We are undertaking further reform initiatives to enable us to deal with these issues,"" the office said. In a statement, the CIA rejected the HRW report, suggesting many of the allegations were ""likely false or exaggerated"". ""We neither condone nor would knowingly participate in illegal activities, and we continually work with our foreign partners to promote adherence to the law,"" the CIA said. The New York Times published a report,externalon the alleged abuses of these strike forces in December 2018. According to the article, these CIA-backed forces have worked ""unconstrained by battlefield rules designed to protect civilians"", which has undercut US attempts to strengthen Afghanistan's government and institutions. This video can not be played The BBC enters Taliban-controlled territory in Faryab province, Afghanistan's 'no-man's land' One official quoted in the New York Times also ""bluntly"" accused the groups of war crimes. In April 2019,the UN published a report,externalshowing for the first time civilian deaths by pro-government forces outstripping those by militants in the first quarter of the year. Their report also highlights strike forces backed by ""international military forces"", reiterating its concern that these groups ""appear to act with impunity, outside of the governmental chain of command"". Hundreds of thousands have died in Afghanistan since US-led forces toppled the Taliban government in 2001, including tens of thousands of civilians. US President Donald Trump seemed close to a deal with the Taliban in September. Butthe president abruptly called off peace talksafter the militants admitted killing a US soldier. The Taliban told the BBCtheir ""doors are open"" should he wish to resume negotiations. The group has refused to hold talks with Afghanistan's government until a US deal is agreed, as they do not recognise its legitimacy.

"This video can not be played Survivors were treated at nearby hospitals in the hours after the blaze At least 74 people have died after a train travelling between the Pakistani cities of Karachi and Rawalpindi caught fire in the middle of its journey. Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said the fire started when a gas cylinder, which passengers were using to cook breakfast on board, exploded. The huge blaze spread to at least three carriages. According to officials cited in local media, many victims died as they tried to jump off the moving, burning train. Another 40 people were injured. Officials say the number of victims may still rise. Are rail accidents at a record high in Pakistan? BBC Urdu's Farhat Javed, who visited hospitals where victims are being treated, said many patients were too traumatised to speak. Survivor Shahid Imran told the BBC he realised a fire had broken out when he heard screaming. He pushed his wife out of a window and then jumped after her. Mr Imran was slightly hurt in the fall from the moving train, but his wife suffered severe head injuries. Another survivor told the BBC they pulled the emergency chain to get the train to stop, but it did not slow down. Doctors are treating people for burns, broken limbs and head injuries, our correspondent said. The accident happened near the town of Rahim Yar Khan in the south of Punjab province. Many passengers were pilgrims heading to Raiwind near Lahore for one of Pakistan's largest annual religious congregations, organised by the Tablighi Jamaat Sunni Muslim missionary movement. Three carriages were set alight, officials said, with 54 people in the 11th carriage and 78 each in carriages 12 and 13. Most of these passengers were on their way to the religious festival. Mohammad Ramzan, who was on board, told BBC Urdusome pilgrims were making tea when their gas cylinder exploded. He jumped from the train to safety. Survivor Jamshed Pathan told BBC Urdu he was in carriage 11 when they realised there was a fire, and that it had broken out just after they finished morning prayers. ""There was chaos everywhere,"" he said. ""It was very difficult for us to get out and save ourselves."" Another man, who gave his name as Ghaffar, said he could smell something in the night, ""but no one paid attention"". He and his friends helped rush injured passengers to hospital. ""I have no words to explain what we saw,"" he said. ""The rescue teams got there very late."" The injured were taken to hospitals including this one in Bahawalpur District deputy commissioner Jamil Ahmed said some of the victims had suffered such severe burns that they could not be identified without DNA testing. Evidence is now being collected at the scene and sent off for forensic tests, an anonymous official told BBC Urdu. ""Two cooking stoves blew up. They were cooking, they had [cooking] oil which added fuel to fire,"" Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said. Passengers bringing stoves onto trains in order to cook meals on long journeys was a common problem, the minister said. Though it is common to carry food on board, gas cylinders are banned. But other reports from the scene suggest electrical problems could have been the cause. Several survivors have reportedly said they believed a short-circuit on board may have been to blame. Prime Minister Imran Khan said he was ""deeply saddened by the terrible tragedy"",external, adding that he had ordered an ""immediate inquiry"" into the cause of the fire. After an earlier suspension in the wake of the blaze, the railways minister said services had now been restored. By Abid Hussain, BBC Urdu Train travel is one of the most popular means of transport in Pakistan, particularly among middle- and lower-income groups. Built by the British during pre-partition era, the railway tracks cover the length of the country. However, while some of the upscale trains have dedicated dining carriages, most of the country's trains are in poor condition and have barely functioning amenities. Therefore, passengers choose to bring things along with them, or refresh themselves where the trains stop. They also take advantage of the fact that inspection is more relaxed than at airports, bringing banned items like cooking stoves and oil canisters to keep themselves sustained during the long hours on board. This particular service - Tezgam - is one of the oldest and most popular, travelling between Karachi in the south and Rawalpindi in the north. The journey takes more than 25 hours,external, with each of its carriages boasting space for somewhere between 60 and 80 passengers on bunk beds. Tickets cost between 1,500 rupees ($9.60; Â£7.40) and 5,000 rupees ($32; Â£24.80), depending on the class. This is Pakistan's worst rail disaster in over a decade, but the country has a history of fatal railway accidents. Casualty figures are often high because trains are packed with far greater numbers of passengers than they were designed for. In July, 11 people died in an accident, with four dying in another accident in September. In 2007, at least 56 people were killed,externaland more than 120 injured in a crash near Mehrabpur. And in 2005, more than 130 people were killed whenthree trains collided in Sindh province,externalin one of the country's worst train disasters. Driver killed and dozens injured in Japan train crash.

"This video can not be played Horses flee a burning ranch in Simi Valley, California Residents of San Bernardino awoke early on Thursday to a rapidly-spreading fire covering 200 acres, one of several raging in southern California. The Hillside fire, east of Los Angeles, spread faster than firefighters could contain it during intense winds. Another major blaze had erupted on Wednesday dozens of miles away on the far side of Los Angeles. The US National Weather Service said conditions were ""extremely critical and life threatening"". The strong gusts of wind fanning the flames have at times approached hurricane-level speeds of more than 74mph (119km/h). In San Bernardino, about 490 homes were evacuated â about 1,300 people, and those evacuations remained in effect by 06:00 local time (13:00 GMT) as more than 500 firefighters tackled the blaze. A car burns in a collapsing garage of a home in San Bernardino The Easy fire, in Simi Valley, was being battled by more than 700 people, Ventura County fire said, and had spread to cover 1,723 acres â an area twice the size of New York's Central Park. At one point on Wednesday it threatened to engulf the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Fires across California over the past week have led to mass evacuations and power cuts.

Ventura County Fire's information officer, Mike DesForges, said that more than 1,000 firefighters had been deployed to battle the Easy Fire at one point. ""At the height of the fire, 7,000 homes were evacuated and were directly threatened by fire,"" he said. San Bernardino County Fire chief Kathleen Opliger urged residents to stay away from their homes during the evacuation order. ""We still have a lot of work to do up there to get rid of the hot spots and take care of that,"" she said on Thursday. ""This fire moves so fast, and continues to have the potential to move so quickly, that if folks don't evacuate when we ask them to it'll be very difficult to try to get them out when the fire is moving towards their home."" This home in the north of San Bernardino was engulfed early on Thursday The fire in Simi Valley also led to the evacuation of nearby homes Aircraft carrying water and fire-retardant joined the effort to protect the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, which is about 40 miles north-west of LA. Staff were advised to ""shelter in place"" as emergency crews tackled the flames. Library director Duke Blackwood later announced that the building was out of danger. He said artefacts had already been moved to safety to protect them. It was later revealed that a herd of goats probably helped to save the hilltop library. They had been hired to eat an area of flammable shrubs earlier this year, creating a fire break. In photos: Goats help save presidential library Goats near the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library also had to be rescued Ventura County's assistant fire chief Chad Cook said the Easy Fire had quickly ""outflanked"" crews fanned by the winds. ""We did experience gusts up to 65mph this morning which made long-range spotting very, very dangerous and also quickly outpaced the initial attack resources,"" he said. There are fears that the winds will also fan the nearby Getty Fire, which has already scorched 745 acres. Meanwhile, authorities in northern California said progress had been made in tackling the Kincade Fire which ignited last week. This video can not be played Smoke from Kincade Fire seen from space The fire covered 76,825 acres and triggered evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people. On Wednesday, officials said the blaze was 30% contained. Meanwhile, energy supplier Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) cut off power to nearly 400,000 more homes across California on Wednesday as a precaution against damaged power cables starting more fires. The utility has come in for strong criticism for pre-emptively shutting off power to thousands of properties. The company says it is a matter of public safety but critics say the precautionary blackouts have been too widespread and too disruptive. PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January after facing hundreds of lawsuits from victims of wildfires in 2017 and 2018.

"This video can not be played Is burning rubbish a good way of disposing of it? Sending rubbish to landfill is better than burning it in large incinerators, the chairman of the assembly's environment committee has claimed. Labour AM Mike Hedges described incineration as ""a very dangerous way of getting rid of waste materials"". He wants the Welsh Government to ban any new plants from being developed here, except for burning medical waste. It said they were a ""transitionary step"" but the long-term solution was to move away from single-use plastics. And others have argued more incinerators are needed if Wales is to achieve its ambition of becoming a ""zero waste"" nation by 2050. Mr Hedges, who has campaigned in the past against a proposed incinerator in his Swansea East constituency, said his main concern was around emissions. ""Some of it will be carbon dioxide which is very bad for global warming, some of it will be nitrous oxide and dioxins which we know are bad for health."" ""Hospitals need them, they have to get rid of pathogens in some of the medical waste but there's no reason why domestic waste needs to be incinerated."" ""Can we get on with reduction rather than looking for ways of getting rid of more and more waste?"" In the meantime, he said landfill was ""a slightly less bad option"". ""As long as you have it in an area that's secure it will stay there, instead of putting it out into the atmosphere that may do us harm."" Another senior AM, Plaid Cymru's Dai Lloyd, chair of the assembly's health committee, also told BBC Wales he supported a ban on new incinerators. ""We must do everything we can to avoid more air pollution,"" Dr Lloyd said. ""The answer is to invest in specialist plants to recycle plastics in Wales, which we can't do at the moment."" Conservative environment spokesman Andrew RT Davies repeated his calls for a moratorium on new large-scale incinerators until there was a national plan to deal with them. ""We believe there should be no development of large-scale incinerators in communities where there is no history of large waste businesses, or without comparable large scale industry and suitable infrastructure,"" he said. There are two incinerators - or ""energy from waste"" plants - already operating in Wales and two more have been built. Crymlyn Burrows in Swansea opened in 2002 to deal with waste from Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend, although it has been forced to close on occasions in past years forbreaching the emission limit for dioxins. Trident Park, operated by Viridor near Splott, Cardiff, deals with 172,000 tonnes of waste a year from five councils - and generates 250 GWh of electricity for the National Grid. Wheelabrator expects to have its Parc Adfer plant - on an old steelworks site on Deeside - open by the end of 2019 The developers behind a controversial incinerator at Barry Dock hope to be up and running by the end of the year. Meanwhile the Â£800m Parc Adfer plant on Deeside is expected to be operational by the end of 2019 and will process 200,000 tonnes of waste a year from Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd and Anglesey, that would otherwise end up in landfill. A Wheelabrator Technologies spokeswoman said once fully operational the plant would generate enough renewable energy to meet the needs of more than 30,000 homes and businesses. ""In addition Parc Adfer will enable recycling of valuable materials and has already created opportunities for a wide range of local suppliers and supply chain companies,"" she said. Six more proposals are at various stages on the road in the planning process. They include revived plans for a plant on the site of the old Llynfi power station near Llangynwyd, Bridgend, controversial proposals which have beenrejected by planners for Llansamlet, Swanseaand a Â£150m plant at Wentloog on the outskirts of Cardiff. Recycle for Wales, a national campaign funded by the Welsh Government, argues that improvements in technology and regulation meanincineration emissions have fallen significantly in recent decades,external, and the plants also turn waste into renewable electricity and heat. It claims landfill is not a sustainable option for dealing with our rubbish as space is running out, and it also creates methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Robin Latchem, a former editor of trade journal Materials Recycling World said incineration played ""a key part in making sure nothing goes to landfill"". More plants would be required, he predicted, as the commercial and industrial sectors are weaned off sending their waste to be buried. ""We don't want to stick it in the ground or send it abroad, so until you and I get much better at recycling, and the manufacturers and all the people in the supply chains make their packaging easier to recycle and make less of it - you have to incinerate."" ""It's a stop-gap, a shock absorber."" Waste incinerator rejected after Extinction Rebellion protest 'Monster' incinerator rejected Protesters stop waste lorries Barry docks incinerator decision 'long-awaited' The ""bad press"" incinerators have received could be addressed, he suggested, if developers and local authorities were ""a lot smarter about what the plants do once they're installed"" such as providing affordable heating for communities so they see the benefits ""in their pockets"". The Welsh Government has set a limit on the amount of household rubbish that can be sent to incinerators until 2025. ""As a responsible nation, we want to deal effectively with our non-recyclable waste in a way which prevents it from either polluting the environment or sees the problem being exported,"" a spokesman said. ""For this reason we have invested in infrastructure to extract electricity and heat from this material and dispose of it safely, to the highest environmental standards."" Councils are allowed to send up to 30% of household waste to be turned into power or heat, in order to encourage efforts to recycle the rest. A petition against an incinerator in the Usk Valley has been presented to Monmouthshire council The incinerator would provide electricity and heat for a poultry farm, with the potential to supply the National Grid Plans to expand a private gasification plant in the Usk Valley,externalhave led campaigners to present a 1000-signature petition to Monmouthshire council. David Morgan of Trostrey Court near Llancayo hopes to turn waste wood and non-recyclable plastics, into electricity for his farm and the National Grid. Lindsey Williams, who is coordinating the campaign group's efforts, said it was worried about air pollution and carbon emissions from the site. It comes at a time when the council has declared its own""climate emergency"". ""It's ridiculous for the council to try to reduce its emissions on the one hand and then think of approving a plant like this on the other,"" Mrs Williams said. ""That's even before we start to think about traffic and the visual impact of an industrial plant in the valley."" ""We think gasification is last century's technology and involves bringing waste long distances."" Mr Morgan told BBC Wales his planning application was simply for a storage building for the fuel. The generator itself has already been built, with all relevant consents in place. He claims the site has been operational for the last four years, though the campaigners dispute this. An environmental report prepared on his behalf and submitted to the council concluded emissions were likely to be ""negligible"" and the effect of production processes ""well below"" relevant critical levels at nearby sensitive ecological sites.

"This video can not be played ""Mum was holding HUG and her face was just happy"" ""It's kind of brought her back again."" Alison Webb had watched her mother Margaret, 73, ""slipping further and further away"" because of dementia. Margaret has been using a device called a HUG, aimed at improving the mental well-being of people with advanced dementia - who often experience anxiety and depression. After it helped her and others, the design team at Cardiff Metropolitan University now want to produce it commercially. ""Every time I came to visit I seemed to be losing a little bit more of her. ""The smiles were less frequent, the recognition of me was slipping away."" Thousands of young dementia sufferers 'undiagnosed' Toddlers to help dementia patients in Conwy restore memories Margaret worked her whole life in a bank, brought up Alison alone and enjoyed travelling and spending time with her three grandchildren. But the smiling, happy, hard-working, loving mother she knew started disappearing before her eyes after being diagnosed with dementia 10 years ago. The HUG has helped Margaret, who has had dementia for 10 years Residents in Cardiff have been trialling the HUG In the spring the Sunrise Senior Living home in Cardiff, where Margaret lives, took delivery of 20 HUGs as part of a trial, and she was one of the first people to be given one. While it looks like a soft toy on the outside, it has a beating heart and speaker that can play chosen music and sounds. Alison said: ""I walked in and Mum was holding the HUG in the dining room and her face was just happy... almost serene and it was lovely. ""The icing on the cake was the music. All my mum's favourite songs are there - musicals, Elvis, Tom Jones, Abba."" Danny Langhorn from Sunrise said: ""The HUG is not intrusive to them, it's not a person... they're not feeling threatened. ""They're just able to sit there, listen and in their own time start feeling comfortable."" It was designed by a team led by Cathy Treadaway at the university's Centre for Applied Research in Inclusive Arts and Design, or Cariad. The HUG was designed with dementia patient Thelma in mind The idea came about after a visit to a care home in Port Talbot, during a project to design objects for people with dementia. ""Thelma's carers asked us to make something for her, and when we asked them what kind of thing they wanted us to make, they told us the only thing they could think that Thelma needed was a hug, so we went away and came up with HUG,"" said Prof Treadaway. Thelma showed improvement within a week: opening her eyes, engaging with other residents of the home, and her falls - which had been frequent - stopped completely. The team then applied for more funding from the Welsh Government to see if Thelma's response could be replicated. Dementia is the umbrella term to describe around 100 conditions including Alzheimer's and is the leading cause of death in Wales and England. About 40,000 people in Wales are living with dementia and there is currently no cure. Last week theUS drug company Biogen announced it was ready to bring a drugto the market which it said could slow Alzheimer's. Cathy Treadaway led the team which designed the HUG But approval could take a year or two and if successful the company aims to initially offer the drug to patients previously enrolled on clinical studies of the drug. It could be some time before the drug reaches the UK. But Alison says she's grateful to see her mum Margaret happy again.

"This video can not be played Bronze Age monument discovered in Forest of Dean A previously unknown Bronze Age monument has been discovered hidden in woodland in the Forest of Dean following an airborne laser scan. The ritual monument, known as a ring cairn, dates back to about 2,000 BC. It consists of a circular bank with several small limestone standing stones on top. Archaeologist Jon Hoyle, who found it, said it was the only site of its kind known about in Gloucestershire, and was a ""very significant"" discovery. Archaeologist Jon Hoyle said nobody knows precisely what ring cairns were used for It was identified following a LiDAR (light detection and ranging) survey of the Forest of Dean. The technique used laser beams fired from an aeroplane to create a 3D record of the land surface, effectively removing the trees from the landscape. Mr Hoyle said when he studied the data, he spotted an ""extremely circular"" feature, which he thought initially might be a World War Two gun emplacement. After visiting the site, at a secret location near the village of Tidenham, he realised it was much older, dating to between 2,500 BC and 1,500 BC. A LiDAR survey of the forest revealed the circular feature beneath the trees ""It was very exciting. I was expecting to find quite a lot of new sites with the LiDAR, but nothing as interesting as this."" The ring cairn is about 25m (80ft) in diameter and made up of a 5m-wide (16ft) rubble bank, with at least 10 white limestone standing stones, each no more than 1m (3ft) high, standing on top. Mr Hoyle said ring cairns were ""common in upland areas, in places like Derbyshire, Northumberland and Wales"" but this was the only known one in Gloucestershire. Mr Hoyle said the discovery was ""very exciting"" ""Nobody knows precisely what they were used for. Some have been found in association with burials, and often there appear to be residues of charcoal in places like this, suggesting rituals that involved fire,"" he added. The discovery is featured in a new book by Mr Hoyle - Hidden Landscapes of the Forest of Dean. Pub regular, 89, 'thrilled' as locals fix up home Do these photographs show Banksy at work?

"This video can not be played Survivors were treated at nearby hospitals in the hours after the blaze At least 74 people have died after a train travelling between the Pakistani cities of Karachi and Rawalpindi caught fire in the middle of its journey. Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said the fire started when a gas cylinder, which passengers were using to cook breakfast on board, exploded. The huge blaze spread to at least three carriages. According to officials cited in local media, many victims died as they tried to jump off the moving, burning train. Another 40 people were injured. Officials say the number of victims may still rise. Are rail accidents at a record high in Pakistan? BBC Urdu's Farhat Javed, who visited hospitals where victims are being treated, said many patients were too traumatised to speak. Survivor Shahid Imran told the BBC he realised a fire had broken out when he heard screaming. He pushed his wife out of a window and then jumped after her. Mr Imran was slightly hurt in the fall from the moving train, but his wife suffered severe head injuries. Another survivor told the BBC they pulled the emergency chain to get the train to stop, but it did not slow down. Doctors are treating people for burns, broken limbs and head injuries, our correspondent said. The accident happened near the town of Rahim Yar Khan in the south of Punjab province. Many passengers were pilgrims heading to Raiwind near Lahore for one of Pakistan's largest annual religious congregations, organised by the Tablighi Jamaat Sunni Muslim missionary movement. Three carriages were set alight, officials said, with 54 people in the 11th carriage and 78 each in carriages 12 and 13. Most of these passengers were on their way to the religious festival. Mohammad Ramzan, who was on board, told BBC Urdusome pilgrims were making tea when their gas cylinder exploded. He jumped from the train to safety. Survivor Jamshed Pathan told BBC Urdu he was in carriage 11 when they realised there was a fire, and that it had broken out just after they finished morning prayers. ""There was chaos everywhere,"" he said. ""It was very difficult for us to get out and save ourselves."" Another man, who gave his name as Ghaffar, said he could smell something in the night, ""but no one paid attention"". He and his friends helped rush injured passengers to hospital. ""I have no words to explain what we saw,"" he said. ""The rescue teams got there very late."" The injured were taken to hospitals including this one in Bahawalpur District deputy commissioner Jamil Ahmed said some of the victims had suffered such severe burns that they could not be identified without DNA testing. Evidence is now being collected at the scene and sent off for forensic tests, an anonymous official told BBC Urdu. ""Two cooking stoves blew up. They were cooking, they had [cooking] oil which added fuel to fire,"" Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said. Passengers bringing stoves onto trains in order to cook meals on long journeys was a common problem, the minister said. Though it is common to carry food on board, gas cylinders are banned. But other reports from the scene suggest electrical problems could have been the cause. Several survivors have reportedly said they believed a short-circuit on board may have been to blame. Prime Minister Imran Khan said he was ""deeply saddened by the terrible tragedy"",external, adding that he had ordered an ""immediate inquiry"" into the cause of the fire. After an earlier suspension in the wake of the blaze, the railways minister said services had now been restored. By Abid Hussain, BBC Urdu Train travel is one of the most popular means of transport in Pakistan, particularly among middle- and lower-income groups. Built by the British during pre-partition era, the railway tracks cover the length of the country. However, while some of the upscale trains have dedicated dining carriages, most of the country's trains are in poor condition and have barely functioning amenities. Therefore, passengers choose to bring things along with them, or refresh themselves where the trains stop. They also take advantage of the fact that inspection is more relaxed than at airports, bringing banned items like cooking stoves and oil canisters to keep themselves sustained during the long hours on board. This particular service - Tezgam - is one of the oldest and most popular, travelling between Karachi in the south and Rawalpindi in the north. The journey takes more than 25 hours,external, with each of its carriages boasting space for somewhere between 60 and 80 passengers on bunk beds. Tickets cost between 1,500 rupees ($9.60; Â£7.40) and 5,000 rupees ($32; Â£24.80), depending on the class. This is Pakistan's worst rail disaster in over a decade, but the country has a history of fatal railway accidents. Casualty figures are often high because trains are packed with far greater numbers of passengers than they were designed for. In July, 11 people died in an accident, with four dying in another accident in September. In 2007, at least 56 people were killed,externaland more than 120 injured in a crash near Mehrabpur. And in 2005, more than 130 people were killed whenthree trains collided in Sindh province,externalin one of the country's worst train disasters. Driver killed and dozens injured in Japan train crash.

"This video can not be played These aerial shots show a massive fire consuming Japan's historic Shuri Castle A fire has destroyed all the main structures of Shuri Castle, a Unesco World Heritage site on Japan's southern island of Okinawa. Firefighters battled the flames for more than 10 hours, extinguishing them by Thursday afternoon. No injuries have been reported so far. The wooden castle, built 500 years ago, was almost completely destroyed during World War Two. The current structure is a reconstruction. The castle served as a campus for Okinawa's largest public university until the 1970s, and has been a popular tourist attraction since. The fire started just before 02:40 local time on Thursday (17:40 GMT Wednesday). It is still unclear what might have triggered it. The fire broke out in the early hours of Thursday Firefighters worked for hours to extinguish the flames More than 100 firefighters were called to the scene, but one police officer said fire fighters struggled to contain the fire due to strong winds. ""The many wooden structures and the [recently reapplied] lacquer may have also had an effect,"" the unidentified officer told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. The fire was eventually put out at around 13:30, but all seven key buildings of the castle were burnt down. The main buildings of the castle were completely destroyed Shuri Castle, which was was once the seat of the Ryukyu dynasty, sits on top of a hill overlooking the city of Naha - Okinawa's capital - and is surrounded by curved stone walls. One resident said the castle was seen as ""god-like"". ""To us, the Shuri Castle is a god-like existence,"" 84-year-old Toyoko Miyazato told the Asahi Shimbun. ""I am so sad I don't know what to say."" The castle, which overlooks the city, was a popular tourist attraction The city will now ""do everything in [its] power"" to deal with the fire and its aftermath, its Mayor Mikiko Shiroma told public broadcaster NHK. A massive amount of work will have to be put into rebuilding the castle According to Okinawa's tourism site, the castle burned down three times during the Ryukyu Dynasty and was again destroyed in World War Two during the Battle of Okinawa. Until Thursday's incident it was the largest wooden building in Okinawa. The castle had been scheduled as a stop on the 2020 Tokyo Olympic torch relay route. The castle in all its glory before it was destroyed By Sakiko Shiraishi, BBC News Japan The Ryukyu dynasty was a kingdom that thrived on maritime trade, connecting countries in the region. Shuri Castle, though it had architectural influences from China and Japan, was at the centre of this unique Ryukyu culture. But in 1879, the king was banished from the castle and the dynasty was annexed to become Okinawa prefecture. The castle was completely destroyed in WW2 by American forces in 1945. Many documents and artefacts, which could have helped in the reconstruction, were also lost. The current castle was rebuilt and opened to the public in 1992. It was registered as a World Heritage site in 2000 and was the site for the Okinawa Summit in the same year, appearing in commemorative 2000-yen notes. From Ryukyu to Japan, war to peace - Shuri Castle has been there through everything, and was a symbol of identity for the Okinawa people. Those who saw the end of WW2 in Okinawa have seen the Castle burn twice in their lifetime. Their sorrow is beyond imagination. Japan country profile Japan's moving castle - in 40 secs.

"The two leaders appeared on the Andrew Marr show last April Jeremy Corbyn has challenged Boris Johnson to a head-to-head TV debate during the election campaign. The Labour leader's spokesman said Mr Corbyn was ""committed"" to holding a debate and they were ""in discussion with the broadcasters"". Political leaders' TV debates have featured in the last three general elections in 2010, 2015 and 2017. But Mr Johnson swerved a question earlier from Lib Dem Jo Swinson, who challenged him to a debate. If the government's election bill is passed into law, as expected, then the UK will go to the polls on 12 December, after a five week campaign. Early on in this summer's Tory leadership race, Mr Johnson was criticised by his opponents for avoiding media scrutiny, but he later took part in a head-to-head with rival Jeremy Hunt. During that campaign, Mr Johnson said he was ""very keen"" on TV debates. Election TV debates had 'crucial role' TV political debates: Lessons from history Mr Corbyn's spokesman said: ""As we demanded of Theresa May and she refused to agree, we would challenge Boris Johnson to agree today to head-to-head TV debates in this campaign."" However, when asked about a three-way discussion with Ms Swinson, the spokesman replied: ""There are only two people who can be prime minister at the end of this campaign and I think the British public have a clear right to see them debate head-to-head on TV and hear their cases."" Amber Rudd stood in for Theresa May in the BBC's 2017 election debate In 2017, then Conservative Party leader Theresa May declined to take part in TV debates ahead of the general election, saying she preferred ""to get out and about and meet voters"". Instead, then Home Secretary Amber Rudd stood in for Mrs May during a BBC debate. At Prime Minister's Questions, Liberal Democrat leader Ms Swinson told MPs that voters ""deserve better than a choice between the two tired old parties"", adding: ""So will the prime minister commit today to take part in those three-way debates or is he going to run scared?"" Mr Johnson replied: ""What the people of this country want is their promises kept. ""I'm not disposed to believe in the promises of the Liberal Democrats when their leaflets in London say they want to revoke the result of the referendum and their leaflets in the south-west of the country don't mention Brexit at all.""

"Quebec Premier Francois Legault A Canadian province will soon require economic immigrants to pass a ""values test"" under a newly proposed policy. Quebec Premier Francois Legault says potential immigrants to the province should be aware of values like the equal rights of men and women. The provincial government says the test questions will be based on its charter of rights. The policy is to take effect on 1 January 2020. Potential immigrants can retake the online values test if they fail. A passing grade is 75%. They also have the option of taking a course covering the topics in question if they struggle to pass. Mr Legault said newcomers should also know about a provincial secularism bill that bars civil servants in positions of ""authority"" from wearing religious symbols like the kippah, turban, or hijab while at work. That controversial legislation includes judges, police officers and teachers. The 20-question evaluation will focus on issues including democracy, French-speaking Quebec society, state secularism, and equality between men and women. Its goal is to ensure those newcomers ""integrate in French into Quebec society and adhere to Quebec values"", said provincial immigration minister Simon Jolin-Barrette. Examples questions include: ""In Quebec, men and woman have the same rights and are considered equal by law, true or false?"" and ""Identify which of the following examples are discriminatory: refusing to hire a women who is pregnant, a person who doesn't have the required diploma, or a person based on their ethnicity."" The values test is part of an immigration system overhaul by the centre-right CAQ party, which estimates up to 26,300 newcomers - economic immigrants and their family members - will take the test next year. Why this photo with Malala is being criticised Quebec has a special agreement on immigration with Canada's federal government and has broad powers in the selection of immigrants, in particular in the economic category. An immigrant wishing to settle in the province must apply to Quebec for a so-called ""selection certificate"" for which passing the new test will be a prerequisite. He or she must obtain that certificate before applying for permanent residence with the federal government. Is it OK for civil servants to wear religious symbols? Why the star power of Trudeau dimmed The policy is unlikely to be challenged by the federal government. During the recent general election, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it is within the province's mandate to impose such a criterion. Fo Niemi, of the Center for Research-Action on Race Relations, a non-profit civil rights organisation, says he does not oppose the values test per se, but warns ""the devil is in the details"". He worries that the protection of minority rights does not appear to be a topic emphasised in the test.

"This video can not be played These aerial shots show a massive fire consuming Japan's historic Shuri Castle A fire has destroyed all the main structures of Shuri Castle, a Unesco World Heritage site on Japan's southern island of Okinawa. Firefighters battled the flames for more than 10 hours, extinguishing them by Thursday afternoon. No injuries have been reported so far. The wooden castle, built 500 years ago, was almost completely destroyed during World War Two. The current structure is a reconstruction. The castle served as a campus for Okinawa's largest public university until the 1970s, and has been a popular tourist attraction since. The fire started just before 02:40 local time on Thursday (17:40 GMT Wednesday). It is still unclear what might have triggered it. The fire broke out in the early hours of Thursday Firefighters worked for hours to extinguish the flames More than 100 firefighters were called to the scene, but one police officer said fire fighters struggled to contain the fire due to strong winds. ""The many wooden structures and the [recently reapplied] lacquer may have also had an effect,"" the unidentified officer told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. The fire was eventually put out at around 13:30, but all seven key buildings of the castle were burnt down. The main buildings of the castle were completely destroyed Shuri Castle, which was was once the seat of the Ryukyu dynasty, sits on top of a hill overlooking the city of Naha - Okinawa's capital - and is surrounded by curved stone walls. One resident said the castle was seen as ""god-like"". ""To us, the Shuri Castle is a god-like existence,"" 84-year-old Toyoko Miyazato told the Asahi Shimbun. ""I am so sad I don't know what to say."" The castle, which overlooks the city, was a popular tourist attraction The city will now ""do everything in [its] power"" to deal with the fire and its aftermath, its Mayor Mikiko Shiroma told public broadcaster NHK.

"It is unclear if John Bolton will appear before the inquiry Former US National Security Adviser John Bolton has been summoned to testify in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. House of Representatives investigators have invited him to appear next month. Mr Trump has denied using the power of his office to pressure Ukraine to investigate former US Vice-President Joe Biden and his son. Mr Bolton likened the alleged proposal to a ""drug deal"", according to witness testimony. It is unclear if Mr Bolton, who left his position in September after falling out of favour with the president, will appear as scheduled on 7 November. His lawyer, Charles Cooper, told US media his client was not willing to appear voluntarily before the House committee members. But Mr Cooper said he was ready to accept a subpoena - or legal summons to compel testimony - on Mr Bolton's behalf. The Trump impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means At the heart of the impeachment inquiry is a phone call on 25 July between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript of the call shows Mr Trump asking Mr Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated corruption claims against Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who held a lucrative board position with a Ukrainian natural gas firm. According to US media, Mr Bolton was alarmed about a back-channel operation in Ukraine by President Trump's private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Mr Giuliani acknowledged last month in a TV interview having asked Ukraine to investigate Mr Biden. The former US vice-president is a leading Democratic candidate to challenge Mr Trump for the White House next year. This video can not be played Trump impeachment: Last week was the most dramatic so far Mr Bolton's anger over alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine for political help reportedly triggered heated confrontations at the White House over the summer. President Trump's former top adviser on Russia, Fiona Hill, testified that Mr Bolton had told her to alert White House lawyers about Mr Giuliani, according to US media. Mr Bolton reportedly also criticised Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the EU, and Mick Mulvaney, acting White House chief of staff. ""I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,"" Mr Bolton is said to have told Ms Hill. Meanwhile, a top adviser to Mr Trump on Russia and Europe, is reportedly stepping down on the eve of his testimony to the congressional impeachment investigators. Tim Morrison, a National Security Council official, was one of the officials authorised to listen in on Mr Trump's July call with the president of Ukraine. Mr Morrison is still expected to testify on Thursday, despite the White House urging officials to shun the proceedings. Also on Thursday, the House is preparing to take its first formal vote on the path ahead for the impeachment process, which has until now been conducted behind closed doors. Democrats are planning public hearings in a matter of weeks, and considering the possibility of drafting articles of impeachment against the president. The Trump-Zelensky phone call was the subject of a complaint by a whistleblower, whose identity has been closely protected by lawmakers. On Wednesday evening, a conservative author named a CIA officer as the whistleblower. Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office. If the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted and removed. President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached. Hang on, why was Trump impeached again? Impeachment: Most dramatic week yet.

"John Bercow is standing down as Commons Speaker on Thursday after 10 years in the job. His idiosyncratic turn of phrase and distinctive bellow - as he tries to silence the wall of sound emanating from MPs - has made him something of a cult figure on social media. His catchphrase, in fact the traditional cry of Commons speakers through the centuries, is ""Order!"", often elongated and twisted into an extraordinary sound that is all his own. To mark his retirement, the BBC has analysed 100 years of Hansard - the official Parliamentary record - to discover just how different he was to any previous occupant of the chair. The first thing we discovered is that he has said ""Order!"" nearly 14,000 times. But that is just the beginning of the Bercow story in statistics. This video can not be played John Bercow's most memorable moments as Speaker of the House We know John Bercow enjoys a rhetorical flourish, and often intervenes in rowdy Commons debates to deliver withering put-downs to backbench barrackers. But measuring the number of words spoken by the Speaker compared with all words spoken in Commons debates shows an extraordinary willingness to enter the Parliamentary fray compared with his predecessors. It is hard to know for sure whether this is because he has presided over more debates, taking - and providing detailed responses to - more points of order, or because he has a particularly unruly gaggle of MPs to keep in check, or whether he simply likes to talk, but the difference is striking. Not only does Mr Bercow speak more than previous Commons Speakers, his choice of words often stands out. One MP,quoted by the New York Times,external, said: ""It's as if he goes to bed every night, reads a thesaurus, inwardly digests it and then spews it out the next day."" There are many words the Speaker used that have not been uttered by any of his predecessors, certainly since 1916 - the earliest date that transcripts of debates are available on the House of Commons website. Excluding words that make up the names of people or government departments, these are the ones he said most frequently. Other words Mr Bercow has used that other MPs have said extremely rarely, or never, include: ""Demosthenian"", ""Einsteinian"", ""Flaubert"", ""Heidegger"", ""irascibility"", ""jackanapes"", ""rhapsodise"", ""susurrations"" and ""testicle"". Who is John Bercow? Nine MPs make pitch for Bercow's job Effigy of John Bercow to be set alight at bonfire In policy terms, Mr Bercow's time in office was defined by one issue. Counting the number of times particular words are used in Commons debates shows how this is true. His interventions on procedure during Brexit debates were both controversial and pivotal, and are likely to be the most important part of his legacy. Allowing backbench MPs to take control of debate, in order to pass Labour MP Hillary Benn's bill to take no-deal off the table, was just one example. It might seem like a small thing, but a noticeable shift in tone occurred under Mr Bercow's watch. Applauding other MPs in Commons debates used to be strictly forbidden, and there are no recorded instances of applause in the Commons until the then-Speaker Betty (later Baroness) Boothroyd announced her decision to stand down in 2000. Even as recently as 2015, Mr Bercowtold SNP MPs, many of whom were new to the Commons, to ""show some respect"" for the convention forbidding applause. A year later, he said: ""If, spontaneously, a large group of Members bursts into applause, sometimes the most prudent approach is to let it take its course. However, I would much prefer it if it did not happen."" MPs took note of the first part of the ruling, at least.
