"This video can not be played Theresa May described the attempted murder of the former Russian spy as 'despicable' Theresa May has visited Salisbury after the ""brazen"" nerve agent attack on a Russian ex-spy and his daughter. The prime minister was briefed by public health experts, as the pair remain critically ill in hospital. Mrs May has said Russia is ""culpable"" for the attack and that she is expelling 23 Russian diplomats - but Moscow denies all involvement. France, Germany, the US and UKsaid in a joint statementRussian involvement was ""the only plausible explanation"". Mrs May added: ""This happened in the UK, but it could have happened anywhere and we are taking a united stance against it."" What we know so far How is the UK retaliating against Russia? UK to build new chemical defence centre The countries' leaders condemned ""the first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War"". US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House: ""It certainly looks like the Russians were behind it, something that should never ever happen. ""We are taking it very seriously as, I think, are many others."" Mrs May's expulsion of diplomats has prompted Moscow to say it willexpel UK diplomats ""soon"". Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamsonsaid Russia should ""go away and shut up"". The Russian Ministry of Defence called Mr Williamson a ""vulgar old harpy"". Major General Igor Konashenkov said that ""the extreme level of the intellectual impotence"" of Mr Williamson confirmed London's accusations amounted to nothing. ""Long ago, Great Britain became the cosy nest not just for the world's turncoats, but also of all kinds of headquarters for producing fake scandals,"" he added. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has beencriticised for not being firmer in his condemnation of Russia, has defended his stance, clarifying that he did think evidence pointed towards Moscow. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""The source of this weapon, which appears to be Russia... must be brought to justice"" Russianformer spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, remain critically ill in hospital 11 days after they were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire. They had been poisoned with a nerve agent of a type developed by Russiacalled Novichok, the UK government has said. A sample is to be sent to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - the independent international body set up to stop chemical warfare - for analysis. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reportedly said the allegations against Russia were ""absolutely boorish"" and said the UK's approach was partly prompted by its Brexit problems. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in a ""critical but stable"" condition Mrs May thanked emergency services in Salisbury and spoke to members of the public during her visit on Thursday. She also visited Det Sgt Nick Bailey in Salisbury District Hospital, where he is being treated for exposure to the nerve agent after attending to the Skirpals. Her spokesman said the two of them had a ""private conversation"". Wiltshire Chief Constable Kier Pritchard said: ""I know that both he and his wife really appreciated this time with [Mrs May]."" Earlier in the day, police cordoned off streets around Mr Bailey's home in Alderholt - 11 miles from Salisbury -as part of the clean-up operation. Officers from the Metropolitan Police, which is one of 15 forces currently assisting in Wiltshire, were joined by members of the Army, as a hatchback car was taken away in a military vehicle. This video can not be played Theresa May fist bumps a member of the public on her visit to Salisbury Speaking to reporters, Mrs May said: ""We do hold Russia culpable for this brazen, brazen act and despicable act, which has taken place on the streets of what is such a remarkable city."" She met one boutique owner, who told her: ""We just need the support to get the city going again. It needs to happen quite quickly. ""I'm a small independent, we need all the help we can get."" Wiltshire PCC Angus Macpherson said on Thursday that local businesses had been ""greatly"" affected by recent events but stressed: ""Salisbury is open, it is safe"". The Mill pub is still taped off as the investigation continues Environment Secretary Michael Gove has chaired a meeting of a cross-governmental recovery group to discuss what can be done to help the people of Salisbury. The PM, who also met Public Health England officials, expelled the Russian diplomats on Wednesday after Moscow refused to meet the UK's deadline to explain the use of the nerve agent. She said there was ""no alternative conclusion"" than to believe Russia was ""culpable"" for the poisonings. Alex Salmond: Russian station RT 'not propaganda' The spy at centre of poison mystery What are Novichok nerve agents? In the joint statement released on Thursday, allies France, Germany, the US and UK said the poisoning was ""an assault on UK sovereignty"" and ""a breach of international law"". ""It threatens the security of us all,"" the statement read. ""Our concerns are also heightened against the background of a pattern of earlier irresponsible Russian behaviour."" And in his first major speech - unveiling plans for a new chemical weapons ""defence centre"" in Porton Down - Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said there was ""no doubt the attack came from Russia"". Meanwhile,Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told the BBCthe attack was Russia's ""way of saying to people this is what happens to people who stand up to our regime"". This video can not be played Gavin Williamson: Russia 'should go away and shut up' Mr Johnson, who will meet the Nato secretary general in Brussels on Monday, said the UK's allies had been ""steadfast in their support"" and that he was ""heartened"" by the response around the world.

"This video can not be played Miami rescue workers search for survivors At least six people have been killed and nine others hurt after a footbridge collapsed near Florida International University in Miami. Police announced the deaths after rescuers spent the night searching for victims trapped beneath the structure. The 862-tonne, 174ft (53m) bridge fell over an eight-lane street on Thursday afternoon, crushing at least eight vehicles, police said. The bridge was erected on Saturday in just six hours. It was built using a method called ""accelerated bridge construction"" to avoid traffic disruption. A major section of the bridge was assembled on the side of the road and then raised into place. Announcing the deaths early on Friday, Miami-Dade police spokesman Alvaro Zabaleta said the operation was now moving from rescue to recovery. Workers at the site were having to take extreme care because of the possibility of finding more victims and for their own safety. At one point during the operation, police ordered TV helicopters to leave the area so rescue teams could hear for any sounds of people calling for help under the wreckage, CBS Miami television reported. FIU students are currently on their spring break until 17 March. They told local media that vehicles were stopped at a traffic light when the structure collapsed at about 13:30 local time (17:30 GMT). This video can not be played Florida officials: We found eight trapped cars and multiple fatalities One witness told ABC News,externalthat the screams coming from the cars were ""terrifying"". ""As soon as I looked outside, I saw dust flying everywhere,"" Tiona Page said. ""I knew the bridge had collapsed."" Another witness, Damany Reed, told CBS News: ""I heard a big kaboom... it sounded continuous. We look outside... we thought something had fallen but it was the bridge that collapsed. It was just surreal at that moment and pretty scary."" This video can not be played Miami bridge collapse witness: 'This is crazy' ""I saw there were multiple cars crushed under the bridge. It was just terrible,"" Jacob Miller, an FIU student, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.

"The shirt was on sale on the Topman website, with almost 200 sold on Thursday Retailer Topman has withdrawn a shirt after criticism it could be seen referring to the Hillsborough disaster. The red shirt with a large number 96 is being seen by some Liverpool fans as a reference to the club's kit and number of victimskilled in the 1989 disaster. Louise Brookes, whose brother Andrew died in the tragedy, and MP for Wirral South Alison McGovern were among those calling for it to be removed from sale. Topman apologised ""unreservedly"" saying it was based on a Bob Marley track. The shirt is no longer on sale online or in stores, the shop said. In a tweet, Labour MP Ms McGovern said the shirt was ""very unfortunate"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Under the number 96 on the back of the long-sleeved red top, the design includes the words, ""What goes around comes back around"". On one sleeve of the Â£20 top is the word ""Karma"". Ms Brookes, whose 26-year-old brother died at the stadium, said ""karma"" and ""what goes around comes around"" were used by some rival fans who claimed Hillsborough was ""God's punishment"" forthe Heysel disasterin which 39 people, mostly Juventus supporters, died at a match against Liverpool. Margaret Aspinall's son James died in the Hillsborough disaster She also said the red colour, the number 96 and the rose were all symbols she associated with Hillsborough. Chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, whose son James died in the disaster, said she could ""quite understand the fans and the families being upset about this"". She urged those who approved the design to be made to ""look up on Hillsborough because they've got to learn"". Ninety-six people died in the Hillsborough disaster Some Twitter users had initially said the top referenced the Bob Marley song What Goes Around Comes Around, a remix of which was released in 1996. Others said Karma was a brand. The shop said in a statement: ""Topman apologises unreservedly for any offence caused by this T-shirt. ""The design was inspired by a Bob Marley track with the number referring to the year of re-release. The garment has been removed from sale online and in stores."" Ms Brookes said whatever the shirt's original message, ""people will use it now as a way of antagonising Liverpool fans"". She added: ""Our 96 were decent human beings who did nothing wrong. ""How would people feel if it was their loved ones being mocked?"" London College of Fashion's Professor Kate Fletcher said her mind was ""boggling"" at ""the lack of ethical oversight"" by Topman, adding: ""It's a complete mystery to me how they came up with this design."" ""The speed and volume of the fashion industry means it's making the clothes in distant areas. ""The local knowledge and expertise is gone and the cultural context of where it is worn is not known.""

"Olorgesailie Basin: the dig site spans an area of 65 square kilometres Humans may have developed advanced social behaviours and trade 100,000 years earlier than previously thought. This is according to aseries,externalof paperspublished today,externalinScience,external. The results come from an archaeological site in Kenya's rift valley. ""Over one million years of time"" is represented at the site, according to Rick Potts from the Smithsonian Institution, who was involved in the studies. There are also signs of developments in toolmaking technologies. Environmental change may have been a key influence in this evolution of earlyHomo sapiensin the region of the Olorgesailie dig site. Early humans were in the area for about 700,000 years, making large hand axes from nearby stone, explained Dr Potts. ""[Technologically], things changed very slowly, if at all, over hundreds of thousands of years,"" he said. Then, roughly 500,000 years ago, something did change. A period of tectonic upheaval and erratic climate conditions swept across the region, and there is a 180,000 year interruption in the geological record due to erosion. It was not only the landscape that altered, but also the plant and animal life in the region - transforming the resources available to our early ancestors. The dig site revealed evidence of climate change that oscillated from arid to wet When the record resumes, the way of life of these early humans has completely changed. ""The speed of the transition is really remarkable,"" Dr Potts said. ""Sometime in that [gap] there was a switch, a very rapid period of evolution."" New tools appeared at this time - small, sharp blades and points made from obsidian, a dark volcanic glass. This technology marks the transition to what is known as the Middle Stone Age, explained Dr Eleanor Scerri from the University of Oxford. Rather than shaping a block of rock, into a hand axe, humans became interested in the sharp flakes that could be chipped off. These were mounted on spears and used as projectile weapons. Where 98% of the rock previously used by people in the Olorgesailie area had come from within a 5km radius, there were no sources of obsidian nearby. People were travelling from 25km to 95km across rugged terrain to obtain the material, and ""interacting with other groups of early humans over that time period"", according to Dr Potts. This makes the site the earliest known example of such long distance transport, and possibly of trade. (l to r) Hand axes, obsidian sharps and colour pigments discovered at the site There is additional evidence that the inhabitants, who would likely have lived in small groups of 20-25 people, also used pigments like ochre. It is unclear whether these were merely practical or had a ritual social application. Dr Marta Mirazon Lahr from the University of Cambridge said that being able to ""securely date"" the continuous occupation of the site using argon techniques on volcanic deposits ""makes Olorgesailie a key reference site for understanding human evolution in Africa during [this period]"". Dr Scerri, who was not involved in the studies, emphasised that they are valuable in implying that ""Middle Stone Age technology emerged at the same time in both eastern and northwestern Africa."" Prof Chris Stringer from the Natural History Museum agrees. ""This makes me think that the Middle Stone Age probably already existed in various parts of Africa by 315,000 years ago, rather than originating in one place at that time and then spreading,"" he said. While the behaviours exhibited at the Kenya site are characteristic ofHomo sapiens, there are as yet no fossils associated with this time period and location. The oldest knownHomo sapiensfossils werediscovered in Morocco, and are dated to between 300,000 and 350,000 years old.

"Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as ""Putin's chef"", has denied election tampering The US has imposed sanctions on 19 Russians, accusing them of interference in the 2016 US election and alleged cyber-attacks. They include 13 individuals charged last month by Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin accused the Russians of ""destructive cyber-attacks, and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure"". He said the sanctions would target ""ongoing nefarious attacks"" by Russia. The tactics of a Russian troll farm The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words The measures are being described in Washington as the strongest action taken by the Trump administration thus far against Moscow. Russia says it has already begun drawing up counter-measures. Five entities including the Russian military intelligence agency GRU are targeted in Thursday's sanctions. Also blacklisted is the St Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, which is accused of engineering an online disinformation campaign to sway the 2016 US presidential election. Yevgeny Prigozhin - an oligarch who allegedly ran the agency and is known as ""Putin's chef"" - and 12 of the agency's staff are also hit by the sanctions. Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Who's who in Russia scandal? All 13 were charged in a February indictment by US special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating allegations that Russia meddled in the US vote to help Donald Trump win. Under the US sanctions, the Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB, and six of its employees are subjected to penalties for cyber-attacks. The US treasury secretary said there would be additional sanctions to hold Russian ""officials and oligarchs accountable for their destabilising activities"". He did not specify when these penalties would be imposed, but stated they would sever the individuals' access to the US financial system. ""The IRA [Internet Research Agency] created and managed a vast number of fake online personas,externalthat posed as legitimate US persons to include grassroots organisations, interest groups, and a state political party on social media,"" the Treasury Department statement said on Thursday. ""Through this activity, the IRA posted thousands of ads that reached millions of people online."" The penalties freeze any assets the individuals and entities may have in the US and prohibits American citizens from conducting business with them. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation The Trump administration also accused Russia on Thursday of an ongoing operation to hack and spy on the US power utilities. US officials say the Russians hacked computer systems to conduct ""network reconnaissance"" of systems that run the American electricity grid and other industrial infrastructure. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington More than 16 months after the 2016 presidential election, more than a year after the US intelligence community concluded the US had been targeted by Russian hackers and influencers and 45 days after the congressionally mandated deadline to impose punitive sanctions on Russia, the Trump administration has acted. Interestingly enough, the list of individuals and groups identified by Department of Treasury for punishment appears to have relied on the efforts of Robert Mueller's independent investigation into Russia's election meddling and possible ties to the Trump campaign - an inquiry the president has called a baseless ""witch hunt"". The statement from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin referenced Russia's ""ongoing nefarious attacks"". That was in sharp contrast to Mr Trump's White House comments on Thursday in response to a question about Russian activities, saying the UK nerve agent attack ""looks like the Russians are behind it"" and that he takes it ""very seriously"" - while declining to discuss the new sanctions at all. The US has condemned the poison attack, but it has yet to follow the UK's lead and take direct action against the Russian government in response. Unlike the election-meddling charges, the US may have to move more quickly in this case. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow was calm about the new sanctions, according to Interfax news agency. Mr Ryabkov said Moscow had already begun drawing up retaliatory measures. Meanwhile Mr Prigozhin said he was unconcerned by the sanctions on him because he did not have any business interests linked to the US, Russian media reported. ""I have been sanctioned maybe three or four times - I'm tired of counting, I can't remember. I don't have any business in the United States or with Americans. I'm not worried by this.

"Joyce Msokeri was convicted of three counts of fraud and a charge of possessing a false document A woman who said she lost her home and husband in the Grenfell Tower fire has been found guilty of fraud. Joyce Msokeri, 47, filled a room at Kensington's Hilton hotel with donations after saying she was a grief-stricken victim of the disaster. Southwark Crown Court heard data showed the 47-year-old's phone had never been used near the Grenfell site. Msokeri was convicted of three counts of fraud and a charge of possessing a false document. As well as claiming goods, accommodation and cash handouts, worth a total of Â£19,000, Msokeri concocted an elaborate ploy to claim insurance on her fictitious partner's death, the court heard. Grenfell flat doors fail police fire test Seventy-one people died after fire broke out in Grenfell Tower in June 2017. When her story began to unravel, she told investigators she had found out her husband had survived and had been living in a cave in Margate, Kent, where he was fed by tourists. In his closing speech, prosecutor David Jeremy QC said: ""What the evidence demonstrates is that she committed these crimes through greed and she got away with it for a certain amount of time through her skill at manipulation."" Msokeri created three different personas for her non-existent husband to try to claim compensation, eventually persuading a man with a history of mental health problems to pose as her spouse so she could claim he had miraculously been found weeks after the fire. Mr Jeremy said Msokeri wanted to ""double her money"" and continued to commit fraud until early September. The court heard she filled 10 suitcases with new goods taken from the store set up to help survivors and applied for a number of phones and laptops. Seventy-one people died after fire broke out in Grenfell Tower in June 2017 Mr Jeremy said: ""You would have thought that by July she would have called it a day and stopped, but she wanted to double her money with her claim about her husband. ""She wanted a bigger flat than would have been given to a single person."" Msokeri was not in court to hear the jury's verdicts as she remains in hospital after being admitted on Monday. Judge Michael Grieve QC thanked the jury for their ""good humour"" throughout the trial in the face of what he said were Msokeri's delaying tactics, including regularly feigning illness and claiming to be disabled. Two relatives of one of the victims of the fire, who Msokeri at one point tried to claim was her husband, were in the public gallery to hear the verdicts read out. Msokeri will be sentenced on 6 April.

"Civilians have been moving along ""humanitarian corridors"" declared by the government More than 12,000 people have fled a town in the besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghouta region outside Syria's capital, Damascus, as government forces advance. Men, women and children carrying blankets and bags were seen leaving the town of Hamouria, which has come under intense bombardment in recent days. It is the biggest exodus from the enclave since the military stepped up an offensive to retake it last month. At the same time, 25 lorries carrying food aid entered the town of Douma. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said the aid was just a fraction of what was needed in the Eastern Ghouta, where some 390,000 people are facing severe shortages of food and medical supplies. Why is there a war in Syria? Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Who's fighting whom in Syria's Ghouta?,external The developments came as Syria's civil war, which ICRC president Peter Maurer said had ""extracted an immensely painful human toll"", entered its eighth year. The conflict has left more than 350,000 people dead, 1.5 million others with permanent disabilities, and displaced 11 million both inside Syria and abroad. Air and artillery strikes hit Hezzeh, not far from Hamouria, on Thursday - injuring this man More than 1,100 people have been killed since the government and its allies intensified their bombardment of the Eastern Ghouta on 18 February. In the past week, dramatic advances by soldiers and militiamen have cut the enclave into three pockets: one in the north around Douma controlled by the rebel group Jaysh al-Islam; a second in the south around Hamouria held by Faylaq al-Rahman; and a third in the west around Harasta controlled by Ahrar al-Sham. A UN-facilitated agreement between Jaysh al-Islam and the government's key ally Russia saw dozens of sick and wounded people evacuated along with their families from Douma during local ""humanitarian pauses"" on Tuesday and Wednesday. But the government's assault on the southern pocket continued unabated. After troops broke through rebel lines outside Hamouria on Wednesday night, the government designated a corridor through which it said civilians could leave. On Thursday, more than 12,000 people took the opportunity to flee towards a government-held checkpoint in Adra, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. A Russian military spokesman said he expected no fewer than 13,000 to leave Hamouria, which had a population of between 31,000 and 34,000 in January. The government said the civilians had been used as ""human shields"" One rebel fighter said his group did not want anything other than for the civilians to be safe ""We had been trapped in the basements and did not dare come out,"" one man told Reuters news agency on the outskirts of Hamouria. ""We could not do anything... There was no food."" A fighter with Faylaq al-Rahman said the group had withdrawn to the town of Ein Tarma, to the south-west. ""The situation is very mixed up. We didn't understand anything at all,"" he said. ""We don't want anything other than for the civilians to be safe, and whatever happens to us happens. We don't know what will happen."" The official Sana news agency confirmed that the army had recaptured Hamouria and alleged that the civilians had been ""used as human shields by terrorist organisations"". The Eastern Ghouta has been devastated by years of intense bombardment The Syria Civil Defence - whose rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets - said 13 civilians, including four children and two women, were killed in Hamouria on Wednesday alone as the town was hit by 65 government air strikes, 80 barrel bombs and 200 rockets. The organisation added that one of its volunteers was killed in a ""double tap"" air strike on the nearby town of Hezzeh on Thursday, which targeted ambulances arriving at the scene of an earlier bombing. The Syrian Observatory said 12 people were also killed by air strikes on the town of Zamalka on Thursday. Meanwhile in government-controlled Damascus, one civilian was killed and 18 others wounded by shells fired by rebels based in the Eastern Ghouta, police told the Sana news agency.

"HSBC has reported a 29% median gender pay gap for its UK banking operations. However, the company also reported a 59% gap on the mean measure for hourly pay for 2017. HSBC has a median gap of 61% for bonus payments between its male and female employees. The bank said it had fewer women in senior management roles, while many top global roles were based in the UK, where its group head office is based. Elaine Arden, group head of human resources, said: ""If we identify any pay differences between men and women in similar roles, which cannot be explained by reasons such as performance/behaviour rating or experience, we make appropriate adjustments."" What is the gender pay gap? The 29% figure is more than double the 14.2% reported by Barclays for its UK retail banking operations for 2017, but lower than Royal Bank of Scotland (36.5%) and Lloyds Banking Group (32.8%). HSBC said its pay gap was largely down to the fact it - like its rivals - has fewer women in senior roles, with just 23% of higher positions held by women. Across the whole organisation, however, 54% of its workforce is female. HSBC has a target to try to improve its gender balance and aims to have 30% of senior roles held by women by 2020. All firms with more than 250 staff must report their gender pay gap to the government by 4 April. The median figure refers to the midpoint of all workers' salaries from lowest to highest paid. The mean describes the total wage bill divided by the number of employees, which means it can be skewed by a small number of very highly paid workers. What is the gender pay gap?

"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital The leaders of France, Germany, the US and UK say there is ""no plausible alternative explanation"" to Russia having been behind the nerve agent attack in the UK. They condemned the ""first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War"", calling it an assault on UK sovereignty. In Washington, US President Donald Trump said ""it certainly looks like the Russians were behind it"". The UK has expelled Russian diplomats. ""We do hold Russia culpable for this brazen, brazen act and despicable act,"" Prime Minister Theresa May said during a visit to the site of the attack in Wiltshire. Mr Trump said it was a ""very sad situation"" that the US was taking ""very seriously"". In France, President Emmanuel Macron is to snub the official Russian stand at the Paris book fair on Thursday, officials said. Earlier Mr Macron said he would announce more measures in the coming days. Russia has denied any involvement and vowed a swift response to the expulsion of 23 of its diplomats, whom the UK said were operating as spies. What we know so far White House backs UK decision to expel diplomats The nerve agent was used on a former Russian spy and his daughter in the city of Salisbury.

Separately,the US has announced sanctions against Russian individuals and entitiesaccused of trying to influence the 2016 election and carrying out cyber-attacks. Russia says it had nothing to do with the attack and will respond to UK measures against it. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the UK was being ""absolutely irresponsible"". Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has vowed a response ""very soon"". Meanwhile Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has denied that either the Soviet Union or Russia ever had a programme to create the Novichok nerve agent identified as having been used, the Interfax news agency reported. How is the UK retaliating against Russia? UK to build new chemical defence centre The Russian embassy in London said the decision to expel its diplomats was ""unacceptable, unjustified and short-sighted"". It also suggested on its Twitter feed that the UK could have the capacity to manufacture the nerve agent,externalused in Salisbury. It said Russia closed all Soviet-era chemical weapons programmes in 1992 and some of the scientists involved were flown to other countries, including the UK.

Mrs May on Thursday visited Salisbury. While there, she was briefed by public health experts, as Sergei and Yulia Skripal remain critically ill in hospital. She also thanked emergency services and spoke to members of the public.

"This video can not be played Miami rescue workers search for survivors At least six people have been killed and nine others hurt after a footbridge collapsed near Florida International University in Miami. Police announced the deaths after rescuers spent the night searching for victims trapped beneath the structure. The 862-tonne, 174ft (53m) bridge fell over an eight-lane street on Thursday afternoon, crushing at least eight vehicles, police said. The bridge was erected on Saturday in just six hours. It was built using a method called ""accelerated bridge construction"" to avoid traffic disruption. A major section of the bridge was assembled on the side of the road and then raised into place. Announcing the deaths early on Friday, Miami-Dade police spokesman Alvaro Zabaleta said the operation was now moving from rescue to recovery. Workers at the site were having to take extreme care because of the possibility of finding more victims and for their own safety.

"This video can not be played The plastic particles lurking in your bottled water The World Health Organization is to launch a review into the potential risks of plastic in drinking water. It will assess the latest research into the spread and impact of so-called microplastics - particles that are small enough to be ingested. It comes after journalism organisationOrb Media,externalfound plastic particles in many major brands of bottled water. There is no evidence that microplastics can undermine human health but the WHO wants to assess the state of knowledge. Plastic particles found in bottled water Bruce Gordon, coordinator of the WHOâs global work on water and sanitation, told BBC News that the key question was whether a lifetime of eating or drinking particles of plastic could have an effect. ""When we think about the composition of the plastic, whether there might be toxins in it, to what extent they might carry harmful constituents, what actually the particles might do in the body â there's just not the research there to tell us. ""We normally have a 'safe' limit but to have a safe limit, to define that, we need to understand if these things are dangerous, and if they occur in water at concentrations that are dangerous."" 'Shame and anger' at plastic pollution Earth is becoming 'Planet Plastic' Plastic pollution in seven charts Mr Gordon said that he did not want to alarm anyone, and also emphasised that a far greater waterborne threat comes in countries where supplies can be contaminated with sewage. But he said he recognised that people hearing about the presence of microplastics in their drinking water would turn to the WHO for advice. ""The public are obviously going to be concerned about whether this is going to make them sick in the short term and the long term."" The WHO initiative is partly in response to a study that screened more than 250 bottles of water from 11 different brands bought in nine countries - the largest investigation of its kind. Read the full scientific report [PDF],external A dye is used that binds to pieces of plastic The tests were carried out at the State University of New York in Fredonia as part of a project involving original research and reporting by the US-based journalism organisation Orb Media. Using a dye called Nile Red, which binds to free floating pieces of plastic, the university's Prof Sherri Mason found an average of 10 plastic particles per litre of water, each larger than the size of a human hair. Smaller particles assumed to be plastic but not positively identified were found as well - an average of 314 per litre. After filtration, the larger particles - yellow marks - are easy to see Of all the bottles tested, 17 were found to have no particles at all while many had counts ranging into the hundreds or even thousands, with big differences within brands and even the same pack of bottles. We contacted the companies behind the brands and most responded, standing by the quality and safety of their products. A few questioned why the studyâs results were so much higher than their own internal research or pointed out that there are no regulations on microplastics or agreed methods for testing for them. The study comes on top of earlier investigations that have found microplastics in tap water, beer, sea salt and fish, and Prof Mason told me that researchers need to be able to answer the pressing question of whether microplastics can be harmful. ""What we do know is that some of these particles are big enough that, once ingested, they are probably excreted but along the way they can release chemicals that cause known human health impacts. ""Some of these particles are so incredibly small that they can actually make their way across the gastro-intestinal tract, across the lining and be carried throughout the body, and we donât know the implications of what that means on our various organs and tissues."" The UK's Food Standards Agency said it was unlikely that the levels of microplastic reported in the bottles of water could cause harm but it added that, ""it would assess any emerging information concerning microplastics in food and drink"". For Dr Stephanie Wright of the Kingâs College Centre for Environment and Health, the priority is to understand how much microplastic we are exposed to, and exactly what happens to it inside us. Researchers have established that tiny particles of titanium dioxide can pass through the lining of the gut so the same might be possible with plastic, raising the question of where it would then end up. Dr Wright told me: ""The particles could stay within an immune cell in the gut lining, or be passed into our lymphatic system ending up in the lymph nodes, or there is a small potential for them to enter the blood stream and possibly accumulate in the liver. ""These are foreign hard particles which our body will obviously want to get rid of but it canât because plastic is not degradable so that will cause harm to the local tissue. ""But at the moment we don't know."" I suggested to Michael Walker, a consultant to the Office of the UK Government Chemist and founder board member of the Food Standards Agency, that the jury was out on whether microplastics could cause harm. He replied: ""The scientific literature says that not only is the jury not yet out on this question but the jury has not yet been convened on it.""

"Nordic countries regularly appear in the top five happiest places, according to the survey, with Finland coming top this year This year's happiest place on Earth is Finland, according to an annual UN report - toppling Norway from the top spot. TheWorld Happiness Report measures ""subjective well-being"",external- how happy people feel they are, and why. Nordic countries regularly appear in the top five, while war-hit countries and a number in sub-Saharan Africa regularly appear in the bottom five. Burundi was the least happy, taking over from the Central African Republic. It was thrown into crisis when President Pierre Nkurunziza's bid for re-election to a third term in 2015 sparked protests by opposition supporters who said the move was unconstitutional. This year's report by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network also features data about the happiness of immigrants in their host countries, with Finland also coming top as home to the happiest immigrants. The Finns love to get hot and steamy in saunas- with an estimated 3.3 million, there are enough steam rooms for more than one every other person They have the most metal bands per capita. The most famous include HIM, Nightwish and Children of Bodom From Lapland, you can see wild reindeer, the Northern Lights and if you are lucky Santa Claus The country's most famous exports include the cartoon characters called Moomins and the mobile gaming app Angry Birds ""I think everything in this society is set up for people to be successful, starting with university and transportation that works really well,"" American teacher Brianna Owens, who lives in Finland's second biggest city Espoo, told Reuters news agency. The survey ranks some 156 countries by their happiness levels, and 117 by the happiness of their immigrants. Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Switzerland were the other countries in the top five. The UK and US came in at 19th and 18th places respectively. Togo is seen to be this year's biggest gainer, moving up 17 places, while the biggest loser is Venezuela, which dropped 20 places to 102nd. The study found that the 10 happiest countries also scored highest on immigrant happiness, suggesting that migrants' wellbeing was tied to the quality of life in their adopted home. With a population of around 5.5 million people, Finland counted some 300,000 foreigners in 2016, reports say. ""The most striking finding of the report is the remarkable consistency between the happiness of immigrants and the locally born,"" said John Helliwell, co-editor of the report and a professor at the University of British Columbia. Can we all be as happy as Scandinavians? Can I learn to be happy? The report relies on asking a simple, subjective question of more than 1,000 people in more than 150 countries. ""Imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. ""The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?"" The average result is the country's score - ranging from Finland's 7.6 to Burundi's 2.9. But the report also uses statistics to explain why one country is happier than another. It looks at factors including economic strength (measured in GDP per capita), social support, life expectancy, freedom of choice, generosity, and perceived corruption.

"Opioid painkillers include tramadol, codeine and morphine Doctors warn the NHS is fuelling an addiction crisis because of an increase in the prescribing of powerful painkillers. Nearly 24 million opioids, such as morphine, were prescribed in 2017 - equivalent to 2,700 packs an hour. A drugs counsellor and former user told the BBC the NHS was ""creating drug addicts"". The Royal College of GPs said doctors would not prescribe opioid painkillers as a ""quick fix"". Opioids such as morphine, tramadol and fentanyl are super-strength painkillers, which can be highly addictive and can kill if misused. An investigation by BBC News has found: More than two million working age people in England are estimated to have taken a prescription painkiller that was not prescribed for them in 2016-17. GPs in England prescribed 23.8  million opioid-based painkillers in 2017, the equivalent of 2,700 items every hour. This was 10 million more prescriptions than in 2007. The prescribing rate of opioid painkillers in parts of northern England is four times higher than in London. The latest figures show the number of people dying from opioid-related drug misuse has reached a record high in England and Wales. About 3,700 people died in 2016 because of drug misuse. More than 2,000 of these deaths involved an opioid, according tothe Office for National Statistics,external(ONS). However these figures also included deaths from heroin, which is made from morphine. Nicki Hari says some doctors do not ask enough questions before prescribing powerful painkillers Abuse of opioids can start at an early age. ""I got my first taste of prescription painkillers when I was 14,"" said Nicki Hari. ""After having my tonsils out I remember thinking opioid based painkillers are great. They give you a floaty feeling, like you're on pink fluffy cloud."" Ms Hari, from Borehamwood in Hertfordshire, said a 25-year addiction saw her ""manipulate"" doctors into prescribing her painkillers and various types of surgery she said she did not need. ""I must have had over 10 operations on different parts of my body just so I could get more painkillers,"" she said. Ms Hari now works forUK Addiction Treatment,,externalwhich runs a network of recovery centres. ""Most doctors will give you tablets like Tramadol without asking too many questions,"" she said. ""GPs are just feeding people with pills, and the result is that the NHS is creating drug addicts."" More than three million prescriptions were issued in 2016 for the opioid Buprenorphine Analysis of theEngland and Wales crime survey,externalby the BBC England data unit suggests about 2.3 million people aged 16 to 59 in England took a prescription painkiller that had not been prescribed for them in 2016-17. Doctors and addiction experts have reported seeing a rise in the number patients seeking help for opioid prescription addictions. ""I'd say in the last five years the number of patients I'm treating has doubled,"" said Professor Jonathan Chick fromCastle Craig Hospital,external, a rehabilitation clinic in Peeblesshire, Scotland that treats people from across the UK. ""There is definitely a link between rising numbers of prescriptions and an increase in the number of opioid addicts and related deaths."" 1.5 million painkillers stolen from lorry Parents fined for children's truancy and holidays 'I take 'smart drugs'...despite risks A study by thePublic Health Research Consortium, published in 2017 found the proportion of patients being prescribed opioid painkillers by their GP had doubled in 15 years. Data held byNHS Digital,externalfor 2017 shows 23.8 million opioid painkillers were prescribed to patients across the country. Prescription rates for opioid drugs in the North East and Cumbria were four times higher than in London. It is not known how many prescriptions there were per individual patient. Dr Luke Mordecai, from University College London Hospitals, said communities that are poor or have a large elderly population often have higher prescribing rates. ""We also have to remember that GPs are often under pressure and patients demand they get given these strong painkillers,"" he added. In January the government orderedPublic Health England to conduct a review of prescribing levels,external. The Royal College of GPs said doctors would not prescribe opioid painkillers irresponsibly. ""GPs take prescribing any medication incredibly seriously and will never prescribe opioids as a 'quick fix',"" said chairwoman Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard. ""GPs will continue to work closely with patients in chronic pain by inviting them for regular medication reviews, and prescribing opioids when they are deemed to be the best treatment option, at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time."" An NHS England spokesman said: ""GPs and other health professionals make decisions about what, if any, medication to prescribe based on each individual patient's specific condition and circumstances. GPs and hospitals are working to ensure every prescription is both safe and effective, and the Care Quality Commission can investigate instances where these drugs appear to be given too frequently.""

"HSBC has reported a 29% median gender pay gap for its UK banking operations. However, the company also reported a 59% gap on the mean measure for hourly pay for 2017. HSBC has a median gap of 61% for bonus payments between its male and female employees. The bank said it had fewer women in senior management roles, while many top global roles were based in the UK, where its group head office is based. Elaine Arden, group head of human resources, said: ""If we identify any pay differences between men and women in similar roles, which cannot be explained by reasons such as performance/behaviour rating or experience, we make appropriate adjustments."" What is the gender pay gap? The 29% figure is more than double the 14.2% reported by Barclays for its UK retail banking operations for 2017, but lower than Royal Bank of Scotland (36.5%) and Lloyds Banking Group (32.8%). HSBC said its pay gap was largely down to the fact it - like its rivals - has fewer women in senior roles, with just 23% of higher positions held by women. Across the whole organisation, however, 54% of its workforce is female. HSBC has a target to try to improve its gender balance and aims to have 30% of senior roles held by women by 2020. All firms with more than 250 staff must report their gender pay gap to the government by 4 April. The median figure refers to the midpoint of all workers' salaries from lowest to highest paid. The mean describes the total wage bill divided by the number of employees, which means it can be skewed by a small number of very highly paid workers. What is the gender pay gap?

" The road out of Perm runs along a frozen river dotted with crouching figures. They huddle round small holes drilled through the ice. All around are thick forests of silver birch and fir trees, covered in snow. Lyubov laughs off mention of the cold as I approach her gingerly, looking for cracks beneath my feet. It’s -17C and the pensioner has been fishing with her husband on the frozen river for hours without gloves. “It’s fine!” she insists, dipping a finger through the ice hole and swirling it round. “It’s warmer in the water.” Russians are famed for their hardiness. But ask about politics and there’s one fear that keeps recurring - no-one wants to return to the chaos and criminality of the 1990s. Those who lived through the Soviet collapse still shudder at the memory of the empty shops, the queues and the hardship. In some places there was conflict - in many places there was organised crime. And everywhere there was bewilderment as an entire ideological system fell apart. Putin, only Putin. He's our man... If someone new came we'd have to start all over again, and who knows how that would work out?"" For those who don’t remember the era, officials and the state-run media machine now constantly spread the fear of chaos. It comes with a message - President Vladimir Putin brought an end to that. He brought order and stability. “Putin, only Putin. He’s our man,” Lyubov insists, when I ask her about Russia’s presidential election. “If someone new came we’d have to start all over again, and who knows how that would work out? Our pensions aren’t much. But it’s enough. Things are stable.” That message has intensified over Putin’s last six-year term in office. At the same time, the idea that Russia faces a hostile outside world has spread. It was the West that fomented chaos in the 1990s and tried to force its ways on to Russia, Putin argues. Not satisfied with winning the Cold War, he insists that the West wanted to humiliate the former superpower. So he has built up Russia - allowed it to feel strong again. Now, it is pushing back. In the middle of this river, 1,200km (700 miles) east of Moscow, that message has barely filtered through. Lyubov does have a vague notion that the West doesn’t like Russia much. She mentions the doping scandal at the Olympic games that’s been reported heavily on TV, and blamed on Russophobia. But Lyubov is not too worried. “All that will pass,” the pensioner assures me, more interested in catching a bite as she lowers her line back into the ice hole. “It’s just a question of time.” A little further along the road out of Perm, there is a cluster of brick buildings and single-storey wooden barracks. They stand as a stubborn reminder of an uncomfortable past. Now a museum, Perm-36 is the only part of Joseph Stalin’s Gulag that still survives. The network of brutal labour camps was where Soviet Russia sent its political opponents, as well as many criminals and kulaks - wealthier peasants. During Stalin’s Great Terror in the 1930s, millions passed through the system. Hard physical work on meagre rations in extreme weather killed vast numbers. Perm-36 is a remote monument to this repression. But it has been at the heart of a dispute over history itself. It’s a controversy that hints at Russia’s priorities under President Vladimir Putin and his increasing hostility to the West.

Now a museum, Perm-36 is the only part of Joseph Stalin’s Gulag that still survives.

During Stalin’s Great Terror in the 1930s, millions passed through the system. Hard physical work on meagre rations in extreme weather killed vast numbers. Perm-36 is a remote monument to this repression. Far east of Moscow, it has been at the heart of a dispute over history itself. It’s a controversy that hints at Russia’s priorities under President Vladimir Putin and his increasing hostility to the West. The museum at this site was founded by historian Viktor Shmyrov in the 1990s as post-Soviet Russia opened up to the world. “The Gulag was a huge phenomenon but there are practically no traces of it left,” he says. “That’s why Perm-36 needed preserving.” The country opened many archives then too, revealing the scale and details of decades of political repression. But the desire to dig deep into that past has been fading. The Perm camp in the 1940s In 2014, Perm-36 was taken over by the local authorities and the museum’s founder was removed. The new administration then tried to soften the museum’s focus, says Shmyrov. “The dominant idea now is that the Gulag was necessary, both economically and to bring discipline and order.” One member of the new team admits there were changes. “There was a lean towards justifying the repressions, maybe three years when the museum wavered,” historian Sergei Sheverin says, standing by rows of barbed wire. At one point, the Gulag museum’s own website defended Stalin’s imprisonment of scientists - to force them to work for the state. Sheverin suggests the museum was a stain on the “Great Power” narrative of Russia that’s now led by Putin. That approach has seen Stalin rehabilitated because of his role in the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany. “The policy from above is that we shouldn’t remember the bad things, only the good,” says Sheverin. The museum’s founder Viktor Shmyrov suspects there was an additional reason for his removal. Perm-36 used to host an annual forum and music festival that attracted thousands. In a place where free-thinkers were once incarcerated, Shmyrov says the festival had developed into a “freedom space”. “Not one person there could say a good thing about Vladimir Putin of course,” he says. “We used to have a powerful civil society. Now they’re bringing order and control.” The attempts to dilute the historical message at Perm-36 sparked opposition from human rights activists and the independent press. I was given a full tour by a management team anxious to prove that the museum endures as testimony to the crushing cruelty of the Soviet state. The tiny exercise space of the “special zone”, the rock-hard bunks and the sheer remoteness of the camp all drive home that point. Viktor Shmyrov was removed as director of the museum he founded But Shmyrov has not been restored to his post. Instead, the organisation he first created to run the Gulag museum has been branded a “foreign agent”. Under a law passed during Putin’s latest term in office, that label is now applied to all groups engaged in “political activity” and receiving funding from the West. In the president’s words, such groups “serve the interests of others”. Recovering the memory of Perm-36 and its prisoners, the move implies, was an act of subversion on behalf of an enemy state. Perm is a big city - unattractive and industrial at first glance but its appeal creeps up on you. The pale orange morning light on the city is beautiful from across the broad, sweeping river. The main avenue through the city centre is lined with Soviet architecture and decorated with elaborate ice sculptures. For decades Perm was a hub for military factories producing aircraft and artillery and completely closed to foreigners. Prying eyes were kept away from sensitive technology.  But this city has been changing. In the basement of an apartment block is the only gay club in Perm. Inside, the crowd are free to be themselves. “I can be Whitney Houston, Lady Gaga… all sorts of people,” Ruslan says, in a cramped dressing room stuffed with sequined clothes and synthetic wigs. A factory worker by day, Ruslan’s night-time transformation includes applying dramatic eye make-up in thick layers and carefully attaching false lashes. But he lives a double-life. Emphatically “out” within the four walls of this club, above ground Ruslan keeps his sexuality under wraps. “If you don’t make people speak openly about it, then we live absolutely fine. Happiness likes silence,” the 26-year-old says, applying black liner in dramatic swoops around his eye. He sums up life for LGBT people in Russia. “It’s fine to be gay, but you can’t say being gay is a good thing.” Russia decriminalised homosexuality in the early 1990s but social prejudice remains and it is fed from the top. In 2013 a new law made it illegal to “promote” homosexuality to minors. Last summer the European Human Rights Court ruled the law discriminatory, warning that it encouraged homophobia. Public figures regularly present gay rights as an alien concept, forced on Russia by the degenerate West. The term “gay pride” is now uttered by some with a sneer, as an insult. Perhaps it’s not surprising then that Ruslan isn’t campaigning for more freedom. His own parallel lives are just part of what he calls the “Russian reality”. “The borders are open,” Ruslan says. “If you really want to walk hand-in-hand with your boyfriend in the street and kiss so everyone claps, then you’re welcome. Go for it. You can buy a ticket and travel. It’s not the USSR.” Moments later, fully transformed into “Kira Cocaine”, he struts on to stage in high heels and long purple wig, to lip-sync to Russian pop. The small crowd roar their approval from the dancefloor and “Kira” starts up a comic, crude banter. Outside a group of clubbers stand smoking by the door, defying the cold. This is a spot where they feel safe and uninhibited. Beyond the grey metal gate, that freedom is limited. At Perm’s only LGBT support group, members say the law against “gay propaganda” has made life harder. About 15 people have turned up for a weekly discussion. The topic this time is famous gay figures in history, and afterwards the group talk about taking strength from the reminder that they’re not alone. Among them are several psychologists who work with the centre to offer counselling. They don’t want the group’s location revealed. There is no sign on the door. “In this climate, that’s impossible,” says one woman. The propaganda law has particularly complicated life for those working in education. One of the young women in the group describes panic when it passed, a fear that even saying the word “gay” could get you fined thousands of roubles. Another says people think homosexuality is a “disease which can be passed on”. A gay rights protest in Moscow, June 2017 A trainee teacher reveals that she masks her sexuality on social media so her students won’t realise. “I portray myself as straight and I have a male friend who I post pictures with, like we’re a couple,” she admits. “That way I can’t be accused of propaganda.” The atmosphere in the room is warm and relaxed - it is decked out with rainbow flags and leaflets. But security cameras on the walls are a reminder of a shattering day. Two years ago - at a previous premises - the centre was raided by more than a dozen police. They came to check the group’s activity was in line with the propaganda law. “It was humiliating,” a woman who was there says quietly, asking not to be named. “They treated us like we were an illegal group. Here we help people through complex situations. We think society needs us. But to them we are scum.” After the police raid they were kicked out of their building - the landlady said she didn’t agree with homosexuality. The group now exists only on donations, unable to apply for Western grants because that means being branded a “foreign agent”. The foreign agents law, like the gay propaganda bill, was signed by President Putin during his most recent term. Last May, the Perm LGBT group made a small step forward when they got permission for a public gathering on international anti-homophobia day. Some 30 people with rainbow balloons were guarded by 20 police. Their hope is to build on that and emerge slowly from the shadows. Things are tolerable now - that means they don’t kill us” When I visit Nadia at the flat she’s been sharing with Masha for two years, she tells me she’d love to live openly like she’s heard is possible in Europe. “I’d love for being gay to be as natural as any other relationship,” she says. But here, deep in the Russian provinces, few want to risk pushing for that. “Things are tolerable now. That means they don’t kill us,” Nadia puts it bluntly. “I would say that people don’t know [our sexuality], so they don’t attack. Everyone puts all their efforts into no-one finding out - and that’s where it stops.’ Over the river, deep in the countryside, Igor Dymahakov and his family have moved outside Perm to live a “traditional” Russian way of life. They came to the village of Ilyinsky after Igor received a commission from the local museum. A painter of Orthodox Christian icons, his garage is filled with works-in-progress including a giant mosaic propped up against the wall. A ray of winter sun cuts in through a small window as Igor works, his bold brushstrokes colouring the cape of a saint bright red. The family’s two-storey wooden house is cosy thanks to a log-burning stove. In the kitchen, Olga has prepared a huge heap of pancakes. The youngest of four children dart in and out as she sets the table. In the next room the others watch cartoons beneath a giant painted image of an angel. Before they sit down to eat the family sing a solemn “Our Father” led by Igor, facing an icon mounted on the wall. Igor and Olga with their children Igor and Olga both discovered religion after the atheist USSR fell apart. They describe themselves as children of Perestroika, the dramatic political transformation that precipitated the collapse of decades of communist rule. It was a period that brought many positive changes. “We could converse freely with foreigners, for one,” Igor tells me. But they also remember a sudden cascade of corrupting influences. “The iron curtain should have been opened more carefully,” Igor argues, sipping a mug of tea around the family’s kitchen table. “Soviet people weren’t ready for the stream of things that hit us. “There was a flood of erotica, horror films and all sorts of rubbish. An uncontrolled tide.” Igor Dymahakov: “The iron curtain should have been opened more carefully” Igor says some of his generation couldn’t cope with the assault. His own choice has been a very deliberate turn to tradition. In his terms, it’s a turn towards Russian Orthodox values, away from the corrupting influences of the West. Igor is not alone in his conservativism. There’s a new trend for the traditional. A former KGB spy, Vladimir Putin has undergone his own transformation in power. He now styles himself as religious and refers to “Russian values” on a regular basis. Putin also places great stress on the institution of the family as key to boosting Russia’s population. He has previously justified the gay propaganda law, arguing that it’s based on the idea that same-sex couples “don’t produce children”. Russia, Putin has stressed, needs “proper” families and more children. Igor and Olga are not hostile to the outside world and talk warmly of guests who’ve visited in the past from America. Igor also says he doesn’t buy what state-run TV pumps into his kitchen every day - the message that the West is Russia’s sworn ideological enemy again. “They’re just following orders,” Igor laughs. “It’s political games. It’s not serious, and it will pass.” But Igor does believe that the decline of religion in the West has led to a broader moral slide, which he doesn’t want Russia to repeat. “Unfortunately, things are moving away from traditional Christian values. It’s happening slowly, but steadily,” he argues. Same-sex relationships are among the things he doesn’t approve of. “There’s a rejection of traditional family relationships. Fewer people are having children. But we are resisting this,” he says, referring to his own family of six. As evening falls over the village, the family prepare for mass. The local church was turned over to cheese production in Soviet times but it’s open for worship again and the congregation has been growing. “Obviously after 70 years of godlessness it’s difficult for people to return to religion,” Olga admits. “But there is progress and that’s great.” There’s pop music playing on the street opposite and a few hardy souls skating on an outdoor rink. The church itself is boxy, missing both its original cupolas and bell tower. Inside the bitterly cold entrance a few pictures taped to the walls show the place in its pre-Soviet glory. Mass-goers now squeeze into a small section of the building that's been separated off and heated. The light inside is dim and the flames of the thin yellow candles waver each time the door opens. There’s a fair few children. As I slip out and leave Igor’s family to the long service, he follows to explain how they hope to restore the whole church for worship one day. The parishioners have already begun gathering funds but, looking around, that seems a giant task. More than 2,000km (1,250 miles) away in the southern city of Rostov another conservative Russian force is enjoying a revival. In the thick morning mist outside the town what looks like a Cossack army is in action. The warriors appear in traditional baggy trousers, big boots and greatcoats, some thundering by on horseback, others marching through the melting ice and thick, squelching mud. They’re re-enactors - reliving a moment from history in a borderland their ancestors have defended for centuries. As the Cossacks charge, roaring, towards the Red Army line there are loud cannon booms, fireworks and explosions. A horse slips and tumbles, “victims” slump to the floor. The Cossacks push on to victory. Many on the battlefield are young cadets from local Cossack schools. Their military-style education has become increasingly popular, an ideal match for the patriotism, religion and “traditional” values that are now promoted in Russia. “Cossacks want to serve their country and to protect their land. That’s important. And to raise our children as defenders,” says Vitaly Babulchinko. A cadet school headmaster in real life, he’s playing a military commander on the battlefield. As the Cossacks celebrate, I chat to some of the cadets near the smoking cannons. Cheeks still red from the fight, they tell me they plan to become officers in the Russian army one day. “Of course we’re patriotic, we’re cadets,” one says, taken aback. “Loving and defending your country is the most important thing.” Their headmaster talks about how the boys learn ballroom dancing as well as battle skills. They also have a Cossack choir, complete with patriotic repertoire. So what do these proud young Russians - who’ve only ever known Vladimir Putin in power - make of the hostility between their country and the West? All three boys look genuinely confused by the question. “For me, what happens in my own country is more important,” says Roman. “We don’t really have any negative thoughts about the West.” But just down the road from Rostov is the border with Ukraine, where a conflict is still being waged despite an official ceasefire. The West blames Russian aggression - Russia blames Western meddling. Almost four years ago, a mix of “warrior” spirit and patriotism drove some Cossacks to join the fight there. But according to one former volunteer, people of all kinds travelled from across the country. Alexander Rostovsky sits in the office of NOD, the right-wing organisation he belongs to. There’s an array of flags and a photo of Vladimir Putin prominent on the wall. One of the group starts wiping the whiteboard when he catches me looking and three words the group appear to have been discussing - liberalism, tolerance and democracy - disappear. Alexander Rostovsky sees the West as Russia's oppressor Alexander then launches into a long attack against the West. He calls it a parasite that destroyed the Soviet Union, fed off the spoils, and tried to humiliate and subjugate Russia in the 1990s. He sees what happened in Ukraine as a continuation of that campaign - a Western-backed coup that led to civil war. “Volunteer fighters felt they had to take part in the war because if they didn’t, then their towns would be shelled next,” he says. “We remember Iraq and Afghanistan. We know who this is done by. It’s the West that wants to divide up our country.” Such views would once have been dismissed as extreme but over the past few years they’ve merged into the mainstream in Russia, pushed by senior officials and state television. It’s a key reason why many Russians did head to eastern Ukraine as volunteers - I met some during the conflict. Russia has never admitted sending regular troops over the border, despite a wealth of evidence. But Rostov now has a permanent memorial to those who died. A tall, thin column in a city park topped with a cross is marked to the “heroes” of eastern Ukraine. At its base is a soggy bunch of flowers. Wandering down one of the main shopping streets in Rostov, all the hostile talk seems very remote. The city boasts a brand new football stadium that will host World Cup matches this summer. Every night it lights up on the river bank as a reminder of that prospect. In the city centre, as in much of Russia, Rostov feels more Western than ever - full of foreign stores and styles. It also has a cluster of fashionable new businesses that wouldn’t look out of place in London or New York. There’s coffee and craft beer, a vegan café and a noodle bar, and in one slightly run-down street is a women’s clothes shop with a huge fluffy pink cabin as a changing room. The creative force behind Like Shop is 35-year-old Maria Alandarenko. In 2012 she and her partner began selling lines by little-known designers from Korea. By 2013 they were producing their own designs in Rostov, for sale both in-store and online. Maria says her business has been squeezed as the Russian economy has faltered under the strain of falling oil prices and Western sanctions. The cost of imported fabric has shot up, just as her customers’ spending power has tumbled. “Before, people would drop in and buy a whole set of clothes just on a whim,” the businesswoman explains, as a couple of lunchtime browsers flick through rails hung with dramatically colourful designs. “Now people ask about discounts all the time, and we feel the impact.” Unlike many Russians, Maria makes a direct link between the downturn and her country’s politics. “The government is doing everything possible to isolate Russia. It’s a very sad fact.” Full of infectious energy and enthusiasm, Maria is optimistic about expanding sales to the West and seeking new online platforms. But she’s pessimistic about another six years living under Vladimir Putin. Maria (left) Taming the media was one of the president’s priorities, very soon after coming to power, and it has had a long-lasting impact. “Instead of talking about problems we have inside the country, they talk about how we are surrounded by enemies who all want the worst for us,” says Maria of the television news. “It's really scary, because it whips everything up. People then think we need to push back, otherwise we'll be overrun and destroyed.” Across the road from her clothes store, Maria and her partners recently opened a wine bar. In the evening, a young after-work crowd sip from large glasses of European wine and tap on smartphones. Among them are theatre directors, art curators and a couple who run a comic shop. Like Maria, and unlike their president, they don’t look on the West as a threat or an enemy. It’s somewhere they travel to and trade with. For Maria, it’s something more. “We have a European mentality and we are European,” she says, adding that no-one “normal” would think fair elections, stable institutions and an active civil society were bad. “I like to think there are European values that Russians share, inside themselves.” In the eastern city of Perm there’s a giant archway - made of driftwood and shaped like a Russian letter P. The massive sculpture was part of the city’s attempt to rebrand itself as progressive. It proved controversial. “People tried to torch it when it first appeared,” the taxi driver says as we drive past. A “cultural revolution” started in Perm in 2008, with the city pitching itself as a capital of culture not just for Russia, but for the world. The once closed-off military city was embracing modernity and the West. The ambitious project was launched during a brief liberal “spring” when Dmitry Medvedev took over the presidency. The constitution barred Vladimir Putin from running for a third consecutive term so Medvedev kept his seat warm. The governor in Perm was a liberal at the time. And for the artists involved, the climate felt good. A sculpture at Perm's museum of contemporary art “It was a project to change life in the city,” says curator Marat Gelman, who was brought in specially from Moscow.  Always provocative, it seems that in 2012 his exhibitions were too political and went too far. He was sacked. “It all finished very quickly when Mr Putin decided to be president again,” the curator argues. “At the beginning Putin was a person who said we go to Europe, we think about the future. But Putin today is a totally different figure. He said forget about modernisation, we’re going back to traditional things.” The “P” sculpture itself survived. So did Perm’s museum of contemporary art - PERMM - the only one of its kind outside Moscow. A former member of Gelman’s team now runs it. “There was a point when Perm was beginning to feel like a Russian New York, attracting all the best producers, curators and projects,” the museum’s new head, Nadia Allahverdiyeva remembers. She recalls this city full of creative energy, hosting multiple festivals and shows and well-known guests from abroad. Perm is where Chekhov is said to have imagined his Three Sisters in the provinces, yearning for Moscow. As modern-day Perm filled up with art, so the real-life young stopped pining to leave. Looking back, the curator recalls a thrilling moment. But now the museum’s wings have been severely clipped and she has to be careful. “The vulnerability of the museum now creates internal censorship in my head. The most important thing is to maintain the institution.” “We do nothing to damage our reputation for art,” the curator insists, acknowledging that state funding is key to the museum’s survival. “But we do lower the temperature. It’s a compromise.” Forced compromise is a product of the shifting climate across Russia. Being open, challenging and modern - all are firmly out of fashion. They’ve been ousted by isolation, control and tradition. There are plenty of people who don’t share that vision. But over his last term in office their president has pivoted Russia away from the West and its values and on to a “Russian” path. The direction for the next six years seems fixed.

"Mariam Moustafa, 18, was an engineering student at Nottingham College Police are keeping an ""open mind"" about whether an attack on an Egyptian student that sparked outrage in her home country was racially motivated. Mariam Moustafa, 18, died on Wednesday after being attacked by a group in Nottingham three weeks earlier. The hashtag ""Mariam's rights will not be lost"" has been trending in Egypt. Egypt's prosecutor-general has requested information about the probe into her death by British officials, according to BBC Monitoring. The Egyptian Embassy said it had been ""closely following"" the circumstances of the ""vicious attack"" and had ""expressed the need for those responsible to be brought to justice swiftly"" with UK authorities. ""The deep concern of the Egyptian public is evident and the embassy remains focussed in its efforts to support and assist Mariam's grieving family whose life has been shattered by their traumatic loss,"" the statement added. Nottinghamshire Police said: ""At this time, from our investigation, there is no information to suggest that the assault was motivated by hate but we continue to keep an open mind."" Live updates and more from the East Midlands A 17-year-old girl was arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm and was released on conditional bail. Miss Moustafa's uncle told the BBC he believed a group of about 10 girls had started beating his niece before she ran to get on a bus. He said the girls kept beating her until she passed out and a man intervened to help. Her younger sister, Mallak Moustafa, said her sibling told her how the attack unfolded before she went into a coma. ""My sister couldn't see as she'd been hit in the head but then as soon as she saw our bus coming, she ran to it, trying to get on it,"" she said. ""She got on to the bus, she didn't think they'd all pay Â£1 to get on but they went up to her when she'd sat down and said they weren't finished with her. ""Then the girls kept saying punch her more, punch her more. Then she couldn't see what was going on."" This video can not be played Mariam Moustafa's sister, Mallak, and father, Muhammad, spoke to the BBC She added she had seen some of the people involved ""laughing about my sister's coma"" on Instagram. ""I was shocked and they should be ashamed of themselves,"" she added. ""We thought England would be our future, be an engineer one day, anything we wanted to be, that's why my dad brought us to England. ""But it seems like it has actually ruined us, we didn't think England was like that."" Miss Moustafa's father, Hatim Moustafa, said: ""When Mariam was born, I did my best for her. ""I come here for her future and education, for my daughter, to be engineering but now it is not fair."" Police said the attack started in Parliament Street in Nottingham Nottinghamshire Police said Miss Moustafa was ""punched several times"" outside the Victoria Centre in Parliament Street at about 20:00 GMT on 20 February. The force said she then got on a bus but was followed ""by the same group of women who were threatening and abusive towards her before they got off"". In a statement, bus company Nottingham City Transport (NCT) said one of its drivers helped Miss Moustafa. ""We would like to publicly recognise our driver, who went upstairs to intervene and acted as a barrier between the attackers and the young lady, after he asked them to leave the bus,"" NCT said. ""CCTV from the bus has been provided to Nottinghamshire Police as part of their investigation into this appalling attack and we continue to support their efforts to identify the culprits."" A spokesperson for Nottingham College said Mariam was ""well-liked and able"" Miss Moustafa's uncle said the hospital sent her home initially, where she fell ill and was taken back to hospital where she entered into a coma. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust said an initial review ""does not indicate any significant untoward incident on the trust's part, however we will fully examine the family's concerns"". Miss Moustafa was an engineering student at Nottingham College. Yultan Mellor, a vice principal at the college, said Mariam was ""well-liked and able"" and had ""strong aspirations for her future studies and eventual career"". Her best friend, Mariam Jankeh John, said she was ""loving, cheerful, fashionable and intelligent"". ""I can't imagine someone as friendly, calm and cheerful as Mariam can be a victim,"" she said. The statement released by the Egyptian Embassy added: ""The consul general of Egypt and the medical counsellor, as well as a representative from the embassy, were immediately dispatched to offer support and assistance to the family at this devastating time.

"Tramadol is an opioid drug which can kill if misued More than 1.5 million powerful prescription painkillers were stolen from a lorry at a service station. NHS staff were told not to alert the public about the theft of the tramadol tablets, a document obtained by the BBC shows. Tramadol is a strong painkiller that is potentially addictive and can kill if abused. West Yorkshire Police (WYP) urged people not to take the stolen drugs. The 15,072 packs, each containing 100 tablets, were taken from a lorry at a service station on the M62 in West Yorkshire between 22:00 GMT on 6 March and 05:00 on 7 March. Tramadol is a controlled drug and can only be given to patients who have a prescription. BBC News has obtained an NHS ""alert message"" revealing the packs of tablets were stolen from the back of a lorry, parked at the Hartshead Moor motorway service station, in West Yorkshire. The document states ""this information is not to be disclosed to or displayed in view of members of the public and is for the information of NHS members of staff only"". Parents fined for children's truancy and holidays 'I take 'smart drugs'...despite risks Telford abuse: Concerns over youth workers' caseloads The number of people in England and Wales dying because they have misused tramadol has doubled in the past decadeaccording to official figures,external. In 2016 there were 184 recorded deaths involving the painkiller, compared to 81 deaths in 2006. The theft took place at the Hartshead service station in West Yorkshire Ian Hamilton, a lecturer in mental health and addiction studies at the University of York, said the NHS should be alerting the public to the danger of stolen painkillers. ""The theft of such a large quantity of drugs poses an immediate risk to public health,"" he said. ""In the wrong hands tramadol is a nasty drug and an inexperienced user only need to take a relatively small quantity to create a risk of an overdose."" NHS England in Yorkshire and the Humber did not answer questions about why staff were told not to disclose the theft. A spokeswoman said: ""We are aware of an incident involving the theft of drugs and West Yorkshire Police are currently looking into it. The public are urged to contact the police if they have any information regarding this incident."" West Yorkshire Police (WYP) controlled drugs liaison officer Helen Pipe said: ""It is highly likely that this was a targeted theft. ""Although this occurred overnight, this is a busy service station off the motorway and it is possible that someone may have seen this offence taking place.

"Nordic countries regularly appear in the top five happiest places, according to the survey, with Finland coming top this year This year's happiest place on Earth is Finland, according to an annual UN report - toppling Norway from the top spot. TheWorld Happiness Report measures ""subjective well-being"",external- how happy people feel they are, and why. Nordic countries regularly appear in the top five, while war-hit countries and a number in sub-Saharan Africa regularly appear in the bottom five. Burundi was the least happy, taking over from the Central African Republic. It was thrown into crisis when President Pierre Nkurunziza's bid for re-election to a third term in 2015 sparked protests by opposition supporters who said the move was unconstitutional. This year's report by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network also features data about the happiness of immigrants in their host countries, with Finland also coming top as home to the happiest immigrants. The Finns love to get hot and steamy in saunas- with an estimated 3.3 million, there are enough steam rooms for more than one every other person They have the most metal bands per capita. The most famous include HIM, Nightwish and Children of Bodom From Lapland, you can see wild reindeer, the Northern Lights and if you are lucky Santa Claus The country's most famous exports include the cartoon characters called Moomins and the mobile gaming app Angry Birds ""I think everything in this society is set up for people to be successful, starting with university and transportation that works really well,"" American teacher Brianna Owens, who lives in Finland's second biggest city Espoo, told Reuters news agency. The survey ranks some 156 countries by their happiness levels, and 117 by the happiness of their immigrants. Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Switzerland were the other countries in the top five. The UK and US came in at 19th and 18th places respectively. Togo is seen to be this year's biggest gainer, moving up 17 places, while the biggest loser is Venezuela, which dropped 20 places to 102nd. The study found that the 10 happiest countries also scored highest on immigrant happiness, suggesting that migrants' wellbeing was tied to the quality of life in their adopted home. With a population of around 5.5 million people, Finland counted some 300,000 foreigners in 2016, reports say. ""The most striking finding of the report is the remarkable consistency between the happiness of immigrants and the locally born,"" said John Helliwell, co-editor of the report and a professor at the University of British Columbia. Can we all be as happy as Scandinavians? Can I learn to be happy? The report relies on asking a simple, subjective question of more than 1,000 people in more than 150 countries. ""Imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. ""The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?"" The average result is the country's score - ranging from Finland's 7.6 to Burundi's 2.9. But the report also uses statistics to explain why one country is happier than another. It looks at factors including economic strength (measured in GDP per capita), social support, life expectancy, freedom of choice, generosity, and perceived corruption.

"Rihanna has accused Snapchat of ""intentionally"" shaming victims of domestic abuse. The singer was the subject of an advert on the platform which asked users if they would ""rather slap Rihanna or punch Chris Brown"". The ad, which was for a game, appeared to reference Chris Brown's conviction forassaulting Rihannain 2009 while they were dating. Snap Inc says the ad ""never should have appeared on our service"". Rihanna posted a lengthy comment on an Instagram Story saying she was ""trying to figure out what the point was with this mess"". ""I'd love to call it ignorance, but I know you ain't that dumb,"" she wrote. The company's share price has fallen by more than 4% since Rihanna's statement. The first part of Rihanna's Instagram Story addressed Snapchat directly A Snap Inc spokesperson said: ""This advertisement is disgusting and never should have appeared on our service. We are so sorry we made the terrible mistake of allowing it through our review process. ""We are investigating how that happened so that we can make sure it never happens again."" Rihanna accused Snapchat of ""intentionally"" shaming domestic violence victims. ""This isn't about my personal feelings, cause I don't have much of them... but all the women, children and men that have been victims of DV in the past and especially the ones who haven't made it out yet. ""You let us down! Shame on you. Throw the whole app-ology away."" Rihanna said her response was for victims of domestic violence The advert was widely criticised online on Monday.

"More than 100 girls could have been targeted by a sex gang in Telford between 2007 and 2009, police believe. A frontline team set up to tackle child sex abuse in Telford was overworked and under-resourced, a report says. Youth workers were unable to keep appointments with vulnerable girls due to facing ""almost double"" the recommended caseload. Team members raised concerns about the volume of high-risk cases in 2016, three years after a grooming gang was jailed for abusing girls. Telford council said it spent an extra Â£200,000 last year to tackle abuse. Midlands Live: Man quizzed on terror training camp; snow warning extended The town has been in the spotlight since the Sunday Mirror published a report about ""groups of mainly Asian men"" targeting vulnerable white teenagers in the town since the 1980s,external. A Telford & Wrekin Council report,externalfound specialist youth workers in the Cate (Children Abused Through Exploitation) team were spending a ""disproportionate amount of time"" taking children to GP or sexual health clinic appointments. They were meant to meet with girls considered to be at high risk of sexual exploitation two or three times a week. But, due to their workloads, they were unable to meet this target. Seven men were jailed in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali The specialist youth workers flagged concerns around ""decreased capacity"" and said there was no time to train other organisations in how to tackle child sexual exploitation. Police offered to pay for help from children's charity Barnardo's so its staff could take on lower-risk cases but this had not happened, the report found. The committee which compiled the document, to look at how abuse was being tackled in Telford, said it had particular concerns about resources against a backdrop of ""dramatic"" public sector cuts. It was written after seven men were jailed following West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice. The head of Telford's safeguarding children board claims there is ""no evidence"" grooming gangs are still operating in towns such as Wellington (pictured) More than 100 girls could have been targeted by the gang between 2007 and 2009, police believe. One victim told how she was abused at a ""rape house"" and the town's Conservative MP Lucy Allan has said white working-class girls were being traded for sex in a ""routine way"". ""Holly"" - a victim of exploitation in the town from the age of 14 - told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she went to a sexual health clinic for the morning-after pill twice a week for three years, but no-one ever asked her any questions. She said she was beaten with a belt and sold ""two or three times a night"". Calling for an independent inquiry, Ms Allan said the cases would not have happened had the victims been from different backgrounds. Telford's Conservative MP Lucy Allan said white working-class girls had been traded for sex ""in a routine way"" Adele Gladman, an independent safeguarding consultant, said: ""As a country, England is becoming reactive rather than proactive. ""I think we have a far greater problem with CSE in England than in Wales or Scotland. The long-term impacts are going to be extraordinary."" Chris Cowan, director of school theatre group Loudmouth, which works in Telford, said: ""Over the last 15 years things have changed and are getting worse in many areas. ""There used to be many different funded organisations that offered support in the community from youth clubs and centres to community centres or hubs and Sure Start centres. ""There were more outreach workers who would know the young people in an area and were an on hand source of support and would see or hear what was going on."" Meanwhile, the head of Telford's safeguarding children board claimed there was ""no evidence"" grooming gangs were still operating in Telford. Chairman Andrew Mason, said he feared ""misrepresentation"" could mean children suffering abuse did not come forward. ""The reason we are hitting the headlines is because we are so open and talk about the work we are doing."" He disputed up to 1,000 children had been victims. ""It doesn't help anyone having these figures banded around when they are a completely incorrect figure. ""It gives the impression to children that are being abused that authorities don't care and we're not good at what we do, which will discourage them from coming forward and is a poor outcome for everyone involved."" A spokesman for West Mercia Police and Crime Commissioner said more than Â£80,000 had been given to Barnardo's this year and last year to help tackle exploitation in the force area. Barnardo's said that money was only for work in Herefordshire and Worcestershire and not Telford, in Shropshire, as there was a Cate team already operating there. Telford & Wrekin Council said current workloads within its Cate team were at recommended levels. It added the team now offered training to other organisations.

"The test on the flat was part of an investigation into the fire in west London on 14 June Doors for flats in Grenfell Tower could only hold back a fire for half the time they were designed to, a police investigation has found. Experts said a door was supposed to resist fire for 30 minutes, but only lasted 15 minutes in tests. The test was part of a Met Police probe into the fire in west London which killed 71 people last June. Housing Secretary Sajid Javid said the risk to public safety in buildings with the same doors remains low. Speaking in the House of Commons, he said that further tests would be carried out on the doors and that there was ""no evidence that this is a systemic issue"". Grenfell Tower fire 'widow' guilty of fraud Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? What happened at Grenfell Tower? Shadow housing minister Tony Lloyd told MPs he was ""astounded"" by Mr Javid's claim and added: ""If this isn't systemic, what assessment has been made of how many buildings are potentially affected by this, how many individual flats, how many people who have fire doors that simply don't do the job?"" Natasha Elcock, a survivor from the tower and a representative of the bereaved and survivors' group Grenfell United, said it is ""time people's lives are taken more seriously and that includes everyone from every walk of life"". She added: ""It's shocking - first the cladding and insulation, then the doors. Who knows what else is putting people's lives at risk? ""The government should have improved regulations after previous fires."" Seventy-one people were killed in the blaze Manse Masterdor is believed to have been the manufacturer of Grenfell Tower's fire doors, which were installed between 2011 and 2012. Since then, the company's trade and operating assets were taken over by Synseal - which continues to trade under the name Masterdor. On Thursday, Synseal said it ""never had any involvement with Grenfell Tower"" and that the products in question were no longer being sold. A spokesman added the company was co-operating with the police investigation. This video can not be played Firefighter Ricky Nuttall describes how he broke down after the Grenfell disaster Kensington and Chelsea Council confirmed three doors were tested and provided ""less protection than guidelines recommend"", but said test results are ""as yet inconclusive"". A spokesperson said the government must give ""clear advice"" so that residents across the country can understand any safety implications. The Met said the forensic examination and testing phase is ongoing so it did not want to comment on the potential impact ""any test result may have on the overall criminal investigation"". But the force shared the information with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government because of concerns it might have ""wider implications for public safety"", Mr Javid told the House of Commons on Thursday. He added: ""Conclusions should not be taken about the nature of the cause of the Grenfell tragedy. That is a matter for a separate police investigation and it must be allowed to run its course."" Sajid Javid said the risk to public safety in buildings with the same doors remains low Labour MP Helen Hayes told the House of Commons that unless the government acted fast on mitigating the risks ""revealed as a consequence of Grenfell"", it was ""simply meting out further injustice to leaseholders, who will face very large bills, and tenants, who will see much-needed major works pushed back"". Mr Javid said the government had ""made it very clear"" that it would provide local authorities with ""financial flexibilities"". A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told the BBC that the government was ""working with councils across the country and private landlords"" to establish how many other sites are affected. He added that the risk to the public was deemed low, because it was ""very uncommon for fires to spread beyond the room of origin"", as evidenced in a2017 Home Office report into fires in purpose-built flats,external. Roy Wilsher, chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council, said he is ""confident"" the government is ""taking the right steps"" by doing rigorous testing and seeking independent and technical expertise. A second procedural hearing of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick,,externalwill take place on 21 and 22 March to review its progress.

"Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as ""Putin's chef"", has denied election tampering The US has imposed sanctions on 19 Russians, accusing them of interference in the 2016 US election and alleged cyber-attacks. They include 13 individuals charged last month by Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin accused the Russians of ""destructive cyber-attacks, and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure"". He said the sanctions would target ""ongoing nefarious attacks"" by Russia. The tactics of a Russian troll farm The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words The measures are being described in Washington as the strongest action taken by the Trump administration thus far against Moscow. Russia says it has already begun drawing up counter-measures. Five entities including the Russian military intelligence agency GRU are targeted in Thursday's sanctions. Also blacklisted is the St Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, which is accused of engineering an online disinformation campaign to sway the 2016 US presidential election. Yevgeny Prigozhin - an oligarch who allegedly ran the agency and is known as ""Putin's chef"" - and 12 of the agency's staff are also hit by the sanctions. Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Who's who in Russia scandal? All 13 were charged in a February indictment by US special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating allegations that Russia meddled in the US vote to help Donald Trump win. Under the US sanctions, the Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB, and six of its employees are subjected to penalties for cyber-attacks. The US treasury secretary said there would be additional sanctions to hold Russian ""officials and oligarchs accountable for their destabilising activities"". He did not specify when these penalties would be imposed, but stated they would sever the individuals' access to the US financial system. ""The IRA [Internet Research Agency] created and managed a vast number of fake online personas,externalthat posed as legitimate US persons to include grassroots organisations, interest groups, and a state political party on social media,"" the Treasury Department statement said on Thursday. ""Through this activity, the IRA posted thousands of ads that reached millions of people online."" The penalties freeze any assets the individuals and entities may have in the US and prohibits American citizens from conducting business with them. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation The Trump administration also accused Russia on Thursday of an ongoing operation to hack and spy on the US power utilities. US officials say the Russians hacked computer systems to conduct ""network reconnaissance"" of systems that run the American electricity grid and other industrial infrastructure. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington More than 16 months after the 2016 presidential election, more than a year after the US intelligence community concluded the US had been targeted by Russian hackers and influencers and 45 days after the congressionally mandated deadline to impose punitive sanctions on Russia, the Trump administration has acted. Interestingly enough, the list of individuals and groups identified by Department of Treasury for punishment appears to have relied on the efforts of Robert Mueller's independent investigation into Russia's election meddling and possible ties to the Trump campaign - an inquiry the president has called a baseless ""witch hunt"". The statement from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin referenced Russia's ""ongoing nefarious attacks"". That was in sharp contrast to Mr Trump's White House comments on Thursday in response to a question about Russian activities, saying the UK nerve agent attack ""looks like the Russians are behind it"" and that he takes it ""very seriously"" - while declining to discuss the new sanctions at all. The US has condemned the poison attack, but it has yet to follow the UK's lead and take direct action against the Russian government in response. Unlike the election-meddling charges, the US may have to move more quickly in this case. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow was calm about the new sanctions, according to Interfax news agency. Mr Ryabkov said Moscow had already begun drawing up retaliatory measures. Meanwhile Mr Prigozhin said he was unconcerned by the sanctions on him because he did not have any business interests linked to the US, Russian media reported. ""I have been sanctioned maybe three or four times - I'm tired of counting, I can't remember. I don't have any business in the United States or with Americans. I'm not worried by this. Except that now I will stop going to McDonald's,"" he was quoted as saying by RIA news agency.

"Mariam Moustafa, 18, was an engineering student at Nottingham College Police are keeping an ""open mind"" about whether an attack on an Egyptian student that sparked outrage in her home country was racially motivated. Mariam Moustafa, 18, died on Wednesday after being attacked by a group in Nottingham three weeks earlier. The hashtag ""Mariam's rights will not be lost"" has been trending in Egypt. Egypt's prosecutor-general has requested information about the probe into her death by British officials, according to BBC Monitoring. The Egyptian Embassy said it had been ""closely following"" the circumstances of the ""vicious attack"" and had ""expressed the need for those responsible to be brought to justice swiftly"" with UK authorities. ""The deep concern of the Egyptian public is evident and the embassy remains focussed in its efforts to support and assist Mariam's grieving family whose life has been shattered by their traumatic loss,"" the statement added. Nottinghamshire Police said: ""At this time, from our investigation, there is no information to suggest that the assault was motivated by hate but we continue to keep an open mind."" Live updates and more from the East Midlands A 17-year-old girl was arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm and was released on conditional bail. Miss Moustafa's uncle told the BBC he believed a group of about 10 girls had started beating his niece before she ran to get on a bus. He said the girls kept beating her until she passed out and a man intervened to help. Her younger sister, Mallak Moustafa, said her sibling told her how the attack unfolded before she went into a coma. ""My sister couldn't see as she'd been hit in the head but then as soon as she saw our bus coming, she ran to it, trying to get on it,"" she said. ""She got on to the bus, she didn't think they'd all pay Â£1 to get on but they went up to her when she'd sat down and said they weren't finished with her. ""Then the girls kept saying punch her more, punch her more. Then she couldn't see what was going on."" This video can not be played Mariam Moustafa's sister, Mallak, and father, Muhammad, spoke to the BBC She added she had seen some of the people involved ""laughing about my sister's coma"" on Instagram. ""I was shocked and they should be ashamed of themselves,"" she added. ""We thought England would be our future, be an engineer one day, anything we wanted to be, that's why my dad brought us to England. ""But it seems like it has actually ruined us, we didn't think England was like that."" Miss Moustafa's father, Hatim Moustafa, said: ""When Mariam was born, I did my best for her. ""I come here for her future and education, for my daughter, to be engineering but now it is not fair."" Police said the attack started in Parliament Street in Nottingham Nottinghamshire Police said Miss Moustafa was ""punched several times"" outside the Victoria Centre in Parliament Street at about 20:00 GMT on 20 February. The force said she then got on a bus but was followed ""by the same group of women who were threatening and abusive towards her before they got off"". In a statement, bus company Nottingham City Transport (NCT) said one of its drivers helped Miss Moustafa. ""We would like to publicly recognise our driver, who went upstairs to intervene and acted as a barrier between the attackers and the young lady, after he asked them to leave the bus,"" NCT said. ""CCTV from the bus has been provided to Nottinghamshire Police as part of their investigation into this appalling attack and we continue to support their efforts to identify the culprits."" A spokesperson for Nottingham College said Mariam was ""well-liked and able"" Miss Moustafa's uncle said the hospital sent her home initially, where she fell ill and was taken back to hospital where she entered into a coma. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust said an initial review ""does not indicate any significant untoward incident on the trust's part, however we will fully examine the family's concerns"". Miss Moustafa was an engineering student at Nottingham College. Yultan Mellor, a vice principal at the college, said Mariam was ""well-liked and able"" and had ""strong aspirations for her future studies and eventual career"". Her best friend, Mariam Jankeh John, said she was ""loving, cheerful, fashionable and intelligent"". ""I can't imagine someone as friendly, calm and cheerful as Mariam can be a victim,"" she said. The statement released by the Egyptian Embassy added: ""The consul general of Egypt and the medical counsellor, as well as a representative from the embassy, were immediately dispatched to offer support and assistance to the family at this devastating time.

"HSBC has reported a 29% median gender pay gap for its UK banking operations. However, the company also reported a 59% gap on the mean measure for hourly pay for 2017. HSBC has a median gap of 61% for bonus payments between its male and female employees. The bank said it had fewer women in senior management roles, while many top global roles were based in the UK, where its group head office is based. Elaine Arden, group head of human resources, said: ""If we identify any pay differences between men and women in similar roles, which cannot be explained by reasons such as performance/behaviour rating or experience, we make appropriate adjustments."" What is the gender pay gap? The 29% figure is more than double the 14.2% reported by Barclays for its UK retail banking operations for 2017, but lower than Royal Bank of Scotland (36.5%) and Lloyds Banking Group (32.8%). HSBC said its pay gap was largely down to the fact it - like its rivals - has fewer women in senior roles, with just 23% of higher positions held by women. Across the whole organisation, however, 54% of its workforce is female. HSBC has a target to try to improve its gender balance and aims to have 30% of senior roles held by women by 2020. All firms with more than 250 staff must report their gender pay gap to the government by 4 April. The median figure refers to the midpoint of all workers' salaries from lowest to highest paid. The mean describes the total wage bill divided by the number of employees, which means it can be skewed by a small number of very highly paid workers. What is the gender pay gap?

"Civilians have been moving along ""humanitarian corridors"" declared by the government More than 12,000 people have fled a town in the besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghouta region outside Syria's capital, Damascus, as government forces advance. Men, women and children carrying blankets and bags were seen leaving the town of Hamouria, which has come under intense bombardment in recent days. It is the biggest exodus from the enclave since the military stepped up an offensive to retake it last month. At the same time, 25 lorries carrying food aid entered the town of Douma. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said the aid was just a fraction of what was needed in the Eastern Ghouta, where some 390,000 people are facing severe shortages of food and medical supplies. Why is there a war in Syria? Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Who's fighting whom in Syria's Ghouta?,external The developments came as Syria's civil war, which ICRC president Peter Maurer said had ""extracted an immensely painful human toll"", entered its eighth year. The conflict has left more than 350,000 people dead, 1.5 million others with permanent disabilities, and displaced 11 million both inside Syria and abroad. Air and artillery strikes hit Hezzeh, not far from Hamouria, on Thursday - injuring this man More than 1,100 people have been killed since the government and its allies intensified their bombardment of the Eastern Ghouta on 18 February. In the past week, dramatic advances by soldiers and militiamen have cut the enclave into three pockets: one in the north around Douma controlled by the rebel group Jaysh al-Islam; a second in the south around Hamouria held by Faylaq al-Rahman; and a third in the west around Harasta controlled by Ahrar al-Sham. A UN-facilitated agreement between Jaysh al-Islam and the government's key ally Russia saw dozens of sick and wounded people evacuated along with their families from Douma during local ""humanitarian pauses"" on Tuesday and Wednesday. But the government's assault on the southern pocket continued unabated. After troops broke through rebel lines outside Hamouria on Wednesday night, the government designated a corridor through which it said civilians could leave. On Thursday, more than 12,000 people took the opportunity to flee towards a government-held checkpoint in Adra, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. A Russian military spokesman said he expected no fewer than 13,000 to leave Hamouria, which had a population of between 31,000 and 34,000 in January. The government said the civilians had been used as ""human shields"" One rebel fighter said his group did not want anything other than for the civilians to be safe ""We had been trapped in the basements and did not dare come out,"" one man told Reuters news agency on the outskirts of Hamouria. ""We could not do anything... There was no food."" A fighter with Faylaq al-Rahman said the group had withdrawn to the town of Ein Tarma, to the south-west. ""The situation is very mixed up. We didn't understand anything at all,"" he said. ""We don't want anything other than for the civilians to be safe, and whatever happens to us happens. We don't know what will happen."" The official Sana news agency confirmed that the army had recaptured Hamouria and alleged that the civilians had been ""used as human shields by terrorist organisations"". The Eastern Ghouta has been devastated by years of intense bombardment The Syria Civil Defence - whose rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets - said 13 civilians, including four children and two women, were killed in Hamouria on Wednesday alone as the town was hit by 65 government air strikes, 80 barrel bombs and 200 rockets. The organisation added that one of its volunteers was killed in a ""double tap"" air strike on the nearby town of Hezzeh on Thursday, which targeted ambulances arriving at the scene of an earlier bombing. The Syrian Observatory said 12 people were also killed by air strikes on the town of Zamalka on Thursday. Meanwhile in government-controlled Damascus, one civilian was killed and 18 others wounded by shells fired by rebels based in the Eastern Ghouta, police told the Sana news agency.

"Becky was suffocated at her home and her body was later moved and dismembered Murdered schoolgirl Becky Watts was told explicit pictures of her would be posted online months before she was killed, it has been revealed. Becky's step-brother Nathan Matthews suffocated her at her home in St George, Bristol, in February 2015. He and his girlfriend, Shauna Hoare targeted Becky due to their sexual interest in petite teenage girls. Becky's parents told a serious case review they did not know she was being bullied and ""could not keep her safe"". The review by the Bristol Safeguarding Children Board,externalsaid Becky had been the victim of sexting at the hands of a ""young male peer"" who told her the explicit pictures would be posted online. Becky told caseworkers about it some time around May 2014 and said she was worried her father ""would throw her out"" if he found out - a threat that he had carried out at least once. In one instance she was told to leave one Christmas and had stayed with friends. She had exhibited ""serious anxiety"" about this being made permanent. The report criticised the advice she had been given to deal with this. Becky's father, Darren Galsworthy, told the review he was not given the parental support needed to help his daughter and he was ""not included by professionals"". Nathan Matthews and Shauna Hoare were jailed for murdering Becky Becky, who had a history of mental health issues and suffered from anorexia, had been seen by a number of professionals over several years. Her mother told the review that too many people had been involved in her care and she could not build the trust she needed to speak out. During an initial assessment ""Becky reported feeling scared about a lot of things"" and told a family support worker that she read about abduction cases. The report said instead of looking at her wider problems Becky was described as ""controlling"", ""lacking aspiration"" and ""not engaged with the assessment"". Mr Galsworthy said in hindsight they could see her behaviour was worse when her step-brother, who bullied her about her weight, was present. The review said there was no evidence that her murder could have been ""predicted or prevented by any professional working with Becky"". But it did find there was a need for services to be focussed on ""the needs and circumstance of adolescents"" to avoid vulnerable young people ""being seen as 'troublesome' rather than troubled because of their circumstances"". The safeguarding board also said there were shortcomings in ""assessing and understanding"" Becky's complex needs and professionals failed to engage her father and help him understand her issues. It also recommended trying to engage fathers in family therapy and parenting sessions. The report said that ""at the time of working with Becky there were inconsistencies"" in the multi-agency approach to looking after Becky and recommended in future that professionals should not take what parents or carers say about a young person at ""face value"". In addition to the safeguarding review, there is an ongoing Domestic Homicide Review into Becky's case.

"Friends described Jodie Willsher as ""a truly lovely woman"" A man who stabbed to death his ex-partner's daughter at an Aldi supermarket has been jailed for at least 30 years. Neville Hord, 44, pleaded guilty to murdering 30-year-old mother-of-one Jodie Willsher in Skipton, North Yorkshire, four days before Christmas. Bradford Crown Court heard it was a ""cold-blooded public execution"" carried out ""for the purpose of revenge"". The judge told Hord it was highly probable he would never be released. Prosecutor Peter Moulson, QC, told the court Hord, who was the ex-partner of Mrs Willsher's mother, Nicole Dinsdale, stabbed the Aldi employee several times before he was restrained. Read more on this and other Yorkshire stories Mrs Willsher died from wounds to her chest and abdomen inflicted during the attack - which was witnessed by horrified Christmas shoppers, including a child. After his arrest, Hord told police the attack was planned and he had also armed himself with an axe. Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC told Hord he was ""truly and horribly rotten to the core"". He added: ""You chose a time and a place to, in effect, execute, to kill, to murder."" The attack by Neville Hord was filmed on CCTV Mr Moulson said Hord, of Great Horton Road, Bradford, told police Mrs Willsher had ""made things very difficult"" in his relationship with her mother. He said the defendant admitted putting a tracking device on Mrs Willsher's car and planned the killing for two weeks - buying a pistol crossbow as an ""option weapon"" and taking the axe as ""back-up"". Hord admitted he went to the store to kill Mrs Willsher and told officers he thought she had smiled at him before he stabbed her. The court heard how a previous partner confirmed Hord threatened to kill her and her young son if she left him. She said he told her: ""I'll chop the pair of you up and bury you on the moors."" Police found the cross-bow in Hord's vehicle in the Aldi car park along with 50 bolts, a large amount of diesel and cable ties. Sentencing Hord, Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC said: ""You are a monster, Mr Hord."" Jodie Willsher's husband Malcolm paid tribute to a ""doting mother and loving wife"" In a statement read in court, Mrs Willsher's husband Malcolm said his life and that of his daughter, Megan, had been ripped apart. He said: ""I have to explain it to Megan who then says to me 'I hate you daddy for not bringing mummy back. You're not trying hard enough'. ""She then says 'daddy, can't I have a brother or sister any more' or 'won't mummy ever be a granny now?'. ""How do you deal with that?"" He said his wife and daughter had an ""unbreakable bond"" and described how Megan had been excited about them opening Christmas presents together. He said the family had planned to leave on a dream trip to Disneyland on Boxing Day - five days after his wife was murdered. Mr Willsher added: ""I'm so scared he'll get out and do something to Megan."" Det Ch Insp Mark Pearson, of the Cleveland and North Yorkshire major investigation team, said: ""Neville Hord planned and carried out a horrific attack on Jodie Willsher while she was working in a busy supermarket in the run-up to Christmas. ""His terrible actions have devastated a family, leaving a mother without a daughter, a husband without a wife and a young girl without her mother. ""No sentence could ever compensate for their loss.""

"Tramadol is an opioid drug which can kill if misued More than 1.5 million powerful prescription painkillers were stolen from a lorry at a service station. NHS staff were told not to alert the public about the theft of the tramadol tablets, a document obtained by the BBC shows. Tramadol is a strong painkiller that is potentially addictive and can kill if abused. West Yorkshire Police (WYP) urged people not to take the stolen drugs. The 15,072 packs, each containing 100 tablets, were taken from a lorry at a service station on the M62 in West Yorkshire between 22:00 GMT on 6 March and 05:00 on 7 March. Tramadol is a controlled drug and can only be given to patients who have a prescription. BBC News has obtained an NHS ""alert message"" revealing the packs of tablets were stolen from the back of a lorry, parked at the Hartshead Moor motorway service station, in West Yorkshire. The document states ""this information is not to be disclosed to or displayed in view of members of the public and is for the information of NHS members of staff only"". Parents fined for children's truancy and holidays 'I take 'smart drugs'...despite risks Telford abuse: Concerns over youth workers' caseloads The number of people in England and Wales dying because they have misused tramadol has doubled in the past decadeaccording to official figures,external.

The theft took place at the Hartshead service station in West Yorkshire Ian Hamilton, a lecturer in mental health and addiction studies at the University of York, said the NHS should be alerting the public to the danger of stolen painkillers. ""The theft of such a large quantity of drugs poses an immediate risk to public health,"" he said. ""In the wrong hands tramadol is a nasty drug and an inexperienced user only need to take a relatively small quantity to create a risk of an overdose."" NHS England in Yorkshire and the Humber did not answer questions about why staff were told not to disclose the theft. A spokeswoman said: ""We are aware of an incident involving the theft of drugs and West Yorkshire Police are currently looking into it. The public are urged to contact the police if they have any information regarding this incident."" West Yorkshire Police (WYP) controlled drugs liaison officer Helen Pipe said: ""It is highly likely that this was a targeted theft. ""Although this occurred overnight, this is a busy service station off the motorway and it is possible that someone may have seen this offence taking place.

"About 400,000 penalty notices for school non-attendance have been issued to parents in England and Wales in the past three years Parents across England and Wales have been fined about Â£24m for failing to send their children to school during the past three years, it has emerged. A BBC investigation also shows some councils are issuing penalties at rates five times higher than the average. Some parents say they now actively budget for the cost of fines when planning holidays. While some councils admit they have become ""stricter"", they say they are protecting the education of children. Between them, 155 local authorities in England and Wales (Scotland and Northern Ireland do not issue fines) issued about 400,000 penalties over three years. A further 19 did not supply data. On average, 12 penalties were issued per 1,000 children - whether for truancy or for parents taking children away on holiday during term time - during 2016-17. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map by Daniel Wainwright and Daniel Dunford, built with Carto. Can't see the map?Click or tap here,external Some councils issued penalties at rates five times the average, including the Isle of Wight (64 per 1,000 pupils),which last year won a long-running case over an unauthorised holiday, East Riding of Yorkshire (63 per 1,000) and Suffolk (60 per 1,000). All three councils issued penalty tickets at a rate of more than 60 per 1,000 pupils (compared with 12 per 1,000 on average). Of the Welsh authorities, Merthyr Tydfil had the highest penalty rate at 4.6 per 1,000 pupils, less than half the average for England and Wales. Term-time holiday: What are the rules? School attendance and absence: The facts Shortened summer holidays plan approved Paul Brading, Isle of Wight's cabinet member for schools, said its high rate of fines was because officials want every unauthorised absence to be ""thoroughly followed through"". From 2019, the authority is cutting the summer holiday from six to five weeks and introducing a two-week autumn half term instead. The changes would also give island parents - many of whom work in the tourism sector - greater freedom to take a family break outside traditional school holiday dates. Dave Brain, wife Hannah, and their three children on their holiday in Florida last summer When Dave Brain's father passed away, he decided to use money left to him to pay for a family holiday to Florida. Going during the school holidays, he said, would have cost about Â£8,000 rather than the Â£4,500 they would be charged for a term-time trans-Atlantic holiday. So Mr Brain, wife Hannah and their three children decided to ignore the threat of a Â£60 fine and flew off for a two-week holiday last September. Florida as a destination held particular importance for Mr Brain, of Bristol, because his late father used to take him there as a child. ""We try and stick to the holidays,"" he said. ""But this was different and we budgeted for the fine,"" said Mr Brain, co-creator and producer of the YouTube channel Guksack. After their return to the UK, the family received a Â£60 fine for one of their children. ""And I would do it again in an instant if the same opportunity arose,"" he said. Have you ever taken your child on a term time holiday? Have you been fined for doing so? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Visionary physicist Stephen Hawking dies Is this the end for 1p and 2p coins? Nando's cries fowl over rival's branding Some councils reported a drop in the number of fines issued for term-time holidays during a high-profile court case. In 2017, the Supreme Court ruled against Jon Platt, who had won earlier legal battles against a Â£120 fine in a case brought by Isle of Wight council. Jon Platt took his daughter on a week's holiday to Disney World in the United States three years ago without the head teacher's permission Mr Platt, originally from Northern Ireland, was fined for taking his daughter on holiday without permission. One authority watching the Platt case closely was Nottingham City Council, where the number of fines issued dropped from 1,129 in 2014-15 to just 282 in 2016-17. A council spokesman said the authority had ""placed a temporary hold on fines for holidays in term-time while we awaited the judgment"". Fining resumed last autumn, he said. Parents in Nottinghamshire faced the steepest rise in the number of fines issued in England - up tenfold from 370 in 2014-15 to 3,771 in 2016-17. Denis McCarthy, service manager at Nottinghamshire County Council said the figures reflected schools ""being stricter about the circumstances in which they authorise absence"". ""It essentially reflects an increased level of enforcement activity being requested by schools in response to parents removing their children from school in term time for an unauthorised leave of absence,"" he said. ""Historically - compared to some authorities - we issued a small number of fines. ""So, whilst the increases seem significant I think we are now probably more in line with lots of other authorities."" In Essex, the second largest education authority area in the country (after Kent), parents saw the number of penalties issued treble (from 909 in 2014-15 to 3,165 in 2016-17) for unauthorised term time holidays. Ray Gooding, the authority's cabinet member for education, said: ""There are clear links between attendance and attainment, and every lesson really does count."" At the other end of the spectrum is Southend Borough Council, where the number of penalties issued dropped 98% from 52 in 2014-15 to just one - for truancy - in 2016-17. The money from penalties goes to local education authorities to cover the cost of enforcement, including prosecution Penalty notices can be issued for a number of reasons including truancy, holidays taken during term-time and pupils caught during ""exclusion sweeps"". Local authorities act on behalf of schools in issuing penalties, which start at Â£60 and then rise to Â£120 if not paid within three weeks. A spokesman for the Association of School and College Leaders said: ""No doubt people will argue that there should be a uniform approach across the country. ""But I would have thought there is a reasonable case for these decisions to be made locally as schools and councils will be in the best position to judge what is most effective as part of an overall strategy to deter unauthorised absences. ""The other point - and surely the most important one -  is that there should be no need to issue any penalty notices at all because children should not be removed from school without authorisation.""

Her mother told the review that too many people had been involved in her care and she could not build the trust she needed to speak out. During an initial assessment ""Becky reported feeling scared about a lot of things"" and told a family support worker that she read about abduction cases. The report said instead of looking at her wider problems Becky was described as ""controlling"", ""lacking aspiration"" and ""not engaged with the assessment"". Mr Galsworthy said in hindsight they could see her behaviour was worse when her step-brother, who bullied her about her weight, was present. The review said there was no evidence that her murder could have been ""predicted or prevented by any professional working with Becky"". But it did find there was a need for services to be focussed on ""the needs and circumstance of adolescents"" to avoid vulnerable young people ""being seen as 'troublesome' rather than troubled because of their circumstances"". The safeguarding board also said there were shortcomings in ""assessing and understanding"" Becky's complex needs and professionals failed to engage her father and help him understand her issues. It also recommended trying to engage fathers in family therapy and parenting sessions. The report said that ""at the time of working with Becky there were inconsistencies"" in the multi-agency approach to looking after Becky and recommended in future that professionals should not take what parents or carers say about a young person at ""face value"". In addition to the safeguarding review, there is an ongoing Domestic Homicide Review into Becky's case.

"The couple had posted videos of their pranks to YouTube in a quest for internet fame A US woman has been sentenced to six months' imprisonment for shooting dead her boyfriend in a botched stunt they hoped would go viral on YouTube. Monalisa Perez, now 20, was asked by Pedro Ruiz, 22, to fire a gun from a foot (30cm) away, believing a thick book he held in front of his chest would shield him. The bullet pierced the 1.5in book, fatally wounding Ruiz last June. Perez, a mother of two, later pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter. Going viral: When YouTube stunts turn deadly Minnesota Judge Jeffrey Remick set out the terms agreed under plea bargaining on Wednesday. Perez will: Serve a 180-day jail term. This will be an alternating 10 days in jail and 10 days out for the first six months, amounting to 90 days behind bars. The remaining 90 days can be served in home confinement. The jail time can be served in South Dakota, where she now lives Serve 10 years of supervised probation Be banned for life from owning firearms Make no financial gain from the case The sentencing is below state guidelines but Norman County Attorney James Brue said ""the reality [is] that this foolish stunt was dreamed up, planned and executed by Pedro Ruiz, and the defendant wrongfully and tragically relied on his assurances that the stunt was safe"". Perez and Ruiz had been documenting their everyday lives in Halstad, Minnesota, by posting videos of their pranks to a YouTube channel in a quest for internet fame. They had filmed some minor pranks, which seemed relatively harmless. She told police the stunt had been Ruiz's idea, and that he had to convince her to do it And there was little indication of how far they were prepared to go in order to become online celebrities until the fatal stunt on 26 June 2017. On that day Perez fired a powerful Desert Eagle handgun from close range, as Ruiz held an encyclopaedia in front of his chest. He had experimented previously and thought the thick book would protect him, but the couple's three-year-old child and nearly 30 onlookers watched as she fired a fatal bullet. Perez called 911 to report she had accidentally shot her boyfriend. Ruiz was pronounced dead at the scene at their home. Perez was pregnant with their second child at the time of the shooting.

"More than 100 girls could have been targeted by a sex gang in Telford between 2007 and 2009, police believe. A frontline team set up to tackle child sex abuse in Telford was overworked and under-resourced, a report says. Youth workers were unable to keep appointments with vulnerable girls due to facing ""almost double"" the recommended caseload. Team members raised concerns about the volume of high-risk cases in 2016, three years after a grooming gang was jailed for abusing girls. Telford council said it spent an extra Â£200,000 last year to tackle abuse. Midlands Live: Man quizzed on terror training camp; snow warning extended The town has been in the spotlight since the Sunday Mirror published a report about ""groups of mainly Asian men"" targeting vulnerable white teenagers in the town since the 1980s,external. A Telford & Wrekin Council report,externalfound specialist youth workers in the Cate (Children Abused Through Exploitation) team were spending a ""disproportionate amount of time"" taking children to GP or sexual health clinic appointments. They were meant to meet with girls considered to be at high risk of sexual exploitation two or three times a week. But, due to their workloads, they were unable to meet this target. Seven men were jailed in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali The specialist youth workers flagged concerns around ""decreased capacity"" and said there was no time to train other organisations in how to tackle child sexual exploitation. Police offered to pay for help from children's charity Barnardo's so its staff could take on lower-risk cases but this had not happened, the report found. The committee which compiled the document, to look at how abuse was being tackled in Telford, said it had particular concerns about resources against a backdrop of ""dramatic"" public sector cuts. It was written after seven men were jailed following West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice. The head of Telford's safeguarding children board claims there is ""no evidence"" grooming gangs are still operating in towns such as Wellington (pictured) More than 100 girls could have been targeted by the gang between 2007 and 2009, police believe. One victim told how she was abused at a ""rape house"" and the town's Conservative MP Lucy Allan has said white working-class girls were being traded for sex in a ""routine way"". ""Holly"" - a victim of exploitation in the town from the age of 14 - told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she went to a sexual health clinic for the morning-after pill twice a week for three years, but no-one ever asked her any questions. She said she was beaten with a belt and sold ""two or three times a night"". Calling for an independent inquiry, Ms Allan said the cases would not have happened had the victims been from different backgrounds. Telford's Conservative MP Lucy Allan said white working-class girls had been traded for sex ""in a routine way"" Adele Gladman, an independent safeguarding consultant, said: ""As a country, England is becoming reactive rather than proactive. ""I think we have a far greater problem with CSE in England than in Wales or Scotland. The long-term impacts are going to be extraordinary."" Chris Cowan, director of school theatre group Loudmouth, which works in Telford, said: ""Over the last 15 years things have changed and are getting worse in many areas. ""There used to be many different funded organisations that offered support in the community from youth clubs and centres to community centres or hubs and Sure Start centres. ""There were more outreach workers who would know the young people in an area and were an on hand source of support and would see or hear what was going on."" Meanwhile, the head of Telford's safeguarding children board claimed there was ""no evidence"" grooming gangs were still operating in Telford. Chairman Andrew Mason, said he feared ""misrepresentation"" could mean children suffering abuse did not come forward. ""The reason we are hitting the headlines is because we are so open and talk about the work we are doing."" He disputed up to 1,000 children had been victims. ""It doesn't help anyone having these figures banded around when they are a completely incorrect figure. ""It gives the impression to children that are being abused that authorities don't care and we're not good at what we do, which will discourage them from coming forward and is a poor outcome for everyone involved."" A spokesman for West Mercia Police and Crime Commissioner said more than Â£80,000 had been given to Barnardo's this year and last year to help tackle exploitation in the force area. Barnardo's said that money was only for work in Herefordshire and Worcestershire and not Telford, in Shropshire, as there was a Cate team already operating there. Telford & Wrekin Council said current workloads within its Cate team were at recommended levels. It added the team now offered training to other organisations.

"Council leader Heather Smith resigned following the report's publication Cash-strapped Northamptonshire County Council should be scrapped, according to a government report. The report, ordered by Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid, recommends ""a new start"" which is ""best achieved by the creation of two new unitary councils"". Council leader Heather Smith resigned following the report's publication. Northampton North MP Michael Ellis called the management of the authority a ""national scandal"". He said he was ""appalled"" by the report, which ""makes for chilling reading"". Northamptonshire's Â£40m worth of cuts MPs call for takeover of no-spend council Probe ordered into county council's finances Mr Javid called for the report in January after the council revealed it was looking to make budget cuts of about Â£34m. The authority was later forced to ban all new spendingto balance its budget for this year. Auditor KPMG then issued a legal warning that led to the council re-working its budget for 2018-19 to make Â£40m worth of cuts. This video can not be played People in Northampton give their verdict on the council's financial crisis In February, all seven of the county's Tory MPs said they had lost confidence in the authority's leadership. Conservative councillor Mrs Smith criticised ""vicious attacks by four local MPs"", adding ""you cannot win"" if the ""machinery of government turns against you"". Max Caller, who led the government investigation, said Northamptonshire should have two new unitary authorities by 2020, one covering Daventry, Northampton and South Northamptonshire and the other covering Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering and Wellingborough. That would mean the county council would cease to exist. The report said its findings are ""very serious"" for the council and its residents. All seven of Northamptonshire's MPs, including Michael Ellis (bottom left), have previously called for commissioners to be brought into Northamptonshire County Council Mr Caller also said government commissioners should be sent in to the authority. He added that ""living within budget constraints is not part of the culture"" of the council. The council ""did not respond well, or in many cases even react, to external and internal criticism"", Mr Caller said. He added individual councillors ""appear to have been denied answers"" to legitimate questions. In October,the council launched a campaign for fairer fundingfrom the government, but the report said it had not been ""particularly badly treated by the funding formula"". Next year's council budget will see Â£39.2m of cuts made, including the closure of 21 small libraries Mr Caller was alsocritical of the council's 'Next Generation Model,'which planned to outsource all services and create four new bodies for child protection, care of vulnerable adults, providing health and well-being services, and improving the county. The report said the model did not have ""any documented underpinning"" of how it intended to deliver Â£68m of savings, and ""served to obscure and prevent effective"" budgetary control. It does add that the council ""employs many good, hardworking, dedicated staff"". Mrs Smith said she had made ""repeated representations"" to central government about ""spiralling costs of social care"" and the council's inability to meet those costs. She said Â£50m is needed per year to meet statutory obligations in Northamptonshire, adding that she would prefer a single unitary authority as ""two unitaries won't save sufficient money"". Sajid Javid ordered an independent inspection of Northamptonshire County Council Deputy leader Matthew Golby, who is performing the functions of council leader prior to any formal appointment, said the authority accepted the inspector has found ""what he believes to be significant failings at the council"". He said while the report says the authority is ""in no worse position than any other council"", Northamptonshire's leadership ""would argue the sector as a whole does face significant financial challenges"". The leaders of Northamptonshire's district and borough councils issued a joint statement saying they ""acknowledge the enormity of the situation"" but ""do not believe a unitary model is the only way forward"".

"Mariam Moustafa, 18, was an engineering student at Nottingham College Police are keeping an ""open mind"" about whether an attack on an Egyptian student that sparked outrage in her home country was racially motivated. Mariam Moustafa, 18, died on Wednesday after being attacked by a group in Nottingham three weeks earlier. The hashtag ""Mariam's rights will not be lost"" has been trending in Egypt. Egypt's prosecutor-general has requested information about the probe into her death by British officials, according to BBC Monitoring. The Egyptian Embassy said it had been ""closely following"" the circumstances of the ""vicious attack"" and had ""expressed the need for those responsible to be brought to justice swiftly"" with UK authorities. ""The deep concern of the Egyptian public is evident and the embassy remains focussed in its efforts to support and assist Mariam's grieving family whose life has been shattered by their traumatic loss,"" the statement added. Nottinghamshire Police said: ""At this time, from our investigation, there is no information to suggest that the assault was motivated by hate but we continue to keep an open mind."" Live updates and more from the East Midlands A 17-year-old girl was arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm and was released on conditional bail. Miss Moustafa's uncle told the BBC he believed a group of about 10 girls had started beating his niece before she ran to get on a bus. He said the girls kept beating her until she passed out and a man intervened to help. Her younger sister, Mallak Moustafa, said her sibling told her how the attack unfolded before she went into a coma. ""My sister couldn't see as she'd been hit in the head but then as soon as she saw our bus coming, she ran to it, trying to get on it,"" she said. ""She got on to the bus, she didn't think they'd all pay Â£1 to get on but they went up to her when she'd sat down and said they weren't finished with her. ""Then the girls kept saying punch her more, punch her more. Then she couldn't see what was going on."" This video can not be played Mariam Moustafa's sister, Mallak, and father, Muhammad, spoke to the BBC She added she had seen some of the people involved ""laughing about my sister's coma"" on Instagram. ""I was shocked and they should be ashamed of themselves,"" she added. ""We thought England would be our future, be an engineer one day, anything we wanted to be, that's why my dad brought us to England. ""But it seems like it has actually ruined us, we didn't think England was like that."" Miss Moustafa's father, Hatim Moustafa, said: ""When Mariam was born, I did my best for her. ""I come here for her future and education, for my daughter, to be engineering but now it is not fair."" Police said the attack started in Parliament Street in Nottingham Nottinghamshire Police said Miss Moustafa was ""punched several times"" outside the Victoria Centre in Parliament Street at about 20:00 GMT on 20 February. The force said she then got on a bus but was followed ""by the same group of women who were threatening and abusive towards her before they got off"". In a statement, bus company Nottingham City Transport (NCT) said one of its drivers helped Miss Moustafa. ""We would like to publicly recognise our driver, who went upstairs to intervene and acted as a barrier between the attackers and the young lady, after he asked them to leave the bus,"" NCT said. ""CCTV from the bus has been provided to Nottinghamshire Police as part of their investigation into this appalling attack and we continue to support their efforts to identify the culprits."" A spokesperson for Nottingham College said Mariam was ""well-liked and able"" Miss Moustafa's uncle said the hospital sent her home initially, where she fell ill and was taken back to hospital where she entered into a coma. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust said an initial review ""does not indicate any significant untoward incident on the trust's part, however we will fully examine the family's concerns"". Miss Moustafa was an engineering student at Nottingham College. Yultan Mellor, a vice principal at the college, said Mariam was ""well-liked and able"" and had ""strong aspirations for her future studies and eventual career"". Her best friend, Mariam Jankeh John, said she was ""loving, cheerful, fashionable and intelligent"". ""I can't imagine someone as friendly, calm and cheerful as Mariam can be a victim,"" she said. The statement released by the Egyptian Embassy added: ""The consul general of Egypt and the medical counsellor, as well as a representative from the embassy, were immediately dispatched to offer support and assistance to the family at this devastating time.

"Mr Salmond has hosted a weekly show on RT since November Alex Salmond has launched a staunch defence of his weekly show on Russian broadcaster RT as he warned regulator Ofcom against closing the channel down. Opponents have accused the former Scottish first minister of being a ""useful idiot for the Kremlin"". But Mr Salmond insisted that the state-funded channel was not propaganda, and he had never been told what to say. And he said revoking its broadcasting licence in the UK would ""make a mockery of freedom of speech"". Ofcom said earlier this week that it could strip RT (Russia Today) of its broadcasting licence if the UK government concluded that Moscow was behind the chemical poisoning of a former spy in Salisbury. There have been claims that RT acts as a propaganda tool for the Kremlin, although politicians from all of the major UK political parties have appeared on it. Russia 'will expel UK diplomats soon' How is the UK retaliating against Russia? Analysis: No easy choices for UK On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs that there was ""no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable"" for the attack that left Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, critically ill in hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident. Speaking on his show on Wednesday morning, Mr Salmond said the chemical poisoning was a ""heinous crime"" that should be ""universally condemned"", although he did not directly accuse Moscow of being responsible. He did acknowledge that the UK government was ""totally convinced that the Russian state is involved"" and said it was therefore ""entitled to take a range of additional measures"". But he said the government would need to produce ""overwhelming evidence"", which Russia would then have to answer. The Kremlin-funded news channel began broadcasting internationally in 2005 in English, Arabic and Spanish as Rossiya Segodnya (Russia Today). It shortened its name to RT several years later and began focusing on US news. It launched a dedicated UK service in 2014. It says it provides a ""Russian viewpoint"" on world events and challenges ""mainstream media"" - but critics say it is a propaganda vehicle for the Russian government. It has been sanctioned by UK regulator Ofcom for misleading programmes on the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Its website has prominently featured claims that British intelligence agencies may have been involved in the poisoning of Mr Skripal. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said last year it was ""an absolute scandal"" that Labour MPs had given interviews to RT. A number of Conservative and SNP politicians - and ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage - have also appeared on the channel. The channel was recently forced toregister as a foreign agent in the US. Mr Salmond said he held ""no brief for the Kremlin"", and added: ""No-one has tried to influence the content of this show in any way, shape or form whatsoever. ""By definition RT has not been a propaganda station because it is regulated under a UK licence by Ofcom. ""Yes it has had breaches of the Ofcom code, but so have Sky, ITV and the BBC."" Mr Salmond said shutting down RT would send the message that ""your standpoint is so uncertain that you must exclude other perspectives"". Sturgeon condemns Russia over spy attack Don't go on Russia Today, Labour tells MPs He continued: ""To censure would make a travesty of the concept of nation speaking unto nation, a mockery of freedom of speech and it would portray an image of a country lost in self-doubt. ""Liberal democracies don't succeed in international confrontations by sacrificing their dearest held values - their freedom of speech."" Speaking at Holyrood, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said RT exists ""for the sole purpose of promoting the agenda of Putin's regime"". She added: ""It acts as an apologist for a government which all the evidence shows has directly or indirectly been culpable in a chemical attack on Britain's soil."" Ms Davidson called on the first minister and others to ""unite against propaganda channels which spread disinformation and undermine our values"". In response, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she hadmade her views on RT known in the past, and had not changed that view. But she said it was right that the question of whether RT should be allowed to continue broadcasting was one for Ofcom rather than politicians. Ms Sturgeon said Russian donations to political parties were also a major issue - a reference to money given to the Conservatives byseveral Russian oligarchs in recent years. She added: ""Based on what I have been told - and in my case, of course, that includes briefing directly from the national security advisor - I believe at this stage the conclusion that Russia was responsible (for the chemical attack) is a reasonable conclusion. ""Therefore I think it demands a proportionate, but a very firm, response and that is why I support the initial steps that the prime minister outlined in the House of Commons."" Ms Sturgeon has previously distanced herself from Mr Salmond's RT show, saying she would have advised him against doing it if he had asked her advice. Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that it was ""unfortunate, to put it mildly"" that Mr Salmond was associated with RT, and called on him to reconsider his position. Labour's Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said he will not be making any more appearances on RT, whose coverage he said ""goes beyond objective journalism"", and has urged other Labour MPs not to appear.

"The embassy is waiting to learn about the Russian response Moscow has vowed there will be a swift response to the expulsion of 23 of its diplomats by Britain.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has been speaking on the issue at an event in Moscow, although Russian media reports of what he has said have been conflicting. The RIA Novosti agency quoted him as saying Russia would ""definitely"" expel UK diplomats ""soon"". But he was quoted by others as saying that Russia would inform British authorities first before any media announcement. ""This is, in my view, being polite; this is how gentlemen behave,"" he said. Mr Lavrov was also quoted by Tass as saying he hoped the former spy, Sergei Skripal, would recover so he could shed light on events. Interfax quoted the foreign minister as saying a motive behind the UK's actions might be to complicate Russia's hosting of Fifa's World Cup this summer.

Mr Lavrov then said Moscow would co-operate if the UK submitted a formal request under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which gives a 10-day time limit to respond. But after Tuesday's deadline passed, the UK announced the expulsions. In addition, the UK has announced measures that include increased checks on private flights, customs and freight as well as a boycott of this year's Fifa World Cup in Russia by ministers and the Royal Family.

Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron said he would announce unspecified ""measures"" in the coming days over the poisoning. He said: ""I condemn in the strongest possible terms this unacceptable attack. Everything leads us to believe that responsibility can be attributed to Russia.""

"This video can not be played Williamson: Russia 'should go away and shut up' UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson urged Russia to ""go away"" and ""shut up"" as he unveiled plans for a new chemical weapons ""defence centre"". He made the comments as he announced a Â£48m investment in a facility that will be located at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory in Porton Down. Scientists at the Wiltshire lab helped identify the nerve agent used to attack ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal. Russia said his comments demonstrated his ""intellectual impotence"". In a speech on Thursday, Mr Williamson said the ""shocking and reckless"" attack on Mr Skripal and his daughter illustrated the increasing dangers the UK faced from chemical weapons. Mr Williamson said there was ""no doubt the attack came from Russia"". The UK is expelling 23 Russian diplomats and taking a range of other measures in response to what it said was the Russian state's culpability for the use of a military grade nerve agent on the duo in Salisbury. White House backs UK decision to expel diplomats UK to expel 23 Russian diplomats What are Novichok nerve agents? Moscow has hit out at what it described as the UK's unacceptable provocations and threatened reprisals. It has denied involvement. In questions after the speech Mr Williamson was asked what further measures the UK would take if Russia expelled British diplomats. He said: ""We will look at how Russia responds to what we've done. ""It's absolutely atrocious and outrageous what Russia did in Salisbury - we've responded to that. Frankly, Russia should go away - it should shut up. ""But if they do respond to the action we have taken, we'll consider it carefully and we'll look at our options. But it would be wrong to prejudge their response."" This video can not be played A look around Porton Down, Britain's military research base in to chemical and biological attacks Asked if the situation could lead to a new Cold War, Mr Williamson said that it had been described as a ""cool war"", adding: ""Let's face it, relations aren't good, are they?"" Mr Williamson said the UK leads the world in research into chemical, biological and radiological warfare but said this expertise needed to be developed further to confront potential hostile activity by states and individuals. ""We know the chemical threat doesn't just come from Russia but from others,"" he said. ""I can announce we will be strengthening this capability by investing Â£48m in a new Chemical Weapons Defence Centre to ensure we maintain our cutting edge in chemical analysis and defence."" But Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov criticised Mr Williamson's ""boorish statement"" as showing an ""extreme level of intellectual impotence"". ""All of this not only confirms the fact that London's accusations against Russia, which we have heard over the previous few years amount to nothing, but also the complete insignificance of the accusers themselves."" He added: ""Russia long ago developed a strong immunity to London's fake accusations towards Russia."" This video can not be played Williamson: ""Russia ripping up international rulebook"" On his visit to Porton Down, Mr Williamson also announced that, as a precaution, thousands of British troops would be offered vaccinations against anthrax, a spore-producing bacterial disease used in a series of bio-terror attacks in the US in 2001. British troops who are held at high-readiness will be offered the vaccine on a voluntary basis so they are ready to deploy to areas where the risk of this type of attack exists. Mr Williamson, who took over the role in November, is currently reviewing Britain's defences amid calls from Conservative MPs for a moratorium on cuts to the armed forces and defence capability. The BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said Mr Williamson was making clear that Britain must invest more in defence to counter both conventional and emerging threats like cyber warfare. ""As Brexit beckons, the eyes of the world are on us. Rest assured our adversaries will be watching even more closely than our allies,"" Mr Williamson said.

"Mr Salmond has hosted a weekly show on RT since November Alex Salmond has launched a staunch defence of his weekly show on Russian broadcaster RT as he warned regulator Ofcom against closing the channel down. Opponents have accused the former Scottish first minister of being a ""useful idiot for the Kremlin"". But Mr Salmond insisted that the state-funded channel was not propaganda, and he had never been told what to say. And he said revoking its broadcasting licence in the UK would ""make a mockery of freedom of speech"". Ofcom said earlier this week that it could strip RT (Russia Today) of its broadcasting licence if the UK government concluded that Moscow was behind the chemical poisoning of a former spy in Salisbury. There have been claims that RT acts as a propaganda tool for the Kremlin, although politicians from all of the major UK political parties have appeared on it. Russia 'will expel UK diplomats soon' How is the UK retaliating against Russia? Analysis: No easy choices for UK On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs that there was ""no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable"" for the attack that left Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, critically ill in hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident. Speaking on his show on Wednesday morning, Mr Salmond said the chemical poisoning was a ""heinous crime"" that should be ""universally condemned"", although he did not directly accuse Moscow of being responsible. He did acknowledge that the UK government was ""totally convinced that the Russian state is involved"" and said it was therefore ""entitled to take a range of additional measures"". But he said the government would need to produce ""overwhelming evidence"", which Russia would then have to answer. The Kremlin-funded news channel began broadcasting internationally in 2005 in English, Arabic and Spanish as Rossiya Segodnya (Russia Today). It shortened its name to RT several years later and began focusing on US news. It launched a dedicated UK service in 2014. It says it provides a ""Russian viewpoint"" on world events and challenges ""mainstream media"" - but critics say it is a propaganda vehicle for the Russian government. It has been sanctioned by UK regulator Ofcom for misleading programmes on the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Its website has prominently featured claims that British intelligence agencies may have been involved in the poisoning of Mr Skripal. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said last year it was ""an absolute scandal"" that Labour MPs had given interviews to RT. A number of Conservative and SNP politicians - and ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage - have also appeared on the channel. The channel was recently forced toregister as a foreign agent in the US. Mr Salmond said he held ""no brief for the Kremlin"", and added: ""No-one has tried to influence the content of this show in any way, shape or form whatsoever. ""By definition RT has not been a propaganda station because it is regulated under a UK licence by Ofcom. ""Yes it has had breaches of the Ofcom code, but so have Sky, ITV and the BBC."" Mr Salmond said shutting down RT would send the message that ""your standpoint is so uncertain that you must exclude other perspectives"". Sturgeon condemns Russia over spy attack Don't go on Russia Today, Labour tells MPs He continued: ""To censure would make a travesty of the concept of nation speaking unto nation, a mockery of freedom of speech and it would portray an image of a country lost in self-doubt. ""Liberal democracies don't succeed in international confrontations by sacrificing their dearest held values - their freedom of speech."" Speaking at Holyrood, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said RT exists ""for the sole purpose of promoting the agenda of Putin's regime"". She added: ""It acts as an apologist for a government which all the evidence shows has directly or indirectly been culpable in a chemical attack on Britain's soil."" Ms Davidson called on the first minister and others to ""unite against propaganda channels which spread disinformation and undermine our values"". In response, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she hadmade her views on RT known in the past, and had not changed that view. But she said it was right that the question of whether RT should be allowed to continue broadcasting was one for Ofcom rather than politicians. Ms Sturgeon said Russian donations to political parties were also a major issue - a reference to money given to the Conservatives byseveral Russian oligarchs in recent years. She added: ""Based on what I have been told - and in my case, of course, that includes briefing directly from the national security advisor - I believe at this stage the conclusion that Russia was responsible (for the chemical attack) is a reasonable conclusion. ""Therefore I think it demands a proportionate, but a very firm, response and that is why I support the initial steps that the prime minister outlined in the House of Commons."" Ms Sturgeon has previously distanced herself from Mr Salmond's RT show, saying she would have advised him against doing it if he had asked her advice. Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that it was ""unfortunate, to put it mildly"" that Mr Salmond was associated with RT, and called on him to reconsider his position. Labour's Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said he will not be making any more appearances on RT, whose coverage he said ""goes beyond objective journalism"", and has urged other Labour MPs not to appear.

"Poppi Worthington was blue and not breathing when she was taken to hospital There will be no further review into the death of toddler Poppi Worthington, prosecutors have said. In January, coroner David Roberts said the 13-month-old was sexually assaulted by her father, Paul, before her death in December 2012 from asphyxia. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said no new evidence ""capable of affecting decisions not to prosecute"" had emerged at the inquest. Poppi's mother said she was ""extremely disappointed"" by the decision. In a statement released through her solicitor Fiona McGhie, she said it was the ""third time"" a court had found, on the balance of probabilities, that Poppi was sexually assaulted prior to death Ms McGhie said Poppi's mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, ""was also left disappointed that Poppi's father chose to rely on his right not to answer many questions which may incriminate him at the inquest. She added: ""While she understands he was entitled to do this, she considers that the coroner's inquiry was frustrated by this. ""The past five years have been a complete nightmare for her. ""Not knowing what happened to Poppi on that day, and knowing that there were evidence gathering failures by the police in the very early stages of the investigation has made things even worse. ""Although she is now closer to the devastating truth, it is likely that she may never get full closure on exactly what happened that night."" Poppi Worthington death: Key dates 'Why did you hurt your daughter?' The inquest: Review of evidence, findings and conclusion,external High levels of security were in place when Paul Worthington attended the second inquest Three reviews were conducted between March 2015 and November 2016. On those occasions, three different prosecutors decided that there was ""insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction"". During the three-week inquest at Kendal Coroner's Court in November last year, Mr Worthington declined to answer 252 questions about the circumstances surrounding Poppi's death. He said he had gone to get her a fresh nappy and returned a few minutes later to find her limp and unresponsive. He told the coroner he rushed downstairs and Poppi's mother called an ambulance. Poppi was pronounced dead at Furness General Hospital soon after. However, Mr Roberts said the 50-year-old's account of events did not ""stand up to scrutiny"". He ruled Mr Worthington assaulted his daughter in his bed, laid a cover over her and went to sleep with Poppi dying because her ability to breathe was compromised as a result of ""an unsafe sleeping environment."" Mr Worthington is now living in hiding with the help of police protection In a statement announcing its latest decision, the CPS said: ""The coroner's verdict has now been considered carefully. ""No new witness was called at the inquest whose evidence had not already been considered by the CPS prosecutors. ""The medical issues raised by those witnesses were the same and the evidence given by each in respect of those issues was essentially the same. ""As in all cases, we would consider any future referrals from police should significant new evidence become available to them."" Cumbria Police, which carried out a second investigation into the youngster's deathafter its first was found to have suffered a catalogue of failures, said it had ""liaised closely with the CPS over the past two months"".

"Nordic countries regularly appear in the top five happiest places, according to the survey, with Finland coming top this year This year's happiest place on Earth is Finland, according to an annual UN report - toppling Norway from the top spot. TheWorld Happiness Report measures ""subjective well-being"",external- how happy people feel they are, and why. Nordic countries regularly appear in the top five, while war-hit countries and a number in sub-Saharan Africa regularly appear in the bottom five. Burundi was the least happy, taking over from the Central African Republic. It was thrown into crisis when President Pierre Nkurunziza's bid for re-election to a third term in 2015 sparked protests by opposition supporters who said the move was unconstitutional. This year's report by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network also features data about the happiness of immigrants in their host countries, with Finland also coming top as home to the happiest immigrants. The Finns love to get hot and steamy in saunas- with an estimated 3.3 million, there are enough steam rooms for more than one every other person They have the most metal bands per capita. The most famous include HIM, Nightwish and Children of Bodom From Lapland, you can see wild reindeer, the Northern Lights and if you are lucky Santa Claus The country's most famous exports include the cartoon characters called Moomins and the mobile gaming app Angry Birds ""I think everything in this society is set up for people to be successful, starting with university and transportation that works really well,"" American teacher Brianna Owens, who lives in Finland's second biggest city Espoo, told Reuters news agency. The survey ranks some 156 countries by their happiness levels, and 117 by the happiness of their immigrants. Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Switzerland were the other countries in the top five. The UK and US came in at 19th and 18th places respectively. Togo is seen to be this year's biggest gainer, moving up 17 places, while the biggest loser is Venezuela, which dropped 20 places to 102nd. The study found that the 10 happiest countries also scored highest on immigrant happiness, suggesting that migrants' wellbeing was tied to the quality of life in their adopted home. With a population of around 5.5 million people, Finland counted some 300,000 foreigners in 2016, reports say. ""The most striking finding of the report is the remarkable consistency between the happiness of immigrants and the locally born,"" said John Helliwell, co-editor of the report and a professor at the University of British Columbia. Can we all be as happy as Scandinavians? Can I learn to be happy? The report relies on asking a simple, subjective question of more than 1,000 people in more than 150 countries. ""Imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. ""The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?"" The average result is the country's score - ranging from Finland's 7.6 to Burundi's 2.9. But the report also uses statistics to explain why one country is happier than another. It looks at factors including economic strength (measured in GDP per capita), social support, life expectancy, freedom of choice, generosity, and perceived corruption.

"The embassy is waiting to learn about the Russian response Moscow has vowed there will be a swift response to the expulsion of 23 of its diplomats by Britain. President Vladimir Putin would make a final decision and ""won't take long"" to respond, his spokesman said. The UK took its action after Moscow refused to explain how a Russian-made nerve agent was used on a former spy and his daughter in the UK. Russia denies it was involved.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has been speaking on the issue at an event in Moscow, although Russian media reports of what he has said have been conflicting. The RIA Novosti agency quoted him as saying Russia would ""definitely"" expel UK diplomats ""soon"". But he was quoted by others as saying that Russia would inform British authorities first before any media announcement. ""This is, in my view, being polite; this is how gentlemen behave,"" he said. Mr Lavrov was also quoted by Tass as saying he hoped the former spy, Sergei Skripal, would recover so he could shed light on events. Interfax quoted the foreign minister as saying a motive behind the UK's actions might be to complicate Russia's hosting of Fifa's World Cup this summer.

Moscow wanted to ""simultaneously deny it and at the same time to glory in it"", he said, adding the nerve agent was chosen ""to show that it is Russia"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia ""should go away and should shut up"". Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, 33, were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 4 March and remain critically ill in hospital.

This video can not be played Theresa May announces measures to send a ""clear message"" to Russia over the use of a nerve agent in Salisbury The prime minister, who visited Salisbury on Thursday, said there was ""no alternative conclusion"" than to believe Russia was ""culpable"" for the poisonings. She had given Russia a deadline of last Tuesday evening to explain the use of the nerve agent. Mr Lavrov then said Moscow would co-operate if the UK submitted a formal request under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which gives a 10-day time limit to respond. But after Tuesday's deadline passed, the UK announced the expulsions. In addition, the UK has announced measures that include increased checks on private flights, customs and freight as well as a boycott of this year's Fifa World Cup in Russia by ministers and the Royal Family. Thursday's four-nation joint statement said the western allies shared the UK's view that Russia was responsible.

""We call on Russia to live up to its responsibilities as a member of the UN Security Council to uphold international peace and security."" Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron said he would announce unspecified ""measures"" in the coming days over the poisoning. He said: ""I condemn in the strongest possible terms this unacceptable attack. Everything leads us to believe that responsibility can be attributed to Russia.""

She also visited Det Sgt Nick Bailey in Salisbury District Hospital, where he is being treated for exposure to the nerve agent after attending to the Skirpals. Her spokesman said the two of them had a ""private conversation"". Wiltshire Chief Constable Kier Pritchard said: ""I know that both he and his wife really appreciated this time with [Mrs May].""

She said diplomatic notes sent to the Foreign Office had received replies that ""made no sense"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson stepped up the war of words with Russia on Thursday.

This video can not be played The foreign secretary told Radio 4 Today the Russia tensions aren't a return to the Cold War He told the BBC a sample of the nerve agent would be sent to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - the independent international body set up to stop chemical warfare - for analysis. But he added that Russia's ""smug, sarcastic"" response indicated their ""fundamental guilt"". Moscow wanted to ""simultaneously deny it and at the same time to glory in it"", he said, adding the nerve agent was chosen ""to show that it is Russia"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia ""should go away and should shut up"". Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, 33, were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 4 March and remain critically ill in hospital. The chemical used in the attack has been identified as part of a group of nerve agents developed by Russia known as Novichok, Mrs May said. This video can not be played Theresa May announces measures to send a ""clear message"" to Russia over the use of a nerve agent in Salisbury The prime minister, who visited Salisbury on Thursday, said there was ""no alternative conclusion"" than to believe Russia was ""culpable"" for the poisonings. She had given Russia a deadline of last Tuesday evening to explain the use of the nerve agent. Mr Lavrov then said Moscow would co-operate if the UK submitted a formal request under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which gives a 10-day time limit to respond. But after Tuesday's deadline passed, the UK announced the expulsions. In addition, the UK has announced measures that include increased checks on private flights, customs and freight as well as a boycott of this year's Fifa World Cup in Russia by ministers and the Royal Family. Thursday's four-nation joint statement said the western allies shared the UK's view that Russia was responsible. ""Russia's failure to address the legitimate request by the UK government further underlines its responsibility,"" it said. ""We call on Russia to live up to its responsibilities as a member of the UN Security Council to uphold international peace and security."" Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron said he would announce unspecified ""measures"" in the coming days over the poisoning. He said: ""I condemn in the strongest possible terms this unacceptable attack. Everything leads us to believe that responsibility can be attributed to Russia."" On Wednesday, the White House said it ""stands in solidarity"" with ""its closest ally"" the UK and supported its decision to expel the Russian diplomats.

"The UK is seeking support in the UN Security Council but knows Russia can sabotage the process There are no easy political choices for the prime minister. She has taken significant steps to try to punish Russia for the poisoning attack in Salisbury with the biggest diplomatic moves against Russia since the end of the Cold War. But the government is all too aware that there is likely to be retaliation from Moscow, alongside ongoing denials and scorn in the coming days. By implication then, the government is well aware that they will have to make more moves in the coming days, or risk looking as if they have backed down after one opening blast. But ministers also know that bigger and bolder moves can't be taken without support from international friends and allies. UK to expel 23 Russian diplomats Corbyn aide queries proof of Russian guilt But as soon as other countries' interests come into play, so too do competing demands for them. At the UN, Russia itself, of course, can sabotage the process. In the EU other countries, even Britain's friends, have other considerations to take - closer business ties, a reliance on Russian gas. No 10 has put significant effort into trying to shore up friendly signals from allies, but words of support may not translate into a commitment to any firm actions. Ministers obviously felt they had little choice but to take firm action today but in the longer term, it is clearly not diplomatically desirable for Britain to have plunged its relations with Russia into the deep freeze if friendly countries aren't willing to try to help in meaningful ways. The prime minister's undoubtedly tricky position is however shored up by noisy support from her backbenches, a unity that she is unaccustomed to. The roles have perhaps been reversed. Because in the last couple of days Labour has looked like two parties again, with the Tories cheering their rival backbenchers opposite when they rise to support the government's position in the Commons -  while Jeremy Corbyn's front bench team stayed silent at times, arms crossed, faces glum. And at least one senior frontbencher in the Labour Party is considering leaving his post tonight, and Labour MPs are circulating a motion that explicitly backs Theresa May's position, not the Labour leader's. The uneasy truce in Labour that's held since the general election has cracked wide open again. To his supporters, one of Jeremy Corbyn's fundamental appeals is that he doesn't believe in going along with the government on foreign policy. Simply, he is not ready yet to point the finger at the Russian state. But for others in Labour this is unacceptable, and by betraying the tradition that the main two parties stick together in this kind of situation, at least publicly, he is also betraying some of Labour's own traditions. Forget Brexit for now, this challenge to our relations with the rest of the world could become a defining feature of our politics for both sides at home.

"Mr Salmond has hosted a weekly show on RT since November Alex Salmond has launched a staunch defence of his weekly show on Russian broadcaster RT as he warned regulator Ofcom against closing the channel down. Opponents have accused the former Scottish first minister of being a ""useful idiot for the Kremlin"". But Mr Salmond insisted that the state-funded channel was not propaganda, and he had never been told what to say. And he said revoking its broadcasting licence in the UK would ""make a mockery of freedom of speech"". Ofcom said earlier this week that it could strip RT (Russia Today) of its broadcasting licence if the UK government concluded that Moscow was behind the chemical poisoning of a former spy in Salisbury. There have been claims that RT acts as a propaganda tool for the Kremlin, although politicians from all of the major UK political parties have appeared on it. Russia 'will expel UK diplomats soon' How is the UK retaliating against Russia? Analysis: No easy choices for UK On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs that there was ""no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable"" for the attack that left Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, critically ill in hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident. Speaking on his show on Wednesday morning, Mr Salmond said the chemical poisoning was a ""heinous crime"" that should be ""universally condemned"", although he did not directly accuse Moscow of being responsible. He did acknowledge that the UK government was ""totally convinced that the Russian state is involved"" and said it was therefore ""entitled to take a range of additional measures"". But he said the government would need to produce ""overwhelming evidence"", which Russia would then have to answer. The Kremlin-funded news channel began broadcasting internationally in 2005 in English, Arabic and Spanish as Rossiya Segodnya (Russia Today). It shortened its name to RT several years later and began focusing on US news. It launched a dedicated UK service in 2014. It says it provides a ""Russian viewpoint"" on world events and challenges ""mainstream media"" - but critics say it is a propaganda vehicle for the Russian government. It has been sanctioned by UK regulator Ofcom for misleading programmes on the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Its website has prominently featured claims that British intelligence agencies may have been involved in the poisoning of Mr Skripal. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said last year it was ""an absolute scandal"" that Labour MPs had given interviews to RT. A number of Conservative and SNP politicians - and ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage - have also appeared on the channel. The channel was recently forced toregister as a foreign agent in the US. Mr Salmond said he held ""no brief for the Kremlin"", and added: ""No-one has tried to influence the content of this show in any way, shape or form whatsoever. ""By definition RT has not been a propaganda station because it is regulated under a UK licence by Ofcom. ""Yes it has had breaches of the Ofcom code, but so have Sky, ITV and the BBC."" Mr Salmond said shutting down RT would send the message that ""your standpoint is so uncertain that you must exclude other perspectives"". Sturgeon condemns Russia over spy attack Don't go on Russia Today, Labour tells MPs He continued: ""To censure would make a travesty of the concept of nation speaking unto nation, a mockery of freedom of speech and it would portray an image of a country lost in self-doubt. ""Liberal democracies don't succeed in international confrontations by sacrificing their dearest held values - their freedom of speech."" Speaking at Holyrood, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said RT exists ""for the sole purpose of promoting the agenda of Putin's regime"". She added: ""It acts as an apologist for a government which all the evidence shows has directly or indirectly been culpable in a chemical attack on Britain's soil."" Ms Davidson called on the first minister and others to ""unite against propaganda channels which spread disinformation and undermine our values"". In response, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she hadmade her views on RT known in the past, and had not changed that view. But she said it was right that the question of whether RT should be allowed to continue broadcasting was one for Ofcom rather than politicians. Ms Sturgeon said Russian donations to political parties were also a major issue - a reference to money given to the Conservatives byseveral Russian oligarchs in recent years. She added: ""Based on what I have been told - and in my case, of course, that includes briefing directly from the national security advisor - I believe at this stage the conclusion that Russia was responsible (for the chemical attack) is a reasonable conclusion. ""Therefore I think it demands a proportionate, but a very firm, response and that is why I support the initial steps that the prime minister outlined in the House of Commons."" Ms Sturgeon has previously distanced herself from Mr Salmond's RT show, saying she would have advised him against doing it if he had asked her advice. Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that it was ""unfortunate, to put it mildly"" that Mr Salmond was associated with RT, and called on him to reconsider his position. Labour's Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said he will not be making any more appearances on RT, whose coverage he said ""goes beyond objective journalism"", and has urged other Labour MPs not to appear.

"Friends described Jodie Willsher as ""a truly lovely woman"" A man who stabbed to death his ex-partner's daughter at an Aldi supermarket has been jailed for at least 30 years. Neville Hord, 44, pleaded guilty to murdering 30-year-old mother-of-one Jodie Willsher in Skipton, North Yorkshire, four days before Christmas. Bradford Crown Court heard it was a ""cold-blooded public execution"" carried out ""for the purpose of revenge"". The judge told Hord it was highly probable he would never be released. Prosecutor Peter Moulson, QC, told the court Hord, who was the ex-partner of Mrs Willsher's mother, Nicole Dinsdale, stabbed the Aldi employee several times before he was restrained. Read more on this and other Yorkshire stories Mrs Willsher died from wounds to her chest and abdomen inflicted during the attack - which was witnessed by horrified Christmas shoppers, including a child. After his arrest, Hord told police the attack was planned and he had also armed himself with an axe. Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC told Hord he was ""truly and horribly rotten to the core"". He added: ""You chose a time and a place to, in effect, execute, to kill, to murder."" The attack by Neville Hord was filmed on CCTV Mr Moulson said Hord, of Great Horton Road, Bradford, told police Mrs Willsher had ""made things very difficult"" in his relationship with her mother. He said the defendant admitted putting a tracking device on Mrs Willsher's car and planned the killing for two weeks - buying a pistol crossbow as an ""option weapon"" and taking the axe as ""back-up"". Hord admitted he went to the store to kill Mrs Willsher and told officers he thought she had smiled at him before he stabbed her. The court heard how a previous partner confirmed Hord threatened to kill her and her young son if she left him. She said he told her: ""I'll chop the pair of you up and bury you on the moors."" Police found the cross-bow in Hord's vehicle in the Aldi car park along with 50 bolts, a large amount of diesel and cable ties. Sentencing Hord, Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC said: ""You are a monster, Mr Hord."" Jodie Willsher's husband Malcolm paid tribute to a ""doting mother and loving wife"" In a statement read in court, Mrs Willsher's husband Malcolm said his life and that of his daughter, Megan, had been ripped apart. He said: ""I have to explain it to Megan who then says to me 'I hate you daddy for not bringing mummy back. You're not trying hard enough'. ""She then says 'daddy, can't I have a brother or sister any more' or 'won't mummy ever be a granny now?'. ""How do you deal with that?"" He said his wife and daughter had an ""unbreakable bond"" and described how Megan had been excited about them opening Christmas presents together. He said the family had planned to leave on a dream trip to Disneyland on Boxing Day - five days after his wife was murdered. Mr Willsher added: ""I'm so scared he'll get out and do something to Megan."" Det Ch Insp Mark Pearson, of the Cleveland and North Yorkshire major investigation team, said: ""Neville Hord planned and carried out a horrific attack on Jodie Willsher while she was working in a busy supermarket in the run-up to Christmas. ""His terrible actions have devastated a family, leaving a mother without a daughter, a husband without a wife and a young girl without her mother. ""No sentence could ever compensate for their loss.""

"This video can not be played Williamson: Russia 'should go away and shut up' UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson urged Russia to ""go away"" and ""shut up"" as he unveiled plans for a new chemical weapons ""defence centre"". He made the comments as he announced a Â£48m investment in a facility that will be located at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory in Porton Down. Scientists at the Wiltshire lab helped identify the nerve agent used to attack ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal. Russia said his comments demonstrated his ""intellectual impotence"". In a speech on Thursday, Mr Williamson said the ""shocking and reckless"" attack on Mr Skripal and his daughter illustrated the increasing dangers the UK faced from chemical weapons. Mr Williamson said there was ""no doubt the attack came from Russia"". The UK is expelling 23 Russian diplomats and taking a range of other measures in response to what it said was the Russian state's culpability for the use of a military grade nerve agent on the duo in Salisbury. White House backs UK decision to expel diplomats UK to expel 23 Russian diplomats What are Novichok nerve agents? Moscow has hit out at what it described as the UK's unacceptable provocations and threatened reprisals. It has denied involvement. In questions after the speech Mr Williamson was asked what further measures the UK would take if Russia expelled British diplomats. He said: ""We will look at how Russia responds to what we've done. ""It's absolutely atrocious and outrageous what Russia did in Salisbury - we've responded to that. Frankly, Russia should go away - it should shut up. ""But if they do respond to the action we have taken, we'll consider it carefully and we'll look at our options. But it would be wrong to prejudge their response."" This video can not be played A look around Porton Down, Britain's military research base in to chemical and biological attacks Asked if the situation could lead to a new Cold War, Mr Williamson said that it had been described as a ""cool war"", adding: ""Let's face it, relations aren't good, are they?"" Mr Williamson said the UK leads the world in research into chemical, biological and radiological warfare but said this expertise needed to be developed further to confront potential hostile activity by states and individuals. ""We know the chemical threat doesn't just come from Russia but from others,"" he said. ""I can announce we will be strengthening this capability by investing Â£48m in a new Chemical Weapons Defence Centre to ensure we maintain our cutting edge in chemical analysis and defence."" But Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov criticised Mr Williamson's ""boorish statement"" as showing an ""extreme level of intellectual impotence"". ""All of this not only confirms the fact that London's accusations against Russia, which we have heard over the previous few years amount to nothing, but also the complete insignificance of the accusers themselves."" He added: ""Russia long ago developed a strong immunity to London's fake accusations towards Russia."" This video can not be played Williamson: ""Russia ripping up international rulebook"" On his visit to Porton Down, Mr Williamson also announced that, as a precaution, thousands of British troops would be offered vaccinations against anthrax, a spore-producing bacterial disease used in a series of bio-terror attacks in the US in 2001. British troops who are held at high-readiness will be offered the vaccine on a voluntary basis so they are ready to deploy to areas where the risk of this type of attack exists. Mr Williamson, who took over the role in November, is currently reviewing Britain's defences amid calls from Conservative MPs for a moratorium on cuts to the armed forces and defence capability. The BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said Mr Williamson was making clear that Britain must invest more in defence to counter both conventional and emerging threats like cyber warfare. ""As Brexit beckons, the eyes of the world are on us. Rest assured our adversaries will be watching even more closely than our allies,"" Mr Williamson said. ""This is our moment to retain our competitive advantage.""

"Unilever owns a host of well-known brands Unilever, the consumer goods giant that makes Marmite and Dove soap, has chosen Rotterdam over London for its headquarters. The Anglo-Dutch firm said it would now be one legal entity in the Netherlands in a bid to become ""more agile"". Unilever's dual-headed structure has existed since 1930, when Dutch margarine firm Unie merged with British soap maker Lever Brothers. The company said the decision over its HQ was ""not about Brexit"". Simon Jack: Why Unilever is leaving UK At the same time, Unilever -  which also makes Pot Noodle and Ben & Jerry's ice cream - said it would be reorganising its business into three divisions: beauty and personal care, home care, and foods and refreshment. The Beauty and personal care and home care divisions will be headquartered in London, while foods and refreshment will continue to be based in Rotterdam. Unilever chief executive Paul Polman told the BBC the leaders of the first two divisions were being brought to the UK from the US and Singapore, ""and related to that, there will be transfers of jobs as well"". This video can not be played Unilever boss Paul Polman said moving its HQ is not about Brexit The company employs 7,300 people in the UK and 3,100 in the Netherlands. No jobs will be lost by the move. Unilever is one of the largest companies in the UK's FTSE 100 share index, but is not expected to remain in the blue-chip index after the move. However, its shares will continue to be listed in London as well as Amsterdam and New York. A government spokesperson said: ""Unilever has today shown its long-term commitment to the UK by choosing to locate its two fastest-growing global business divisions in this country. ""As the company itself has made clear, its decision to transfer a small number of jobs to a corporate HQ in the Netherlands is part of a long-term restructuring of the company and is not connected to the UK's departure from the EU."" Mr Polman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the move to a single legal entity was being made for ""technical reasons"", as the bulk of its shares - 55% - were traded in the Netherlands. ""This is not about Brexit,"" he said, adding that ""both countries are attractive from an investment point of view"". However, anti-Brexit campaigners described the move as a ""major blow"" to the UK government as it prepares for next year's exit from the European Union. The chief executive of the Best for Britain group, Eloise Todd, said it showed ""what business really feels"" about the UK's departure from the EU. She added: ""The government are saying to anyone who will listen this is not to do with Brexit, but anyone with any sense knows it's a factor. ""The company has had an HQ in the UK for over 90 years, and all that history and legacy has gone down the plughole."" Unilever announced a review of its dual-headed structure last year, after it foiled a $143bn takeover offer from Kraft Heinz. The company has had talks with the governments of both countries in the run-up to its decision. According to reports, Mr Polman lobbied the UK government for changes in UK takeover rules, while the government expressed concerns over Unilever's decision to pick Rotterdam for its HQ. Unilever's Rotterdam base will become the group's HQ Speculation that it would choose the Netherlands has increased in recent months, following the proposal of a tax change by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, himself a Unilever veteran, seen as benefiting Anglo-Dutch multinationals. Since 1930, Unilever has operated with two parent companies - a British PLC headquartered in London and a Dutch NV based in Rotterdam. Although run as one company, the distinct legal entities have different shareholders, separate stock listings and annual meetings and are subject to different laws and corporate governance requirements.

"Airbus has warned it would be ""practically impossible"" to give new business to engineering giant GKN if it was bought by turnaround specialist Melrose. GKN makes wing components and other key aircraft parts for Airbus, which is its biggest customer. However, it is fighting off a hostile bid from Melrose, saying it fundamentally undervalues the firm. GKN employs more than 59,000 people, with 6,000 in the UK. Tom Williams, Airbus's chief operating officer at its commercial aircraft division, said: ""The nature of our industry is one that requires a commitment to long-term investment and strategic vision. ""The industry does not lend itself to shorter term financial investment which naturally reduces R&D budgets and limits vital innovation. ""It would be practically impossible for us to give any new work to GKN under such ownership model when we don't know who will be the long-term investor."" His comments werefirst reported by the Financial Times,external. Earlier this week, GKN rejected what Melrose called its ""final"" offer. Melrose said the bid valued the company at Â£8.1bn. GKN chairman Mike Turner said: ""The comments from Airbus that stress the need for long-term investment and strategic vision in our industry emphasise our firmly held belief that Melrose is not an appropriate owner of GKN. ""Its management lacks the relevant experience and its short-term business model is inappropriate for GKN's customers and investors."" Christopher Miller, chairman of Melrose, said his company ""invests in its businesses for the long term"". He added: ""Under Melrose, shareholders and customers will be able to enjoy a considered and longer-term process of value creation, investment and business enhancement, which is clearly not an option under continued GKN ownership."" The intervention by Airbus, GKN's biggest customer, is as dramatic as it is unusual. The takeover bid by the turnaround specialists Melrose is described as hostile, because it was not sought by GKN's management. But it is Melrose that is experiencing hostility on several fronts. The board of GKN, MPs, pension fund trustees and now a key customer have all very publicly questioned Melrose's attempt to buy one of Britain's oldest engineering giants. Airbus's decision to wade in raises new concerns for GKN shareholders. They have two weeks to decide whether to back the bid or send Melrose packing. The share price of GKN suggests this is far from a done deal. GKN also makes parts for Boeing 737 jets and Black Hawk helicopters, as well as parts for Volkswagen and Ford cars. Under the terms of the Melrose bid, GKN investors would receive 81p in cash and 1.69 new Melrose shares for GKN share they held. GKN shareholders would end up owning 60% of Melrose. However, GKN says a fall in the Melrose share price has reduced the value of the cash and shares offer. GKN has fought hard against the bid, offering to give back Â£2.5bn to shareholders andagreeing to merge its car unit with US company Dana. The takeover approach has raised fears among unions and MPs that GKN, one of the UK's largest industrial firms, will be broken up and sold to overseas owners. The Pensions Regulator has warned that the Melrose takeover could affect the company's ability to fund its pension scheme. Last week,a cross-party group of MPs wrote to the Business Secretary, Greg Clark, saying the Melrose takeover should be blocked.

"The automotive industry says a Â£220m clear air fund is already in operation MPs have demanded an end to the UK's ""poisonous air"" in an unprecedented report from four Commons committees. The Environment, Health, Transport and Environmental Audit committees want a new Clean Air Act, and a clean air fund financed by the motor industry. They are also demanding a faster phase-out of petrol and diesel cars - currently set for 2040. The government said air pollution had improved significantly since 2010 but there was ""more to do"". MPs have been frustrated by the response from ministers, who have promised to publish a comprehensive clean air strategy later this year. Their report says: ""Air pollution is a national health emergency resulting in an estimated 40,000 early deaths each year, costing the UK Â£20bn annually. ""It is unacceptable that successive governments have failed to protect the public from poisonous air. UK air pollutants continue decline Government loses clean air court case Reality Check: Are diesel cars always the most harmful? ""Despite a series of court cases, the government has still not produced a plan that adequately addresses the scale of the challenge. Nor has it demonstrated the national leadership needed."" The report - the first time that four committees are thought to have collaborated - urges the Treasury to take greater account of the costs of air pollution when setting tax and spend policy, after tax changes by the former Chancellor George Osborne left a Porsche driver paying the same tax as the owner of a low-pollution Prius. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders told BBC News that a clear air fund worth Â£220m had already been set up by government, paid for by changes to vehicle taxation. ""In addition, vehicle manufacturers are funding scrappage schemes to get the older vehicles off the road,""  Mike Hawes said. ""Other sectors must also play their part in improving air quality."" The government has called for evidence on pollution from other sources such as wood stoves, coal fires and smokeless fuel. It is also looking at the use of cheap agricultural red diesel in food delivery vans. But Greenpeace said the car industry could not continue to be allowed to ""shake off its responsibility"" for the pollution crisis the UK was facing. ""The public was missold highly polluting diesel cars by manufacturers who knew road emissions were many times higher than in the lab,"" said its senior political adviser Rosie Rogers. ""It's high time manufacturers felt the heat, and contributing to a clean air fund is a good start."" Consumer products 'affecting air quality' London's January air 'best in 10 years' Scrutiny over wood and coal fires The government's long-term target of abolishing cars driven only by petrol and diesel by 2040 is regarded by environment groups as a red herring. They point out that India has made the same pledge - but for 2030. It is most unlikely, they say, that manufacturers will still be making UK cars deemed unfit to drive on India's roads after 2030. The chair of the Environment select committee, Neil Parish, told the BBC government should work with councils to tackle pollution hotspots where Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels are breached, some of which are very small. Coal fires are among the sources of domestic emissions being investigated by government scientists ""This really has to be stamped out and that's why the whole committee talked about bringing government and local authorities together so we can work across not just here in London but the whole country,"" he said. That was welcomed by Councillor Martin Tett, from the Local Government Association, who said MPs were right to ""recognise the unique position of councils to understand air quality in their area, which is why they need the flexibility to deliver their own plans"". The current explosion of concern over air pollution has been fuelled by the diesel car scandal and the government's defeat in the courts over EU regulations governing Nitrogen Oxide (NOX) emissions. But World Health Organisation air quality guidelines are already tougher than those set by the EU. And recent reports have drawn a possible link between attention deficit disorder, dementia and air pollution - at levels currently considered acceptable. The government is being urged to address these concerns in its clean air strategy later in the year. A government spokesman said: ""Air pollution has improved significantly since 2010, but we recognise there is more to do. We will carefully consider the joint committee's report, and respond in due course.""

"David Davis said he can ""live with"" a transition period of under two years if that helps to secure an early deal. The Brexit secretary said the EU and UK will establish a joint committee during the transition period to guarantee a ""duty of good faith"" by both sides. He said that outlines of the transition phase would reassure Brexit supporters. Mr Davis will travel to Brussels on Sunday for a meeting on Monday with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Prime Minister Theresa May has called for an implementation period of ""around two years"" after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March next year. Juncker: UK will 'regret' Brexit We don't want wall with UK - Tusk All you need to know about Brexit In an interview with BBC Newsnight, Mr Davis said he was prepared to accept the EU demand that the transition should come to end earlier - in December 2020 - to ensure the transition is concluded at the same time as the EU's seven-year budget cycle. The Brexit secretary said his main priority was to secure agreement on the implementation period at next week's EU summit in Brussels. He told Newsnight: ""That is more important to me than a few months either way. So I'm not bothered too much about the question of whether it is Christmas 2020 or Easter 2021."" David Davis will meet Michel Barnier on Monday Asked whether he could live with the transition ending in December 2020, he said: ""I would live with that. We are still in the middle of a negotiation. Frankly what I would not do is delay the decision [on an implementation period] in order to get a month or two more."" Mr Davis said that the UK's decision to accept the EU's transition timetable will be balanced by the establishment of a new joint committee to ensure both sides observer a ""duty of good faith"" during the transition. He downplayed concerns, voiced by the prominent Tory Brexit supporter Jacob Rees-Mogg, that the UK would be a ""vassal state"" during the transition. He said most EU laws take two years to pass - three months longer than the proposed transition timetable. Mr Davis said: ""It is not going to be a big material issue. But we want to have in place, and we will have in place, is a joint committee which will oversee any issues like this that come up and a duty of good faith, good faith on both sides so neither side is disadvantaged. So we won't fall into Mr Rees-Mogg's interesting definition of our position."" Brexit in 300 words Have voters changed their minds? May urges EU to embrace 'ambitious' Brexit The Brexit secretary was interviewed by Newsnight during a day in which he travelled to Copenhagen and Prague to shore up support for the UK in the Brexit negotiations. Britain believes that the remaining 27 member states, who have been united behind Brussels in the first phase of negotiations, may have their own concerns which could be helpful to the UK in the final phase of negotiations. Mr Davis, who has been criticised by the European Commission for visiting EU capitals rather than negotiating in person in Brussels, announced he would meet Michel Barnier in Brussels on Monday. He said: ""On all of these [strands in the negotiations] we started discussions with the Commission in Downing Street about four weeks or so ago.  Since then a team, my team, have been working flat out. Principally in Brussels, and that will continue through this weekend, and I shall join them on Sunday and we'll have another meeting with Michel on Monday.""

Theresa May's spokesman said: ""The consultation's call for evidence was simply intended to help the government better understand the role of cash and digital payments.

"About 300,000 new places will be needed at universities over the next 12 years, experts predict, making the higher education funding model unsustainable. A rise in the number of 18-year-olds by 2030 will push demand up by 50,000, the Higher Education Policy Institute says. A further 350,000 places will be needed to keep pace with the existing growing participation rate, it adds, but other factors may reduce that by 50,000. The government has set up a review of university fees and funding. Last year, 534,000 students were accepted on to the hundreds of mainly three-year degree courses on offer in England. The Hepi report examines the impact of policy changes on university entrant rates, feeding a number of scenarios into the calculations to arrive at the 300,000 figure. The 18-year-old population has been declining steadily for a number of years, but from 2020 it will increase again, rising by nearly 23% by 2030, says Hepi. It estimates there will be 14,709 additional entrants arising from demography alone, which will amount to about 50,000 additional students by 2030. And if participation continues to increase at the current rate, about 350,000 extra places will be needed on top. Countervailing factors such as Brexit, are likely to reduce that total by about 50,000, the research says. Currently, more women than men go to university. And if males were to increase their rates of participation, the research says, 500,000 extra places would be needed in total by 2030. It notes that there is not much sign of a change ahead in this area but cautions that the higher education system would come under great pressure and require a comprehensive reassessment if there was. Bahram Bekhradnia, one of the authors and Hepi president, said as nearly every new student required a government-subsidised loan, ""it is difficult to see - under the current finance model - how the policy of uncapped student recruitment can continue"". ""This is particularly pertinent given the constraints on public expenditure and the absence of any suggestion from the Treasury that more money will be available for higher education in the future,"" he added. The report says the policy consequences of this very likely large increase in demand need to be considered. ""Given the extent of the loan subsidy provided for student loans... the higher education budget will need to be significantly increased in order to meet the financial consequences,"" it says. They suggest a cap on student numbers may have to be reintroduced. A DfE spokesperson said: there were more people going to university than ever before - including record numbers of 18-year olds from disadvantaged backgrounds entering full-time. ""We want anyone with the talent and potential to have the opportunity to go to university, which is why we lifted the cap on student numbers and reduced barriers that people face. ""We are conducting a major review of post-18 education to ensure that the system provides genuine choice for young people, and students and taxpayers are getting value for money.""

"The estate of To Kill a Mockingbird author Harper Lee is suing the producers of a much-anticipated Broadway adaptation of the US novel. The estate argues that the play's script differs too much from the book about race relations in the Deep South. Play producer Scott Rudin denies this, saying his team - not the estate - has the final say over the script. Harper Lee's novel was written in 1960. It remains a towering presence in American literature. It won the Pulitzer Prize in literature in 1961. This video can not be played Harper Lee wrote her iconic novel To Kill A Mockingbird in 1960 Harper Lee died in 2016 at the age of 89. Obituary: Harper Lee Why is To Kill a Mockingbird so popular?,external The lawsuit was filed after estate representative Tonja B. Carter read the script of the play written by Aaron Sorkin. The estate says that some characters are altered. This includes protagonist Atticus Finch, the lawyer who defends a black man falsely accused of rape. The main character, the lawsuit argues, is portrayed as initially being naive to racism. It also alleges that the script does not present a fair depiction of small-town Alabama in the 1930s. Scott Rudin's representatives say that it is up to the producers to judge whether the adaptation is faithful to the novel. ""I can't and won't present a play that feels like it was written in the year the book was written in terms of its racial politics: it wouldn't be of interest,""Mr Rudin was quoted as saying by the New York Times, who first reported on the lawsuit,external. ""The world has changed since then,"" Mr Rudin added. The Broadway play is expected to open in December. In the small fictional town of Maycomb in the depression-ravaged American South, a black man named Tom Robinson is falsely accused of raping a white woman. A lawyer named Atticus Finch defends Robinson in court. The frenzy stirred up by the case and her father's quest for justice are seen through the eyes of Finch's six-year-old daughter Scout. 5,000 copies in initial print run $20,000 value of a signed first-edition copy Over 40mglobal sales 40languages into which it has been translated 8Oscar nominations for 1962 film version 3Oscar wins The book explores issues of race, class and the loss of innocence.

"Unilever owns a host of well-known brands Unilever, the consumer goods giant that makes Marmite and Dove soap, has chosen Rotterdam over London for its headquarters. The Anglo-Dutch firm said it would now be one legal entity in the Netherlands in a bid to become ""more agile"". Unilever's dual-headed structure has existed since 1930, when Dutch margarine firm Unie merged with British soap maker Lever Brothers. The company said the decision over its HQ was ""not about Brexit"". Simon Jack: Why Unilever is leaving UK At the same time, Unilever -  which also makes Pot Noodle and Ben & Jerry's ice cream - said it would be reorganising its business into three divisions: beauty and personal care, home care, and foods and refreshment. The Beauty and personal care and home care divisions will be headquartered in London, while foods and refreshment will continue to be based in Rotterdam. Unilever chief executive Paul Polman told the BBC the leaders of the first two divisions were being brought to the UK from the US and Singapore, ""and related to that, there will be transfers of jobs as well"". This video can not be played Unilever boss Paul Polman said moving its HQ is not about Brexit The company employs 7,300 people in the UK and 3,100 in the Netherlands. No jobs will be lost by the move. Unilever is one of the largest companies in the UK's FTSE 100 share index, but is not expected to remain in the blue-chip index after the move. However, its shares will continue to be listed in London as well as Amsterdam and New York. A government spokesperson said: ""Unilever has today shown its long-term commitment to the UK by choosing to locate its two fastest-growing global business divisions in this country. ""As the company itself has made clear, its decision to transfer a small number of jobs to a corporate HQ in the Netherlands is part of a long-term restructuring of the company and is not connected to the UK's departure from the EU."" Mr Polman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the move to a single legal entity was being made for ""technical reasons"", as the bulk of its shares - 55% - were traded in the Netherlands. ""This is not about Brexit,"" he said, adding that ""both countries are attractive from an investment point of view"". However, anti-Brexit campaigners described the move as a ""major blow"" to the UK government as it prepares for next year's exit from the European Union. The chief executive of the Best for Britain group, Eloise Todd, said it showed ""what business really feels"" about the UK's departure from the EU. She added: ""The government are saying to anyone who will listen this is not to do with Brexit, but anyone with any sense knows it's a factor. ""The company has had an HQ in the UK for over 90 years, and all that history and legacy has gone down the plughole."" Unilever announced a review of its dual-headed structure last year, after it foiled a $143bn takeover offer from Kraft Heinz. The company has had talks with the governments of both countries in the run-up to its decision. According to reports, Mr Polman lobbied the UK government for changes in UK takeover rules, while the government expressed concerns over Unilever's decision to pick Rotterdam for its HQ. Unilever's Rotterdam base will become the group's HQ Speculation that it would choose the Netherlands has increased in recent months, following the proposal of a tax change by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, himself a Unilever veteran, seen as benefiting Anglo-Dutch multinationals. Since 1930, Unilever has operated with two parent companies - a British PLC headquartered in London and a Dutch NV based in Rotterdam. Although run as one company, the distinct legal entities have different shareholders, separate stock listings and annual meetings and are subject to different laws and corporate governance requirements.

"The ad first appeared in October 2016 Actor Pierce Brosnan has told Indian authorities that he was ""cheated"" by a mouth freshener company that had employed him to promote its brand. He had been asked to explain why he was in an ad for Pan Bahar which is linked with an addictive form of tobacco. Brosnan said the company, Ashok & Co, did not disclose the hazardous nature of the product, a senior official said. The firm has not reacted to the actor's statement, but told the BBC in 2016 there was no tobacco in the product. Indian law prohibits all advertisements of tobacco products. Delhi health official SK Arora said that in his written response to the government, Brosnan had also assured them that his association with the brand was over and agreed to help further efforts against similar campaigns in the future.

"This video can not be played The plastic particles lurking in your bottled water The World Health Organization is to launch a review into the potential risks of plastic in drinking water. It will assess the latest research into the spread and impact of so-called microplastics - particles that are small enough to be ingested. It comes after journalism organisationOrb Media,externalfound plastic particles in many major brands of bottled water. There is no evidence that microplastics can undermine human health but the WHO wants to assess the state of knowledge. Plastic particles found in bottled water Bruce Gordon, coordinator of the WHOâs global work on water and sanitation, told BBC News that the key question was whether a lifetime of eating or drinking particles of plastic could have an effect. ""When we think about the composition of the plastic, whether there might be toxins in it, to what extent they might carry harmful constituents, what actually the particles might do in the body â there's just not the research there to tell us. ""We normally have a 'safe' limit but to have a safe limit, to define that, we need to understand if these things are dangerous, and if they occur in water at concentrations that are dangerous."" 'Shame and anger' at plastic pollution Earth is becoming 'Planet Plastic' Plastic pollution in seven charts Mr Gordon said that he did not want to alarm anyone, and also emphasised that a far greater waterborne threat comes in countries where supplies can be contaminated with sewage. But he said he recognised that people hearing about the presence of microplastics in their drinking water would turn to the WHO for advice. ""The public are obviously going to be concerned about whether this is going to make them sick in the short term and the long term."" The WHO initiative is partly in response to a study that screened more than 250 bottles of water from 11 different brands bought in nine countries - the largest investigation of its kind. Read the full scientific report [PDF],external A dye is used that binds to pieces of plastic The tests were carried out at the State University of New York in Fredonia as part of a project involving original research and reporting by the US-based journalism organisation Orb Media. Using a dye called Nile Red, which binds to free floating pieces of plastic, the university's Prof Sherri Mason found an average of 10 plastic particles per litre of water, each larger than the size of a human hair. Smaller particles assumed to be plastic but not positively identified were found as well - an average of 314 per litre. After filtration, the larger particles - yellow marks - are easy to see Of all the bottles tested, 17 were found to have no particles at all while many had counts ranging into the hundreds or even thousands, with big differences within brands and even the same pack of bottles. We contacted the companies behind the brands and most responded, standing by the quality and safety of their products. A few questioned why the studyâs results were so much higher than their own internal research or pointed out that there are no regulations on microplastics or agreed methods for testing for them. The study comes on top of earlier investigations that have found microplastics in tap water, beer, sea salt and fish, and Prof Mason told me that researchers need to be able to answer the pressing question of whether microplastics can be harmful. ""What we do know is that some of these particles are big enough that, once ingested, they are probably excreted but along the way they can release chemicals that cause known human health impacts. ""Some of these particles are so incredibly small that they can actually make their way across the gastro-intestinal tract, across the lining and be carried throughout the body, and we donât know the implications of what that means on our various organs and tissues."" The UK's Food Standards Agency said it was unlikely that the levels of microplastic reported in the bottles of water could cause harm but it added that, ""it would assess any emerging information concerning microplastics in food and drink"". For Dr Stephanie Wright of the Kingâs College Centre for Environment and Health, the priority is to understand how much microplastic we are exposed to, and exactly what happens to it inside us. Researchers have established that tiny particles of titanium dioxide can pass through the lining of the gut so the same might be possible with plastic, raising the question of where it would then end up. Dr Wright told me: ""The particles could stay within an immune cell in the gut lining, or be passed into our lymphatic system ending up in the lymph nodes, or there is a small potential for them to enter the blood stream and possibly accumulate in the liver. ""These are foreign hard particles which our body will obviously want to get rid of but it canât because plastic is not degradable so that will cause harm to the local tissue. ""But at the moment we don't know."" I suggested to Michael Walker, a consultant to the Office of the UK Government Chemist and founder board member of the Food Standards Agency, that the jury was out on whether microplastics could cause harm. He replied: ""The scientific literature says that not only is the jury not yet out on this question but the jury has not yet been convened on it.""

"A strict macrobiotic diet tends to rely heavily on whole grains such as brown rice Police in Italy say they have broken up a ""psycho sect"" that enslaved members by forcing them to adhere to a strict macrobiotic diet and cut off contact with the outside world. Five people are under investigation over allegations including maltreatment and tax evasion. Among the suspects is a business mogul who is accused of manipulating followers of the diet he created. Mario Pianesi reportedly told them that Ma.Pi. would provide miracle cures. The investigation started in 2013 after a young woman left the sect and denounced its head to police. They found that as well as having to pay for the diet and give donations, members were coerced into working long hours with next to no pay.

"This video can not be played Theresa May announces the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats from the UK The UK will expel 23 Russian diplomats after Moscow refused to explain how a Russian-made nerve agent was used on a former spy in Salisbury, the PM says. Theresa May said the diplomats, who have a week to leave, were identified as ""undeclared intelligence officers"". The UK later told the UN Security Council that Russia had used ""a weapon so horrific that it is banned in war"" in a ""peaceful"" British city. Russia denies attempted murder and says it will respond appropriately. Mrs May also revoked an invitation to Russia's foreign minister, and said the Royal Family would not attend the Fifa World Cup in Russia later this year. Addressing the UN Security Council, Britain's deputy UN ambassador, Jonathan Allen, accused Russia of breaking its obligations under the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. What we know so far What are Novichok nerve agents? Corbyn aide queries proof of Russian guilt How is the UK retaliating against Russia? He said he had heard the threats from Russia but that the UK would not be deterred. ""We will stand by the values which are shared by the overwhelming majority of those in this council in this United Nations and we ask you today, to stand by us,"" he added. In response the Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, denied Moscow's involvement in the attack and demanded ""material proof"" from Britain to support its charge. He said: ""We were given an ultimatum and requested in 24 hours to admit that we committed a crime. In other words, confess. ""We do not speak the language of ultimatums.

Earlier, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would co-operate if it received a formal request for clarification from the UK under theChemical Weapons Convention,external, which sets a 10-day time limit for a response. Mrs May has welcomed support from allies including the US, Nato and the EU. ""This was not just an act of attempted murder in Salisbury - nor just an act against UK,"" she said. ""It is an affront to the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May announces measures to send a ""clear message"" to Russia over the use of a nerve agent in Salisbury The White House says it ""stands in solidarity"" with ""its closest ally"" the UK and supports its decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats. PM Theresa May saidthe diplomats would be expelledafter Moscow refused to explain how a Russian-made nerve agent was used on a former spy in the UK. US President Donald Trump's spokeswoman accused Russia of undermining the security of countries worldwide. Moscow denies responsibility andsays it will expel UK diplomats ""soon"". Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russian media the expulsions would ""definitely"" happen and reportedly referred to the UK's allegations as ""absolutely boorish"". Former spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, 33, remain critically ill in hospital after being found slumped on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 4 March. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the attack was Russia's ""way of saying to people this is what happens to people who stand up to our regime"". He said: ""Now is the moment for Putin to jam the lid down and send a signal to people: 'You do this, you're going to die.'"" What we know so far Griffith says Labour backs PM over Russia How is the UK retaliating against Russia? UK to build new chemical defence centre Alex Salmond: Russian station RT 'not propaganda' BBC North American editor Jon Sopel said the White House statement was notable in the unqualified support it offered Theresa May. President Trump's way of talking about Russia, using language that had not been heard from the White House before, was also significant, he said. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a ""critical but stable"" condition, Boris Johnson said In the statement, Mr Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders said the US wanted to ensure ""this kind of abhorrent attack does not happen again"" and called the UK's expulsion of Russian diplomats ""a just response"". ""This latest action by Russia fits into a pattern of behaviour in which Russia disregards the international rules-based order, undermines the sovereignty and security of countries worldwide, and attempts to subvert and discredit Western democratic institutions and processes,"" she said.

Russia retaliation could hurt UK business Kuenssberg: No easy choices for UK Boris Johnson: This is not another Cold War The chemical used in the attack on Mr Skripal and his daughter has been identified part of a group of nerve agents developed by Russia known as Novichok, Mrs May said. The PM said there was ""no alternative conclusion"" than to believe Russia was ""culpable"" for the poisonings. Mr Johnson told the BBC a sample of the nerve agent would be sent to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - the independent international body set up to stop chemical warfare - for analysis. But he added that Russia's ""smug, sarcastic"" response indicated their ""fundamental guilt"". This video can not be played The foreign secretary told Radio 4 Today the Russia tensions aren't a return to the Cold War Moscow wanted to ""simultaneously deny it and at the same time to glory in it"", he said, adding the nerve agent was chosen ""to show that it is Russia"". Mrs May spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday, after a French government spokesman said the time for decisions would come ""once the elements are proven"". Shortly afterwards, his office released a statement saying France agreed with the UK's claim that Russia was behind the attack. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has condemned the ""appalling attack"", has faced criticism - some from his own party - afterhis spokesman said there was not yet definitive proof the Russian state carried out the poisoning. Moscow had refused to meet the UK's Tuesday evening deadline to explain the use of the nerve agent, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov saying it would co-operate if the UK submitted a formal request under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which gives a 10-day time limit to respond. But when the UK's deadline passed, Mrs May announce the expulsion of 23 diplomats - the largest number it has expelled since 1985. They have been given one week to leave the country. Other measures include increased checks on private flights, customs and freight as well as a boycott of this year's Fifa World Cup in Russia by ministers and the Royal Family.

"The iReporter game can be used by pupils in lessons and complements English and citizenship UPDATE 7 November 2024: The BBC iReporter interactive game is no longer available. Other media literacy resources for schools and young people can be found on the BBC Teach website. Can you separate the fact from the fiction? The new interactive BBC iReporter game - aimed at youngsters aged 11 to 18 - gives you the chance to take on the role of a journalist in the BBC newsroom. It is a ""choose your own adventure"" game, created by Aardman Animations, which challenges you to make your own decisions on which sources, political claims, social media comments and pictures should be trusted as you contribute to the day's news output. See more from young journalists working with the BBC The game is part of a BBC initiative to help young people identify false storiesby giving students and teachers resourcesto use in classrooms across the UK. This video can not be played An introduction to different types of fake and false information The resources also look at the issues of trust. In an era when people get their information from a much wider range of sources, how do young people gain confidence in deciding what they should trust? Hints and tips on how to spot false information on social media and online are included, as well as lesson plans for teachers to use in school. This video can not be played A guide to help you decide which sources to trust and which not to The BBC has also teamed up with the Centre for Argument Technology at the University of Dundee to create the""Evidence Toolkit"",external- a programme aimed at 16-to-18-year-olds. It combines complex algorithms and archive material fromBBC Radio 4's Moral Maze,externalto help students identify the claims made and the reasoning in any news article and how the two are connected. This video can not be played If you want to be sure a story is right, check the evidence. Professor Chris Reed, director of the centre, said: ""Dissecting news articles to determine their anatomy and figure out how they're working is a delicate business. ""The Evidence Toolkit equips users with a set of razor-sharp tools to go about it."" John Lawrence, lead developer on the project, explained: ""The Toolkit employs state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques for argument mining. This is the first time AI has been unleashed on understanding the reasoning in news articles."" Amol Rajan is the BBC's media editor and was previously editor of the Independent newspaper. Let me tell you how I decide whether or not I can trust a news source. First of all, have they shown a commitment to accuracy over a long period of time? Have they consistently got things right? And the second thing - which is related - is: do they admit when they get things wrong? You know, if you put your hand up and say 'Sorry, I made an error, there were factual mistakes in the piece that we published', then people like me are much more likely to believe you when you say another time that you got things right. Numbers are often used to tell all sorts of stories too. They can help show the scale of a particular problem or issue, illustrating whether it's big or small. In this short animation you'll learn how just because a number looks big doesn't mean it really is and that a really small number might turn out to be much bigger than it first appears.

"This video can not be played How much homework is too much? How much homework is too much homework? It's a big question for pupils, teachers and parents alike. Reality Check went to Sutton Community Academy in Nottinghamshire to try to find some answers, working with a group of School Reporters from Years 7 to 9. First of all, they interviewed each other to get some basic research. So does homework help pupils academically? ""Yes,"" says Lauren, ""because if you know what you're doing for your homework, then you'll know what to do in the next lesson."" But is there too much of it? ""Yes sometimes,"" says Ryan. ""In subjects like art, I think the homework we get won't be that useful in the future."" But what do the experts say? It is quite a mixed picture. A bigreport for the Department for Education,external, published in 2014, concluded that students in Year 9 who spent between two and three hours on homework on an average week night were almost 10 times more likely to achieve five good GCSEs (A*-C) than students who did no homework at all. But where does the limit lie? When does too much homework become too stressful, and therefore counter-productive? It's something students at Sutton Community Academy think about a lot. ""If you get too much and you have to get it done really quickly but you've still got to do stuff around the house, it can be really stressful,"" says Porsche. ""It can be difficult, but it's also helping you."" ""We get told a lot that we need to know our maths and we need to know our English because it could help us get jobs,"" says Samara. ""Sometimes it is quite easy, but then if it's new homework, sometimes we do struggle."" Until 2012 schools in England were given formal advice on how much homework should be set, but schools now have more flexibility to design systems to suit their own students. International comparisons confirm that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to educational success. Analysis by the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) suggests pupils in China are given the largest amount of homework, and they are among the highest achievers academically. But while Italy also sets a relatively large amount of homework, its results - according to Pisa - don't reflect the extra hours put in. In Finland, meanwhile, there is far less emphasis on testing and homework than in schools in the UK. And the Finns have one of the most successful education systems in the world. Other factors beyond the way a national education system is set up have to be taken into account. Every pupil is different, and works in different ways. Schools are of different standards. And of course the stability of home life plays a huge role in performance in general and in the ability of any pupil to complete their homework. Our conclusion at the Sutton Community Academy? Homework is important, it does make a difference, but there comes a point where handing out more and more won't deliver better results. In other words, the work-life balance that worries so many parents is a big factor for pupils in schools too.

"This video can not be played Meghan Wright from Edinburgh says trial shifts took advantage of her Some MPs and lawyers have called for a blanket ban on unpaid shift work. Companies can currently invite prospective employees to do trial shifts with the carrot of a job at the end. But there has been a six-fold increase over three years in complaints over unpaid shifts, trade union Unite said. The Federation of Small Businesses said unpaid shifts are a valuable part of the recruitment process, but shouldn't cross the line into exploitation. On Fridaya private members bill,externalwhich seeks to make unpaid trials illegal will get its second parliamentary reading. Meghan Wright's first experience of an unpaid shift was with Nando's in 2014. ""They told me it was six hours, and I'd get a meal at the end. ""I assumed I'd be observed and trained but I was meeting and greeting guests, taking orders and clearing tables.  I was basically working as a staff member."" She had a similar experience working at a supermarket crÃ¨che. ""When it came to the full-time staff's lunch break they asked me to stay to cover it. The worst thing about that was that I never heard back from them - even though they promised I'd be offered the job."" Nando's told us: ""We do invite potential team members to shadow a member of the team during a four hour trial shift. Whilst these trials are unpaid we will always offer a meal and feedback."" Unite says that too often, ""shadow shifts"" are crossing over to labour and exploitation. They claim they've gone from receiving around three complaints a week, to up to twenty. Stewart McDonald, the SNP MP for Glasgow South who tabled the private members bill, says current legislation - which bans ""excessively long"" trial shifts - is not working. ""People are being asked to try out for jobs that don't exist. ""Companies are just trying to cover staff absences in other parts of the business. ""This is about ending that exploitation and empowering applicants and making sure there is dignity throughout the process,"" Mr McDonald said. There is nothing illegal about asking a worker to do a voluntary trial shift. Smaller businesses in particular rely on them as part of the recruitment process. Colin Borland from the FSB says small firms find trial shifts useful Colin Borland from the Federation of Small Businesses said: ""Small businesses can sometimes be reticent about hiring or even looking to expand headcount when the work is there because they are worried about making the wrong decision. ""The more that we can do to make sure that they hire the right people the better. You just have to be very careful that it doesn't cross into what's exploitative."" Is it always possible to identify when the line has been crossed? Unpaid work is in theory voluntary, and so some argue that legally negotiating payment is a grey area. Lois Madden, an employment solicitor in Edinburgh, doesn't agree. ""There is nothing grey about this. It's illegal to ask someone to come in, to give up their time, to provide services, to provide revenue, and not pay them at least the minimum wage, or the national living wage if they are over 25,"" she says. The legal advice for prospective employees is to outline the terms of the trial shift before it begins, and question anything over a few hours. But Meghan and many others say in reality that can be tricky; it can feel as though you're jeopardising your chances if you challenge your potential employer. ""As long as everyone's doing it, nobody wants to be the first to stick their neck out,"" Ms Wright says. ""There are more people than jobs, and if someone says you have to do a trial shift, you don't want to say no."" Which is why some MPs and lawyers say a blanket ban is the only way to robustly prevent exploitation.
