"More than 31,000 people are employed in the UK steel industry, and 4,000 work at Tata Steel's plant in Port Talbot, above US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from allies in Europe and North America are ""disappointing"" and ""absurd"", the UK trade secretary says. Liam Fox questioned the US decision to impose a25% tax on steel and a 10% tax on aluminiumfrom the EU, Mexico and Canada, from midnight, US time. UK Steel said the tariffs will damage not only the UK steel sector but also the US economy. The EU said it would retaliate with tariffs on products such as US bourbon. The tariffs apply to a wide range of steel and aluminium products such as sheets, plates, bars, pipes and ""semi-finished"" products. The new tariffs will make steel and aluminium from the UK more expensive in the US, which could lead to a decline in demand for it - potentially affecting thousands of jobs. It comes as the sector is still recovering from the 2016 steel crisis caused by oversupply and slack demand. US imposes metal tariffs on key allies Tata demands 'swift' action EU has 'gun held to head' on steel tariffs Bikes, bourbon and T-shirts on EU tax list According to UK Steel - the body which represents steel producers across the country -7% of steel exports go to the US, worth Â£360m.,external The organisation's director Gareth Stace said UK steel producers were ""going to be hit hard"". He admitted that there was a problem of global over-capacity in the industry, but he claimed most of that was in China. He said that about 20 million tonnes of Chinese steel would need to ""find a new home to go to"" because of the tariffs. ""Because we are a free and open market here in the UK/the EU, it'll come here, we believe, and therefore further damage our sector - not only from the direct impact of tariffs in the US but the surge of steel coming here,"" he added. US President Donald Trump justified the tariffs on national security grounds, arguing that global oversupply of steel and aluminium, driven by China, threatened American steel and aluminium producers. Mr Fox said: ""It's very disappointing that the United States has chosen to apply steel and aluminium tariffs... all in the name of national security. ""In the case of the United Kingdom, where we send steel to the United States that is vital for their businesses and their defence industry, it is patently absurd."" About 31,000 people across the UK work in steel production and many more in the supply chain. There are steel mills in the North East, East Midlands, Yorkshire, and Wales. Tata Steel, which employs 8,500 people across the UK,has called for ""swift and robust action"" in response to the steel tariffs. More than 7,000 Tata workers are employed in Wales, including about 4,000 in Port Talbot - the largest steelworks in the UK. UK exports of aluminium to the US are tiny, butin March the UK's Aluminium Federation said it was concerned about the impact 10% tariffs could have. President Giles Ashmead said: ""While the US is not a major export market for UK-produced aluminium, indiscriminate tariffs are a hindrance to free trade, and do little to secure a 'level playing field' for global commerce."" The EU has drawn up a target list of 100 US goods worth â¬2.8bn ($3.5bn, Â£2.5bn) for its retaliatory tariffs, the BBC understands. The list includes: Bourbon whiskey Florida orange juice Jeans Cosmetics It could lead to many every day items becoming more expensive for shoppers in the UK, as shops pass on increased import prices.

"The EU, Canada and Mexico have announced retaliatory measures against the US tariffs The US has slapped tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from its allies the EU, Canada and Mexico - but don't think they'll take it without a fight. All three have already announced retaliatory measures as the US follows its new policy, which has been attacked as ""protectionism, pure and simple"" by the EU. Ranging from serious to strange, these counter-tariffs could play a part in a growing trade battle. It's too early to say how consumers will be hit in all the affected countries, but prices could rise throughout the world in light of these tariffs. Read on to see which American products each US ally plans to target. What is a trade war and why should I worry? Trade tariffs: Real war or phoney war Prime Minister Justin Trudeau objected strongly to the announced tariffs, calling them an ""affront"" to their nations' military alliance. He said Canada buys half of US steel exports. This video can not be played Trudeau: Canada not US national security threat Canada plans ""trade-restrictive countermeasures"" on C$16.6bn ($12.8bn) of US goods, to come into effect on 1 July. The country will impose a 25% tariff on assorted US steel products, including railway tracks, piping and steel sheets. But Canada also plans a 10% tariff on more varied items: Yoghurt, soya sauce, strawberry jam, ""mixed condiments"", pizza and quiche Orange juice, whiskies, coffee, soups and waters Manicure and pedicure products, hair lacquers, shaving foam, toilet paper and dishwasher detergents Playing cards, felt-tipped pens, inflatable boats, lawnmowers and sleeping bags The list,published by the Department of Finance,external, also includes a 10% tariff on candles - although, relax Canadians, ""not including those for birthdays, Christmas or other festive occasions"". Senior Canadian officials say the list is designed to exert political pressure on the US and make it take notice of how this will affect trade. Asked by reporters if he was ready to start a trade war with its southern neighbour, Mr Trudeau said Canada was ""ready for anything"". Canada is targeting a variety of US foods - including pizza European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he planned to take the US to the World Trade Organization over the American tariffs, a policy he called ""totally unacceptable"". Meanwhile, EU Trade CommissionerCecilia Malmstrom called the US measures a ""dangerous game""and said the EU would not ""stay silent"". The bloc releaseda list of tariffs,externalin March - 10 pages of US goods it plans to target: Bourbon whiskey, orange juice and cranberries Jeans, T-shirts and tobacco Corn and other agricultural products Steel and industrial products Cosmetics, consumer goods, motorbikes and pleasure boats Snuff and chewing tobacco The EU plans to target iconic US goods, like Levi's jeans The aim is to have the maximum political effect. Kentucky, home to bourbon whiskey, is Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell's state. Orange juice, meanwhile, is a major export of Florida - a key US swing state. France's junior trade minister Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne said he expects EU counter-measures to be completed by mid-June. America's southern neighbour also swiftly released a list of products on which it would impose tariffs, ""up to an amount comparable to the level of damage"" of US tariffs. Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said in a radio interview that the measures would target US products from districts that would cause political difficulties for Mr Trump. He said levies would be placed on the following:,external Flat steel, hot and cold foil products, and piping Cold cuts, pork chops and sausages Berries, grapes, apples and ""various cheeses"" Lamps Mexico Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo attacked the US tariffs Mr Guajardo said Mexico was the top buyer of US aluminium and the second-biggest buyer of US steel, and that ""this kind of thing does not benefit anybody"". US tariffs could hit $4bn worth of trade between the two countries. In 2009, Mexico imposed higher tariffs on dozens of US products such as apples, frozen potatoes and Christmas trees in a dispute over the access of Mexican trucks to US highways. The two nations agreed a deal in 2011 allowing their trucks to use each other's roads.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump's US trade tariffs worry first minister Tata Steel has urged the EU to take ""swift and robust action"" in response to a US decision to impose a 25% tariff on European steel. The US said the tariffs on imports from the EU, Mexico and Canadawould start at midnight. This will impact directly on Port Talbot as about 10% of Tata Steel Europe's exports go to the US. Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones called it ""short-sighted"" with wide-ranging implications for business. Liberty Steel's Welsh plants including Newport will not be affected, but it could hit parts of its UK operations. Almost 7,000 workers are employed by Tata in Wales, including about 4,000 in Port Talbot. The US announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminium immediately triggered vows of retaliation from Mexico and the EU, which called the tariffs ""protectionism, pure and simple"". The Community union called on trade unions across the world to stand together to oppose the measures. Criticism of Trump trade tariffs intensifies UK labels US metal tariffs 'absurd' Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Henrik Adam, chief commercial officer of Tata Steel in Europe, said: ""We have been, and will continue, to work closely with our customers on potential product exclusions as the vast majority of the products Tata Steel Europe exports to the US cannot be made by US steel companies, such as our extra wide strip, battery quality hot rolled material as well as certain packaging steels. ""We now call on the EU Commission to take swift and robust action to combat the indirect effects of these tariffs. ""We must ensure our markets are not destabilised by millions of tonnes of steel being diverted away from the US and into Europe. ""The European Commission now needs to put in place protection measures on a provisional basis without delay."" Tony Brady, Unite national officer, described the measures as blunt and short-sighted while Labour MP for Aberavon, Stephen Kinnock, said it was a ""major setback for the British steel industry"". Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, the steelworkers' union, said: ""The problems of steel dumping will not be solved by unfair tariffs and steelworkers in the UK and USA must not fall into the trap of believing rhetoric from the likes of Donald Trump."" The George Bush administration introduced steel tariffs in 2002 which lasted for 20 months. Why is Port Talbot steelworks important? Blood, sweat and steel: Life in and out of the steel works Carwyn Jones criticises Donald Trump's US steel tariff UK to seek exemption from US steel tariffs It prompted threats of retaliation from the European Union on US products before the policy was abandoned. This video can not be played Stephen Davies has worked at Port Talbot steel works for 39 years Mr Jones, who is in Washington meeting business leaders and politicians, said: ""I want to see fewer obstacles to trade, more cooperation, more internationalism, to help our economies continue to grow. ""It is, therefore, extremely disappointing that the US is pressing ahead with tariffs on EU steel and aluminium imports. ""It could also harm the Welsh steel industry, which we have fought so hard to protect."" A UK government spokeswoman said Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns had spoken to Mr Jones to give reassurances Whitehall was fully committed to reaching a successful resolution.

"Jeremy Corbyn has reminded all of his MPs not to employ unpaid interns after Chuka Umunna advertised for a student to work for free in his London office. The Streatham MP insisted he was not seeking an unpaid intern - but someone on a ""sandwich"" degree course who would be supported by student finance. But he still came under fire on social media from angry students. The Labour leader's office then sent a reminder to Labour MPs of the party's commitment to ban unpaid internships. Government targets unpaid internships Unpaid internships 'lock some out of careers' Mr Umunna, who has criticised Mr Corbyn in the past and who is opposed to the party's policy on Brexit, has campaigned for fairer wages for the low paid. The ad, for a year in industry student placement, which was circulated to students at Leeds University, listed duties such as ""administrative support"", organising ""a wide variety of policy issues and constituent enquiries"" and ""EU campaign work"". It said the placement was unpaid but the cost of a student travel card - worth about Â£1,000 a year - will be covered. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Kane Emerson, a Labour-supporting student who tweeted the job ad after it was sent to him by the university, told Mr Umunna he was ""extremely disappointed"" by it.

""The scheme, and others like it, are run collaboratively by MPs and universities, and gives students supported work experience as part of their university degree. ""In addition to the student finance students receive while undertaking a placement, as detailed in the advert, my office will reimburse travel expenses for a student travel card to minimise expenses. 'I do not and would not offer a long-term placement where a student is not supported and left financially penalised. ""Unfortunately, (MPs' expenses body)  IPSA do not provide additional resources for MPs to recruit interns on a paid basis, though the Parliamentary Labour Party has always argued strongly for them to do so."" The Labour leadership responded to the row by sending a message to all of its MPs, saying: ""This is a reminder to all MPs that it is against Labour Party policy to employ unpaid interns."" The message includes a link to Labour's 2017 general election manifesto. Tanya de Grunwald, founder of the Graduate Fog website,which broke the story,external, and a campaigner for fair internships, said: ""Rightly or wrongly, there is a loophole in the minimum wage law which means students need not be paid when doing a 'Year in Industry' placement as credit for their university course. So, legally Chuka has not done anything wrong. ""However, big ethical questions remain. Is it right that this person won't be paid, when they will clearly bring great value to his office?

"Samantha Bee (left) used a highly offensive slur for Ivanka Trump Comedian Samantha Bee has apologised after insulting Ivanka Trump with an obscene phrase on her television show. Bee was lambasting the White House adviser and US first daughter over the immigration policy of her father President Donald Trump. Conservatives demanded Bee be fired like Roseanne Barr, whose sitcom was cancelled this week after she posted a racist tweet. Bee acknowledged on Thursday she had ""crossed a line"" with her language. On her political commentary show Full Frontal, Bee attacked the president's daughter over a long-standing US policy of separating undocumented immigrant children from their families. Presenting Obama-era photos of such young people sleeping in cages, Bee said: ""Tearing children away from their parents is so evil, it's the inciting incident in almost every movie we've ever cared about."" She said Ms Trump had been ""oblivious"" recently to post an Instagram photo of herself hugging her child. ""You know, Ivanka, that's a beautiful photo of you and your child, but let me just say, one mother to another, do something about your dad's immigration practices,"" Bee said. She then called Ms Trump a ""feckless [expletive]"", employing an offensive term for part of the female anatomy. Bee urged the first daughter to confront her father about the policy. ""He listens to you,"" she said. ""Put on something tight and low-cut and tell your father to [expletive] stop it. Tell him it was an Obama thing and see how it goes, OK?"" Allow Twitter content?

"The redeveloped Stamford Bridge will be Europe's most expensive stadium at Â£1bn Chelsea's Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich has put the club's stadium plans on hold after delays to the renewal of his UK visa. The estimated cost for a new 60,000 seat Stamford Bridge has increased to Â£1bn after delays, which included adispute with a local family. Abramovich is unwilling to invest in a major project in a country where he is not allowed work. The 51-year-old's UK investor visa expired some weeks ago. In 2015, changes to the visa process mean applicants may be required to toprove the origins,externalof their wealth. But it is understood that Abramovich's decision will have no impact on the running of the football team. The delay in issuing him a new visa comes amid increased diplomatic tensions between London and Moscow after the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. The UK government has refused to comment on his individual case. Chelsea issued a statement saying the club had delayed work on Stamford Bridge because of ""the current unfavourable investment climate"". It added: ""No further pre-construction design and planning work will occur. The club does not have a time frame set for reconsideration of its decision."" Plans were under consideration to move Chelsea matches to Wembley stadium for the four years it would take to redevelop Stamford Bridge. Although the future of Wembley is in doubt after Fulham owner Shahid Khan offered Â£600m to buy the stadium from the Football Association, it is not thought to be a factor in Chelsea's decision. Christian Purslow, who left his role as managing director last year after three seasons at the club, said: ""It's been a very difficult project. Costs have skyrocketed. ""I have thought for some time it's a project that would not get off the ground. It was always an extremely marginal project financially and a very difficult project practically.

"Giuseppe Conte (L) presented a new list of ministers to President Sergio Mattarella A coalition government has been agreed in Italy, ending months of uncertainty in the EU's fourth-biggest economy. Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte presented his list of ministers to President Sergio Mattarella for the second time in a week and the new government will be sworn in on Friday. Ministers are drawn from both the anti-establishment Five Star (M5S) and the right-wing League. Attempts to form a technocratic government had failed. Mr Mattarella rejected Mr Conte's original choice for economy minister but a different candidate was agreed on Thursday. Italy populists: What you should know Country profile Analysis by BBC's James Reynolds in Rome Four days of political and constitutional crisis are over. And a new populist government - led by law professor Giuseppe Conte - will now be sworn in. Aiming to rule: The Five Star Movement's Luigi Di Maio (left) and the League's Matteo Salvini In the end, the populist parties decided to back down and accept the president's veto of their original choice of a eurosceptic economy minister. Their newly chosen minister, Giovanni Tria, is in favour of Italy's continued membership of the single currency. But the populists' conflict with the EU is not entirely over. The M5S and the League have promised both new welfare spending and also tax cuts - which may run into conflict with the EU's spending rules. League leader Matteo Salvini will be the interior minister. He has promised a tough new policy on migration, which may provoke arguments within Europe. After meeting President Mattarella, Mr Conte confirmed reports that the new candidate for the key economy minister post would be economics professor Giovanni Tria. M5S leader Luigi Di Maio and Mr Salvini said in a brief joint statement: ""All the conditions have been met for a M5S-League government."" Paolo Savona will enter government after all - but not as economy minister Other notable appointments to the new cabinet include: Interior and Deputy Prime Minister: Matteo Salvini (League) Industry and Deputy Prime Minister: Luigi Di Maio (M5S) Foreign: Enzo Moavero Milanesi (independent, ex-European Affairs minister) Defence: Elisabetta Trenta (M5S) European affairs: Paolo Savona (independent), the controversial original choice for finance ""We will work intensely to realise our political objectives which we have already put together in our government contract,"" Mr Conte was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency. The new government is expected to be sworn in later on Friday. After the ceremony, it will face confidence votes in both chambers of parliament, where the M5S and the League have a majority. Italy is no stranger to political turmoil - it has had 64 governments since World War Two. Mr Conte is taking over from Paolo Gentiloni, who led a coalition cabinet for two years. 4 March:5-Star wins 32% of the vote in the general election, with the League taking 18%. The two populist parties eventually attempt to form a coalition, putting forward Mr Conte, a political novice, as prime minister. 28 May:Mr Conte presents his cabinet list to President Mattarella who vetoes the choice of Mr Savona as finance minister on the grounds that he is a eurosceptic.

"County councillor Inga Lockington served as the mayor of Ipswich in 2007 A former mayor of Ipswich has won her appeal against a decision by the Home Office to refuse her British citizenship. Inga Lockington moved to the UK in 1979 from Denmark when she married her husband Tim. She said she wanted to retain her Danish passport but to have dual citizenship ahead of the UK leaving the European Union. The Home Office apologised for the initial refusal. Mrs Lockington said it was ""lovely"" her citizenship application will be granted, but said she will hold off celebrating until she has her official certificate in her hand. Read more Suffolk stories here Former mayor Inga Lockington hands Bobby Robson the Freedom of Ipswich in 2008 The 66-year-old, who lives in Ipswich, has been a Liberal Democrat councillor for 19 years and served as mayor in 2007. She said her Danish passport was stamped when she first arrived in the country with the words ""leave to enter the United Kingdom for an indefinite period"". Mrs Lockington said she will have to go through a formal process and attend a ceremony where she will swear allegiance to the Queen. ""I'm really grateful that it's been sorted reasonably quickly, and I'm grateful for the media for sharing my story,"" she said. Mrs Lockington's Danish passport was stamped in 1979 Mrs Lockington has lived in the UK since 1979 and spent many years in public service A Home Office spokesman said: ""We have contacted Mrs Lockington today to advise her that, following reconsideration of her case, her citizenship application will be granted. ""We have also taken the opportunity to apologise to her for the initial decision."" The Home Office said the case wasinitially decided based on the lack of a Permanent Residence card accompanying her application. But it became clear upon review that her settled status since 1979 had not been correctly evaluated. It said guidance has been reissued to reinforce the importance of consideration of wider immigration status in all cases for citizenship.

"Silvana Tenreyo is the only female member of the Monetary Policy Committee The appointment of another male economist to the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee has drawn fire from the female chairs of two House of Commons committees. The Business Committee's Rachel Reeves called it ""truly staggering"", while Nicky Morgan, from the Treasury Committee, said she was ""disappointed"". Prof Jonathan Haskel's appointment means there is one woman on the MPC. The Treasury said the role had been awarded on merit. The department insisted it was ""committed to diversity and encouraging the broadest range of candidates"". It had ""actively contacted"" 44 women and 43 men to apply for the role. Of those, 19 men and eight women applied and four women and one man were shortlisted. It also pointed out that two of the three people on the interview panel were women. ""The final appointment decision was based on merit,"" it said. However, Ms Reeves said: ""Eight of the nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee are currently men and it is truly staggering that the Treasury has failed to appoint a woman to this role. ""The fact that four women were shortlisted shows that there are plenty of capable and well qualified women, but yet again the top jobs seem to be reserved for men."" Jonathan Haskel joins the MPC on 1 September Ms Morgan said: ""I am disappointed that the gender balance in the Monetary Policy Committee will not be improved through this appointment. ""While I welcome the fact that four women were shortlisted for this role, it is notable that the only shortlisted male candidate has been chosen."" Prof Haskel, who lectures in economics at Imperial College Business School, will replace Ian McCafferty as one of the four externally appointed members of the MPC for three years from 1 September. 'All the good women have been snapped up' Bank chief sorry for 'menopausal' gaffe Chancellor Philip Hammond said Prof Haskel's ""expertise in productivity and innovation will further sharpen the committee's understanding of the British economy"". His appointment was based on recommendations to the chancellor made by an interview panel comprising Clare Lombardelli and Richard Hughes, from the Treasury, and Dame Kate Barker, a former external member of the MPC. Sarah Smith, professor of economics at Bristol University, said Prof Haskell was ""without doubt an excellent appointment, but this leaves only one woman on the committee"". Economics suffered from ""serious under-representation of women at all levels"", she added. ""The profession is going to have to think seriously about attracting a more diverse range of people - and projecting a broader image - otherwise it is in danger of being seen as a subject that is by men and for men."" Rachel Reeves chairs the Commons Business committee Diane Coyle, professor of economics at Cambridge University, called on the Bank of England to do more to encourage women to become economists. She said it was ""hard for any interview panel to do anything other than pick the best candidate, and they've appointed a brilliant person"". However, Prof Coyle added that the ""bigger problem"" was the wider one of too few women economists: ""I'd like to see the Bank take a more prominent leadership role in addressing that in schools and universities."" Last November, the Bank'sgender pay gap report,externalrevealed that its male staff England were paid almost a quarter more than female employees. At the time, governor Mark Carney said he was confident men and women were paid equally for doing the same jobs at the Bank. ""However, the greater proportion of men than women in senior roles creates a gender pay gap,"" he admitted. ""We are working hard to address this imbalance ... addressing the disparity in gender representation at senior levels will take time, but it will help close the current gender pay gap at the Bank.""

"Greg James is taking over the Radio 1 Breakfast Show Greg James has promised when he takes the reins of the Radio 1 Breakfast Show it will be a ""show for the listeners"". Radio 1 announced on Thursday that the presenterwould be swapping slotswith Nick Grimshaw later this year. Shortly after the news broke, Greg told Newsbeat that he's not worried about the response to the show in the press. ""I feel like I have a really good handle on what the listeners enjoy,"" he said. ""People are always going to write stuff about it, but I'm not doing a show for critics or anything like that. ""I really love the listeners and doing a show for them.""

"Commuters had to wait outside London Victoria Rush hour commuters had to clear a busy London railway station after steam from the Flying Scotsman set off the fire alarm. The world's best known steam engine sparked the evacuation when it arrived at London Victoria at about 19:00 BST. BBC reporter Henry Monk said no-one panicked and everyone left calmly - apart from one man who ran out quickly. Network Rail confirmed that ""steam and smoke"" from the locomotive set off the station's fire alarm. A spokesperson said the alarm led to ""the short evacuation of the station for 15 minutes"" from 19:21 to 19:36. The Flying Scotsman will be visiting towns and cities across the UK as part of a summer tour The BBC understands fire alarms are normally switched off when the steam engine pays a visit to the central London terminus. But station staff told Mr Monk that on Thursday the warning was not given and the locomotive's huge cloud of steam sparked an alert.

"Carluccio's could close up to a third of its branches in a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) rescue plan. Over 90% of Carluccio's creditors approved the CVA, allowing it to close 30 loss-making restaurants. Under the plan, the company's majority owner, the Dubai-based Landmark Group, will invest Â£10m in upgrading the remaining restaurants. It joins a growing list of restaurant chains cutting back in the face of higher costs and competition. In the year to 25 September 2016, even though revenues rose 2.7%, spiralling costs meant Carluccio's pre-tax profits fell by 81% to just Â£982,000. 'Godfather of Italian cooking' dies Antonio Carluccio's last interview The company, which runs 103 restaurants across the UK, had a management shake-up in January, with a new chief executive, Mark Jones, former boss of Goals Soccer Centres, and a new chief financial officer, Andrew Campbell, from YO! Sushi. Mr Jones said: ""The positive outcome enables us to kick-start an extensive programme of reinvigoration... with the aim of elevating the guest experience and underpinned by our brand ethos of minimum of fuss, maximum of flavour, which was so passionately championed by our founder Antonio Carluccio."" Earlier this month, following a strategic review, the new team admitted that ""urgent action"" was needed to keep Carluccio's afloat. The casual dining sector of the restaurant trade has been suffering from a general fallin consumer spending. Chains have also faced higher rents and rates, as well as rising wages with the increase in the National Living Wage. Prezzo, Jamie's Italian and Byron also used CVAs to close restaurants. Italian ingredients, from prosciutto to pecorino, have become more expensive since the devaluation of the pound in 2016. Stephen Minnall, a restaurant consultant and former director of Pizza Hut, said: ""They have been caught in a perfect storm. Food costs have gone up. Dairy has gone up 10% - when you order a coffee, it's the milk that costs the money, not the coffee. ""Then the government says you have to pay a higher wage, and then the apprenticeship levy. So the answer is to start a CVA and try to reduce your rental bill."" He said that Carluccio's would be negotiating with landlords to reduce their rents and closing stores if they could not get them low enough. He said: ""It'll be a question of whether the landlords can hold their nerve. And it can get messy with different rental agreements, for instance, forcing you to pay rent until another tenant is found, or putting a shop front back to the state it was in before you got it."" Carluccio has already tried to rebrand itself several times, introducing Via Carluccio's, a grab-and-go format in Tottenham Court Road, a hotel restaurant, and serving pizza for the first time in 2016. But much of the new competition in London is now coming not from other chains, but small independent start-ups such as Padella, Sorella, Flour and Grape or Sager and Wilde, which can be more flexible on pricing and menus. Italian ingredients have become more expensive since the pound's devaluation Carluccio's was co-founded by chef and restaurateur Antonio Carluccio as an Italian food shop in 1991 with the first cafe opening in Market Place, London, in 1999. Its deliberately simple Italian food and drink proved to be immensely popular. In 2010, it was bought by Landmark for Â£90m. Carluccio himself died in November last year aged 80, having sold his majority stake in the company in 2005. Carluccio's feels heat as chains struggle Whatâs eating the restaurant trade?

"Ex-Saints youth coach Bob Higgins is accused of multiple counts of indecent assault against boys A promising young footballer misused alcohol and drugs to cope with being repeatedly groped and kissed by a youth coach at Southampton FC, a court heard. Bob Higgins, 65, is accused of groping and other abuse against 24 boys, many who were trainees at Southampton and Peterborough United at the time. Prosecutors said he had become ""infatuated"" with Billy Seymour, who has waived his right to anonymity. Mr Higgins denies 50 counts of indecent assault at Salisbury Crown Court. The charges, dating between 1971 and 1996, arose after the NSPCC set up a dedicated helpline to deal with sexual abuse in football, the jury was told. Billy Seymour only told his parents what had happened many years later, the court heard Adam Feest QC, prosecuting, said Mr Higgins went on his knees to beg Mr Seymour not to leave him to attend the Football Association's School of Excellence at Lilleshall. He said the sexual behaviour became ""normalised"" in Mr Seymour's mind after months of grooming. The court heard Mr Seymour was repeatedly called to the defendant's bedroom where Mr Higgins cuddled him and told him he loved him. Bob Higgins denies 50 counts of indecent assault The charges arose after the NSPCC set up a helpline to deal with sexual abuse in football The boy became so distressed that on one occasion he fled the house semi-naked and rang his parents from a phone box, the court was told. Jurors heard he only told his parents what had happened many years later, when he was jailed for a knife assault. Mr Seymour told his parents the victim of the attack ""looked like Bob, smelt like Bob"" and ""he's inside me"", Mr Feest said. The court was also told another Southampton FC trainee, Dean Radford - who also waived his right to anonymity - said Mr Higgins inappropriately touched him to ""ease the bruising"" from a lower back injury. Dean Radford said Bob Higgins touched him inappropriately while he was a trainee, the jury was told Dean Radford (left) and Billy Seymour were both Southampton trainees When the allegations came to light in 1989, a senior figure at the club asked Mr Higgins about ""comments and jokes about his behaviour towards young players"", Mr Feest said. He said Mr Higgins replied that he was innocent and would sue anyone who made allegations against him. The jury earlier heard Mr Higgins, from Southampton, was found not guilty at a trial for similar offences in the 1990s. Jurors were also told Mr Higgins continued to abuse trainees after joining Peterborough United in 1994. Bob Higgins is on trial at Salisbury Crown Court He took revenge on a star youth player who rebuffed him by making him run 14 miles a day to lose weight, the court heard. The player was dropped and later released by the club, Mr Feest added. The jury was told Mr Higgins made no comment when he was interviewed by police about the latest allegations in March and June 2017. On both occasions he handed detectives a prepared statement, saying he was not guilty of any offence. The trial continues.

The organisation also said that south-west England, Hampshire and the West Midlands were most at risk, with urban areas most likely to suffer from any flash flooding later.

"Captain Nikesh Rastogi said if he were to leave the ship, it would be deemed a derelict A sailor has been stranded aboard a ship moored in Norfolk for more than 15 months amid a legal dispute. The Indian-owned Malaviya Twenty has been detained in Great Yarmouth docks since it arrived in June 2016. Capt Nikesh Rastogi was part of a 13-strong replacement crew for the ship contracted in February 2017. The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) said33 crew members had been on and off the vessel since October 2015and had not been paid. Capt Rastogi, 43, from Mumbai, said if he were to leave the ship, it would be deemed a derelict. He said anybody would then be able to take it over. Capt Rastogi said he and his crew mates had not been paid since last year Capt Rastogi said the ship's owners fell into liquidation and his employers withdrew from operating the ship in January. All of his original crew have returned to India, and he remains aboard with three crew members who joined him in September. He said the four of them had not been paid since last year. The Malaviya Twenty ship arrived at Great Yarmouth in June 2016 The ITF arrested the ship at Great Yarmouth in November 2016 and secured 688,000 US dollars (Â£517,045) for the asset's release to manning agents acting for the Indian Bank ICICI. The money covered unpaid crew wages, with the last payment made in February 2017, the ITF said. ITF inspector Paul Keenan said arresting the ship and selling it would raise enough money to pay everyone involved in the wrangle and repatriate the remaining four crew to India. The International Transport Workers' Federation wants to repatriate the remaining four crew to India But he said Great Yarmouth port, which is owed unpaid dues, is ""using legislation from the 19th Century"" to demand three times the amount of rates. A spokesman for Peel Ports, which manages the port, said it was an ""ongoing legal matter"" and he was unable to comment. Thecrew aboard the ship's sister vessel, the Malaviya Seven, which was detained in Aberdeen, went home in November.

"This video can not be played Pompeo: North Korea security greater after denuclearisation US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said preparations for talks with North Korea are ""moving in the right direction"" but that there is ""a great deal of work to do"". He was speaking after talks with one of Kim Jong-un's most high-profile aides, Gen Kim Yong-chol, in New York. Gen Kim will now travel to Washington to deliver a letter from Kim Jong-un to President Donald Trump, he said. Mr Trump has also downplayed hopes of reaching a quick deal with Mr Kim. He said while he would ""like to see it done in one meeting... often times that's not the way deals work"". ""But it'll get done at some point."" Separately, the North Korean leader has agreed to hold a summit with Russia, after a meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Kim Jong-un's meeting with Sergei Lavrov was a sign to the US that North Korea has powerful allies North Korean and US officials have been working to get the 12 June Singapore summit back on track after the US leader, angered by North Korean rhetoric,announced last week he was no longer attending. If it does go ahead, it will be the first time a sitting US president has met a North Korean leader. Pyongyang has long wanted such a meeting, which it would see as validating its status. Analysis: Decoding Trump's letter to Kim Kim Yong-chol: Kim Jong-un's right hand man The talks will focus on North Korea's announcement earlier this year that it is committed to ""denuclearisation"" - but there is as yet no agreement between the two sides about what that might mean and how it would be achieved. This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on Gen Kim - who is vice-chairman of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party's Central Committee - is the most senior North Korean to visit the US in nearly 20 years. At his press conference on Thursday, Mr Pompeo said they had ""made real progress"" towards bringing their leaders to the summit. Until recently, Kim Yong-chol (left) was blacklisted in the United States The US-North Korea relationship was at a ""pivotal moment"", he said, and it would be ""nothing short of tragic to let this opportunity go to waste"". ""This is going to be a process that will take days and weeks to work our way through,"" he said. The US has long called on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programme but Pyongyang maintains it needs the weapons for its security. What does Kim really want? North Korea crisis in 300 words In exchange for North Korea giving up its atomic arsenal, the US could possibly relax sanctions, offering food and other aid to the impoverished country. However, Pyongyang has strongly objected to statements by Trump administration officials comparing North Korean denuclearisation to Libya's. Former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi gave up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. In North Korea, Mr Kim held a meeting with Mr Lavrov and, according to state media, told him that the ""will for denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula still remains unchanged and consistent and fixed"". This video can not be played North Koreans dare to criticise 'vampire leader' The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says Mr Kim's agreement to meet President Vladimir Putin in Russia later this year has sent a signal to Washington that North Korea has powerful allies. North Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui also met Sung Kim, a former US ambassador to South Korea, at Panmunjom on the border between the two Koreas. In Singapore, where the summit will be held, a US team led by White House official Joe Hagin is thought to be meeting Kim Chang-son, the de facto chief of staff to the North Korean leader, to talk about logistics. US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis is also travelling to Singapore for an annual Asian security summit. He told reporters on his plane on Thursday he would reassure US allies the White House was committed to their regional security. Please upgrade your browser to view this content.

"Northern services operate across the North East and North West of England Two troubled rail operators were responsible for almost 1,000 late or cancelled trains in just one day - with more services still being axed. Customers are continuing to express anger amid disruption on Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) routes. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said Northern's ""freefall"" had shown ""no signs of slowing down"". Northern and GTR said they were urgently working on ""comprehensive plans"" to improve services. Calls for Northern to lose franchise Train firm's service 'unacceptably poor' Rail boss sorry for 'rude' customer tweets The operators switched to new timetables on 20 May, and on Wednesday one in eight scheduled trains was cancelled or late. At least 147 trains were also cancelled or part-cancelled on 22 May and this had almost doubled to at least 281 on 29 May. Customers have been complaining to the companies on social media.

Lilian Greenwood, chair of the Transport Select Committee, said she would ask the committee on Monday to ""review the situation"", which may lead to a full inquiry. Mr Burnham said the fact services have ""continued to decline"" is ""nothing short of a scandal"". ""Ministers seems oblivious to the scale of this chaos and the impact this is having on people's jobs and social lives on a daily basis,"" he said. Mr Burnham and Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram havecalled for Northern to lose the franchiseif things do not improve. Cancellations at Poulton railway station in Lancashire meant people could not get to the airport on Thursday Mr Burnham has also accused Transport Secretary Chris Grayling of being ""asleep at the wheel"". He said: ""I believe he now must take personal responsibility for sorting this situation out."" Mr Grayling previously said improving Northern's train services is the Department for Transport's ""number one performance priority"". Mayor demands Northern trains inquiry Struggling to work in the north of England Reality Check: Does the North get a raw deal on rail? Northern said it has agreed actions with the DfT and is working on a plan to ""stabilise"" services. Managing director David Brown said that ""such a plan is likely to take a number of weeks to deliver lasting improvements"". There were major delays on ""Meltdown Monday"" at Manchester Piccadilly Mr Burnham spoke to Mr Grayling on a call with other political leaders in northern England. He said they were previously told it was a Network Rail issue but have now been told it is more of a shared issue between Network Rail and Northern. ""The problem with that is we've had an action plan that's been based on the wrong analysis for a week and here we are a week later with worse disruption,"" said Mr Burnham. ""I take away from this that the pain of northern commuters, I'm afraid, is not worth the same as the pain of commuters in London."" The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has also warned that the industry will suffer ""lasting and irreparable damage"" if the issues are not resolved. The union added its members working for companies including Northern and GTR were facing increasing levels of abuse from passengers because of delays and cancellations. Mr Burnham first called for an investigation into Northern's ""unacceptably poor"" serviceon 16 May.

"Rent-to-own customers usually pay off household appliances over three years ""Rent-to-own"" shops that sell appliances and furniture for small weekly payments but with a high interest rate face a price cap. However, the financial regulator will not rush to impose the same restrictions on bank overdrafts. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has spent nearly two years looking at the cost of high interest borrowing. It has now outlined a package of plans for rent-to-own, doorstep lending and catalogue shopping. High-cost credit is used by three million people in the UK. Single-parents aged 18 to 34 are three times more likely to have a high-cost loan - such as a payday loan, doorstep loan or pawnbroking loan - than the national average. ""The proposals will benefit overdraft and high-cost credit users, rebalancing in the favour of the customer,"" said FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey. This video can not be played Kenneth Murray got trapped in a cycle of debt Campaigners had called for a cap on the interest and charges faced by those using high-cost credit, including overdrafts. They said that cap on the cost of payday loans, introduced in 2015, should be a template for the rest of the high-cost credit market. Rent-to-own firms 'selling to vulnerable people' Young and in the red: Personal debt in five charts Millions miss bills as finances bite How debt kills About 400,000 people have outstanding debt with rent-to-own firms such as BrightHouse from which they buy household appliances, paying the money back over three years. After interest, they can end up paying many multiples of the cost price. The FCA said it had seen cases when people had ended up paying more than Â£1,500 for essentials like an electric cooker that could be bought on the high street for less than Â£300. ""The FCA believes the harm identified in this market is sufficient in principle to consider a cap on rent-to-own prices. It will now carry out the detailed assessment of the impact that a cap could have on the rent-on-own sector and how it might be structured,"" the regulator said. Such a cap would not be in place before April 2019. John Glen, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said the measures would help the most vulnerable avoid being stung by ""dodgy deals"". That includes people like Kenneth Murray, who says he had to buy a laptop from a rent-to-own firm business as he could not get credit from a high street electrical store. ""I had multiple debts that I was trying to juggle, and no stable source of income. I ended up taking out loans to pay loans,"" he said, although he has now managed to halt this cycle. This video can not be played Paula Goddard: High interest loans were ""our only option"" More than three million people have dipped into an unauthorised overdraft in the course of a year, exceeding their agreed limit. In 2016, firms made an estimated Â£2.3bn in revenue from overdrafts, with 30% of this from unarranged overdrafts. The charges for those who go into the red without agreement can be high and complex. The majority of unarranged overdraft charges were paid by only 1.5% of customers, who paid about Â£450 a year in fees and charges, the FCA said. The regulator is proposing that banks offer more information to customers, including mobile alerts, about when and how they go into the red. It is also considering a ban on fixed fees, which can lead to relatively high charges for a small unarranged overdraft. This video can not be played Would you use 'rent-to-own' or high-interest lending? Those aged 35 to 44 are most likely to have some form of overdraft A total of 10% of all 18 to 24-year-olds have exceeded their overdraft limit in the last 12 months Source: FCA, Financial Lives, October 2017 Part of discussions will be a ""potential backstop price cap for overdrafts"", but it is not an immediate proposal. The FCA said that it needed to overcome potential legal issues that had been encountered in the past. Gareth Shaw, of consumer association Which?, criticised the delay: ""Last summer, the FCA expressed serious concerns about how unarranged overdrafts work, and now almost a year later it is still refusing to take action."" Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said it was disappointing the regulator had failed to protect users of doorstep loans and unarranged overdrafts as well as buy-to-own customers. ""There are some strong potential remedies on the table for people struggling with overdrafts - the onus is now on the FCA to act quickly,"" she said. But Eric Leenders, managing director of UK Finance, said big banks were making overdrafts more transparent. ""This builds on the unarranged overdraft alerts already available and supported by the regulator, which have already reduced charges to consumers by as much as 25%,"" he said. Greg Stevens, chief executive of the Consumer Credit Trade Association, which represents 300 lenders, welcomed the FCA's ""cautious approach"" and said it was ""taking its time to get the balance right"".

"Will Hutchinson, a fourth generation farmer from Tennessee, says trade between the US and China is ""vitally important"" The US-China trade dispute is starting to have consequences. US tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium went into effect last month. China's retaliatory duties on more than 100 US imports, including pork, fruit and wine, kicked in soon after. Further tariffs on $50bn worth of the each country's products are in the offing, as the Trump administration presses China on state subsidies and practices it says encourage intellectual property theft. The White House has threatened even more. Economists expect the duelling taxes to have a relatively limited impact on the overall US economy. But they say the measures will touch most parts of the country and lead to higher prices for everything from televisions to vitamins. For certain industries like agriculture, aerospace and manufacturing, the effects could be severe. So how are US companies handling a looming trade war? Roadtec, which makes asphalt paving machines, says suppliers are raising their prices For some firms, the measures are welcome. Companies such as US Steel have announced plans to expand their operations, bringing on hundreds of workers. Their customers - many of them manufacturers located in the Midwest - are worried, however. They say US tariffs have already increased demand for domestic steel - which accounts for the majority of the metal's sales in America - driving up prices for firms reliant on steel-based parts. The proposed tariffs, which include taxes on hundreds of Chinese-made parts and equipment, promise more pain. At Roadtec, a growing 600-person Tennessee company that makes asphalt paving machines, suppliers are already asking 40% more, says the firm's marketing director, Eric Baker. He says the firm is still trying to figure out how to best address the higher costs. ""There's a lot of uncertainty right now,"" he says. ""I think the biggest question is how long this is."" Seneca Foods Corp has asked the Commerce Department to exclude its imports from the tariff Hundreds of firms have asked the Commerce Department for exemptions from the US steel and aluminium tariffs, including Wisconsin-based Seneca Foods Corp. The firm, which makes its own cans to support a large fruit and vegetable processing business, started importing coils of tin-plated steel just a few years ago, after domestic supply became uncertain. Leon Lindsay, Seneca's vice president for sourcing, says he is not sure where he will buy coils now, given the uncertainty about how the US tariffs will affect other markets such as Europe. In the meantime, a Chinese shipment from an order of 11,000 metric tons, placed last summer, is due in port in the next few weeks and faces the new 25% mark-up. Mr Lindsay said he is not optimistic a Commerce Department reprieve will come in time, nor can the firm, which is in the competitive food industry, pass on the higher cost of steel to its customers. ""The stuff we're asking for exclusion [for] is on the water. It can't go back, so we're the ones that will probably have to absorb the cost, which is significant,"" he said. Will Hsu on a freshly harvested field in fall of 2013 Farmers are also bracing for a hit. Will Hsu, whose father started a ginseng farm in Wisconsin more than 40 years ago, was in China last week, meeting with clients and sales staff. ""This comes up with every customer that we meet with. This comes up with our staff,"" he said. ""They're worried about how they're going to pass on that price increase."" Trump threatens further $100bn in tariffs against China Trade wars, Trump tariffs and protectionism explained Why China is targeting US hogs and Harleys Wisconsin, the source of more than 90% of the United States' cultivated ginseng, can't afford to lose access to the Chinese market - which has been a key buyer of American ginseng since the 1700s and is the destination for more than three quarters of the state's crop. Industry members said American ginseng has a reputation for quality, commanding a premium price that provides some room to negotiate. Mr Hsu says his farm, which employs about 400 people in the US and China, also has enough US clients to handle a temporary tariff. But levied long term, the tax could force him to scale back. Will Hutchinson's farm relies on exporting its soybeans to China Farmers are also worried about foreign competition. About a third of America's soybean crop heads to China each year - some $14bn in exports - but Argentina and Brazil are also big exporters. Drought has hurt Argentina's crop, but farmers in Brazil expect the US-China dispute to increase demand for their product, says Victor Carvalho of Informa, a business intelligence firm. They are also watching to see if US prices will fall enough to make it worth importing US soy to crush and resell, he says. Will Hutchinson, a fourth generation farmer from Tennessee, has been monitoring developments on the news and is hoping the situation will de-escalate. ""Trade is vitally important to both countries,"" he says of China and the US. ""We don't need to be cutting off our nose to spite our face."" Randy Goodman of Greenland America says his firm has already shifted some scrap metal from China to other countries About half of US scrap aluminium exports went to China last year, but US firms are already starting to turn to other markets. The shift is a response in part to tougher environmental rules China had already imposed on waste imports. China's new tax on aluminium scrap compounded the problem. Randy Goodman is executive vice president at Georgia-based Greenland America, a brokerage that buys and sells scrap metals in countries around the world. So far, he says less than 10% of his firm's business to China has been affected, but he's worried about the future. ""The issue is that these other countries or even the domestic consumers ... can't pick up all the slack so there will be excess material,"" he says. ""There will be an overhang in the market that will eventually affect the pricing."" President Trump has said he is confident that confronting China will lead to a stronger US economy, and tried to reassure those who are worried. ""It'll be very good when we get it all finished,"" he said this week. The people whose livelihoods are caught up in the dispute are hoping the president is right.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump's US trade tariffs worry first minister Tata Steel has urged the EU to take ""swift and robust action"" in response to a US decision to impose a 25% tariff on European steel. The US said the tariffs on imports from the EU, Mexico and Canadawould start at midnight. This will impact directly on Port Talbot as about 10% of Tata Steel Europe's exports go to the US. Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones called it ""short-sighted"" with wide-ranging implications for business. Liberty Steel's Welsh plants including Newport will not be affected, but it could hit parts of its UK operations. Almost 7,000 workers are employed by Tata in Wales, including about 4,000 in Port Talbot. The US announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminium immediately triggered vows of retaliation from Mexico and the EU, which called the tariffs ""protectionism, pure and simple"". The Community union called on trade unions across the world to stand together to oppose the measures. Criticism of Trump trade tariffs intensifies UK labels US metal tariffs 'absurd' Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Henrik Adam, chief commercial officer of Tata Steel in Europe, said: ""We have been, and will continue, to work closely with our customers on potential product exclusions as the vast majority of the products Tata Steel Europe exports to the US cannot be made by US steel companies, such as our extra wide strip, battery quality hot rolled material as well as certain packaging steels. ""We now call on the EU Commission to take swift and robust action to combat the indirect effects of these tariffs. ""We must ensure our markets are not destabilised by millions of tonnes of steel being diverted away from the US and into Europe. ""The European Commission now needs to put in place protection measures on a provisional basis without delay."" Tony Brady, Unite national officer, described the measures as blunt and short-sighted while Labour MP for Aberavon, Stephen Kinnock, said it was a ""major setback for the British steel industry"". Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, the steelworkers' union, said: ""The problems of steel dumping will not be solved by unfair tariffs and steelworkers in the UK and USA must not fall into the trap of believing rhetoric from the likes of Donald Trump."" The George Bush administration introduced steel tariffs in 2002 which lasted for 20 months. Why is Port Talbot steelworks important? Blood, sweat and steel: Life in and out of the steel works Carwyn Jones criticises Donald Trump's US steel tariff UK to seek exemption from US steel tariffs It prompted threats of retaliation from the European Union on US products before the policy was abandoned. This video can not be played Stephen Davies has worked at Port Talbot steel works for 39 years Mr Jones, who is in Washington meeting business leaders and politicians, said: ""I want to see fewer obstacles to trade, more cooperation, more internationalism, to help our economies continue to grow. ""It is, therefore, extremely disappointing that the US is pressing ahead with tariffs on EU steel and aluminium imports. ""It could also harm the Welsh steel industry, which we have fought so hard to protect."" A UK government spokeswoman said Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns had spoken to Mr Jones to give reassurances Whitehall was fully committed to reaching a successful resolution.

"This video can not be played Abortion pills handed to police at pro-choice rally Organisers of a pro-choice rally in Belfast have handed over abortion pills to the police. At the demonstration, three women took what appeared to be abortion pills. A mini-robot that can be used to distribute abortion pills was also handed over to police. The PSNI spoke to one of the women afterwards but she was not arrested. A small anti-abortion protest also took place alongside the demonstration at Laganside Courts on Thursday. Abortion pills were handed over to police A police inspector approached the organisers beforehand and warned them that if the robot was used to distribute the pills it could be seized. DUP politician Jim Wells and pro-life campaigner Bernie Smyth were among those who protested against changes to abortion laws in Northern Ireland After 15 minutes of negotiations on the street outside Laganside Courts, a Dutch doctor, who was part of the protest, handed over the robots and the pills to the PSNI. In Londonderry a group of pro-choice supporters held a rally at the Guildhall. Pro-choice supporters dressed in 'The Handmaid's Tale' style outfits in Londonderry On Tuesday, Irish Minister for Health Simon Harris sought the cabinet's backing to draft the new legislation. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said new abortion law will be in place by the end of the year. The proposed legislation will allow abortions during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and up to the 24th week in exceptional circumstances. Seismic shift for Ireland Timeline: Ireland and abortion Following the Republic's overwhelming vote in favour of abortion law reform, Northern Ireland will soon be the only part of either the UK or Ireland where abortion is illegal unless there is a serious risk to a woman's life or health. Donegal was the only constituency to vote No Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland. And with the focus now shifted to Northern Ireland's strict abortion laws, withUK Prime Minister Theresa May facing calls to act. But Mrs May is in a difficult situation because her administration depends on the support of10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs- who strongly oppose any reform. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald and deputy leader Michelle O'Neill are in favour of change, and attended the official abortion referendum result announcement at Dublin Castle last Saturday.

"Rent-to-own customers usually pay off household appliances over three years ""Rent-to-own"" shops that sell appliances and furniture for small weekly payments but with a high interest rate face a price cap. However, the financial regulator will not rush to impose the same restrictions on bank overdrafts. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has spent nearly two years looking at the cost of high interest borrowing. It has now outlined a package of plans for rent-to-own, doorstep lending and catalogue shopping. High-cost credit is used by three million people in the UK. Single-parents aged 18 to 34 are three times more likely to have a high-cost loan - such as a payday loan, doorstep loan or pawnbroking loan - than the national average. ""The proposals will benefit overdraft and high-cost credit users, rebalancing in the favour of the customer,"" said FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey. This video can not be played Kenneth Murray got trapped in a cycle of debt Campaigners had called for a cap on the interest and charges faced by those using high-cost credit, including overdrafts. They said that cap on the cost of payday loans, introduced in 2015, should be a template for the rest of the high-cost credit market. Rent-to-own firms 'selling to vulnerable people' Young and in the red: Personal debt in five charts Millions miss bills as finances bite How debt kills About 400,000 people have outstanding debt with rent-to-own firms such as BrightHouse from which they buy household appliances, paying the money back over three years. After interest, they can end up paying many multiples of the cost price. The FCA said it had seen cases when people had ended up paying more than Â£1,500 for essentials like an electric cooker that could be bought on the high street for less than Â£300. ""The FCA believes the harm identified in this market is sufficient in principle to consider a cap on rent-to-own prices. It will now carry out the detailed assessment of the impact that a cap could have on the rent-on-own sector and how it might be structured,"" the regulator said. Such a cap would not be in place before April 2019. John Glen, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said the measures would help the most vulnerable avoid being stung by ""dodgy deals"". That includes people like Kenneth Murray, who says he had to buy a laptop from a rent-to-own firm business as he could not get credit from a high street electrical store. ""I had multiple debts that I was trying to juggle, and no stable source of income. I ended up taking out loans to pay loans,"" he said, although he has now managed to halt this cycle. This video can not be played Paula Goddard: High interest loans were ""our only option"" More than three million people have dipped into an unauthorised overdraft in the course of a year, exceeding their agreed limit. In 2016, firms made an estimated Â£2.3bn in revenue from overdrafts, with 30% of this from unarranged overdrafts. The charges for those who go into the red without agreement can be high and complex. The majority of unarranged overdraft charges were paid by only 1.5% of customers, who paid about Â£450 a year in fees and charges, the FCA said. The regulator is proposing that banks offer more information to customers, including mobile alerts, about when and how they go into the red. It is also considering a ban on fixed fees, which can lead to relatively high charges for a small unarranged overdraft. This video can not be played Would you use 'rent-to-own' or high-interest lending? Those aged 35 to 44 are most likely to have some form of overdraft A total of 10% of all 18 to 24-year-olds have exceeded their overdraft limit in the last 12 months Source: FCA, Financial Lives, October 2017 Part of discussions will be a ""potential backstop price cap for overdrafts"", but it is not an immediate proposal. The FCA said that it needed to overcome potential legal issues that had been encountered in the past. Gareth Shaw, of consumer association Which?, criticised the delay: ""Last summer, the FCA expressed serious concerns about how unarranged overdrafts work, and now almost a year later it is still refusing to take action."" Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said it was disappointing the regulator had failed to protect users of doorstep loans and unarranged overdrafts as well as buy-to-own customers. ""There are some strong potential remedies on the table for people struggling with overdrafts - the onus is now on the FCA to act quickly,"" she said. But Eric Leenders, managing director of UK Finance, said big banks were making overdrafts more transparent. ""This builds on the unarranged overdraft alerts already available and supported by the regulator, which have already reduced charges to consumers by as much as 25%,"" he said. Greg Stevens, chief executive of the Consumer Credit Trade Association, which represents 300 lenders, welcomed the FCA's ""cautious approach"" and said it was ""taking its time to get the balance right"".

"Husnain Rashid faces a lengthy sentence, the judge has warned him An Islamic State supporter who called for jihadis to attack Prince George has admitted a string of terror charges. Husnain Rashid, 32, of Leonard Street in Nelson, Lancashire, brought his trial at Woolwich Crown Court to a halt with a dramatic change of plea. Nearly two weeks into his trial Rashid was re-indicted and pleaded guilty to three counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. He also admitted one count of encouraging terrorism. Rashid will be sentenced on 28 June at the same court for the offences spanning from October 2016 to April this year. Husnain Rashid shared Prince George's photograph in tips for would-be attackers Judge Andrew Lees told the defendant: ""For the past week I have listened to the most disturbing allegations. ""You have admitted these allegations of encouraging others to commit terrorist activities and publishing statements to encourage the killing of others. ""It is inevitable that you will receive a very lengthy prison sentence and there will be a consideration of a life prison sentence."" He added: ""The question of your future dangerousness and the protection of the public is a matter that I will have to give very careful consideration."" On 13 October Rashid used a Telegram chat group to call on supporters to target the four-year-old Prince George who had started school at Thomas's Battersea in south-west London a month earlier. Prosecutors said Rashid was encouraging terrorism by posting a photograph of the prince at the school super-imposed with silhouettes of two masked jihad fighters. Last week, prosecutor Annabel Darlow told the court ""the underlying message was clear"" that ""Prince George and other members of the royal family should be viewed as targets"". ""Even the royal family will not be left alone,"" Rashid messaged the group, before sharing the school's full address and postcode. He added: ""School starts early."" A magazine he was producing contained suggestions to strike the 2018 World Cup in Russia using vehicles, weapons or bombs. He also posted suggestions of which British football stadiums terrorists could strike following a deadly attack outside Besiktas's ground in Turkey, his trial heard. He ran a ""prolific"" Telegram channel named the Lone Mujahid where he provided an ""e-toolkit for terrorism"", the prosecution said. This allegedly included a recipe for the poison ricin and instructions for making petrol bombs and napalm. His list of targets included British Army bases, shopping centres, Jewish communities and government buildings. He also plotted with a British terrorist in Syria to bring down an aircraft with lasers, the court heard. Rashid posted a photograph of the Burmese ambassador to the UK, saying: ""You know what to do."" He urged others to ""fight and spill the blood to the apes in your land"" and called for others to ""start preparing tools and weapons/explosives"". Ms Darlow said on the first day of the trial: ""His proposals were indiscriminate and made no distinction between adult and child, between members of fighting forces and civilians."" When police swooped on his house in November, Rashid ""hurled"" a phone containing a ""treasure trove"" of evidence over a wall into an alleyway. Two charges of dissemination of a terrorist publication and one of failing to comply with a notice under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act will lie on file.

" BBC Three This is the story of how the pressure of debt drove a boy to take his own life. In February 2015 Jerome gets a new job at CitySprint, a company that hires couriers to carry out individual deliveries. His job is to bike around London transporting blood and documents between the city's hospitals - which are dotted all over the capital. He's excited to finally get some financial independence. Although he's worked as a takeaway delivery boy before, the hours were really anti-social and he didn't make very much. Plus, he already has a motorbike - which makes getting the courier job much easier. Delivering supplies to hospitals is an important job, and Jerome needs to be able to get across the city as quickly as possible. When he first gets the job, Jerome excitedly tells his friends that he could earn as much as £1,500 a month - because he'stechnically ""self-employed"". What this means is that Jerome isn't classed as a ""worker"" or an ""employee"" of CitySprint. He's technically, legally, in charge of his own earnings. It also means that he isn't guaranteed a minimum amount of work in any given week, and he doesn't have any set hours. But Jerome needs to keep himself available for as much of the day as possible. When he's logged in to the system, CitySprint could ask him to take a job at any time - and if he's not ready, he'll lose out on the job and any money he could have earned doing it. Plus, because he's technically his own ""business"", he's responsible for all of his expenses - including the cost of his bike, his petrol, and any traffic fines he might get while out on a courier job. He also has to pay CitySprint fees in order to hire his uniform and communication devices from them. Still, Jerome is excited. He thinks he can make good money as long as he keeps himself available. It's his first real job and his mum is proud of him. But there's a problem - his bike won't start. He can't fix it himself. He's a courier and needs his bike to take jobs. No working bike means no money - and if it's out of action for too long, the company might stop sending work to him altogether. After seeing Jerome in despair, trying and failing to fix the bike in their driveway at home, Bentley offers to buy him a replacement. The family go to a bike dealership to see if they can get a good deal on a second-hand model, but a bright red bike catches Jerome's eye. The bike is perfect but there's a catch - it's brand new. Watching the family, a salesman intervenes and tells Bentley that he can sell him the brand new bike on a zero-interest payment plan. This, the salesman claims, will work out cheaper than buying a second-hand model on credit. Bentley is a chauffeur, and is already paying off his car and Tracey's car. But knowing how much Jerome needs the bike for work, he agrees. Jerome promises to pay him back in instalments - which works out at £73 a month. But Jerome isn't worried about paying it off. All he has to do is work a few extra hours and he reckons he'll easily cover it. Still from BBC Three factual drama Killed By My Debt: Tom Walker as Jerome's boss As a self-employed courier, Jerome is now one of many young people working in the ""gig economy"". The gig economy is where people take on short-term or freelance work instead of permanent jobs. These include private-hire cab drivers, food delivery workers, and couriers. But with thegig economy boomingin cities like London, working conditions are becoming increasingly unstable. There are now4.8 million self-employed people in the UK- althoughpast studiesby the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) have estimated thataround 10%of this ""self-employment"" isn't genuine. That is, companies are classing people as self-employed, meaning they miss out on basic protections like holiday pay and sick pay, even though they are carrying out the work of employees or full-time workers. As of April 2018, there are also1.8 million peoplein the UK on zero-hours contracts - another notoriously unstable form of work. People in ""bogus"" self-employment, on zero-hours or short-hours contracts have to deal with erratic shifts and pay, and little work-life balance. They could be working full-time one week, but only a few hours the next. Their shifts are impossible to predict, and their weekly earnings can vary significantly. Zero-hours workers areentitled to paid annual leave and the minimum wage, just like those on more traditional fixed-hours contracts - although half of zero-hours workers aresaid to be unaware of these rights. Self-employed contractors like Jerome, however, are not entitled to any statutory rights. Jerome is also not paid unless he's carrying a packet at that moment. So the time he spends travelling to a hospital before picking up a package is essentially unpaid. And because the distance he travels is different depending on what job he takes on, his pay fluctuates wildly too. Usually the assignments he takes on get him about £3 to £6 each time. Jerome has only just brought home enough money to pay off his £65 traffic fine from Camden Council - but if he pays it off, he'll have no money left for the rest of the week. He puts the council's letter to one side, hoping to sort it out later. Before Jerome can pay off his first fine, he has been given a second one. He is still paid less than £10 for most of the deliveries that he's doing - which makes it hard to tackle the fines. On 28 September, Jerome receives a ""notice of enforcement"" from Newlyn PLC, a private bailiff company hired by Camden Council to recover unpaid money. One of Jerome's fines has more than trebled to £202, with another £75 ""compliance fee"" - a fee added by bailiffs - on top. As the weather gets colder, Jerome's asthma is worsening - making it even harder for him to work enough shifts to take home a decent pay. As his debts grow, his health steadily declines - and so does his pay. Less than a month later, in October, he receives a ""removal of goods notice"" from Newlyn telling him that he now owes £512. Jerome faces having someone come to his house and take away his belongings if he doesn't pay the newly increased fine. In November 2015, Jerome receives a letter telling him that he's been given ""final notice"" before they remove his goods. An Enforcement Agent will be attending your property within the next few days to remove your goods to settle your outstanding debt. TELEPHONE 01604 ------ IMMEDIATELY TO DISCUSS PAYMENT. Jerome's debt has now skyrocketed to £789 - an amount he can't possibly hope to repay. In November and December, his gross earnings only come to an average of £97.33 a week - leaving him with less than £20 after his expenses. So at this point, most weeks he's taking home nothing. Just four days later, Jerome gets another text message warning that a bailiff will come to his house to remove his property. RETURN HOME NOW OR TO STOP CALL 078-- ------. PLS QUOTE REF 32---40 Jerome tries to call the bailiff to set up a payment plan, but is told he needs to speak to Newlyn HQ. When he calls Newlyn directly, they tell him that they can't set up a payment plan for him, and that he needs to pay in full - something he just cannot do. He pays off £5, but it feels like a drop in the ocean. On 10 December, Jerome gets a letter headed: REMOVAL OF GOODS NOTICE It says: ""Our REMOVAL UNIT is currently operating in CR0 and will be looking to remove your car & household possessions. TELEPHONE 01604 ------ IMMEDIATELY TO DISCUSS PAYMENT."" Jerome's debt has now soared to £1,019. Including the £5 he managed to pay off last month, his debt has increased by £822 in less than four months. He can't ask his parents for help. He knows Bentley is already tied in to three different payment plans - one of which is for his bike - and he is scared of becoming a burden on them. He starts to get more desperate. Killed By My Debt: Craig Parkinson as The Bailiff A Newlyn bailiff visits Jerome's house and says that if he doesn't pay off the remaining £1,019, he'll take his bike. When Jerome explains that he needs his bike to work - and to make money to pay off the fines - the bailiff says: You've got half an hour to sort this out. Bentley, wondering what's happening, comes outside to speak to the bailiff. After hearing how much debt Jerome is in he pays off £500 for him. But Jerome still needs to figure out how to pay off the rest. Contracted ""self-employment"", zero-hours and short-hours contracts are so insecure that it's much harder for people on them to take out traditional bank loans. With no hope of getting a low-interest loan from his bank - and with the bailiff waiting outside and threatening to take his bike away - Jerome frantically applies for three different payday loans from his phone. Payday loans are quick, easy-to-obtain payments that tie borrowers into credit withhigh interest rates. Studies have shown that people on zero-hours contracts and in other unstable work situations arefive times more likelyto turn to volatile, high-interest payday loans to make up for their erratic earnings. Despite what the Newlyn customer service operator told Jerome earlier, the bailiff agrees to let him pay off his debt in instalments. He sets up the repayments in four weekly instalments of £128. Two days before the bailiff's visit, on 17 January, Jerome's pay was just £58.38, leaving him with nothing after expenses. So he must know as the bailiff sets up the payment plan for him that he can't afford to pay it. As well as his physical health, Jerome's mental health starts to suffer. He starts looking for help online, and comes across people's personal experiences shared on forums like Reddit. Debt is a topic that is often discussed online everywhere from Money Saving Expert to Mumsnet. These sites, he finds, are full of posts from people in absolute despair. Young people in unstable work like Jerome's areone-and-a-half times more likelyto report having a mental health problem compared with those in more secure work. Dr Alex Wood, asociologist at Oxford University, has spent the last six years looking at the link between mental health issues and these kinds of jobs. He's found that people in precarious working situations are left feeling more anxious, depressed, and financially insecure. ""Some workers have even told me that they'd be in tears, or would see their colleagues in tears,"" he tells BBC Three. ""One minute you walk in and you know what you're doing; the next minute you walk in and you have no idea. It creates a really stressful atmosphere."" Alex adds that one zero-hours worker, who took part in his research, told him, ""It's caused me so much stress and anxiety, it's sad and heartbreaking. I've had to hold back tears at work, and I've had to have a lot of therapy from working for this employer. I need stress management and anxiety management just from working here."" Another told him, ""I've got two kids and a mortgage and I'm going to be out of a job because I can't do these hours."" ""They put a lot of stress on people,"" another worker added. ""I used to be in tears."" Jerome's asthma worsened in the cold weather, and he struggled to make deliveries. (Still from BBC Three factual drama Killed By My Debt.) Dr Morag Henderson,from UCL, also tells BBC Three that she had found people in unstable work were at higher risk of mental ill health, as well as poor physical health. ""I speculate that debt might be one of the drivers of this,"" she says. ""It might be as a result of lower income or debt, it might be about low status, or just that uncertainty that people have in their income and lack of job security causing some stress."" She says that 5% of people aged 25 in 2015 - the year that Jerome started working - were on zero-hours contracts, and that there's a disproportionate number of ethnic minorities in unstable work situations. ""Even when they have the same GCSEs, the same A-levels, the same education generally, people from ethnic minority backgrounds are more likely to end up in unstable work at the age of 25,"" she says. ""So instabilities in the labour market are affecting people disproportionately."" Morag added that being on a zero-hours contract is associated witha 41% lower chance of reporting having good, very good or excellent health, compared to those not on those contracts. On the morning of 26 February 2016, Jerome receives a text from the Newlyn bailiff. It says: ""REMINDER Payment due tomorrow to prevent enforcement at warrant address which may result in seizure of assets and further charges."" After seeing the text, Jerome starts researching suicide online. ""Money and mental health are often inextricably linked,"" Paul Spencer, policy and campaigns manager for the mental health charity Mind, tells BBC Three. ""If you're struggling with your finances, or are in debt, you're likely to find that it has a negative effect on your mental health."" But, he adds, the problem is cyclical. ""Equally, if you are experiencing a period of mental ill health, you may find you're more likely to struggle to pay your bills, or get into other financial difficulties. Three times as many adults with a mental health problem report money problems than those without."" The Newlyn bailiff visits Jerome's house for a second time after not receiving the agreed repayments. This time, he clamps Jerome's bike. When Jerome tries to stop him, he calls the police to report him for allegedly breaching the peace. Jerome needs his bike to work, and has absolutely no hope of paying off his debts without it. Bailiffs are not actually allowed to seize tools of trade that are valued at less than £1,350. At this point, Newlyn has assessed Jerome's bike and valued it between £1,500 and £2,000 - although it will later be valued by Honda, the manufacturer, at just £400. Martin Rogers, parking manager at Newlyn, lateradmits at the inquestthat the company's system was only able to accurately value cars - not bikes. Jerome with his brother Nat and sister Macey on holiday (Picture: Supplied) Jerome leaves home. The bailiff, who is still waiting outside his house, is the last person to see him alive. On 8 March 2016, Jerome is found by his older brother Nat and their family friend Michael Strong. His body is found in an area of the woodlands where he used to play as a child. More than a year later, in April 2017, a coroners' court in Croydon hears about Jerome's money problems in the run-up to his death, and about the bailiff's visits. Nat tells the inquest: ""I believe he [took his own life] because he wanted to have no more debt."" The family's GP adds that Jerome hadn't had a history of depression or other mental illness. Jacqueline Devonish, the assistant coroner for south London, records a verdict of suicide. ""It's evident that he was stressed by being in debt,"" she says.

"Husnain Rashid faces a lengthy sentence, the judge has warned him An Islamic State supporter who called for jihadis to attack Prince George has admitted a string of terror charges. Husnain Rashid, 32, of Leonard Street in Nelson, Lancashire, brought his trial at Woolwich Crown Court to a halt with a dramatic change of plea. Nearly two weeks into his trial Rashid was re-indicted and pleaded guilty to three counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. He also admitted one count of encouraging terrorism. Rashid will be sentenced on 28 June at the same court for the offences spanning from October 2016 to April this year. Husnain Rashid shared Prince George's photograph in tips for would-be attackers Judge Andrew Lees told the defendant: ""For the past week I have listened to the most disturbing allegations. ""You have admitted these allegations of encouraging others to commit terrorist activities and publishing statements to encourage the killing of others. ""It is inevitable that you will receive a very lengthy prison sentence and there will be a consideration of a life prison sentence."" He added: ""The question of your future dangerousness and the protection of the public is a matter that I will have to give very careful consideration."" On 13 October Rashid used a Telegram chat group to call on supporters to target the four-year-old Prince George who had started school at Thomas's Battersea in south-west London a month earlier. Prosecutors said Rashid was encouraging terrorism by posting a photograph of the prince at the school super-imposed with silhouettes of two masked jihad fighters. Last week, prosecutor Annabel Darlow told the court ""the underlying message was clear"" that ""Prince George and other members of the royal family should be viewed as targets"". ""Even the royal family will not be left alone,"" Rashid messaged the group, before sharing the school's full address and postcode. He added: ""School starts early."" A magazine he was producing contained suggestions to strike the 2018 World Cup in Russia using vehicles, weapons or bombs. He also posted suggestions of which British football stadiums terrorists could strike following a deadly attack outside Besiktas's ground in Turkey, his trial heard. He ran a ""prolific"" Telegram channel named the Lone Mujahid where he provided an ""e-toolkit for terrorism"", the prosecution said. This allegedly included a recipe for the poison ricin and instructions for making petrol bombs and napalm. His list of targets included British Army bases, shopping centres, Jewish communities and government buildings. He also plotted with a British terrorist in Syria to bring down an aircraft with lasers, the court heard. Rashid posted a photograph of the Burmese ambassador to the UK, saying: ""You know what to do."" He urged others to ""fight and spill the blood to the apes in your land"" and called for others to ""start preparing tools and weapons/explosives"". Ms Darlow said on the first day of the trial: ""His proposals were indiscriminate and made no distinction between adult and child, between members of fighting forces and civilians."" When police swooped on his house in November, Rashid ""hurled"" a phone containing a ""treasure trove"" of evidence over a wall into an alleyway. Two charges of dissemination of a terrorist publication and one of failing to comply with a notice under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act will lie on file.

"Around 9% of students applying to universities are black Black students are more likely to have their university applications flagged for potential fraud or errors than any other ethnic group, according to data from the Ucas admissions service. Of the 5,160 forms flagged between 2013 and 2017, 52% were from black students. Ucas said it was unclear why this is the case and it would work with organisations representing ethnic minority groups to examine the issue. White students - 73% of all applicants - had 19% of flagged applications. About 16% of flagged applications were from Asian students, who made up 11% of applicants, Ucas said. Black applicants made up around 9% of all university undergraduate applicants in the period. Ucas released the figures after aninvestigation by the Independent,externallast month brought the issue to light. The details come amid increasing focus on black and minority ethnic students in higher education, and their experiences at universities and colleges. Are universities letting down black students? Wealthy students tighten university grip Ucas said a student's ethnicity was not used in any of the processes that can lead to an application being flagged. It said it would now be ""reaching out to representative organisations to strengthen the voices of Black, Asian, and minority ethnic students in our decision-making and processes"". But Labour MP David Lammy, a former minister for higher education, told the Times Ucas ""needs to be able to explain this huge disproportionality and satisfy students from ethnic minorities that their applications will be looked upon fairly."" Earlier this month,Mr Lammy was involved in a Twitter row with Oxford Universityover the number of black students it has admitted in the past three years, Ucas says its verification service aims to prevent students from gaining an unfair advantage, or a higher education place, through deception. As well as using fraud detection software, there are systems for detecting similarities and duplicates between applications, and an alerts process for universities and colleges who believe an application warrants further investigation. Ucas said about 40% of the applications flagged for concern are cancelled and this was broadly proportionate to the percentages flagged in each ethnic group - suggesting that the verification is ""generally robust and fair"". Overall, there were 2.9m university applications over the last five years. Of these, 5,160 (0.18%) had applications flagged and 2,085 (0.07%) were cancelled. Clare Marchant, Ucas's chief executive, said:  ""There is more work for us to do to ensure that flagging is as robust as it can be across all areas of the verification service. ""We've already made enhancements to our fraud detection service, introduced an additional review of applications prior to cancellation, and ensured all staff involved in verification activities have had up-to-date unconscious bias training. ""We have set out a programme of work to further review verification processes in collaboration with universities and colleges, and we will be inviting organisations that represent Black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups to work with us to help us take a thorough look at key areas of our business, to improve the experience for all applicants."" A Universities UK spokesman said: ""Ucas's fraud detection software does not look at personal information such as name, address or ethnicity, so the flags seem to be based on very specific parts of the application,"" he said. ""Where flags have been resolved following a review by Ucas staff, this should not have an impact on a university's admissions decision.""

"Carluccio's could close up to a third of its branches in a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) rescue plan. Over 90% of Carluccio's creditors approved the CVA, allowing it to close 30 loss-making restaurants. Under the plan, the company's majority owner, the Dubai-based Landmark Group, will invest Â£10m in upgrading the remaining restaurants. It joins a growing list of restaurant chains cutting back in the face of higher costs and competition. In the year to 25 September 2016, even though revenues rose 2.7%, spiralling costs meant Carluccio's pre-tax profits fell by 81% to just Â£982,000. 'Godfather of Italian cooking' dies Antonio Carluccio's last interview The company, which runs 103 restaurants across the UK, had a management shake-up in January, with a new chief executive, Mark Jones, former boss of Goals Soccer Centres, and a new chief financial officer, Andrew Campbell, from YO! Sushi. Mr Jones said: ""The positive outcome enables us to kick-start an extensive programme of reinvigoration... with the aim of elevating the guest experience and underpinned by our brand ethos of minimum of fuss, maximum of flavour, which was so passionately championed by our founder Antonio Carluccio."" Earlier this month, following a strategic review, the new team admitted that ""urgent action"" was needed to keep Carluccio's afloat. The casual dining sector of the restaurant trade has been suffering from a general fallin consumer spending. Chains have also faced higher rents and rates, as well as rising wages with the increase in the National Living Wage. Prezzo, Jamie's Italian and Byron also used CVAs to close restaurants. Italian ingredients, from prosciutto to pecorino, have become more expensive since the devaluation of the pound in 2016. Stephen Minnall, a restaurant consultant and former director of Pizza Hut, said: ""They have been caught in a perfect storm. Food costs have gone up. Dairy has gone up 10% - when you order a coffee, it's the milk that costs the money, not the coffee. ""Then the government says you have to pay a higher wage, and then the apprenticeship levy. So the answer is to start a CVA and try to reduce your rental bill."" He said that Carluccio's would be negotiating with landlords to reduce their rents and closing stores if they could not get them low enough. He said: ""It'll be a question of whether the landlords can hold their nerve. And it can get messy with different rental agreements, for instance, forcing you to pay rent until another tenant is found, or putting a shop front back to the state it was in before you got it."" Carluccio has already tried to rebrand itself several times, introducing Via Carluccio's, a grab-and-go format in Tottenham Court Road, a hotel restaurant, and serving pizza for the first time in 2016.

"Carluccio's could close up to a third of its branches in a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) rescue plan. Over 90% of Carluccio's creditors approved the CVA, allowing it to close 30 loss-making restaurants. Under the plan, the company's majority owner, the Dubai-based Landmark Group, will invest Â£10m in upgrading the remaining restaurants. It joins a growing list of restaurant chains cutting back in the face of higher costs and competition. In the year to 25 September 2016, even though revenues rose 2.7%, spiralling costs meant Carluccio's pre-tax profits fell by 81% to just Â£982,000. 'Godfather of Italian cooking' dies Antonio Carluccio's last interview The company, which runs 103 restaurants across the UK, had a management shake-up in January, with a new chief executive, Mark Jones, former boss of Goals Soccer Centres, and a new chief financial officer, Andrew Campbell, from YO! Sushi. Mr Jones said: ""The positive outcome enables us to kick-start an extensive programme of reinvigoration... with the aim of elevating the guest experience and underpinned by our brand ethos of minimum of fuss, maximum of flavour, which was so passionately championed by our founder Antonio Carluccio."" Earlier this month, following a strategic review, the new team admitted that ""urgent action"" was needed to keep Carluccio's afloat. The casual dining sector of the restaurant trade has been suffering from a general fallin consumer spending. Chains have also faced higher rents and rates, as well as rising wages with the increase in the National Living Wage. Prezzo, Jamie's Italian and Byron also used CVAs to close restaurants.

"Buying a Harley-Davidson could be more expensive if there's a trade war with the US Motorbikes, whiskey and T-shirts are among the US goods that could be hit by EU taxes if the US imposes import tariffs on steel and aluminium. The EU has drawn up a target list of 100 US goods worth â¬2.8bn ($3.5bn, Â£2.5bn), the BBC understands. The list, which also includes cosmetics, agricultural and industrial goods, was circulated to the 28 EU member governments on Monday. EU commissioners are expected to discuss the proposals on Wednesday. The EU list includes: Bourbon whiskey, orange juice Jeans, T-shirts Corn and other agricultural products Steel and industrial products Cosmetics, consumer goods, motorbikes and pleasure boats Many of the products the EU has in its sights are specifically chosen to have maximum political effect. Bourbon whiskey is produced in Kentucky, the state of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. Orange juice is a key export for Florida, a swing state in the US elections. Kamal Ahmed: Why Trump is playing tough on trade Several US companies such as Levi Strauss have already come out strongly against trade barriers. On Monday, it said: ""Unilateral tariff impositions risk retaliation and destabilizing the global economy, in which case American brands, workers and consumers will ultimately suffer."" On Monday, the EU Commissioner for Trade, Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, told the BBC: ""We are looking at possibilities to retaliate, meaning we will also put taxes or tariffs on US imports to the European Union."" She said that if the US went ahead and applied taxes to European steel, the EU would take the issue to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Ms MalmstrÃ¶m stressed that Europe was looking to respond ""to retaliate but not escalate"". This video can not be played Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, EU Commissioner for Trade But President Trump has already threatened more retaliation. On Saturday he tweeted:: ""If the EU wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on US companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the US."" What would China do in a US trade war? Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? Mr Trump has decried the ""$800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our 'very stupid' trade deals and policies"", and vowed to end it. On Thursday, he said steel imports would face a 25% tariff and aluminium 10%. Then came Saturday's threat on EU-made cars. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In January, he had already announced tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. Downing Street said that during Mrs May's call to President Trump on Sunday she raised ""our deep concern at the President's forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties' interests."" Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for China's National People's Congress, said it was natural that ""some friction will exist"" between the US and China, given the volume of trade between them surpassed $580bn (Â£420bn) last year. But he said China would take ""necessary measures"" if its interests were hurt. Canada said tariffs would cause disruption on both sides of the border. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was ""confident we're going to continue to be able to defend Canadian industry"". Brazil, Mexico and Japan, that have said they will consider retaliatory steps if the president presses ahead with his plan. A number of Republicans have questioned the wisdom of the tariff proposal and have been urging the president to reconsider. US Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has said he is ""extremely worried"" about the impact of a trade war, adding that it could undermine economic gains. Senator Orrin Hatch said American citizens would be made to pay, while Senator Ben Sasse agreed that ""kooky 18th Century protectionism will jack up prices on American families"". Jason Furman, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, told the BBC the proposed tariffs were ""a very costly and inefficient way to help a small number of people"". ""This could be bad or awful, there's no scenario under which it's good,"" he added. Orange juice could be targeted for taxes Industry bodies such as the US Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association have expressed deep concern. But steelworkers in Pennsylvania and Indiana will welcome Mr Trump's comments. President Trump hinted on Monday that if the US achieved a better deal for itself in the latest North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) he would abandon plans for a tariff on Canada's and Mexico's steel imports.

The rest of the tweet is a reference to Canada and US farmers. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin repeated that idea before a congressional panel on Tuesday, saying that he expects Mexico and Canada to be exempt from the tariffs, assuming NAFTA negotiations are successful. Substantial changes to the Nafta agreement are not likely to happen soon, however. The current round of Nafta talks, about updating the 24-year-old treaty, finished on Monday with little progress. Mr Trump has previously threatened to withdraw the United States from the pact. The US imports steel from more than 100 nations and brings in four times more steel from abroad than it exports. Since 2000, the US steel industry has suffered, with production dropping and the number of employees in steel work falling. The US is the largest export market for EU cars - making up 25% of the â¬192bn (Â£171bn; $237bn) worth of motor vehicles the bloc exported in 2016 (China was second with 16%).

"Around 9% of students applying to universities are black Black students are more likely to have their university applications flagged for potential fraud or errors than any other ethnic group, according to data from the Ucas admissions service. Of the 5,160 forms flagged between 2013 and 2017, 52% were from black students. Ucas said it was unclear why this is the case and it would work with organisations representing ethnic minority groups to examine the issue. White students - 73% of all applicants - had 19% of flagged applications. About 16% of flagged applications were from Asian students, who made up 11% of applicants, Ucas said. Black applicants made up around 9% of all university undergraduate applicants in the period. Ucas released the figures after aninvestigation by the Independent,externallast month brought the issue to light. The details come amid increasing focus on black and minority ethnic students in higher education, and their experiences at universities and colleges. Are universities letting down black students? Wealthy students tighten university grip Ucas said a student's ethnicity was not used in any of the processes that can lead to an application being flagged. It said it would now be ""reaching out to representative organisations to strengthen the voices of Black, Asian, and minority ethnic students in our decision-making and processes"". But Labour MP David Lammy, a former minister for higher education, told the Times Ucas ""needs to be able to explain this huge disproportionality and satisfy students from ethnic minorities that their applications will be looked upon fairly."" Earlier this month,Mr Lammy was involved in a Twitter row with Oxford Universityover the number of black students it has admitted in the past three years, Ucas says its verification service aims to prevent students from gaining an unfair advantage, or a higher education place, through deception. As well as using fraud detection software, there are systems for detecting similarities and duplicates between applications, and an alerts process for universities and colleges who believe an application warrants further investigation. Ucas said about 40% of the applications flagged for concern are cancelled and this was broadly proportionate to the percentages flagged in each ethnic group - suggesting that the verification is ""generally robust and fair"". Overall, there were 2.9m university applications over the last five years. Of these, 5,160 (0.18%) had applications flagged and 2,085 (0.07%) were cancelled. Clare Marchant, Ucas's chief executive, said:  ""There is more work for us to do to ensure that flagging is as robust as it can be across all areas of the verification service. ""We've already made enhancements to our fraud detection service, introduced an additional review of applications prior to cancellation, and ensured all staff involved in verification activities have had up-to-date unconscious bias training. ""We have set out a programme of work to further review verification processes in collaboration with universities and colleges, and we will be inviting organisations that represent Black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups to work with us to help us take a thorough look at key areas of our business, to improve the experience for all applicants."" A Universities UK spokesman said: ""Ucas's fraud detection software does not look at personal information such as name, address or ethnicity, so the flags seem to be based on very specific parts of the application,"" he said. ""Where flags have been resolved following a review by Ucas staff, this should not have an impact on a university's admissions decision.""

Nick began hosting the show in 2012 and earlier this week became the second-longest running breakfast show presenter in Radio 1 history. The latest official Rajar listening figures suggest 5.1 million people tuned into Grimmy at breakfast time in the first quarter of 2018 -  they were the second lowest audience figures since current records began. It was a drop of 600,000 compared to the last quarter of 2017.

""They're always front and centre and this will of course be the case on the new breakfast show. It's going to be the most enjoyable challenge I've ever undertaken and I can't wait to get started.""

"Northern services operate across the North East and North West of England Two troubled rail operators were responsible for almost 1,000 late or cancelled trains in just one day - with more services still being axed. Customers are continuing to express anger amid disruption on Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) routes. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said Northern's ""freefall"" had shown ""no signs of slowing down"". Northern and GTR said they were urgently working on ""comprehensive plans"" to improve services. Calls for Northern to lose franchise Train firm's service 'unacceptably poor' Rail boss sorry for 'rude' customer tweets The operators switched to new timetables on 20 May, and on Wednesday one in eight scheduled trains was cancelled or late. At least 147 trains were also cancelled or part-cancelled on 22 May and this had almost doubled to at least 281 on 29 May. Customers have been complaining to the companies on social media.

Lilian Greenwood, chair of the Transport Select Committee, said she would ask the committee on Monday to ""review the situation"", which may lead to a full inquiry. Mr Burnham said the fact services have ""continued to decline"" is ""nothing short of a scandal"". ""Ministers seems oblivious to the scale of this chaos and the impact this is having on people's jobs and social lives on a daily basis,"" he said. Mr Burnham and Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram havecalled for Northern to lose the franchiseif things do not improve. Cancellations at Poulton railway station in Lancashire meant people could not get to the airport on Thursday Mr Burnham has also accused Transport Secretary Chris Grayling of being ""asleep at the wheel"". He said: ""I believe he now must take personal responsibility for sorting this situation out."" Mr Grayling previously said improving Northern's train services is the Department for Transport's ""number one performance priority"". Mayor demands Northern trains inquiry Struggling to work in the north of England Reality Check: Does the North get a raw deal on rail? Northern said it has agreed actions with the DfT and is working on a plan to ""stabilise"" services. Managing director David Brown said that ""such a plan is likely to take a number of weeks to deliver lasting improvements"". There were major delays on ""Meltdown Monday"" at Manchester Piccadilly Mr Burnham spoke to Mr Grayling on a call with other political leaders in northern England. He said they were previously told it was a Network Rail issue but have now been told it is more of a shared issue between Network Rail and Northern. ""The problem with that is we've had an action plan that's been based on the wrong analysis for a week and here we are a week later with worse disruption,"" said Mr Burnham. ""I take away from this that the pain of northern commuters, I'm afraid, is not worth the same as the pain of commuters in London."" The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has also warned that the industry will suffer ""lasting and irreparable damage"" if the issues are not resolved. The union added its members working for companies including Northern and GTR were facing increasing levels of abuse from passengers because of delays and cancellations. Mr Burnham first called for an investigation into Northern's ""unacceptably poor"" serviceon 16 May.

"Silvana Tenreyo is the only female member of the Monetary Policy Committee The appointment of another male economist to the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee has drawn fire from the female chairs of two House of Commons committees. The Business Committee's Rachel Reeves called it ""truly staggering"", while Nicky Morgan, from the Treasury Committee, said she was ""disappointed"". Prof Jonathan Haskel's appointment means there is one woman on the MPC. The Treasury said the role had been awarded on merit. The department insisted it was ""committed to diversity and encouraging the broadest range of candidates"". It had ""actively contacted"" 44 women and 43 men to apply for the role. Of those, 19 men and eight women applied and four women and one man were shortlisted. It also pointed out that two of the three people on the interview panel were women. ""The final appointment decision was based on merit,"" it said. However, Ms Reeves said: ""Eight of the nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee are currently men and it is truly staggering that the Treasury has failed to appoint a woman to this role. ""The fact that four women were shortlisted shows that there are plenty of capable and well qualified women, but yet again the top jobs seem to be reserved for men."" Jonathan Haskel joins the MPC on 1 September Ms Morgan said: ""I am disappointed that the gender balance in the Monetary Policy Committee will not be improved through this appointment. ""While I welcome the fact that four women were shortlisted for this role, it is notable that the only shortlisted male candidate has been chosen."" Prof Haskel, who lectures in economics at Imperial College Business School, will replace Ian McCafferty as one of the four externally appointed members of the MPC for three years from 1 September. 'All the good women have been snapped up' Bank chief sorry for 'menopausal' gaffe Chancellor Philip Hammond said Prof Haskel's ""expertise in productivity and innovation will further sharpen the committee's understanding of the British economy"". His appointment was based on recommendations to the chancellor made by an interview panel comprising Clare Lombardelli and Richard Hughes, from the Treasury, and Dame Kate Barker, a former external member of the MPC. Sarah Smith, professor of economics at Bristol University, said Prof Haskell was ""without doubt an excellent appointment, but this leaves only one woman on the committee"". Economics suffered from ""serious under-representation of women at all levels"", she added. ""The profession is going to have to think seriously about attracting a more diverse range of people - and projecting a broader image - otherwise it is in danger of being seen as a subject that is by men and for men."" Rachel Reeves chairs the Commons Business committee Diane Coyle, professor of economics at Cambridge University, called on the Bank of England to do more to encourage women to become economists. She said it was ""hard for any interview panel to do anything other than pick the best candidate, and they've appointed a brilliant person"". However, Prof Coyle added that the ""bigger problem"" was the wider one of too few women economists: ""I'd like to see the Bank take a more prominent leadership role in addressing that in schools and universities."" Last November, the Bank'sgender pay gap report,externalrevealed that its male staff England were paid almost a quarter more than female employees. At the time, governor Mark Carney said he was confident men and women were paid equally for doing the same jobs at the Bank. ""However, the greater proportion of men than women in senior roles creates a gender pay gap,"" he admitted. ""We are working hard to address this imbalance ... addressing the disparity in gender representation at senior levels will take time, but it will help close the current gender pay gap at the Bank.""

"This video can not be played Zidane announces he is leaving Real Madrid Zinedine Zidane says he is stepping down as Real Madrid boss, five days after leading them to a third straight Champions League triumph, claiming the club needs ""a different voice"". Zidane told a news conference that ""everything changes"" and ""that's why I took this decision"". He leaves having guided the Spanish club to three successive Champions League titles and one La Liga success sincetaking overin January 2016. ""I love this club,"" he added. ""What I think is that this team needs to continue winning but I think it needs a change, a different voice, another methodology. Zidane leaves Real: What next for Champions League winners? Listen to the latest Euro Leagues Football Show podcast Champions League: Is anyone close to matching Real? ""This is the right moment for all involved - for me, for the squad, for the club."" Zidane, 45, took over after Rafael Benitez was sacked and was in charge for 149 games. He steered Real to 104 wins and 29 draws, had a 69.8% win rate, and won nine trophies. However, Real finished third in La Liga in 2017-18 - 17 points behind champions and fierce rivals Barcelona - while they were knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the quarter-final stage by Leganes. Zidanesaid in February,externalhe would walk away if he felt ""there is nothing more to give"". However, the timing of his announcement still came as a shock, just days after Real beat Liverpool 3-1 in the Champions League final. That win saw him join Bob Paisley (three at Liverpool) and Carlo Ancelotti (AC Milan two, Real Madrid one) as the only managers to have won the Champions League/European Cup three times. ""I had to do this for everyone,"" added Zidane on Thursday. Real are looking for their fourth manager in five years. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has been linked with Real in the past. The Argentine signed a newfive-year contractat Spurs last week. Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri could also come into the frame, while Arsene Wenger wants to carry on in management after leaving Arsenal after 22 years in charge. Italian Maurizio Sarri, most recently of Napoli, is also available. The decision on who will next manage Real will be made by club president Florentino Perez. He accompanied Zidane at the news conference and said he wanted to keep the France 1998 World Cup winner. ""This was a totally unexpected decision. Zidane informed me of his choice yesterday,"" added Perez. ""This is a sad day for me, for the players and for everyone involved with the club. He knows that I wanted to sign him more than anyone as a player, as well as a coach. ""I would love for him to be by my side forever."" Zindane's exit comes after Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo revealed they were contemplating their futures at the club. Wales forward Bale wasunhappy at being named as a substituteagainst Liverpool while Ronaldo said last weekend he willsoon make an announcementabout his future. Asked if his decision was anything to do with Ronaldo, Zidane said: ""No."" Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos posted a heartfelt goodbye to his manager ""It's not easy to find a coach for Real,"" the club's former president Ramon Calderon told BBC World Service. ""There are some in the market. Wenger has been offered that job many times. I know this president likes him and he was trying to offer him all the power of the club a few years ago. ""Pochettino is a good coach, no doubt he could be one of the candidates. I think Conte is free too, I don't know. ""The president will have to talk to the big players in the dressing room - Cristiano, Sergio Ramos, Marcelo. They will give their opinion too."" Hibernian manager Neil Lennon said Zidane ""is up there with the greatest managers of all time"". ""Zidane's record is amazing,"" he added. ""We thought at the time that winning back-to-back Champions Leagues was an incredible feat. ""But to do it three times in a row - we may never see that again. ""Real Madrid's transition under Zidane has been immeasurable. In the big games he has come up trumps and he has that respect from being a great player.""

"Women don't fit in, don't want the hassle, and struggle with ""complex issues"". Those are just some of the reasons given for not appointing women to FTSE company boards, according to a report on gender balance. The government-backed Hampton-Alexander Review called it shocking, while a minister branded the excuses ""pitiful"". The government wants women to make up at least a third of boards for the UK's 350 biggest companies by 2020. While the review's interim report found that things are definitely improving, some firms seem to be dragging their feet and paying only lip service to diversity. The top 10 excuses for not appointing women were: ""I don't think women fit comfortably into the board environment"" ""There aren't that many women with the right credentials and depth of experience to sit on the board - the issues covered are extremely complex"" ""Most women don't want the hassle or pressure of sitting on a board"" ""Shareholders just aren't interested in the make-up of the board, so why should we be?"" ""My other board colleagues wouldn't want to appoint a woman on our board"" ""All the 'good' women have already been snapped up"" ""We have one woman already on the board, so we are done - it is someone else's turn"" ""There aren't any vacancies at the moment - if there were I would think about appointing a woman"" ""We need to build the pipeline from the bottom - there just aren't enough senior women in this sector"" ""I can't just appoint a woman because I want to"" The explanations come from a range of FTSE 350 chairs and chief executives that were heard by the team conducting the review. Amanda Mackenzie, chief executive of Business in the Community, said: ""As you read this list of excuses you might think it's 1918, not 2018. ""It reads like a script from a comedy parody but it's true. Surely we can now tackle this once and for all."" The number of all-male FTSE 350 company boards fell from 152 in 2011 to 10 in 2017. Companies targeted over gender balance Most firms pay men more than women What's the gender pay gap at your company? However, Sir Philip Hampton, the senior City figure who is leading the review, said companies were still a long way off from meeting the 2020 target. ""We used to hear these excuses regularly a few years ago, thankfully much less so now. ""However, leaders expressing warm words of support but actually doing very little to appoint women into top jobs - or quietly blocking progress - are really not much better."" This video can not be played Fiona Hathorn worked for 16 years in the City And Business Minister Andrew Griffiths said such ""appalling"" excuses proved companies have more work to do. ""It's shocking that some businesses think these pitiful and patronising excuses are acceptable reasons to keep women from the top jobs. ""Our most successful companies are those that champion diversity."" The review is due to publish its latest figures on the number of women on FTSE 350 boards on 27 June.

"The redeveloped Stamford Bridge will be Europe's most expensive stadium at Â£1bn Chelsea's Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich has put the club's stadium plans on hold after delays to the renewal of his UK visa. The estimated cost for a new 60,000 seat Stamford Bridge has increased to Â£1bn after delays, which included adispute with a local family. Abramovich is unwilling to invest in a major project in a country where he is not allowed work. The 51-year-old's UK investor visa expired some weeks ago. In 2015, changes to the visa process mean applicants may be required to toprove the origins,externalof their wealth. But it is understood that Abramovich's decision will have no impact on the running of the football team. The delay in issuing him a new visa comes amid increased diplomatic tensions between London and Moscow after the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. The UK government has refused to comment on his individual case. Chelsea issued a statement saying the club had delayed work on Stamford Bridge because of ""the current unfavourable investment climate"". It added: ""No further pre-construction design and planning work will occur. The club does not have a time frame set for reconsideration of its decision."" Plans were under consideration to move Chelsea matches to Wembley stadium for the four years it would take to redevelop Stamford Bridge. Although the future of Wembley is in doubt after Fulham owner Shahid Khan offered Â£600m to buy the stadium from the Football Association, it is not thought to be a factor in Chelsea's decision. Christian Purslow, who left his role as managing director last year after three seasons at the club, said: ""It's been a very difficult project. Costs have skyrocketed. ""I have thought for some time it's a project that would not get off the ground. It was always an extremely marginal project financially and a very difficult project practically. I think it's a really sensible decision to put this on hold.""

Zidane, 45, took over after Rafael Benitez was sacked and was in charge for 149 games. He steered Real to 104 wins and 29 draws, had a 69.8% win rate, and won nine trophies. However, Real finished third in La Liga in 2017-18 - 17 points behind champions and fierce rivals Barcelona - while they were knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the quarter-final stage by Leganes. Zidanesaid in February,externalhe would walk away if he felt ""there is nothing more to give"". However, the timing of his announcement still came as a shock, just days after Real beat Liverpool 3-1 in the Champions League final. That win saw him join Bob Paisley (three at Liverpool) and Carlo Ancelotti (AC Milan two, Real Madrid one) as the only managers to have won the Champions League/European Cup three times. ""I had to do this for everyone,"" added Zidane on Thursday. Real are looking for their fourth manager in five years. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has been linked with Real in the past. The Argentine signed a newfive-year contractat Spurs last week. Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri could also come into the frame, while Arsene Wenger wants to carry on in management after leaving Arsenal after 22 years in charge. Italian Maurizio Sarri, most recently of Napoli, is also available. The decision on who will next manage Real will be made by club president Florentino Perez. He accompanied Zidane at the news conference and said he wanted to keep the France 1998 World Cup winner. ""This was a totally unexpected decision. Zidane informed me of his choice yesterday,"" added Perez. ""This is a sad day for me, for the players and for everyone involved with the club. He knows that I wanted to sign him more than anyone as a player, as well as a coach. ""I would love for him to be by my side forever."" Zindane's exit comes after Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo revealed they were contemplating their futures at the club. Wales forward Bale wasunhappy at being named as a substituteagainst Liverpool while Ronaldo said last weekend he willsoon make an announcementabout his future. Asked if his decision was anything to do with Ronaldo, Zidane said: ""No."" Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos posted a heartfelt goodbye to his manager ""It's not easy to find a coach for Real,"" the club's former president Ramon Calderon told BBC World Service. ""There are some in the market. Wenger has been offered that job many times. I know this president likes him and he was trying to offer him all the power of the club a few years ago. ""Pochettino is a good coach, no doubt he could be one of the candidates. I think Conte is free too, I don't know. ""The president will have to talk to the big players in the dressing room - Cristiano, Sergio Ramos, Marcelo. They will give their opinion too."" Hibernian manager Neil Lennon said Zidane ""is up there with the greatest managers of all time"". ""Zidane's record is amazing,"" he added. ""We thought at the time that winning back-to-back Champions Leagues was an incredible feat. ""But to do it three times in a row - we may never see that again.

"Women who are overweight or obese but otherwise healthy are still at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, a large study suggests. The analysis tracked the health of 90,257 women in the US for up to 30 years. Those with excess weight were likelier to have a stroke or heart attack, even if they had normal blood pressure and cholesterol and no diabetes, it found. Researchers said it showed ""healthy obesity is not a harmless condition"". Obesity affects almost all of the cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure, excess cholesterol and diabetes. But some obese people do not appear to have these metabolic disorders, leading scientists to debate whether or not the excess weight actually raises their risk. Are 22,000 children 'severely obese'? 'Fat but fit' still risk heart disease Is it wrong to be blunt about obesity? This new study found women who were overweight or obese (BMIs in excess of 25 and 30 respectively) but had none of these risk factors were 20% and 39% more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than women of a normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9) who were metabolically healthy. However, the authors said it showed an association rather than cause and effect, and was mainly in white women, meaning the findings cannot be generalised to other ethnic groups or men. ""Our large cohort study confirms that metabolically healthy obesity is not a harmless condition, and even women who remain free of metabolic diseases for decades face an increased risk of cardiovascular events,"" said Prof Matthias Schulze, from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke, who led the study. Women who were a normal weight but metabolically unhealthy were around two-and-a-half times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than women of the same weight who were metabolically healthy. That risk was even greater in women who were overweight and obese, said the study,published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal,external. Experts also found that the majority of metabolically healthy women developed either high blood pressure, excess cholesterol or diabetes as they got older, even if they were normal weight. Prof Schulze added: ""Our findings highlight the importance of preventing the development of metabolic diseases. ""They suggest that even individuals in good metabolic health may benefit from early behavioural management to improve their diet and increased physical activity in order to guard against progression to poor metabolic health."" Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, added: ""This large scale study confirms that obesity, even if unaccompanied by other warning signs, increases risk of cardiovascular disease in women."" However, Prof Carl Lavie, from the University of Queensland School of Medicine in New Orleans, who was not involved in the research, said he and colleagues had argued that ""fitness is more important than fatness"". He noted that the study did not have precise data on the participants' physical activity and their cardio fitness.

"Women don't fit in, don't want the hassle, and struggle with ""complex issues"". Those are just some of the reasons given for not appointing women to FTSE company boards, according to a report on gender balance. The government-backed Hampton-Alexander Review called it shocking, while a minister branded the excuses ""pitiful"". The government wants women to make up at least a third of boards for the UK's 350 biggest companies by 2020. While the review's interim report found that things are definitely improving, some firms seem to be dragging their feet and paying only lip service to diversity. The top 10 excuses for not appointing women were: ""I don't think women fit comfortably into the board environment"" ""There aren't that many women with the right credentials and depth of experience to sit on the board - the issues covered are extremely complex"" ""Most women don't want the hassle or pressure of sitting on a board"" ""Shareholders just aren't interested in the make-up of the board, so why should we be?"" ""My other board colleagues wouldn't want to appoint a woman on our board"" ""All the 'good' women have already been snapped up"" ""We have one woman already on the board, so we are done - it is someone else's turn"" ""There aren't any vacancies at the moment - if there were I would think about appointing a woman"" ""We need to build the pipeline from the bottom - there just aren't enough senior women in this sector"" ""I can't just appoint a woman because I want to"" The explanations come from a range of FTSE 350 chairs and chief executives that were heard by the team conducting the review. Amanda Mackenzie, chief executive of Business in the Community, said: ""As you read this list of excuses you might think it's 1918, not 2018. ""It reads like a script from a comedy parody but it's true. Surely we can now tackle this once and for all."" The number of all-male FTSE 350 company boards fell from 152 in 2011 to 10 in 2017. Companies targeted over gender balance Most firms pay men more than women What's the gender pay gap at your company? However, Sir Philip Hampton, the senior City figure who is leading the review, said companies were still a long way off from meeting the 2020 target. ""We used to hear these excuses regularly a few years ago, thankfully much less so now. ""However, leaders expressing warm words of support but actually doing very little to appoint women into top jobs - or quietly blocking progress - are really not much better."" This video can not be played Fiona Hathorn worked for 16 years in the City And Business Minister Andrew Griffiths said such ""appalling"" excuses proved companies have more work to do. ""It's shocking that some businesses think these pitiful and patronising excuses are acceptable reasons to keep women from the top jobs. ""Our most successful companies are those that champion diversity."" The review is due to publish its latest figures on the number of women on FTSE 350 boards on 27 June.

"On Wednesday, more than 400 Thameslink trains were cancelled A rail firm that compared its poor service to chocolate from Poundland has been threatened with legal action by the discount chain. Thameslink has apologised after making the comment in reply to a passenger who was angry over train cancellations. In response, Poundland retail director Austin Cooke said it had ""no right to use our name to describe poor service"". It comes after more than 450 Govia Thameslink Railway trains were either cancelled or ran late on Wednesday. Thameslink had responded to a tweet from a passenger, called Kevin, who posted a picture of a departure board showing train cancellations. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Nick Grimshaw announces Radio 1 Breakfast Show exit Nick Grimshaw is stepping down from the Radio 1 Breakfast Show - and will be replaced by Greg James. The presenter is ending his nearly six-year stint on the show and will move to Greg's 4-7pm slot on the station. Grimmy said he's had the ""time of his life"" but has decided it's ""time for a change and a new show"". Greg added: ""It really doesn't get any bigger than this and I really want to build on the great work Grimmy has done."" Grimmy: My top Radio 1 Breakfast Show moments Greg James is taking over the Radio 1 Breakfast Show The news was announced on the breakfast show on Thursday when Greg joined Grimmy in the studio. ""The prophet J Hus said it best when he said: 'I ain't had a good night's sleep since God knows when',"" Grimmy said. ""I've had jetlag for six years. It has been a ride, but now I feel slightly sick, so we need to get off the ride."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nick began hosting the show in 2012 and earlier this week became the second-longest running breakfast show presenter in Radio 1 history. The latest official Rajar listening figures suggest 5.1 million people tuned into Grimmy at breakfast time in the first quarter of 2018 -  they were the second lowest audience figures since current records began. It was a drop of 600,000 compared to the last quarter of 2017. Greg James: New show is not for the critics Nick said: ""It was always my dream to do the breakfast show and I'm very grateful that I got to live my dream every day for what will be nearly six years. ""But six years is a long time and this isn't a forever job. I had the time of my life. I've decided it's time for a change and a new show."" He said he loves Radio 1 and can't wait to start his new show in the drivetime slot and remove ""all alarms from my house"". Nick has presented the breakfast show for five years and 250 days Nick took over from Chris Moyles on the breakfast show. He'd previously presented the station's late night programme. He added: ""I'm so happy to be swapping shows with my friend and yours, Greg James, and can't wait to wake up to him each morning. Not literally. Just on the radio. Unless he's up for it."" Greg also hosts BBC One's Sounds Like Friday Night with 1Xtra's Dotty Greg is the current presenter of the drivetime show and was first on air on Radio 1 the day after he graduated from university. He said he was ""beside myself"" to be given the chance to present the ""most famous radio show in the world"". He added: ""The listeners have become like mates during the ten years I've been on air, so to be there when they wake up is a real honour. ""They're always front and centre and this will of course be the case on the new breakfast show. It's going to be the most enjoyable challenge I've ever undertaken and I can't wait to get started."" The pair will start their new shows on Radio 1 in autumn - but fans of both presenters have already been sharing their thoughts on the job swap. Allow Twitter content?

"The US holds terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay without charging them European judges have ruled that Lithuania and Romania violated the rights of two al-Qaeda terror suspects by allowing the CIA to torture them. The US captured Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri after the September 2001 attacks in the US and they are now at the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba. The CIA operated secret prisons, including in Lithuania and Romania. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) said both countries had violated the European prohibition of torture. The ECHRissued a similar ruling against Poland in 2014. Lithuania and Romania were ordered to pay â¬100,000 (Â£88,000; $117,000) in damages each to Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Nashiri, respectively. The ECHR was unable to visit the suspects at Guantanamo. The existence of the so-called CIA ""black sites"" for interrogation - under the so-called ""secret rendition"" policy - was kept secret for many years after 9/11. Abu Zubaydah, a stateless Palestinian born in Saudi Arabia, is thought to have been al-Qaeda's chief recruiter in the 1990s, and later became a key organiser, linking Osama Bin Laden to other al-Qaeda cells. Saudi-born Abd al-Nashiri led al-Qaeda's operations in the Gulf region, according to US intelligence. He allegedly masterminded the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000, which left 17 dead. Read more on the US 'war on terror' against al-Qaeda: CIA lied over 'brutal' interrogations CIA report: An expert guide Who were the CIA's al-Qaeda detainees? The new CIA boss's torture ties The ECHR ruling said Romania hosted a CIA prison in 2003-2005, where Abd al-Nashiri was subjected to ""an extremely harsh detention regime"". The ruling said he suffered ""inhuman treatment... which Romania had enabled by co-operating with the CIA"". This photo of Abu Zubaydah was released this year The same verdict was issued against Lithuania, concerning Abu Zubaydah. The CIA prison in Lithuania operated in 2005-2006. Article Three of the European Convention on Human Rights, headed ""Prohibition of Torture"",external, says: ""No-one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."" The ruling said the suspects were not subject to the harshest interrogation techniques in Lithuania and Romania - that happened in other prisons. But both countries had helped the CIA and failed to properly investigate the prisoners' conditions. The judges cited CIA documents, according to which terror suspects were subjected to blindfolding or hooding, solitary confinement, the continuous use of leg shackles, and excessive exposure to noise and light. Both Lithuania and Romania had enabled the CIA to transfer the suspects to other prisons, exposing them to ""a foreseeable serious risk of further ill-treatment"". By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent Today's ruling by the ECHR is an uncomfortable reminder of past practices that are now, rightly, seen as abhorrent and unacceptable. In the years immediately following the 9/11 attacks, there was enormous pressure on many countries' intelligence agencies to find out where the next big al-Qaeda attack would come from. This led to a ""gloves off"" approach to interrogation by the CIA and other agencies, with the encouragement of the George W Bush administration in the White House at the time. Intelligence officers have since spoken about their unease at what they were being asked to do, but it was said there was a pervading atmosphere that if ""enhanced interrogation"" of suspects could save American lives, then it was worth bending the rules. President Obama put a stop to this, banning the practice of water boarding, which has been condemned as tantamount to torture. The US military allows very little access to prisoners at Guantanamo In 2014the US Senate Intelligence Committee issued a detailed reporton the CIA's controversial ""war on terror"" interrogation programme and the ""black sites"". It said al-Qaeda suspects were subjected to repeated waterboarding, slapping, stress positions and sleep deprivation. Waterboarding is simulated drowning and was condemned as torture by the Barack Obama administration. Abu Zubaydahwas kept confined in a coffin-sized box for hours on end, the report said. Andaccording to the US Justice Department, the CIA used waterboarding at least 83 times,externalin August 2002 against Abu Zubaydah, the New York Times reported. He is thought to have been a top al-Qaeda operative who ran training camps in Afghanistan, where some of the 9/11 suicide hijackers trained. The ECHR says the evidence shows that Abu Zubaydah was caught in Pakistan in March 2002 and was first moved to a CIA prison in Thailand. He was flown to another ""black site"" in Poland in December 2002. He is believed to have been held in Lithuania from February 2005 to March 2006, when he was moved to Afghanistan and then to Guantanamo Bay. Abd al-Nashirifaces a possible US death penalty, as military prosecutors have accused him over the USS Cole bombing and some other terror attacks. He allegedly also fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan. Arrested in Dubai in 2002, he was held in CIA ""black sites"" in Afghanistan and Thailand. In December 2002 he was moved to another ""black site"" in Poland, and held there until June 2003, the ECHR says. He is believed to have been held in Romania from April 2004 to October/November 2005, before his transfer to Guantanamo Bay in September 2006.

"Until recently, Kim Yong-chol (left) was blacklisted in the United States The right-hand man to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have concluded two days of talks in New York. Gen Kim Yong-chol flew from China on Wednesday to discuss a historic summit between the two nation's leaders. He is the most senior North Korean to visit the US in nearly 20 years. US President Donald Trump has told reporters he expects Gen Kim to come to Washington DC on Friday and deliver a letter from Kim Jong-un. Speaking aboard Air Force One on his way to Texas, Mr Trump said the envoy will ""be coming most likely tomorrow to the White House to present me with a letter from Kim Jong-un"". President Trump cancelled the 12 June summit, but both sides have since made fresh efforts to revive the plan. Scheduled to happen in Singapore, the historic meeting between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un would be the first between sitting US and North Korean leaders. Thursday's talks concluded early due to progress being made, a US state department official said. Mr Pompeo tweeted after the meeting that the talks had been ""substantive"". Allow Twitter content?

North Korea has strongly objected to statements by Trump administration members comparing North Korean denuclearisation to Libya's. Former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi gave up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders confirmed the US and North Korean leaders still planned to meet next month. ""As the president says, if it happens, we'll certainly be ready,"" she said. They met in an apartment on New York's East Side By Barbara Plett Usher, BBC state department correspondent in New York Just months ago the idea that this powerful North Korean official could visit New York was unthinkable. Until recently Kim Yong-chol was blacklisted in the US. A senior state department official said he and Mr Pompeo were trying to get to know each other after initial meetings in Pyongyang earlier this year. But he also said they needed to reduce the gap between them over the extent and pace of nuclear disarmament before the summit could go ahead. He also acknowledged that the US had to find a way to convince the North Korean leadership it would be secure without such weapons. But this high-level meeting shows that President Trump and Kim Jong-un want the summit to take place, and therefore many believe these two men will find a way to make it happen. North Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui has also met Sung Kim, a former US ambassador to South Korea, at Panmunjom on the border between the two Koreas. The two diplomats have faced one another before during previous denuclearisation negotiations. This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on In Singapore itself, a US team led by White House official Joe Hagin is thought to be meeting Kim Chang-son, the de facto chief of staff to the North Korean leader, to talk about logistics.

"Husnain Rashid faces a lengthy sentence, the judge has warned him An Islamic State supporter who called for jihadis to attack Prince George has admitted a string of terror charges. Husnain Rashid, 32, of Leonard Street in Nelson, Lancashire, brought his trial at Woolwich Crown Court to a halt with a dramatic change of plea. Nearly two weeks into his trial Rashid was re-indicted and pleaded guilty to three counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. He also admitted one count of encouraging terrorism. Rashid will be sentenced on 28 June at the same court for the offences spanning from October 2016 to April this year. Husnain Rashid shared Prince George's photograph in tips for would-be attackers Judge Andrew Lees told the defendant: ""For the past week I have listened to the most disturbing allegations. ""You have admitted these allegations of encouraging others to commit terrorist activities and publishing statements to encourage the killing of others. ""It is inevitable that you will receive a very lengthy prison sentence and there will be a consideration of a life prison sentence."" He added: ""The question of your future dangerousness and the protection of the public is a matter that I will have to give very careful consideration."" On 13 October Rashid used a Telegram chat group to call on supporters to target the four-year-old Prince George who had started school at Thomas's Battersea in south-west London a month earlier. Prosecutors said Rashid was encouraging terrorism by posting a photograph of the prince at the school super-imposed with silhouettes of two masked jihad fighters. Last week, prosecutor Annabel Darlow told the court ""the underlying message was clear"" that ""Prince George and other members of the royal family should be viewed as targets"". ""Even the royal family will not be left alone,"" Rashid messaged the group, before sharing the school's full address and postcode. He added: ""School starts early."" A magazine he was producing contained suggestions to strike the 2018 World Cup in Russia using vehicles, weapons or bombs. He also posted suggestions of which British football stadiums terrorists could strike following a deadly attack outside Besiktas's ground in Turkey, his trial heard. He ran a ""prolific"" Telegram channel named the Lone Mujahid where he provided an ""e-toolkit for terrorism"", the prosecution said. This allegedly included a recipe for the poison ricin and instructions for making petrol bombs and napalm. His list of targets included British Army bases, shopping centres, Jewish communities and government buildings. He also plotted with a British terrorist in Syria to bring down an aircraft with lasers, the court heard. Rashid posted a photograph of the Burmese ambassador to the UK, saying: ""You know what to do."" He urged others to ""fight and spill the blood to the apes in your land"" and called for others to ""start preparing tools and weapons/explosives"". Ms Darlow said on the first day of the trial: ""His proposals were indiscriminate and made no distinction between adult and child, between members of fighting forces and civilians."" When police swooped on his house in November, Rashid ""hurled"" a phone containing a ""treasure trove"" of evidence over a wall into an alleyway. Two charges of dissemination of a terrorist publication and one of failing to comply with a notice under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act will lie on file.

"Unarranged overdraft fees can cost borrowers up to seven times more than a payday loan, a consumer group warned. Which? said ""sky-high"" fees could add up to thousands of pounds a year, hitting those who can least afford them the hardest. It called on the Financial Conduct Authority, which agrees charges are often ""too high"", to impose limits. A group representing UK banks said overdrafts offered customers a ""short-term solution"". Which? compared the cost of borrowing Â£100 for 30 days in an unarranged overdraft across 16 high street banks with borrowing the same amount through a payday loan. It found that 13 of the banks investigated charged more than a payday lender - with some costing considerably more. The consumer group called the findings alarming and urged the FCA to ""finally end this unfair practice"". Which is calling for the charges for unarranged overdrafts to be reduced to the same level as arranged overdrafts. Gareth Shaw, Which? money expert, said: ""The regulator cannot drag its heels any longer."" In 2015 the FCA capped payday loan costs at Â£24 a day following criticisms they left poor families with crippling debts. A spokesman for UK Finance, which represents UK banks, said an unarranged overdraft could be a ""short-term solution to smooth cashflow"". ""An unarranged overdraft might arise where customers have miscalculated their finances, although we would always encourage them to contact their bank to arrange an overdraft and minimise costs,"" he said. ""Text alerts can help customers take action if they are going overdrawn and lenders are working on a series of measures to help those who regularly use their overdraft."" The FCA has been examining the high-cost credit market and will publish a report next week. It said overdraft fees could be ""unreasonable"" and that the market ""may need fundamental reform"". However, it said any reforms must not affect those who rely on overdrafts for day-to-day banking.

Gen Kim Yong-chol flew from China on Wednesday to discuss a historic summit between the two nation's leaders. He is the most senior North Korean to visit the US in nearly 20 years. US President Donald Trump has told reporters he expects Gen Kim to come to Washington DC on Friday and deliver a letter from Kim Jong-un. Speaking aboard Air Force One on his way to Texas, Mr Trump said the envoy will ""be coming most likely tomorrow to the White House to present me with a letter from Kim Jong-un"". President Trump cancelled the 12 June summit, but both sides have since made fresh efforts to revive the plan. Scheduled to happen in Singapore, the historic meeting between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un would be the first between sitting US and North Korean leaders.

North Korea has strongly objected to statements by Trump administration members comparing North Korean denuclearisation to Libya's. Former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi gave up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders confirmed the US and North Korean leaders still planned to meet next month. ""As the president says, if it happens, we'll certainly be ready,"" she said. They met in an apartment on New York's East Side By Barbara Plett Usher, BBC state department correspondent in New York Just months ago the idea that this powerful North Korean official could visit New York was unthinkable. Until recently Kim Yong-chol was blacklisted in the US. A senior state department official said he and Mr Pompeo were trying to get to know each other after initial meetings in Pyongyang earlier this year. But he also said they needed to reduce the gap between them over the extent and pace of nuclear disarmament before the summit could go ahead. He also acknowledged that the US had to find a way to convince the North Korean leadership it would be secure without such weapons. But this high-level meeting shows that President Trump and Kim Jong-un want the summit to take place, and therefore many believe these two men will find a way to make it happen. North Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui has also met Sung Kim, a former US ambassador to South Korea, at Panmunjom on the border between the two Koreas. The two diplomats have faced one another before during previous denuclearisation negotiations.

"General Kim Yong-chol is a controversial but key figure in North Korean diplomacy North Korean general Kim Yong-chol is reportedly heading to Washington DC via Beijing as part of preparations for a second summit between North Korea and the United States. The General's trip to the US continues a series of remarkable developments after a year of surprises surrounding Korean diplomacy in 2018. He is often referred to as Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un's right-hand man and is notionally forbidden to travel to the US, having been twice sanctioned by Washington. But he has been at his leader's side at key summit meetings in 2018 and 2019, and his second visit to America this week highlights his importance to Pyongyang's diplomatic efforts. During his time as North Korea's military intelligence chief, Gen Kim was accused of masterminding attacks on the South Korean warship Cheonan and on Yeonpyeong Island in 2010. He is also linked to the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures in 2014 and led the country's delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics closing ceremony in South Korea's Pyeongchang. General Kim is his Supreme Leader's right hand man at the Inter-Korean Summit in April General Kim Yong-chol emerged as a key player in North Korean diplomacy in 2018. Despite having the same surname, he is not related to the country's Supreme Leader. He was at Kim Jong-un's side in all of his high-profile summits since 2018, including the June summit with Trump in Singapore and the North Korean leader's latest visit to Beijing in January 2019. He was also a member of the welcoming party for US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visits to Pyongyang in May and October 2018, and met Mr Pompeo and Mr Trump when he visited the United States in June before the first North Korea-US summit. Amid stalled talks on denuclearisation, another meeting between Kim Yong-chol and Mr Pompeo was planned in New York for November, but was cancelled abruptly. The former spy chief's current official position is vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, but he rose to prominence as Pyongyang's chief military negotiator during inter-Korean talks between 2006 and 2008. He later served as the director of the General Reconnaissance Bureau, tasked with cyber-warfare and gathering foreign intelligence, from 2009 to 2016. In 2016, he took charge of the United Front Department, the civilian intelligence agency which supposedly operates pro-North Korean groups in South Korea and handles inter-Korean affairs. Soon after this appointment, however, he was reportedly sent for ""ideological re-education"" as punishment for an ""overbearing attitude"", according to South Korean daily JoongAng Ilbo. He retained his posts despite the punishment, and his rise to prominence in 2018 shows he is now clearly very much in favour and a valued adviser to Kim Jong-un. Kim Yong-chol celebrates the performance of a South Korean art troupe in Pyongyang Gen Kim's re-emergence in 2018 was initially met with hostility in South Korea, where he's accused of being a key figure in the 2010 sinking of the South Korean naval corvette Cheonan. North Korea vehemently denies any involvement in the torpedoing of the ship, in which 46 sailors died. The Cheonan naval corvette was sunk by a torpedo He was also reported to be involved in the 2014 Sony hack in response to the comedy film The Interview, which mocked Kim Jong-un. Gen Kim's alleged role in past events led to protests from conservative forces in South Korea before the 2018 Winter Olympics when it emerged that he would visit. ""We absolutely oppose a visit to the South by Kim Yong-chol, the main culprit of the Cheonan's sinking,"" said Kim Sung-tae, then floor leader of the opposition Liberty Korea Party. The party's statement also said that Kim Yong-chol deserved ""death by beating"" and called on the government to block the visit. Kim Yong-chol led North Korea's delegation to the Winter Olympic closing ceremony However, South Korea's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon stated that in the name of the relaxing of tensions between the two Koreas, there would be no restrictions on his travel for the Olympics. He has since stood on South Korean soil for a second time, crossing the border with Kim Jong-un as part of the inter-Korean summit delegation in April 2018.

However, South Korea's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon has clarified that there are no restrictions on his travel to the Olympics.

Seoul's Unification Ministry, however, said that ""there is a limitation in pinpointing who was responsible for the [Cheonan] incident"", despite the fact Gen Kim led the reconnaissance bureau at the time. General Kim's links to attacks on the South has caused anger Despite conservative protests, the South Korean government has welcomed his visit amid improving inter-Korean relations and hopes for an Olympics-inspired detente.

"NHS trusts in England have reported a combined financial deficit that was nearly twice the amount planned. There was a deficit of Â£960m in the last financial year compared with the Â£496m they had planned for, the regulator NHS Improvement said. Acute hospitals were largely responsible, mainly because of increased patient demand, it said. All other providers, including ambulance and mental health trusts, had collectively underspent, it added. The latest reported deficit is reached after taking account of extra financial support provided by the government. NHS 'dangerously' short of 100,000 staff May backs long-term funding plan for NHS Therefore, the Nuffield Trust think tank argued that the true underlying figure was much worse, as the finances had to be patched up with one-off savings and emergency extra cash. Senior policy analyst Sally Gainsbury said: ""Given the huge pressures on NHS providers, it is not at all surprising that the reported deficit for 2017-18 is Â£960m. ""As we have previously warned, there is a widening gap between what we are asking the NHS to do and what we are funding it to do."" Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents various services, said a 5% annual increase in NHS funding is needed to match European levels of care. He told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""Everywhere you look you get a sense of the NHS under real pressure."" He said his proposed funding increase equates to an extra 9p on income tax or 7% on VAT, adding: ""We need to be realistic about what the nation can afford."" Janet Davies, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ""Theresa May and Philip Hammond cannot allow this financial knife-edge to continue. ""Whether the chancellor announces the extra funding in time for the NHS anniversary this summer or waits until the autumn Budget, it must be both substantial and genuinely new money."" The report also highlighted that more than 2,600 patients were waiting longer than 12 months for non-urgent treatment in March - a 75% increase over the year before. And half of the nation's 10 ""best performing"" accident and emergency departments were unable to meet waiting time standards in January, February and March, according to the latest quarterly performance figures. NHS Improvement said acute hospitals had faced a surge in demand within A&E, particularly over the winter months. Some also spent more to cover vacancies and sickness absence. It pointed out that 156 of the 234 trusts finished the year either reaching or exceeding their financial targets. Chief executive Ian Dalton added: ""Despite epic challenges, NHS staff up and down the country displayed incredible resilience and saw more patients than ever before within four hours. ""More than two-thirds of providers ended the year on budget or better than planned. Given rising demand and record vacancies, this is an important achievement."" Ministers have promised a new long-term financial plan for the NHS, which is expected within weeks. In March, Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted toget away from annual ""cash top-ups""and would come up with a blueprint later this year to allow the NHS ""to plan for the future"".

Alice Marie Johnson Johnson was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1996 for a first-time, non-violent drug offence. She was convicted for her role, along with 15 others, in a large cocaine distribution ring in Tennessee. According to her family and supporters, Johnson has been a model inmate who is active in many programmes, including work in the prison hospice. She fitted all of the criteria for former President Barack Obama's Clemency Project 2014, but was denied just days before the end of his term. ""This is the last time I'll put my family through the heartache of expectations,"" Johnson told the BBC at the time. Despite that, Mrs Kardashian West's interest appears to have revitalised the effort. Amy Povah, the founder of CAN-DO Clemency, has been advocating for Johnson's release since 2014 and says she has helped collect signatures from 70 organisations who support the pardon, as well as a letter of support from the retired warden of Johnson's prison. All of that material may be submitted to President Trump. ""She's always stood out to me as being exceptional,"" says Ms Povah. ""She's not bitter or angry, she's this ray of sunshine."" The pardon process is entirely up to the president's discretion, and it is unknown at this point whether he plans to announce a decision to coincide with Mrs Kardashian West's visit. Johnson's daughters remain hopeful that - at least for their family - the long wait may soon be over. ""We are praying for mercy in my mom's caseâ¦ that this nightmare is finally coming to an end,"" Tretessa Johnson told the BBC. Many on social media have been critical of Mrs Kardashian West's unlikely role as a prison reform advocate and say there are thousands of cases that deserve closer examination. Some have questioned her credentials to speak on the subject, suggesting there are more qualified people who should have met Mr Trump. Allow Twitter content?

"The BBC is promoting the trial as providing the ""best ever picture quality"" iPlayer has offered The BBC is to stream dozens of World Cup matches live in 4K resolution and high dynamic range colour (HDR) to UK-based audiences in June and July. It will mark the first time iPlayer has covered one of the major sporting events in such quality. However, it will limit the number of screens with access, and will do so on a first-come first-served basis. The BBC also plans a separate virtual reality experience. One expert said the newshad been highly anticipated.,external ""There had been a couple of earlier trials that had not been highly publicised, but now everyone who has compatible equipment should be able to see some of the best picture quality made available via a terrestrial broadcast,"" commented Andy Madden, content editor at What Hi-Fi? magazine. ""They should see a marked improvement in detail and a brighter, punchier picture than they had previously."" The term 4K - which is sometimes referred to as being ultra-high definition (UHD) - refers to the fact that an image contains four times as many pixels as a 1080p high definition picture. This can reveal details that would otherwise be obscure - including the notes written on a yellow or red card, or the time on a referee's watch. The World Cup runs from 14 June to 15 July The bigger the screen and/or the closer its audience is, the more obvious the enhancement provided. Many people, however, have found that it is HDR that provides the biggest ""wow factor"". The technology takes advantage of the fact modern TVs can go brighter and/or darker than they used to, providing a greater dynamic range. As result, the shadows of an image can be made less murky while the highlights - including glints of light reflected off metal or water - can be given more impact. World Cup 2018 fixtures and schedule How to follow the World Cup on the BBC HDR is also accompanied by the adoption of a ""wider colour space"", meaning millions more colours can be displayed than had been the case before. BT began screening live sport in 4K in 2015, and Sky followed a year later, but neither do so in HDR. The BBC is able to, thanks to the development of a new type of HDR called hybrid-log gamma (HLG), which has been created in conjunction with the Japanese broadcaster NHK. As an added benefit, footage will be played at 50 frames per second rather than the normal 25fps. All 29 of BBC One's World Cup matches are scheduled to be made available in 4K and HDR. But each will be limited to ""tens of thousands of people"" - the exact number of iPlayer-equipped devices has not been specified in advance. Compatible devices will offer access to the 4K HDR streams via iPlayer's home screen To gain access, viewers must be among the first to click on the relevant home screen button just after each stream starts. To enjoy the optimum experience, the BBC says audiences will need a 40 megabit per second (Mbit/s) internet connection - which is faster than that to which most households have access. Those with slower download speeds may find they are provided a lower-resolution image. BBC engineers first trialled the tech involved in public in April, when they streamed a rugby league match between York City Knights and Catalans Dragons. More recently, they streamed the second half of the FA Cup final between Chelsea and Manchester United. However, neither event was publicised in advance, so attracted a much smaller audience than the forthcoming competition in Russia should deliver. In addition, the BBC plans to offer live virtual reality views of 33 games via a dedicated app, that will take account of the viewers' head movements. It will be made available closer to the time on iOS and  Android devices, as well as the Gear VR, Oculus Go and PlayStation VR headsets. It will allow users to switch location to get the view from a ""luxury private box"" on high or from behind either of the two goals. A VR view of the games will be provided via a computer-generated luxury box While many experts see 4K and HDR as a natural evolution of today's normal broadcasts, there are doubts as to whether VR will become mainstream in the same way. Sales of dedicated headsets have been weaker than originally forecast and compelling content has been limited - often because of the added cost involved in creating it. If done well, live sports coverage could help drive demand, but the risk is that it feels like a gimmick. ""Virtual reality is still in its infancy and has still to catch on with the masses,"" commented Mr Madden. ""But it's an interesting way for people to see the World Cup.""

"Football matches can generate plastic waste, particularly from catering operations Football leagues in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are being urged to stop using single-use plastic. A House of Commons committee has written to the chairmen of the four leagues to encourage them to follow the example of England's Premier League. It plans to phase out single-use plastics in its operations and supply chains over the next two years. Plastic cups, bottles, bags, stirrers, trays and cutlery are all by-products of football matches. The English Football League has 72 member clubs and is the single largest body of professional clubs in European football. Labour MP Mary Creagh, who chairs the Environmental Audit Committee, has called on club chairmen to ""mobilise the power of sport"" in moving away from single-use plastic. She also asked whether each league had considered introducing a bottle return scheme. ""Plastic litter ruins our streets, chokes our seas and endangers wildlife,"" she said. ""We all need to do our bit to tackle the scourge of plastic pollution. ""There is a huge opportunity for sports organisations to reduce the use of throwaway plastic at matches and encourage fans to reduce, reuse and recycle. I want the UK's football leagues to show leadership on this issue."" It comes after a series of announcements by the UK government and businesses to tackle the issue of plastic waste. More than 40 companies have signed up to a pact to cut plastic pollution over the next seven years. The firms, which include Coca-Cola and Asda, have promised to honour a number of pledges such as eliminating single-use packaging through better design. They have joined the government, trade associations and campaigners to form the UK Plastics Pact. The signatories are responsible for more than 80% of plastic packaging on products sold through UK supermarkets. One of the promises which companies, such as consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble and Marks & Spencer, have signed up to is to make 100% of plastic packaging ready for recycling or composting by 2025.

"Parent groups have only been behind about one in five of the free schools that have been opened, say researchers. The flagship policy, launched under the coalition government, was meant to bring innovation and more parental choice to schools in England. But Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, which carried out the free school study, said ""very few are fulfilling that original purpose"". The Department for Education said free schools were raising standards. The study, from the Sutton Trust social mobility charity and the National Foundation for Educational Research, says new free schools are now much more likely to be created by expanding academy trusts. Free schools, the first of which opened in 2011, operate outside of local authority networks and were intended to be an innovative response to the demands of local parents. The study examined more than 300 created until autumn 2017. Initially, about 40% were opened with parent groups - but since 2015, that has fallen to below 20% at secondary level. In primary and all-through schools - those that teach youngsters of all ages - it is down to just 4%. ""In reality, the free school programme has been a vehicle by which new schools are opened by academy chains,"" says the study. Since 2015, almost four in five of the new free schools have been set up by academy trusts. They are also less likely to have a ""distinctive mission"" than other schools - and the report says the government needs to explain what it now sees as the purpose of free schools. The analysis also found: At secondary level, pupils at free schools perform slightly better They have ""largely been set up in areas with a need for more school places"" Free schools have a higher proportion of ethnic minority pupils compared with other school types in their local catchment areas In secondary schools, the over-representation of ethnic minority pupils is driven by faith free schools There has been a growth in non-Christian faith schools, such as Muslim, Jewish and Sikh They have a slightly lower proportion of disadvantaged pupils, but poorer pupils in free schools do better than their peers in other schools The report says that if free schools are now very likely to be part of academy chains, with few other distinctive features, there needs to be more clarity about how they are funded and supervised and to make sure they represent ""value for public money"". There had been a presumption that all new schools would have to be free schools. But this effective monopoly could change, as the Education Secretary Damian Hinds has announced that councils could open new faith schools, classified as ""voluntary aided"" rather than free. The next wave of about 35 free schools is going to bedirected towards the lowest-performing areasof England, particularly the North East. Toby Young, founder of the West London Free School, said that even though this might be seen as a critical report, it showed that free schools were serving deprived and ethnic minority pupils. ""Turns out, these schools are not just benefiting middle-class children,"" he added. ""But most strikingly of all, the report found that children from deprived backgrounds at free schools do much better than their counterparts at other types of school. To be precise, disadvantaged pupils get higher grades in three out of eight GCSEs."" Carole Willis, chief executive of the National Foundation for Educational Research, said: ""The government's free schools programme has not been very successful at bringing innovation to the education system and encouraging more parents and teachers to set up new schools"". ""If the government is still committed to the programme's original purpose then it should review and clarify the mission of free schools."" Kevin Courtney, co-leader of the National Education Union, said the free school programme had so far cost Â£3.6bn, and the report showed the ""notion of increased parental choice"" had been ""simply smoke and mirrors"". Mark Lehain, the interim director of the New Schools Network - which promotes the opening of free schools - said: ""As a parent and founder of a free school, I know how much the policy has allowed local communities to get the schools they want. ""Free schools are still the best way for innovation to flourish and voices of the community to be heard."" The Department for Education said that free schools were part of its efforts to raise standards - and that 84% of those inspected were rated either good or outstanding. ""We are now inviting applications for more free schools and will prioritise those proposals that want to set up in areas with the lowest educational performance and greatest need for more good school places,"" said a DFE spokeswoman.

"This video can not be played Back from the dead? The authorities in Ukraine have been sharply criticised for faking the murder of a Russian dissident journalist in Kiev. An official from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said Ukraine was spreading ""false information"". Reporters Without Borders said it was ""part of an information war"". Ukraine said it had acted to foil a Russian plot to kill Arkady Babchenko. Moscow said it was a provocation. Babchenko, a 41-year-old critic of the Kremlin, sprang a major surprise when he arrived at a press conference in Kiev on Wednesday - the day after he was reported dead. The head of Ukraine's security service, Vasyl Hrytsak, said an elaborate sting operation had been set up to catch hitmen paid by Russian forces. Police reported making one arrest. Relations between Kiev and Moscow have been tense since Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014 and was accused of covertly backing rebels in the bloody conflict in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine was accused of undermining the credibility of journalists. Harlem Desir, the OSCE's representative on the freedom of the media, said: ""I deplore the decision to spread false information on the life of a journalist. It is the duty of the state to provide correct information to the public."" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko (left) met Arkady Babchenko on Wednesday ""Reporters Without Borders expresses its sharp indignation on learning of the Ukrainian secret service's manipulation carried out as part of an information war,"" said Christophe Deloire, the group's head. ""It is always very dangerous for states to play with facts and especially on the backs of journalists."" The dangers faced by journalists worldwide Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova described the Ukrainian operation as ""a masquerade"" done for ""propagandistic effect"". Babchenko's wife said on Tuesdayshe had found her husband at the entrance to their apartment block with bullet wounds in his back, and he was reported to have died in an ambulance later. But on Wednesday there were gasps at a Kiev press conference when Babchenko entered the room. ""There was no other way,"" he said. Babchenko later tweeted to say he would ""die at 96"" after ""dancing on Putin's grave"", referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Kiev would offer protection to Babchenko and his family. ""It is unlikely that Moscow will calm down,"" he added. The journalist fled Russia in 2017 after writing about the crash of a Russian military passenger jet in which 92 people died.

"Until recently, Kim Yong-chol (left) was blacklisted in the United States The right-hand man to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have concluded two days of talks in New York. Gen Kim Yong-chol flew from China on Wednesday to discuss a historic summit between the two nation's leaders. He is the most senior North Korean to visit the US in nearly 20 years. US President Donald Trump has told reporters he expects Gen Kim to come to Washington DC on Friday and deliver a letter from Kim Jong-un. Speaking aboard Air Force One on his way to Texas, Mr Trump said the envoy will ""be coming most likely tomorrow to the White House to present me with a letter from Kim Jong-un"". President Trump cancelled the 12 June summit, but both sides have since made fresh efforts to revive the plan. Scheduled to happen in Singapore, the historic meeting between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un would be the first between sitting US and North Korean leaders. Thursday's talks concluded early due to progress being made, a US state department official said. Mr Pompeo tweeted after the meeting that the talks had been ""substantive"". Allow Twitter content?

North Korea has strongly objected to statements by Trump administration members comparing North Korean denuclearisation to Libya's. Former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi gave up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders confirmed the US and North Korean leaders still planned to meet next month. ""As the president says, if it happens, we'll certainly be ready,"" she said. They met in an apartment on New York's East Side By Barbara Plett Usher, BBC state department correspondent in New York Just months ago the idea that this powerful North Korean official could visit New York was unthinkable. Until recently Kim Yong-chol was blacklisted in the US. A senior state department official said he and Mr Pompeo were trying to get to know each other after initial meetings in Pyongyang earlier this year. But he also said they needed to reduce the gap between them over the extent and pace of nuclear disarmament before the summit could go ahead. He also acknowledged that the US had to find a way to convince the North Korean leadership it would be secure without such weapons. But this high-level meeting shows that President Trump and Kim Jong-un want the summit to take place, and therefore many believe these two men will find a way to make it happen. North Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui has also met Sung Kim, a former US ambassador to South Korea, at Panmunjom on the border between the two Koreas. The two diplomats have faced one another before during previous denuclearisation negotiations.

Sergei Lavrov arrived in Pyongyang on Thursday Mr Lavrov extended an invitation to Mr Kim to visit Moscow. Mr Lavrov also spoke to Mr Pompeo for the first time on Wednesday, by phone.

"Ukraine gained independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and has since veered between seeking closer integration with Western Europe and being drawn into the orbit of Russia, which sees its interests as threatened by a Western-leaning Ukraine. Europe's second largest country, Ukraine is a land of wide, fertile agricultural plains, with large pockets of heavy industry in the east. While Ukraine and Russia share common historical origins, the west of the country has closer ties with its European neighbours, particularly Poland, and nationalist sentiment has been strongest there. A significant minority of the population uses Russian as its first language, particularly in the cities and the industrialised east. An uprising against pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014 ushered in a series of Western-leaning governments. But Russia used the opportunity to seize the Crimean peninsula and arm insurgent groups to occupy parts of the east, eventually launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

His Servant of the People party went on to win early parliamentary elections in July 2019, giving him control of both the executive and the legislature. In his inaugural address, President Zelensky said ending the Moscow-run insurgency in the east would be his priority, and he went on to rally Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion in 2022. After the start of the invasion, he declared martial law across Ukraine and a general mobilisation of the armed forces. His leadership during the crisis has won him widespread international praise, and he has been described as a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance National media have adopted a united patriotic agenda following the Russian annexation of Crimea and the armed conflict in the east. Ukraine has banned relays of leading Russian TVs; in turn, areas under Russian or separatist control have seen pro-Kyiv outlets silenced. The authorities also block access to some popular Russian websites and social networks. Ukrainians have changed their media consumption since the start of the full-scale war, with social media replacing TV as a top news source for Ukrainians, new TV channels continuing to launch despite the conflict, and the complete loss of popularity of Russian outlets.

"This video can not be played Back from the dead? Ukraine staged the murder of a Russian dissident journalist in Kiev on Tuesday in what it said was a sting operation to foil a Russian assassination plot. Arkady Babchenko sent shock waves around the world when he arrived at a news conference on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after being reported dead. Ukrainian security chief Vasyl Hrytsak said a sting had been set up to catch hitmen paid by Russian forces. Russia described events in Kiev as an ""anti-Russian provocation"". Ukrainian police say they made one arrest. Babchenko's wife said on Tuesday she had found her husband at the entrance to their apartment block with bullet wounds in his back, and he was reported to have died in an ambulance on the way to hospital. That story was widely reported by media around the world, until Wednesday's sudden and extraordinary development. There were gasps and applause at the press conference in Kiev as Babchenko entered the room. He thanked the Ukrainian security services for saving his life and said he had had no choice but to take part in the sting. ""I did my job,"" he said. "" I'm still alive."" ""I have buried many friends and colleagues many times and I know the sickening feeling,"" he added. ""I am sorry you had to experience it. But there was no other way."" Hours after the news broke, Babchenko tweeted to say he would ""die at 96"" after ""dancing on Putin's grave"", referring to the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin. Babchenko fled Russia in 2017 after writinga Facebook post (in Russian) about a crashed Tu-154 transport plane,external, which went into the Black Sea while carrying a Red Army choir to Syria. He said this Facebook post, in which he described Russia as an ""aggressor"", had led to death threats and abuse from the Russian state. Babchenko said he had been informed a month ago about an alleged Russian plot to kill him. He said he had agreed to co-operate with a counter-operation and had been in constant contact with Ukrainian security services over the course of the past month. He added that he thought security services had been planning the operation for up to two months. Mr Hrytsak said the operation had begun after Ukrainian security services were informed about a Russian plot to kill the journalist. He alleged that Russian security forces had recruited a Ukrainian citizen to find hitmen within Ukraine. He said the citizen had approached several acquaintances, including war veterans, offering $30,000 (Â£22,600) for the contract killing, one of whom revealed the plot to the security services. Babchenko covering the Maidan protests in Kiev in 2014 The security services then informed Babchenko, apparently determining that the only way to reveal the plotters was to stage a fake hit. Babchenko said that his wife Olga and his children had been aware of the plan but he publicly apologised to her at the press conference. ""I am terribly sorry,"" he said, ""but there were no other options."" Mr Hrytsak said the man detained by police was the Ukrainian who had allegedly attempted to find a hitman. Russia's foreign ministry condemned the staged assassination, calling it ""obviously yet another anti-Russian provocation"". Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova described the operation as ""a masquerade"" done for ""propagandistic effect"". She added that Russia was happy that Babchenko was alive, saying: ""I wish it were always like that."" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said the country would offer protection to Babchenko. ""It is unlikely that Moscow will calm down,"" he said on Twitter. ""I've given an order to provide Arkady and his family with protection."" The Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty network posted video footage of Babchenko's colleagues reacting to news that he was alive. Allow Twitter content?

But many expressed reservations over the tactics used by the Ukrainian security services. Campaign group Reporters Without Borders condemned the operation as a ""pathetic stunt"". ""It is pathetic and regrettable that the Ukrainian police have played with the truth, whatever their motive,"" the head of the organisation, Christophe Deloire, told AFP news agency. The Committee to Protect Journalists demanded that the authorities explain ""what necessitated the extreme measure"",describing it in a tweet as an ""unprecedented situation"",external. Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov, a former colleague of Babchenko, said the sting had ""crossed a line big time"". ""Babchenko is a journalist not a policeman, for Christ sake, and part of our job is trust, whatever Trump & Putin say about fake news,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""I'm glad he is alive, but he undermined even further the credibility of journalists and the media."" Simon Ostrovsky, a journalist and friend of Babchenko, told the BBC he felt ""anger and relief in equal measure"". âFrom being incredibly gloomy and sad yesterday... to frankly anger today, weâve all been hoodwinked and made to believe our friend died."" This video can not be played Friend of Babchenko: ""Weâve all been hoodwinked"" Frank Gardner,BBC Security Correspondent There can be few more glaring examples of 'fake news' than the deliberate misreporting by a sovereign government of a prominent journalist's death. Relations between Russia and Ukraine are at an all-time low, following Moscow's annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, and Russia has been accused of several recent deaths of Kremlin critics in Ukraine. But this staged non-death will inevitably muddy the waters. Russia already denies any involvement in the attempted assassination of its former spy Sergei Skripal in the UK city of Salisbury in March, calling it fake news. It will now likely seize on this deception in Kiev to strengthen its claim in that case, and in others. Kiev has in recent years seen a number of deadly attacks on high-profile figures, including journalists and politicians. Most of them were vocal critics of the Kremlin. The leading Belarusian journalist and Kremlin critic, Pavel Sheremet, was killed by a car bomb in Kiev in July 2016. Another car bomb killed Ukrainian military intelligence officer Col Maxim Shapoval in June 2017 in what the Ukrainian authorities called a terrorist act. In March of the same year, former Russian MP Denis Voronenkov was shot dead outside a hotel in Kiev.
