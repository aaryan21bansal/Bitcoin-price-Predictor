"Kirstie's children have a smashing time on their iPads Kirstie Allsopp has revealed she smashed her children's iPads after they broke her rules about screen time. The TV presenter, who is mother to two sons and two stepsons, said she took action after her sons played games outside their permitted time. She told Channel 5's Jeremy Vine: ""This is the first time I've said this publicly. ""In June I smashed my kids' iPads, not in a violent way. I actually banged them on the table leg."" She added: ""There is a game called Fortnite and another PUBG and I decided... we had made all sorts of rules and all sorts of times when we said you can't play them and all those rules got broken and in the end I said: 'Right that is it, I have to physically (break them)."" She has already posted about the issue on Twitter, after some suggested it might have been more sensible to just switch off the WiFi or confiscate the items. Allow Twitter content?

Many comments on social media applauded her actions while others said donating the iPads to charity would have been a more ""mature course of action"" when there are ""children in the world who go without such things"" because their parents cannot afford them. Kirstie retorted that ""this has nothing to do with money"" but was a stand against an ""unhealthy influence in her home"". She added that she felt the lesson learned by her children was worth far more than the monetary value of the iPads. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The presenter has now left Twitter due to the backlash. It's not the first time the Location, Location, Location presenter - who is also an ambassador for family charity Homestart - has waded in with some controversial parenting thoughts. Here are 10 of Kirstie's top tips: Back in 2014, Kirstie urged women to put off higher education and a career in favour of having children because their ""fertility falls off a cliff"". In an interview with Jeremy Paxman on BBC Newsnight, Kirstie, who met her husband when she was 32 and then had two children, said: ""Nature is not with you and I. Nature is not a feminist."" She also encouraged women to be ""more honest"" with one another about their biological clock, saying the topic was still ""taboo"". Kirstie has had issues with the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) in the past - she accused the organisation of not always giving enough information on caesarean sections. In a 2013 tweet, she wrote: ""Lots of people have good NCT experiences, but many don't. This is a very politicised, dogmatic and in my experience, scary organisation."" The NCT's chief executive at the time, Belinda Phipps, responded: ""NCT antenatal courses cover all the topics that are relevant to expectant and new parents, including giving birth by caesarean section."" And, of course,Mumsnetters were keen to debate the issue.,external Should parents be able to make the decision about when to keep reception-aged children off school? In 2012, Kirstie tweeted her response to plans to include absent four-year-old pupils in truancy league tables and said schools should not ""dictate"" to parents when Â­youngsters should attend. ""As a parent of two summer-born boys I know there are days on which school is too much. ""Some children thrive at school early on but some don't, Â­especially boys, and life-long damage is done. Schools must trust parental instincts."" Kirstie went to boarding school from the age of eight but she wasn't keen to go. ""The truth is I would have much preferred to have stayed at home than be sent away,external, but that's what my parents wanted. ""And I know many kids flourish with that independence and freedom, but for me it was a bit too much, too soon."" Speaking of her parents' decision, she added that ""in their eyes they were making the biggest sacrifice for me. Who is to say what is right or not in that situation, other than the child?"" More and more children have access to smartphones Kirstie takes no prisoners when it comes to her kids' access to technology - and that was before iPad-gate. Earlier this month, she said her sons, aged 10 and 12, weren't allowed smartphones or access to ""damaging"" social media. ""I don't think social media is suitable for children.,externalI think that feeling of, 'Oh, I wish I'd been invited to that,' or, 'Oh, my friends are doing something fun without me,' is very damaging."" Prior to that, she revealed:""We have a strict rule, no internet connected devices in bedrooms.,externalKids tend not to look at porn, or beheading videos, in the kitchen!"" Kirstie defended her decision to sit separately from her sons when flyingafter telling the Sun newspaper that she and her partner sometimes sit in the business class cabin, while her children sit in economy. Some suggested she ""look after"" her children and sit with them. Kirstie said this was ""utter rubbish"", adding that having her sons in premium seats seemed ""an absurd waste of money"" and ""very spoiling"". Last year, Kirstie posted a photograph on Instagram of one of her sons sorting out some Tupperware boxes. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

She wrote: ""You're never too young to learn to sort tupperware, even with a broken wrist. #monstermum #noexcuses #callthisaholiday."" To be fair, there are worse jobs around the house. We'd rather sort out Tupperware than clean the loo. A camping adventure - leave your mobile at home Kirstie has also spoken about giving her children freedom outdoors to help develop independence. ""I'm not the perfect parent, but I think that if you let children free with wood, knives and matches sometimes and nails, screws and drills sometimes, they rarely - touch wood - do themselves any harm and they learn so much,"" she said. We'll, erm, take your word for it, Kirstie. There won't be any ""discovering"" yourself in Vietnam if Kirstie has anything to do with it. In 2014, she said she had made a deal with her children that if they take a gap year before university, they do some""proper work, it's not a year off"".,external In return, she and her partner will fund their courses. Not a bad offer. Kirstie has some advice for older 'children', too. Speaking at a craft fair in 2014, she said:""I think we've spoilt our kids too much - we've allowed them to go months without calling their parents.,externalIt's not unreasonable to expect children to ring their parents once a week. ""Older people mustn't think they're a burden and they must call their kids and the children should call their parents. We must respect the older generation and set store by their opinion, otherwise it will happen to us. ""We have a duty to our parents to stay in touch, and see them and know them and understand them.'

"Ryan Thomas appeared shocked to have won Ryan Thomas has been named winner of Celebrity Big Brother after a controversial series that has seen walk-outs and thousands of complaints. They were sparked by an incident between Thomas and Roxanne Pallett, in which the former Emmerdale star claimed to have been repeatedly punched. She accused ex-Coronation Street actor Thomas of deliberately hurting her, but later admitted she got it wrong. Thomas said he had feared he would get a call from police over the incident. He appeared shocked and shook his head as he left the house, telling host Emma Willis he was ""overwhelmed"". Roxanne Pallett: ""I overreacted"" Thousands of complaints over episode Thomas was shown footage from the incident with Pallett - which Big Brother bosses had described as ""almost play-fighting"" - describing her reaction as ""totally unexpected"". ""It was a sign of affection... there was nothing in it,"" he said. ""As it unravelled, as it became bigger and bigger, then it scared me. ""We all know how something like that can stick on a man,"" he added, saying: ""I just wanted out. ""I felt I was going to be getting a call from the police for doing something untowards to a woman. And that's not me. ""I was glad we had 24-hour surveillance on us, because the point was proven."" Thomas, who starred as Jason Grimshaw in Coronation Street, had been the bookies' favourite to win the Channel 5 reality show, followed by US star Kirstie Alley. She was the runner-up.

In a TV interview on the Jeremy Vine show, she said: ""I massively apologise to Ryan, his friends and fans and every single person who watched that. ""[It was] an overreaction to what wasn't a malicious act. ""I was sensitive and emotional and mistook what was playful - I apologise for it, I shouldn't have questioned his motivation.""

Of the other finalists, Allen was voted out first, followed by Morgan and then Leeson. Leeson told Willis the experience had been tougher than his time in prison afterhe brought down Barings Bank, and that he was shocked to have come fourth. ""I did something really bad,"" he said. ""I've been trying to rebuild my reputation since."" Osborne was shocked to learn none of the other contestants had nominated him during the series. He told Willis he had found it difficult not being able to speak to his children, saying he had just wanted to make his family proud.

"This video can not be played Bright Tribe Trust founder Michael Dwan told Panorama that the required work had been completed, before walking out of the interview An academy trust that runs 10 schools in England has been accused of making false claims for government grants. BBC Panorama has found the Bright Tribe Trust received public money for building work, lighting upgrades and fire safety improvements that were either not finished or never done. New trustees, appointed at Bright Tribe two months ago, have now commissioned independent investigations. The trust says swift action will be taken if rules have been breached. Panorama reveals how Bright Tribe was given Â£566,000 to demolish and rebuild unstable walls in the sports centre at Colchester Academy in Essex. But instead of knocking down the dangerous walls, the trust carried out a cheap repair using metal braces. Reporter Bronagh Munro checks out the work carried out at Colchester Academy An insider has told Panorama the repair job only cost about Â£60,000, but paperwork obtained by the programme shows that Bright Tribe received the full Â£566,000, and falsely told the government the work had been completed. Bright Tribe also failed to carry out essential fire protection work, including the fire-stopping of a ceiling void and installing over 100 fire doors in another government-funded project at the sports centre. The trust again claimed the full Â£255,000 of funding, despite being warned by school staff that the work had not been completed and the building was still unsafe. Staff emailed Bright Tribe saying: ""The void above the ceiling has never been completed and is a fire hazard as it is completely open. If there is a fire this will spread throughout the building."" Panorama has also discovered that the trust made false claims for grants for the Whitehaven Academy in Cumbria. A parents' group protesting at the Whitehaven Academy Bright Tribe claimed Â£320,000 for energy-efficient lighting, when less than a third of the lights have been installed, and a further Â£202,000 to upgrade school boilers. Instead of installing new boilers, the trust moved some old boilers from a disused part of the school. An independent engineer, who inspected the school in July, concluded that the work carried out should have cost far less than was claimed from the government. Local Conservative MP Trudy Harrison said she was shocked by the programme's findings: ""Lights haven't been fitted, work hasn't been carried out. ""We need some common sense applied to this. I am a Conservative MP and this is our party policy, but I am speaking out because it is wrong."" Tory MP Trudy Harrison is calling for a criminal investigation into Panorama's findings The government was warned about problems at Bright Tribe in 2015. It investigated and found serious failings, but instead of imposing financial sanctions it gave the trust an additional Â£1m grant the same year. The cash was to set up a northern hub for academies in the north-east of England, but last December Bright Tribe announced it was pulling out of the project. The Â£1m has not been repaid. When the government asked the trust to account for the Â£1m grant, Bright Tribe said the vast majority had already been spent on salaries and provided a list of staff who - it said - had worked on the project. Panorama has obtained the list and spoke to people whose salaries had been claimed against the government grant. Several of these individuals said they had never worked on the northern hub project. Northumberland County Council, which is responsible for schools in the northern hub area, has been trying to get back some of the public money. Conservative councillor and deputy leader of the council Wayne Daley  said the government was to blame for failing to safeguard the cash. ""That is a complete dereliction of duty to our community here and to the public purse. This can never ever be allowed to happen again. Ever. I'm genuinely shocked, I really am."" Bright Tribe was set up by businessman Michael Dwan, who made his reported Â£114 million fortune from private contracts in the NHS. Whitehaven Academy is to be rebuilt In total, Mr Dwan's companies have been paid Â£8m for services by Bright Tribe and another trust he set up called the Adventure Learning Academy Trust, which runs five schools in Cornwall. He says he has donated close to Â£2.4m to the trusts and that all the work carried out by his companies was done at cost or less. In an interview with Panorama, Mr Dwan said: ""The cost of providing the Â£8m in work and services was Â£10.5m. So actually we made a loss. ""I received some revenue, but I made a loss. And throughout the whole period I never, ever, made any profit. I made a substantial loss."" Mr Dwan insists he didn't control the trusts because he was never a trustee. ""I am not in control of the trusts and never have been. I am a very, very interested observer. I have never had any authority, never any decision-making power and no vote."" Mr Dwan wasn't technically a trustee himself, but his charities controlled the trusts and he chaired board meetings as their representative. Panorama has spoken to numerous insiders who say he made all the key decisions. The grants provided for the work at Whitehaven were based on estimates provided by one of Mr Dwan's companies. Mr Dwan's company Blue Support then handed the contracts to a company owned by a close associate of Mr Dwan, which then sub-contracted the work straight back to Blue Support Services. Mr Dwan told Panorama that all of the grant money had been spent at the schools, and that his companies had made a loss on the work. Academies minister Lord Agnew said academies had to provide more financial information than other schools and that more than 95% of trusts had no issues. ""We take the use of public money very seriously and will not tolerate those who try to exploit the system for personal gain,"" he said. ""But I am clear that Bright Tribe Trust is not representative of all academies, and more than half a million children are now in good or outstanding academies that were typically previously underperforming schools, thanks to innovative trusts across the country."" Mr Dwan's lawyers say the programme's allegations about the Northern Hub are untrue and that a full government audit has been completed and no issues have been raised with Mr Dwan. They said ""each and every allegation raised by the BBC"" is completely denied. You can watch 'Profits Before Pupils?

In a message on his Instagram, his family said they were all behind him, telling fans: ""Your support has been amazing throughout."" Former Cheers actress Kirstie Alley was the runner-up Alley and Thomas shared a kiss on a sofa after it was announced that viewers had voted him as the winner. She said it had been a ""wonderful"" experience - and that it had made her a ""stronger and better person"". Third place went to TV personality Dan Osborne, with the other finalists - TV's Sally Morgan (known as Psychic Sally), Love Islander Gabby Allen and former trader Nick Leeson - earlier leaving the Big Brother house. Of the other finalists, Allen was voted out first, followed by Morgan and then Leeson. Leeson told Willis the experience had been tougher than his time in prison afterhe brought down Barings Bank, and that he was shocked to have come fourth. ""I did something really bad,"" he said. ""I've been trying to rebuild my reputation since."" Osborne was shocked to learn none of the other contestants had nominated him during the series. He told Willis he had found it difficult not being able to speak to his children, saying he had just wanted to make his family proud. He said he had wanted to show who he really was, after a scandal in 2015 when he was heard making threats to a former girlfriend in leaked recordings. ""It gave me a lot of time to think about how I can better everything in my life,"" he added.

"Kirstie's children have a smashing time on their iPads Kirstie Allsopp has revealed she smashed her children's iPads after they broke her rules about screen time. The TV presenter, who is mother to two sons and two stepsons, said she took action after her sons played games outside their permitted time. She told Channel 5's Jeremy Vine: ""This is the first time I've said this publicly. ""In June I smashed my kids' iPads, not in a violent way. I actually banged them on the table leg."" She added: ""There is a game called Fortnite and another PUBG and I decided... we had made all sorts of rules and all sorts of times when we said you can't play them and all those rules got broken and in the end I said: 'Right that is it, I have to physically (break them)."" She has already posted about the issue on Twitter, after some suggested it might have been more sensible to just switch off the WiFi or confiscate the items. Allow Twitter content?

Many comments on social media applauded her actions while others said donating the iPads to charity would have been a more ""mature course of action"" when there are ""children in the world who go without such things"" because their parents cannot afford them. Kirstie retorted that ""this has nothing to do with money"" but was a stand against an ""unhealthy influence in her home"". She added that she felt the lesson learned by her children was worth far more than the monetary value of the iPads. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The presenter has now left Twitter due to the backlash. It's not the first time the Location, Location, Location presenter - who is also an ambassador for family charity Homestart - has waded in with some controversial parenting thoughts. Here are 10 of Kirstie's top tips: Back in 2014, Kirstie urged women to put off higher education and a career in favour of having children because their ""fertility falls off a cliff"". In an interview with Jeremy Paxman on BBC Newsnight, Kirstie, who met her husband when she was 32 and then had two children, said: ""Nature is not with you and I. Nature is not a feminist."" She also encouraged women to be ""more honest"" with one another about their biological clock, saying the topic was still ""taboo"". Kirstie has had issues with the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) in the past - she accused the organisation of not always giving enough information on caesarean sections. In a 2013 tweet, she wrote: ""Lots of people have good NCT experiences, but many don't. This is a very politicised, dogmatic and in my experience, scary organisation."" The NCT's chief executive at the time, Belinda Phipps, responded: ""NCT antenatal courses cover all the topics that are relevant to expectant and new parents, including giving birth by caesarean section."" And, of course,Mumsnetters were keen to debate the issue.,external Should parents be able to make the decision about when to keep reception-aged children off school? In 2012, Kirstie tweeted her response to plans to include absent four-year-old pupils in truancy league tables and said schools should not ""dictate"" to parents when Â­youngsters should attend. ""As a parent of two summer-born boys I know there are days on which school is too much. ""Some children thrive at school early on but some don't, Â­especially boys, and life-long damage is done. Schools must trust parental instincts."" Kirstie went to boarding school from the age of eight but she wasn't keen to go. ""The truth is I would have much preferred to have stayed at home than be sent away,external, but that's what my parents wanted. ""And I know many kids flourish with that independence and freedom, but for me it was a bit too much, too soon."" Speaking of her parents' decision, she added that ""in their eyes they were making the biggest sacrifice for me. Who is to say what is right or not in that situation, other than the child?"" More and more children have access to smartphones Kirstie takes no prisoners when it comes to her kids' access to technology - and that was before iPad-gate. Earlier this month, she said her sons, aged 10 and 12, weren't allowed smartphones or access to ""damaging"" social media. ""I don't think social media is suitable for children.,externalI think that feeling of, 'Oh, I wish I'd been invited to that,' or, 'Oh, my friends are doing something fun without me,' is very damaging."" Prior to that, she revealed:""We have a strict rule, no internet connected devices in bedrooms.,externalKids tend not to look at porn, or beheading videos, in the kitchen!"" Kirstie defended her decision to sit separately from her sons when flyingafter telling the Sun newspaper that she and her partner sometimes sit in the business class cabin, while her children sit in economy. Some suggested she ""look after"" her children and sit with them. Kirstie said this was ""utter rubbish"", adding that having her sons in premium seats seemed ""an absurd waste of money"" and ""very spoiling"". Last year, Kirstie posted a photograph on Instagram of one of her sons sorting out some Tupperware boxes. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

We'd rather sort out Tupperware than clean the loo. A camping adventure - leave your mobile at home Kirstie has also spoken about giving her children freedom outdoors to help develop independence. ""I'm not the perfect parent, but I think that if you let children free with wood, knives and matches sometimes and nails, screws and drills sometimes, they rarely - touch wood - do themselves any harm and they learn so much,"" she said. We'll, erm, take your word for it, Kirstie. There won't be any ""discovering"" yourself in Vietnam if Kirstie has anything to do with it. In 2014, she said she had made a deal with her children that if they take a gap year before university, they do some""proper work, it's not a year off"".,external In return, she and her partner will fund their courses. Not a bad offer. Kirstie has some advice for older 'children', too. Speaking at a craft fair in 2014, she said:""I think we've spoilt our kids too much - we've allowed them to go months without calling their parents.,externalIt's not unreasonable to expect children to ring their parents once a week. ""Older people mustn't think they're a burden and they must call their kids and the children should call their parents. We must respect the older generation and set store by their opinion, otherwise it will happen to us. ""We have a duty to our parents to stay in touch, and see them and know them and understand them.'

"Ryan Thomas appeared shocked to have won Ryan Thomas has been named winner of Celebrity Big Brother after a controversial series that has seen walk-outs and thousands of complaints. They were sparked by an incident between Thomas and Roxanne Pallett, in which the former Emmerdale star claimed to have been repeatedly punched. She accused ex-Coronation Street actor Thomas of deliberately hurting her, but later admitted she got it wrong. Thomas said he had feared he would get a call from police over the incident. He appeared shocked and shook his head as he left the house, telling host Emma Willis he was ""overwhelmed"". Roxanne Pallett: ""I overreacted"" Thousands of complaints over episode Thomas was shown footage from the incident with Pallett - which Big Brother bosses had described as ""almost play-fighting"" - describing her reaction as ""totally unexpected"". ""It was a sign of affection... there was nothing in it,"" he said. ""As it unravelled, as it became bigger and bigger, then it scared me. ""We all know how something like that can stick on a man,"" he added, saying: ""I just wanted out. ""I felt I was going to be getting a call from the police for doing something untowards to a woman. And that's not me. ""I was glad we had 24-hour surveillance on us, because the point was proven."" Thomas, who starred as Jason Grimshaw in Coronation Street, had been the bookies' favourite to win the Channel 5 reality show, followed by US star Kirstie Alley. She was the runner-up. This video can not be played Roxanne Pallet: 'I massively apologise to Ryan' Pallett apologised to Thomas in a number of interviews after quitting the show. In a TV interview on the Jeremy Vine show, she said: ""I massively apologise to Ryan, his friends and fans and every single person who watched that. ""[It was] an overreaction to what wasn't a malicious act. ""I was sensitive and emotional and mistook what was playful - I apologise for it, I shouldn't have questioned his motivation."" More than 11,000 complaints have been made to Ofcom. Big Brother bosses pointed out that while ""almost play fighting"" he ""punched Roxanne in the ribs"". Allow Instagram content?

"Jeremy Corbyn says his party must ""turn our fire outwards"", promising MPs Labour will remain a ""broad church"". Several MPs who have criticised the leader have faced pressure from their constituency parties, and Mr Corbyn has recently been urged by one, Chuka Umunna, to ""call off the dogs"". Speaking to the Parliamentary Labour Party, Mr Corbyn said there would always be differences of opinion. Meanwhile a motion of censure against one MP has been withdrawn. Canterbury MP Rosie Duffield had been facing the action by her local party over her comments about Labour's anti-Semitism row, but this was later withdrawn at a branch meeting. A spokesman for Jeremy Corbyn said it was ""not his place"" to get involved in the ""democratic practices of different parts of the Labour Party"". Call off the dogs, Umunna tells Corbyn Why Corbyn allies want selection rules changed Last week Labour activists passed no-confidence votes against the Friends of Israel chairwoman Joan Ryan, Luton South MP Gavin Shuker and Nottingham East MP Chris Leslie. Earlier several Labour MPs rallied in support of Ms Duffield after the censure motion was revealed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Corbyn told MPs on Monday night: ""The Labour Party has always been a broad church and I'm determined it remains so. ""We will always have some differences of opinion and we must protect the right of criticism and debate but our first and overwhelming priority is to deliver for the people we represent and remove this Conservative government from office. ""We must focus on that priority and turn our fire outwards."" On the confidence votes in local parties, a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had told MPs that ""it is not his place to be involved in the democratic practices of different parts of the Labour Party"", the Press Association reported. He added: ""He was making the point that everybody is subject to democratic accountability. It's not his role to interfere with that. ""But obviously these things have to be conducted properly and thoroughly and without abuse and Jeremy reiterated... that our politics is conducted with respect and without abuse of any kind."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell rejected claims Labour MPs who had criticised Mr Corbyn were being forced out of the party by far left activists. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm sorry, that does not bear relation to reality. ""We now have 500,000 members. It's a huge mass party now and, of course, those members want to get involved in discussions about policy. ""Also, they will reflect at times their view about the performances of their local MP. ""And we have had a small number of incidences that we have seen, two or three, where parties have come together and they have expressed concerns about the performance of their MP. That's happened right the way through the history of our party, but it's nothing untoward.""

The Home Office said the passport had been revoked as it was not valid. Mohamed was met by his mother, Hawa Keita, and other family members at Manchester Airport earlier.

"This video can not be played Bolton: ""The ICC is dead to us"" The US has threatened sanctions against the International Criminal Court (ICC) if it goes ahead with prosecutions against Americans. The court is currently considering prosecuting US servicemen over alleged detainee abuse in Afghanistan. National Security Adviser John Bolton called the court ""illegitimate"" and vowed the US would do everything ""to protect our citizens"". The US is among dozens of nations not to have joined the court. The court investigates and brings to justice people responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, intervening when national authorities cannot or will not prosecute. The ICC was established by a UN treaty in 2002, and has been ratified by 123 countries, including the UK. However several countries, including China, India, and Russia, have refused to join. Some African countries have called for withdrawal from the courtover perceived unfair treatment of Africans. The US has been critical of the ICC since it was established - and Mr Bolton has been particularly vocal in his opposition to the court. In his speech on Monday in Washington, Mr Bolton attacked two areas of the court's work. Why is the ICC controversial? 'I want justice for my mother' The first was ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's request last year for a full investigation into alleged war crimes in Afghanistan, which would include any committed by US military and intelligence officials. A 2016 report from the ICC said there was a reasonable basis to believe the US military had committed torture,externalat secret detention sites in Afghanistan operated by the CIA, and that the Afghan government and the Taliban had committed war crimes. US personnel in Afghanistan could be subjected to ICC investigations Mr Bolton said neither Afghanistan nor any government signatory to the ICC's statute had requested an investigation. However, ICC prosecutors also have the ability to take independent action, although any prosecutions must be approved by a panel of judges. The second area Mr Bolton addressed was the Palestinian move to bring Israel before the ICC over allegations of human rights abuses in Gaza and the occupied West Bank - a move dismissed by Israel as politicised. Mr Bolton said the Palestinian move was one of the reasonsthe US administration had decided to close the Palestinians' diplomatic mission in Washington. In his tirade against the court, Mr Bolton said it: Was a threat to ""American sovereignty and US national security"" Lacked checks and balances, claimed ""jurisdiction over crimes that have disputed and ambiguous definitions"" and failed to ""deter and punish atrocity crimes"" Was ""superfluous"" as the US administration did ""not recognise any higher authority than the US Constitution"" Mr Bolton said: ""We will not co-operate with the ICC. We will provide no assistance to the ICC. We will not join the ICC. We will let the ICC die on its own. After all, for all intents and purposes, the ICC is already dead to us."" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders backed Mr Bolton, saying President Donald Trump would use ""any means necessary to protect our citizens [and] those of our allies from unjust prosecution from the ICC"". The court in The Hague was founded in 2002 by a treaty known as the Rome Statute ICC judges and prosecutors would be barred from entering the US and their funds in the US would be targeted. ""We will prosecute them in the US criminal system. We will do the same for any company or state that assists an ICC investigation of Americans,"" Mr Bolton said. More ""binding, bilateral agreements"" would be signed to stop countries submitting US citizens to the court's jurisdiction. The ICC has pledged to ""continue to do its work undeterred, in accordance with... the overarching idea of the rule of law"". ""The ICC, as a judicial institution, acts strictly within the legal framework of the Rome Statute and is committed to the independent and impartial exercise of its mandate,"" it said in a statement, referring to the treaty that established the ICC. Liz Evenson, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, told AFP news agency that Mr Bolton had shown ""callous disregard for victims of atrocity crimes"" and that the US was ""more concerned with coddling serial rights abusers... than supporting impartial justice"". The US has had a varied history with the ICC. The US signed a treaty to establish the ICC in 2000,external, under President Bill Clinton's administration. The US said it strongly supported ""international accountability"" but believed the treaty, known as the Rome Statute, had ""significant flaws"" that still needed addressing. However, the US never ratified the treaty. Presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and George W Bush all took different approaches to the ICC In 2002, shortly before the court was formally established, President George W Bush's administration told the UN that the US would not join the ICC. President Barack Obama took a more positive approach to the ICC. He sought to develop co-operation with the ICC and sent observers to the court, although his administration also opted not to ratify the Rome Statute. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter As a diplomat, John Bolton was famously bellicose: he once said if the UN building in New York ""lost 10 storeys, it wouldn't make a bit of difference"". And he's made clear how he stands on carrot-and-stick diplomacy, saying: ""I don't do carrots."" As national security adviser, he's been more aggressive than the president at times - and has been reined in. On Monday, though, Mr Bolton made his first major address as national security adviser and showed he's in sync with the president. In threatening to take sanctions against ICC judges, he is helping to reinforce the president's ""America First"" policy.

"Network Rail's properties house a broad variety of businesses Network Rail is selling its commercial property portfolio in a deal that will raise Â£1.46bn and shore up the railway operator's finances. It said the proceeds of the sale to Blackstone Group and Telereal Trillium would help fund railway upgrades. But tenants of the 5,200 properties being sold, predominantly converted railway arches, have expressed concern. Campaign groupGuardians of the Arches,external, said they feared the sale would lead to higher rents for tenants. Some businesses had already faced steep rent rises in recent years and feared the new owners would increase them further, or move businesses out at the end of their contracts, the group said. ""We ... dispute whether selling off the whole estate in one job lot is the best way of supporting small businesses and the local economies which rely on them,"" a Guardian of the Arches spokesperson said. The UK's railway arches are home to a wide range of businesses including furniture restorers, metal-shop workers, cafÃ© owners, hairdressers, micro-breweries, galleries, gyms and motorbike repair shops. Network Rail said,externalthe new owners, property investors Telereal Trillium and private equity group Blackstone, would adopt a ""tenants first"" approach, established through a tenants' charter, which would ensure the new owners engaged with tenants and local communities ""in an open and honest manner"". Chris Hill (left) and delivery driver Max Chris Hill has been running his wine and spirits business, Latitude, from underneath an arch near Leeds station for ten years. He's also part of the steering group for Guardians of the Arches. In the arch next to his is a hairdresser, on the other side a letting agent. The site has a damp problem, trains rumble overhead every 10 minutes - and if they stop his mobile signal cuts out entirely. Mr Hill is worried Blackstone and Telereal will want to maximise profits from their investment and raise rents. ""What's been promised is that whatever is in my ten year [tenancy] agreement will be transferred, no questions asked. But we have quite a fragile tenancy agreement, where Network Rail can give me six months notice,"" he says. ""It makes my tenancy agreement look much more fragile when someone else is in charge of it."" Network Rail, which is under pressure to upgrade its infrastructure - especially commuter rail lines into London - announced last November it planned to sell the portfolio. Sir Peter Hendy, chairman of Network Rail, welcomed the deal: ""For tenants it will mean significant commitment and investment, and for passengers and taxpayers it will mean massive, essential improvements without an extra burden on the public purse."" Network Rail Property managing director David Biggs added: ""The new owners will invest in and grow the estate, and we can focus on our core business of running the railway.""

"Indea Ford took her two daughters to Sitka, Alaska without their father's knowledge A British mother has admitted abducting her two children and moving to Alaska to live with her new partner without their father's permission. Indea Ford, 34, previously from Maidstone in Kent, admitted two counts of abduction, at Isleworth Crown Court. She took her children to Sitka in October 2015 after she married an American following the breakdown of her relationship with their father. Ford was jailed for three years and six months. She had met the children's father almost 10 years ago and the couple had two daughters. However, the relationship ended in early 2012. A family court in Dartford ordered that custody be shared between the biological parents. At that hearing the judge said each parent must hold one of the girls' passports. Ford then obtained a new passport for the second child, claiming it had been lost or stolen, having already failed to get a family court to approve their move to the US. She married the American who was in the military in 2014 and the children moved to Alaska the following year, breaking the custody order and the family court judgement. The girls' father began a bid through the family court to get the children back and Ford was extradited to the UK in April. The children remain with their stepfather in Alaska. Recorder Gibson Grenfell QC said: ""A cynic might say the defendant has achieved what she set out to achieve - keep the children in America permanently."" But he said the father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, may have at times behaved ""reprehensibly"" during the relationship.

"This video can not be played Bright Tribe Trust founder Michael Dwan told Panorama that the required work had been completed, before walking out of the interview An academy trust that runs 10 schools in England has been accused of making false claims for government grants. BBC Panorama has found the Bright Tribe Trust received public money for building work, lighting upgrades and fire safety improvements that were either not finished or never done. New trustees, appointed at Bright Tribe two months ago, have now commissioned independent investigations. The trust says swift action will be taken if rules have been breached. Panorama reveals how Bright Tribe was given Â£566,000 to demolish and rebuild unstable walls in the sports centre at Colchester Academy in Essex. But instead of knocking down the dangerous walls, the trust carried out a cheap repair using metal braces. Reporter Bronagh Munro checks out the work carried out at Colchester Academy An insider has told Panorama the repair job only cost about Â£60,000, but paperwork obtained by the programme shows that Bright Tribe received the full Â£566,000, and falsely told the government the work had been completed. Bright Tribe also failed to carry out essential fire protection work, including the fire-stopping of a ceiling void and installing over 100 fire doors in another government-funded project at the sports centre. The trust again claimed the full Â£255,000 of funding, despite being warned by school staff that the work had not been completed and the building was still unsafe. Staff emailed Bright Tribe saying: ""The void above the ceiling has never been completed and is a fire hazard as it is completely open. If there is a fire this will spread throughout the building."" Panorama has also discovered that the trust made false claims for grants for the Whitehaven Academy in Cumbria. A parents' group protesting at the Whitehaven Academy Bright Tribe claimed Â£320,000 for energy-efficient lighting, when less than a third of the lights have been installed, and a further Â£202,000 to upgrade school boilers. Instead of installing new boilers, the trust moved some old boilers from a disused part of the school. An independent engineer, who inspected the school in July, concluded that the work carried out should have cost far less than was claimed from the government. Local Conservative MP Trudy Harrison said she was shocked by the programme's findings: ""Lights haven't been fitted, work hasn't been carried out. ""We need some common sense applied to this. I am a Conservative MP and this is our party policy, but I am speaking out because it is wrong."" Tory MP Trudy Harrison is calling for a criminal investigation into Panorama's findings The government was warned about problems at Bright Tribe in 2015. It investigated and found serious failings, but instead of imposing financial sanctions it gave the trust an additional Â£1m grant the same year. The cash was to set up a northern hub for academies in the north-east of England, but last December Bright Tribe announced it was pulling out of the project. The Â£1m has not been repaid. When the government asked the trust to account for the Â£1m grant, Bright Tribe said the vast majority had already been spent on salaries and provided a list of staff who - it said - had worked on the project. Panorama has obtained the list and spoke to people whose salaries had been claimed against the government grant. Several of these individuals said they had never worked on the northern hub project. Northumberland County Council, which is responsible for schools in the northern hub area, has been trying to get back some of the public money. Conservative councillor and deputy leader of the council Wayne Daley  said the government was to blame for failing to safeguard the cash. ""That is a complete dereliction of duty to our community here and to the public purse. This can never ever be allowed to happen again. Ever. I'm genuinely shocked, I really am."" Bright Tribe was set up by businessman Michael Dwan, who made his reported Â£114 million fortune from private contracts in the NHS. Whitehaven Academy is to be rebuilt In total, Mr Dwan's companies have been paid Â£8m for services by Bright Tribe and another trust he set up called the Adventure Learning Academy Trust, which runs five schools in Cornwall. He says he has donated close to Â£2.4m to the trusts and that all the work carried out by his companies was done at cost or less. In an interview with Panorama, Mr Dwan said: ""The cost of providing the Â£8m in work and services was Â£10.5m. So actually we made a loss. ""I received some revenue, but I made a loss. And throughout the whole period I never, ever, made any profit. I made a substantial loss."" Mr Dwan insists he didn't control the trusts because he was never a trustee. ""I am not in control of the trusts and never have been. I am a very, very interested observer. I have never had any authority, never any decision-making power and no vote."" Mr Dwan wasn't technically a trustee himself, but his charities controlled the trusts and he chaired board meetings as their representative. Panorama has spoken to numerous insiders who say he made all the key decisions. The grants provided for the work at Whitehaven were based on estimates provided by one of Mr Dwan's companies. Mr Dwan's company Blue Support then handed the contracts to a company owned by a close associate of Mr Dwan, which then sub-contracted the work straight back to Blue Support Services. Mr Dwan told Panorama that all of the grant money had been spent at the schools, and that his companies had made a loss on the work. Academies minister Lord Agnew said academies had to provide more financial information than other schools and that more than 95% of trusts had no issues. ""We take the use of public money very seriously and will not tolerate those who try to exploit the system for personal gain,"" he said. ""But I am clear that Bright Tribe Trust is not representative of all academies, and more than half a million children are now in good or outstanding academies that were typically previously underperforming schools, thanks to innovative trusts across the country."" Mr Dwan's lawyers say the programme's allegations about the Northern Hub are untrue and that a full government audit has been completed and no issues have been raised with Mr Dwan. They said ""each and every allegation raised by the BBC"" is completely denied. You can watch 'Profits Before Pupils?

"Final recommendations for new parliamentary boundaries that could see the number of MPs cut from 650 to 600 have been published. The Boundary Commission proposals, which still need to secure the backing of MPs and peers, have been laid in Parliament. The commission said it was ""confident"" in its new map, which covers constituencies across the UK. Parliament approved the principle of reducing the number of MPs in 2011. Since then, the Boundary Commissions ofEngland,external,Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalwere meant to redraw the UK's political map every five years to take account of changes in population shifts. How the changes affect Northern Ireland Why UK's political map is being re-drawn Do boundary changes exclude millions of voters? 'Bring forward' Commons boundaries vote According to analysis of the final proposals by politics professors Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, of Plymouth University, the Conservatives would have won a 16-seat majority at the last general election under the redrawn boundaries. They said there had been no material change to their prediction since last year's publication of proposed boundaries. The reduction in the number of parliamentary constituencies was meant to happen while the Coalition government was in power between 2010 to 2015. But it was abandoned in 2013 after the Liberal Democrats withdrew their support, having failed to agree on House of Lords reform with their Tory partners. As a result, the 2015 election was fought on the same boundaries as in 2010, as was the snap general election in 2017. The proposed number of seats for the next election are: England: 501 (down from 533) Scotland: 53 (down from 59) Wales: 29 (down from 40) Northern Ireland: 17 (down from 18) As well as reducing the number of seats, the review aims to make constituencies more equal in size, in terms of their total number of voters -  between 71,031 and 78,507. Although the changes are expected to most benefit the Conservatives at the ballot box, some big name Tories - including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit secretary David Davis - could face a tougher battle due to changes to the composition of their seats. If MPs reject the proposals, the next election will be fought on demographic data based on the 2000 electoral register and will not take into account changes since then. Critics of the changes have warned that Brexit will mean more legislation in the coming years - and that fewer MPs means less parliamentary scrutiny. Labour MP Nic Dakin, who represents Scunthorpe, said that the changes would not be good for democracy, pointing to the loss of MEPs that will come as a result of Brexit. But the Tories have insisted the system is currently weighed against them and the boundaries - decided by population figures - are out of date. Secretary to the commission, Sam Hartley, said: ""We're confident that the new map of constituencies best reflects the rules set for us by Parliament and we're especially pleased that our recommendations are based heavily on what members of the public have told us about their local areas. ""It is now up to the government to present our report to Parliament, and we look forward to being able to publish our recommendations once that has happened.""

"This video can not be played Bolton: ""The ICC is dead to us"" The US has threatened sanctions against the International Criminal Court (ICC) if it goes ahead with prosecutions against Americans. The court is currently considering prosecuting US servicemen over alleged detainee abuse in Afghanistan. National Security Adviser John Bolton called the court ""illegitimate"" and vowed the US would do everything ""to protect our citizens"". The US is among dozens of nations not to have joined the court. The court investigates and brings to justice people responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, intervening when national authorities cannot or will not prosecute. The ICC was established by a UN treaty in 2002, and has been ratified by 123 countries, including the UK. However several countries, including China, India, and Russia, have refused to join. Some African countries have called for withdrawal from the courtover perceived unfair treatment of Africans. The US has been critical of the ICC since it was established - and Mr Bolton has been particularly vocal in his opposition to the court. In his speech on Monday in Washington, Mr Bolton attacked two areas of the court's work. Why is the ICC controversial? 'I want justice for my mother' The first was ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's request last year for a full investigation into alleged war crimes in Afghanistan, which would include any committed by US military and intelligence officials. A 2016 report from the ICC said there was a reasonable basis to believe the US military had committed torture,externalat secret detention sites in Afghanistan operated by the CIA, and that the Afghan government and the Taliban had committed war crimes. US personnel in Afghanistan could be subjected to ICC investigations Mr Bolton said neither Afghanistan nor any government signatory to the ICC's statute had requested an investigation. However, ICC prosecutors also have the ability to take independent action, although any prosecutions must be approved by a panel of judges. The second area Mr Bolton addressed was the Palestinian move to bring Israel before the ICC over allegations of human rights abuses in Gaza and the occupied West Bank - a move dismissed by Israel as politicised. Mr Bolton said the Palestinian move was one of the reasonsthe US administration had decided to close the Palestinians' diplomatic mission in Washington. In his tirade against the court, Mr Bolton said it: Was a threat to ""American sovereignty and US national security"" Lacked checks and balances, claimed ""jurisdiction over crimes that have disputed and ambiguous definitions"" and failed to ""deter and punish atrocity crimes"" Was ""superfluous"" as the US administration did ""not recognise any higher authority than the US Constitution"" Mr Bolton said: ""We will not co-operate with the ICC. We will provide no assistance to the ICC. We will not join the ICC. We will let the ICC die on its own. After all, for all intents and purposes, the ICC is already dead to us."" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders backed Mr Bolton, saying President Donald Trump would use ""any means necessary to protect our citizens [and] those of our allies from unjust prosecution from the ICC"". The court in The Hague was founded in 2002 by a treaty known as the Rome Statute ICC judges and prosecutors would be barred from entering the US and their funds in the US would be targeted. ""We will prosecute them in the US criminal system. We will do the same for any company or state that assists an ICC investigation of Americans,"" Mr Bolton said. More ""binding, bilateral agreements"" would be signed to stop countries submitting US citizens to the court's jurisdiction. The ICC has pledged to ""continue to do its work undeterred, in accordance with... the overarching idea of the rule of law"". ""The ICC, as a judicial institution, acts strictly within the legal framework of the Rome Statute and is committed to the independent and impartial exercise of its mandate,"" it said in a statement, referring to the treaty that established the ICC. Liz Evenson, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, told AFP news agency that Mr Bolton had shown ""callous disregard for victims of atrocity crimes"" and that the US was ""more concerned with coddling serial rights abusers... than supporting impartial justice"". The US has had a varied history with the ICC. The US signed a treaty to establish the ICC in 2000,external, under President Bill Clinton's administration. The US said it strongly supported ""international accountability"" but believed the treaty, known as the Rome Statute, had ""significant flaws"" that still needed addressing. However, the US never ratified the treaty. Presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and George W Bush all took different approaches to the ICC In 2002, shortly before the court was formally established, President George W Bush's administration told the UN that the US would not join the ICC. President Barack Obama took a more positive approach to the ICC. He sought to develop co-operation with the ICC and sent observers to the court, although his administration also opted not to ratify the Rome Statute. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter As a diplomat, John Bolton was famously bellicose: he once said if the UN building in New York ""lost 10 storeys, it wouldn't make a bit of difference"". And he's made clear how he stands on carrot-and-stick diplomacy, saying: ""I don't do carrots."" As national security adviser, he's been more aggressive than the president at times - and has been reined in. On Monday, though, Mr Bolton made his first major address as national security adviser and showed he's in sync with the president. In threatening to take sanctions against ICC judges, he is helping to reinforce the president's ""America First"" policy.

"The Palestine Liberation Organisation opened its office in Washington in 1994 The US will close the Palestine Liberation Organisation's mission in Washington, the state department says. A statement said PLO leaders had failed to engage with US efforts to bring about peace with Israel and attempted to prompt an investigation of Israel by the International Criminal Court (ICC). A senior Palestinian official called the decision a ""dangerous escalation"". The PLO, the internationally-recognised representative of the Palestinian people, opened the mission in 1994. President Donald Trump is preparing to unveil a long-awaited Middle East peace plan, but Palestinian officials have refused to engage with his envoys sincehe controversially recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December. ""The PLO has not taken steps to advance the start of direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel,"" the state department said on Monday. ""To the contrary, the PLO leadership has condemned a US peace plan they have not yet seen and refused to engage with the US government with respect to peace efforts and otherwise."" The ICC in the Hague The statement also cited Palestinian efforts to get the ICC to prosecute Israelis for alleged violations of international laws and norms regarding the treatment of people and property in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Last year the US state department warned the mission that under US law it faced closureif Palestinian leaders continued to do so. But in May, the Palestinian foreign minister formally asked the ICC's chief prosecutor to launch a full investigation, saying he had ""ample and insurmountable evidence"". Israel - which like the US has never ratified the court's founding treaty, the Rome Statute - dismissed the move as a ""cynical step without legal validity"". In a statement issued as the US move appeared imminent, PLO Secretary-General Saeb Erekat said: ""This dangerous escalation shows that the US is willing to disband the international system in order to protect Israeli crimes and attacks against the land and people of Palestine as well as against peace and security in the rest of our region."" Saeb Erekat said the international community had a responsibility to react ""We reiterate that the rights of the Palestinian people are not for sale, that we will not succumb to US threats and bullying and that we will continue our legitimate struggle for freedom, justice, and independence, including by all political and legal means possible."" Mr Erekat insisted Palestinians would continue to call upon the ICC to open a full investigation. There was no immediate response from the Israeli government. On Saturday, a state department official said that following a review President Trump had ordered that $25m (Â£19m) allocated for the care of Palestinians at six hospitals in East Jerusalem ""go to high-priority projects elsewhere"". The head of the East Jerusalem Hospital Network warned on Monday that the decision to cut funding put ""the health of five million Palestinians at risk"". The US will redirect $25m earmarked for the treatment of Palestinians will be directed elsewhere The hospitals offer health services to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza which the Palestinian health ministry is unable to provide,external, such as cancer care, cardiac and eye surgery, neonatal intensive care and children's dialysis. Two weeks ago, the US said it was ending hundreds of millions of dollars of funding for the UN agency that provides assistance to five million Palestinian refugees across the Middle East. Officials said UN Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) was an ""irredeemably flawed operation"" whose ""endlessly and exponentially expanding community of entitled beneficiaries is simply unsustainable"". Unrwa rejected the claims, saying it provided vital services and that it was the duty of all parties to reach a peace deal that solved the issue of refugees.

Ramniklal Jogiya, 74, was bundled into a van and tortured in a plot to steal almost Â£200,000 of gold jewellery. Thomas Jervis, 24, and Charles Mcauley, 20, were convicted of murder and given life sentences with minimum terms of 33 and 30 years respectively after being found guilty of his murder. Callan Reeve, 20, was convicted of manslaughter and jailed for 16 years. The trio's trial at Birmingham Crown Court heard Mr Jogiya was bundled into a van while walking home in January after locking up his shop. Jervis went back to the shop to open the safe while wearing a burka disguise and pushing a shopping trolley to carry the jewellery, but was defeated by a 12-hour time-lock. (L-R) Callan Reeve, Charles Mcauley and Thomas Jervis were sentenced in Birmingham Mr Jogiya was probably still alive when the men dumped him from the van on Gaulby Lane, an isolated location near Leicester Airport, the jury heard.

But in May, the Palestinian foreign minister formally asked the ICC's chief prosecutor to launch a full investigation, saying he had ""ample and insurmountable evidence"". Israel - which like the US has never ratified the court's founding treaty, the Rome Statute - dismissed the move as a ""cynical step without legal validity"". In a statement issued as the US move appeared imminent, PLO Secretary-General Saeb Erekat said: ""This dangerous escalation shows that the US is willing to disband the international system in order to protect Israeli crimes and attacks against the land and people of Palestine as well as against peace and security in the rest of our region.""

"This video can not be played The gang intended to steal Â£200,000 worth of gold jewellery Two men have been sentenced for murdering a jeweller who was kidnapped and killed in a botched robbery. Ramniklal Jogiya, 74, was bundled into a van and tortured in a plot to steal almost Â£200,000 of gold jewellery. Thomas Jervis, 24, and Charles Mcauley, 20, were convicted of murder and given life sentences with minimum terms of 33 and 30 years respectively after being found guilty of his murder. Callan Reeve, 20, was convicted of manslaughter and jailed for 16 years. The trio's trial at Birmingham Crown Court heard Mr Jogiya was bundled into a van while walking home in January after locking up his shop. Jervis went back to the shop to open the safe while wearing a burka disguise and pushing a shopping trolley to carry the jewellery, but was defeated by a 12-hour time-lock. (L-R) Callan Reeve, Charles Mcauley and Thomas Jervis were sentenced in Birmingham Mr Jogiya was probably still alive when the men dumped him from the van on Gaulby Lane, an isolated location near Leicester Airport, the jury heard.

"Final recommendations for new parliamentary boundaries that could see the number of MPs cut from 650 to 600 have been published. The Boundary Commission proposals, which still need to secure the backing of MPs and peers, have been laid in Parliament. The commission said it was ""confident"" in its new map, which covers constituencies across the UK. Parliament approved the principle of reducing the number of MPs in 2011. Since then, the Boundary Commissions ofEngland,external,Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalwere meant to redraw the UK's political map every five years to take account of changes in population shifts. How the changes affect Northern Ireland Why UK's political map is being re-drawn Do boundary changes exclude millions of voters? 'Bring forward' Commons boundaries vote According to analysis of the final proposals by politics professors Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, of Plymouth University, the Conservatives would have won a 16-seat majority at the last general election under the redrawn boundaries. They said there had been no material change to their prediction since last year's publication of proposed boundaries. The reduction in the number of parliamentary constituencies was meant to happen while the Coalition government was in power between 2010 to 2015. But it was abandoned in 2013 after the Liberal Democrats withdrew their support, having failed to agree on House of Lords reform with their Tory partners. As a result, the 2015 election was fought on the same boundaries as in 2010, as was the snap general election in 2017. The proposed number of seats for the next election are: England: 501 (down from 533) Scotland: 53 (down from 59) Wales: 29 (down from 40) Northern Ireland: 17 (down from 18) As well as reducing the number of seats, the review aims to make constituencies more equal in size, in terms of their total number of voters -  between 71,031 and 78,507. Although the changes are expected to most benefit the Conservatives at the ballot box, some big name Tories - including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit secretary David Davis - could face a tougher battle due to changes to the composition of their seats. If MPs reject the proposals, the next election will be fought on demographic data based on the 2000 electoral register and will not take into account changes since then. Critics of the changes have warned that Brexit will mean more legislation in the coming years - and that fewer MPs means less parliamentary scrutiny. Labour MP Nic Dakin, who represents Scunthorpe, said that the changes would not be good for democracy, pointing to the loss of MEPs that will come as a result of Brexit. But the Tories have insisted the system is currently weighed against them and the boundaries - decided by population figures - are out of date. Secretary to the commission, Sam Hartley, said: ""We're confident that the new map of constituencies best reflects the rules set for us by Parliament and we're especially pleased that our recommendations are based heavily on what members of the public have told us about their local areas. ""It is now up to the government to present our report to Parliament, and we look forward to being able to publish our recommendations once that has happened.""

"The UK economy grew more strongly than expected in July as the heatwave and World Cup boosted the retail sector. The Office for National Statistics said,externalthe economy grew by 0.3% in July, and by 0.6% over the three months to July - the fastest pace in almost a year. ""Services grew particularly strongly, with retail sales performing well, boosted by warm weather and the World Cup,"" said Rob Kent-Smith from the ONS. The construction sector expanded but industrial output contracted. ""The dominant service sector again led economic growth in the month of July with engineers, accountants and lawyers all enjoying a busy period, backed up by growth in construction, which hit another record high level,"" said Mr Kent-Smith. The 0.6% growth rate for the three months to July was at the fastest since August 2017, the ONS said, and marks a pick-up from the0.4% rate seen in the three months to June. The data comes ahead of the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting on Thursday when interest rates are not expected to change. They were raised in August,for only the second time a decade, to 0.75%. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said the latest data justified the decision to raise rates last month. However, he remained cautious due to the possible impact of Brexit. ""Looking ahead... the long hot summer could give way to a stormy autumn as Brexit-related uncertainty leads businesses to defer major investment decisions and subdued real wage growth weighs on consumer spending,"" he said. By Andy Verity, BBC economics correspondent Today's economic growth figures contain a few pleasant surprises as the economic climate mirrored the meteorological one. You will have heard about gloom on the High Street: the figures show activity in the retail sector growing in the summer heat. You knew construction was in a hole: in the three months to July it started climbing back out - up 3.3%. Services drove growth, rebounding from a flat few months before. Professional services - engineers, architects etc - had a particularly busy three months, up 4.4%. No sign there yet of a Brexit-induced slump. Hotels, camping grounds and trailer parks also enjoyed growth of 3.4% - made more attractive to foreign tourists by the weak pound. Yes there may be clouds on the horizon; but don't get your umbrella out just yet. The ONS published a string of data alongside the GDP estimate: The services sector,external- which makes up 80% of the economy - grew 0.6% in the three months to July, fuelled by the growth in retail and wholesale tradeon the back of the joint hottest summer on record for the UK. In the three months to July the construction sector expanded 3.3%,external, the highest three-month rate since February 2017, and driven by repair and recovery work. On the monthly measure, growth was 0.5%. Industrial output contracted in the three months to July,externalby 0.5% even though the mining and quarrying sectors grew. The monthly output figure fell by 0.2%, held back by the pharmaceutical sector. Thetotal trade deficit in goods and services,externalnarrowed to Â£3.4bn in the three months to July. For July itself, the deficit shrank to just Â£111m. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said there had been a ""solid start"" to the third quarter but that each of the sectors showed a mixed picture. ""Uncertainties and risks around Brexit are likely to make the Bank of England particularly cautious during the critical months ahead. We expected a pause before interest rates are raised by 0.25% in November 2019 to 1%,"" she said.

"On average, a woman in Tanzania has more than five children in her lifetime Tanzania's President John Magufuli has urged women to stop taking birth control pills, saying the country needs more people. ""Women can now give up contraceptive methods,"" Mr Magufuli said. Opposition MP Cecil Mwambe has criticised the comments, saying they contradicted the country's health policy. Tanzania has a population of around 53 million people, with 49% of them living on less than $2 (Â£1.50) a day. On average, a woman in Tanzania has more than five children, among the highest rates in the world. 'Give birth 10 times to win a sheep' What Magufuli did during his first year in office Teenage mother take on Magufuli The day after Mr Magufuli's comments, speaker of parliament Job Ndugai banned female lawmakers from wearing fake nails and eye-lashes in parliament. Mr Ndugai told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that the ban was because of ""health"" reasons, without elaborating. The new regulations also ban women MPs from wearing short dresses and jeans. Female visitors to parliament will also be expected to adhere to the dress code. Read more about the fake nail ban here Mr Magufuli made his comments at a rally on Sunday in the northern Meatu district, saying people who use family planning methods were lazy,the local Citizen newspaper quoted him as saying.,external ""They do not want to work hard to feed a large family. And that is why they opt for births controls and end up with one or two children only,"" he said. ""I have travelled to Europe and elsewhere and have seen the harmful effects of birth control. Some countries are now facing declining population growth."" Mr Mwambe said that if President Magufuli wanted his comments to be taken seriously, he should change the health insurance scheme to cover 10 children instead of the current four per family, the Citizen reports. The paper however said that there was no indication that the country's population policy would change following the remarks. Mr Magufuli made similar comments in 2016. After the launch of free primary and secondary education, he said: ""Women can now throw away their contraceptives. Education is now free."" He has proposed several controversial policies since he was elected in 2015. Last year he proposed that pregnant schoolgirls be blocked from resuming their education after giving birth.

"The UK economy grew more strongly than expected in July as the heatwave and World Cup boosted the retail sector. The Office for National Statistics said,externalthe economy grew by 0.3% in July, and by 0.6% over the three months to July - the fastest pace in almost a year. ""Services grew particularly strongly, with retail sales performing well, boosted by warm weather and the World Cup,"" said Rob Kent-Smith from the ONS. The construction sector expanded but industrial output contracted. ""The dominant service sector again led economic growth in the month of July with engineers, accountants and lawyers all enjoying a busy period, backed up by growth in construction, which hit another record high level,"" said Mr Kent-Smith. The 0.6% growth rate for the three months to July was at the fastest since August 2017, the ONS said, and marks a pick-up from the0.4% rate seen in the three months to June. The data comes ahead of the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting on Thursday when interest rates are not expected to change. They were raised in August,for only the second time a decade, to 0.75%. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said the latest data justified the decision to raise rates last month. However, he remained cautious due to the possible impact of Brexit. ""Looking ahead... the long hot summer could give way to a stormy autumn as Brexit-related uncertainty leads businesses to defer major investment decisions and subdued real wage growth weighs on consumer spending,"" he said. By Andy Verity, BBC economics correspondent Today's economic growth figures contain a few pleasant surprises as the economic climate mirrored the meteorological one. You will have heard about gloom on the High Street: the figures show activity in the retail sector growing in the summer heat. You knew construction was in a hole: in the three months to July it started climbing back out - up 3.3%. Services drove growth, rebounding from a flat few months before. Professional services - engineers, architects etc - had a particularly busy three months, up 4.4%. No sign there yet of a Brexit-induced slump. Hotels, camping grounds and trailer parks also enjoyed growth of 3.4% - made more attractive to foreign tourists by the weak pound. Yes there may be clouds on the horizon; but don't get your umbrella out just yet. The ONS published a string of data alongside the GDP estimate: The services sector,external- which makes up 80% of the economy - grew 0.6% in the three months to July, fuelled by the growth in retail and wholesale tradeon the back of the joint hottest summer on record for the UK. In the three months to July the construction sector expanded 3.3%,external, the highest three-month rate since February 2017, and driven by repair and recovery work. On the monthly measure, growth was 0.5%. Industrial output contracted in the three months to July,externalby 0.5% even though the mining and quarrying sectors grew. The monthly output figure fell by 0.2%, held back by the pharmaceutical sector. Thetotal trade deficit in goods and services,externalnarrowed to Â£3.4bn in the three months to July. For July itself, the deficit shrank to just Â£111m. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said there had been a ""solid start"" to the third quarter but that each of the sectors showed a mixed picture. ""Uncertainties and risks around Brexit are likely to make the Bank of England particularly cautious during the critical months ahead. We expected a pause before interest rates are raised by 0.25% in November 2019 to 1%,"" she said.

The Home Office said the passport had been revoked as it was not valid. Mohamed was met by his mother, Hawa Keita, and other family members at Manchester Airport earlier.

"This video can not be played Steve Baker: This not a plot to topple the prime minister Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa May's Chequers plan, a former Brexit minister has warned. Steve Baker told the BBC the PM's blueprint for future relations with the EU had alienated Leavers and Remainers. He warned of a ""catastrophic split"" if his party was not able to unite around a different, more flexible arrangement. No 10 said its plan was the ""only one on the table"" able to deliver on the will of British people while avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. The cabinet backed the so-called Chequers plan when it met at the PM's country residence in July. The agreement, which led to the resignations of then-Brexit Secretary David Davis and the former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, sets out a blueprint for the future relationship with the EU once the UK leaves in March 2019. Mr Baker is the former chairman of the Eurosceptic group the European Research Group (ERG), which plans to publish its own proposals for Brexit ahead of the Conservative Party conference. Brexit: All you need to know The Chequers plan explained Labour, unions and the Brexit vote issue Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles He told the Press Association that the lack of support for Mrs May's plan, which would involve the UK accepting a common rule book for trade in goods, among Tory MPs left her with a ""massive problem"" in the run-up to next month's Conservative conference. If the government tried to push through a Brexit deal through the Commons, on the back of Labour votes, he said the Tory Party ""would suffer the catastrophic split which thus far we have managed to avoid"". ""It is absolutely no pleasure whatsoever to me to acknowledge that, but I look at the mood of colleagues and the mood of the Conservative Party in the country and I am gravely concerned for the future of our party."" Theresa May's cabinet agreed the Chequers plan in July, but it led to a number to resignations Mr Baker told the BBC that opposition to Chequers was so widespread that some colleagues who backed remaining in the EU would prefer the UK to leave without a deal than sign up to the current proposal. Despite his criticism, he insisted he was not seeking a change in leadership and he would back the PM if she changed tack and backed a free trade deal modelled on Canada's arrangements with the EU. ""We want to change the policy and we would be delighted to unite behind Theresa May with a different policy. ""The Conservative Party must come together to deliver Brexit behind a policy and the policy we are arguing for is the one the EU has offered us in March."" Former leader Iain Duncan Smith said the PM's plan was ""unacceptable"" to the majority of Tory MPs and was ""essentially dead"". Asked when Brexiteers outside of the government would come up with a detailed alternative, he said he and others would be putting forward a ""whole set of new ideas"" in the coming weeks but it was up to ministers to mould them into a plan that would be approved by Parliament. The latest interventions follow a week of criticism of the Chequers deal from MPs, notably former foreign secretary Boris Johnson. He caused controversy over the weekendwith a column in the Mail on Sunday, calling the PM's plan a ""suicide vest"" around the UK, with the detonator in Brussels' hands. A number of senior Tories criticised the language he used, with one minister saying it marked a ""disgusting moment"" in politics but other colleagues of Mr Johnson said critics were ""terrified of his popular appeal"". Boris Johnson has criticised the Chequers deal in a number of newspaper articles In his weekly column in Monday's Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson wrote that the Conservative government should cut taxes to help ""striving"" families and give the UK a post-Brexit boost. But Justice Secretary David Gauke said there was ""no vacancy"" in Downing Street and ex-education secretary Nicky Morgan, who backs a Norway-style association agreement with the EU, said getting a Brexit deal through the Commons would potentially depend on the support of Labour MPs. ""Surely the public want politicians to work together on this matter of national interest,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""That is why I hope the government is going to appeal to MPs on all sides to do the right thing for the country."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. A deal on the UK's withdrawal agreement was expected to be agreed in time for an EU summit in October, along with a statement from both sides on the future relationship. However, a number of senior figures have said this deadline may slide into November. The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier has said he is ""strongly opposed"" to aspects of the Chequers plan. But with the clock ticking to next month's summit, the Financial Times said EU leaders now seem prepared to begin discussions on the most contentious points of Mrs May's plan. The paper reported they would give Mr Barnier the green light to begin talks at a meeting in Salzburg later this month. But, at the same time, The Republic of Ireland's EU Commissioner Phil Hogan signalled that further UK compromises would be needed and ""factionalism"" within the Conservative Party could scupper any chance of an agreement. ""If the UK attitude is Chequers and only Chequers, there will be no agreement before March next year on the future trade relationship,"" he said in a speech in the town of New Ross.

"Michel Barnier has said a Brexit deal is possible within six to eight weeks. The EU's chief negotiator said if both sides are ""realistic"" there could be an agreement on the terms of the UK's exit by early November. His comments come amid unconfirmed reports a one-off summit of EU leaders could be convened in the middle of November to sign off the agreement. The BBC's Katya Adler said Mr Barnier's tone may have changed but the substance of his arguments was still the same. While the EU was not about to compromise its Brexit principles, our Europe editor said the bloc was aware of Mrs May's domestic political troubles and ""planned to throw her as much of a lifeline as possible"". Mrs May has been warned she faces a mass Tory rebellion if she persists with her Chequers plan for future relations with the EU, with former Brexit minister Steve Baker claiming as many as 80 Tories could oppose it in a Commons vote later this year. Brexit: All you need to know The Chequers plan explained Laura Kuenssberg: Keep calm and carry on Labour, unions and the Brexit vote issue Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles The UK and EU are hoping to finalise the so-called divorce agreement and agree a statement on their future economic co-operation in time for an EU summit in mid-October or by the end of the month at the latest. Mr Barnier has said this is vital if the UK and EU Parliaments are to have enough time to consider and vote on the proposals before the UK's scheduled departure on 29 March 2019. But some senior Tory Brexiteers are continuing to urge the PM to change course, saying proposals agreed by her cabinet in July - which would see the UK follow EU rules on trade in goods - will not be backed by Parliament. Mr Baker said the party risked a ""catastrophic split"" if the PM didn't rethink her approach, which he suggested many MPs - including some who backed Remain - thought was worse than staying in the EU as it would leave the UK without any say in its rules. This video can not be played What Labour's Stephen Kinnock claimed Mr Barnier told him about Chequers A key argument that has been made by MPs opposed to the Chequers deal in recent weeks is that the EU will not accept it, since it seeks different levels of market access and obligations for goods and services. After meeting Mr Barnier last week, Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Frenchman's views were closer to his than those of the prime minister while Labour MP Stephen Kinnock claimed he told him and other MPs that, referring to the Chequers plan, ""les propositions sont mortes"" (the proposals are dead). But asked about this at the Bled Strategic Forum in Slovenia, Mr Barnier said this was not true. ""I never said that, I don't think that. It is not my feeling."" He described the Chequers plan as a ""very important"" document and suggested the EU was now ""benchmarking"" it against the mandate it had been given by the EU's 27 other members. ""It is useful because it clearly defines what the wishes are for the UK for future relations."" This video can not be played Steve Baker: We are not trying to topple the prime minister Mr Barnier said there were ""many, many points of convergence"" between the two sides, particularly over defence and security and a deal on the terms of withdrawal could be settled within six to eight weeks. But he warned that the UK's core proposals for trading relations after it leaves were a direct challenge to the founding principles of the EU and the integrity of the single market. ""It is not possible to get freedom for goods without freedom for services, in particular for the movement of people,"" he said. The BBC's Katya Adler said there was a suggestion EU leaders might be preparing to give Mr Barnier an updated negotiating mandate when they meet in Salzburg later this month, but that any changes were likely to be ""pretty cosmetic"" rather than a fundamental change in the EU's negotiating position. The talk in Brussels among senior EU officials is increasingly of a special Brexit summit in the week commencing 12 November, if as is widely expected, a deal cannot be struck in October. The Chequers agreement led to the resignations of then-Brexit Secretary David Davis and the former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, both of whom have continued to criticise the direction of government policy. Mr Johnson caused controversy over the weekendwith a column in the Mail on Sunday, calling the PM's plan a ""suicide vest"" around the UK, with the detonator in Brussels' hands. No 10 has said its plan was the ""only one on the table"" able to deliver on the will of British people while avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.

"This video can not be played TUC boss Frances O'Grady: Union will back ""popular vote"" on Brexit deal if it fails working people In the glare of publicity, the TUC's Frances O'Grady announced that the unions would - under certain circumstances - back a referendum on a final Brexit deal. That's the broadly agreed view amongst the 49 member unions - but not the unanimous view. The leadership of the rail union, the RMT, oppose a new vote. On the other side, there is a vanguard pushing for a referendum on the final Brussels deal no matter what. This includes the GMB and the smaller Community and TSSA unions. So away from public view the shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer spent his Sunday in what are, these days, smoke-free rooms sounding out what the big unions will do in two weeks' time at Labour's conference. His mission is to try to find consensus and avoid conflict before all eyes turn to the Conservative conference a week later. So he wanted to find out if the largest union backing a 'people's vote' - the GMB - would press for Labour to adopt the same policy. I understand he was told they will. Currently the Labour leadership insist they would prefer to call for an election if Parliament either rejects Theresa May's final deal, or if she returns from Brussels empty-handed. TUC issues EU referendum warning to May GMB union backs referendum on Brexit deal New EU vote would 'undermine democracy' A referendum, though, wouldn't be off the table as an option. Not just some unions, but many rank-and-file Labour members want their leadership to go further. So I'm told Sir Keir is trying to find ""a form of words"" to paper over any underlying differences before the party gathers in Liverpool. And Frances O'Grady's language at the TUC conference could provide the blueprint. In words and phrases that could only really be written by a committee, the TUC - including the big Labour supporting unions Unison and Unite - will formally agree a motion on the conference floor today backing ""the possibility of a campaign for people to have a final say on the final Brexit deal through a popular vote"". But more robustly, the TUC's general secretary adds that if this were to happen, then unions' ""full weight"" would be behind that campaign. And it is felt that if the Labour leadership could sound more enthusiastic about the prospect - rather than appearing to be being dragged reluctantly towards it - that might just be enough to keep the Remainers in Labour's ranks from publicly revolting. Unite's Len McCluskey - whose position is close to Jeremy Corbyn's - is stressing a new vote should be left ""on the table"". For Kremlinologists, that's more positive than the previous formulation of ""not taking it off the table"". But one thing is clear - the Labour leadership won't agree to back a new vote in all circumstances. If their language does become more positive, caveats will remain - and any support for a new referendum would only be triggered if Parliament can't agree a deal with Brussels.

Khalid Masood ran down and killed four people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a policeman to death. The attack, on 22 March, ""cruelly and brutally"" ripped victims from their families, said the husband of Aysha Frade, who was killed on the bridge. Tributes to the five have been read out on the first day of the hearing. Those hit by Masood's car were Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes, Aysha Frade, and Andreea Cristea. PC Keith Palmer was killed in the forecourt of the Palace of Westminster. He made the ""ultimate sacrifice"", a colleague told the Old Bailey. Victims of the Westminster terror attack Westminster attack: What happened Masood was shot dead at the scene by armed police officers. Judge Mark Lucraft QC, chief coroner of England and Wales, said ""the lives of many were torn apart by high and terrible drama"" that day in little more than a minute. He warned that video footage shown during the inquest would be ""graphic and shocking"" and some family members chose to leave the court when it was played. Among the images shown was one of the moment US tourist Kurt Cochran saved his wife's life by pushing her away from the path of Masood's car before being hit by it himself. Gareth Patterson QC, representing three of the victims' families, said people were hit like ""human bowling pins"" and ""thrown in the air like rag dolls"". Mr Patterson said Masood would have ""seen and heard every impact as he drove over the bridge"", suggesting there was ""no getting away from the barbarity of what happened and the inhumanity of what took place"". Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives Det Supt John Crossley, who led the police investigation, said the attack began at 14:40 when Masood's vehicle, a rented Hyundai Tucson, mounted the kerb on Westminster Bridge, travelling at an average of 31mph. Mr Cochran - who was standing with his wife at the south end of the bridge - was the first to be hit. The CCTV also showed Mr Rhodes being knocked into the air and dragged by Masood's car. He was taken to hospital, but died the following day from head injuries. Ms Frade was thrown 17 metres into a bus lane, then fell under a slow-moving oncoming bus. Ms Cristea was knocked into the Thames from the bridge and was in the water for nearly nine minutes before being rescued. She died just over two weeks later. After crashing his car, Masood got out and ran around the fence to enter the Palace of Westminster's Carriage Gate, where he continued his attack. PC Palmer, who was unarmed, challenged him but was forced backwards into the Parliamentary estate and stabbed. One of the CCTV images seen in court showed Masood standing over PC Palmer with a knife in each hand. The court heard two of his colleagues ran towards the attacker to give PC Palmer the chance to get away, but he collapsed a short distance away. At the beginning of the hearing, a minute's silence was held and members of the victims' families embraced one another. The families and friends of victims read out tributes to their loved ones. First was Mr Cochran's sister-in-law, Angela Stoll, who read out a tribute on behalf of his wife Melissa, who had travelled to the inquest from the US. Melissa Payne Cochran's sister read a statement on her behalf She said: ""I was so lucky to have had 25 wonderful years with the man of my dreams. He made me laugh every single day. She said she was ""forever grateful"" for their time together, ""and especially his heroic actions on that day, saving my life"". By BBC News correspondent Helena Lee, at the Old Bailey Relatives of those who died came to court number one today, nearly 18 months after the attack, to share their memories, their pain and their loss. They read, through tears, powerful tributes to their loved ones from the witness box in front of a full, hushed courtroom. Pictures of those who died were put up on big screens for all to see. As the events of that day last March were recalled, the coroner warned them of the harrowing and graphic footage ahead. He told them they could leave if they wanted to - and some did. Those left behind watched as the horrifying footage was played of the attacker driving erratically along Westminster Bridge and ploughing into pedestrians. The families will return to the Old Bailey on Tuesday. They'll be hoping the days and weeks ahead will give them answers about the final moments of their loved ones' lives. Ms Frade's husband John said she had been ""cruelly and brutally ripped away from us"". ""Her spirit lives on in the eyes of her children,"" he added. John Frade told the court his wife's spirit lived on Romanian interior designer Ms Cristea, who would have turned 33 on the day the inquest began, was walking with her boyfriend Andrei Burnaz on a visit to London when she was hit. Andreea Cristea was visiting London with her boyfriend Her family described her as a ""lovely, enchanting and life-loving"" woman, who had a thriving business. PC Palmer's sister Angela said he had ""died protecting strangers whilst doing his job and he will be remembered by many for his courage and bravery"". Chief Inspector Neil Sawyer said the 48-year-old constable had made the ""ultimate sacrifice"". Amanda Rhodes, the niece of retired window cleaner Mr Rhodes, told the inquest the family was ""devastated"" and ""incredibly angry"" about the 75-year-old's death. Flowers and candles were left on Westminster Bridge in tribute to the victims The inquest is set to last about five weeks. A separate inquest into the death of Masood will be held but only once the one into his victims' deaths has concluded. The coroner is expected to examine Masood's background, police records, and look into the fact that he briefly featured in MI5 investigations in 2009 and 2010. The absence of armed officers at the scene will also be examined. Who was attacker Khalid Masood?

"Social Democrat supporters in Stockholm. Their party finished first again, but its vote fell The Swedish general election has left the two main political blocs almost tied, with the anti-immigration party making gains on its previous results. With nearly all ballots counted, the governing centre-left coalition is marginally ahead of its centre-right Alliance rivals, with around 40% each. The nationalist Sweden Democrats (SD) have won about  18% of the vote, up from 12.9% in the previous election. A protracted battle to form a working coalition now looks certain. Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? Both of the main blocs have refused to govern with the SD, although its leader said he was prepared to talk with all other parties. ""We will increase our seats in parliament and we will gain huge influence over what happens in Sweden during the coming weeks, months and years,"" Jimmie Akesson told a party rally. He had hoped to gain the support of one in five, or even one in four, Swedes, which some polls had also predicted. However, the results were closer to one in six. Other European countries have seen support rise for anti-immigration parties in recent years. Earlier this year, Italy installed a new coalition government run by the anti-establishment Five Star and the right-wing League. In 2017  the far-right Alternative for Germany won 12.6% of votes, and The Danish People's Party won 21% in 2015. Sweden has become accustomed to coalition governments and no one was expecting an outright winning party in this election. The current coalition, headed by outgoing PM Stefan Lofven, is made up of his Social Democrats and the Green Party, and is supported in parliament by the Left Party. On the other side, the centre-right Alliance is made up of four parties: the Moderates, the Centre, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats. It was formed in 2004 to counter decades of dominance by the Social Democrats. The main party in the Alliance is the centre-right Moderates and they have proposed Ulf Kristersson as their candidate for PM. Sweden uses a system of proportional representation, under which each party is allocated a number of seats in each constituency that is broadly in line with its share of the vote. Neither of the leading alliances has reached the threshold of 175 seats, which is needed to govern. Mr Lofven's bloc holds 144 seats and the Alliance holds one less. Overseas votes, which could make a slight change to the outcome, have not yet been counted and the final result is not expected until Wednesday. Lengthy negotiations will follow to attempt to form a workable government. One option could be for one of the parties to switch alliances. PM Stefan Lofven saw his party get its worst results in years At a party rally on Sunday night, Mr Lofven refused to quit. ""We have two weeks left until parliament opens. I will work on calmly, as prime minister, respecting voters and the Swedish electoral system,"" he said. By Gavin Lee, BBC News in Stockholm The headline in a Swedish National newspaper says it all, DÃ¶tt Lopp, which means Dead Heat. The governing Social Democrat party is the largest party, but because the centre left doesn't have a collective majority, it can't govern together in a coalition. The opposition Moderate party is also unable to take over because even an established alliance with the centre-right parties doesn't make up the numbers needed for a majority. Hence the leader of the nationalist Sweden Democrats, Jimmy Akesson's claim, that he is the ""kingmaker"" being the third most popular party - but that's a simplified view. No other party will consider the anti-migrant hard-right group in any form of coalition. The Sweden Democrats could however play a role as possible home-wrecker for the Prime Minister Stefan Lofven. In roughly two weeks, Mr Lofven faces a confidence vote in parliament. If he is forced to stand down, parliament would be dissolved and fresh coalition attempts would start in September. Mr Akesson says Mr Lofven's party must enter into a dialogue with him, otherwise he will support a no confidence vote alongside the main opposition alliance and Mr Lofven would certainly go. The prime minister must choose between: risking losing core voters by dealing with the party he calls racist; and bargaining, for the sake of his career. The SD was linked for years to neo-Nazis and other far-right groups, only entering parliament in 2010. It has been working to rebrand itself, changing its logo from a flaming torch (similar to the one used by the UK far-right National Front) to a blue-and-yellow daisy, the colours of the Swedish flag. Jimmie Akesson said the SD now had ""huge influence"" Traditionally appealing to working-class men, it wants to attract more women and higher-income voters. Mr Akesson says there is zero tolerance towards racism in the party and several members have been expelled. However, the party has still been embroiled in various racism scandals. One municipal candidate shared a song on Facebook with the lyrics ""Swedes are white and the country is ours"", according to a report in tabloid Aftonbladet. Sweden's economy is booming but many voters are concerned that housing, healthcare and welfare services have come under pressure from a wave of immigration during the 2015 migrant crisis. The campaign has been dominated by immigration issues That year Sweden took in a record 163,000 asylum seekers - the highest such intake in the EU, per head of population. Sweden's traditional parties have since hardened their tone to reflect concerns about integration. Many voters are also concerned about violence. The SD links a rise in shootings to increased immigration, although official figures show no correlation. Is Malmo the 'rape capital' of Europe? The SD also wants to leave the European Union and has proposed a ""Swexit"" referendum. However, the centrist parties all oppose such a vote, so it is unlikely to go ahead. Aside from immigration, climate change is an issue many Swedes care about - particularly after a long, hot summer and severe forest fires. In pictures: Fighting the Swedish wildfires Sweden country profile During the heatwave, around 25,000 hectares of forest burned in wildfires. Support for the Green party, which had been struggling after various internal scandals, has crept up across the country. Have you voted in the Swedish election?

"Former chief superintendent David Duckenfield appeared via videolink at Preston Crown Court Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield has pleaded not guilty to the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool supporters. The former chief superintendent, 74, appeared via videolink at Preston Crown Court for a trial preparation hearing. The names of the 95 men, women and children he is charged with unlawfully killing were read out in court as the charge was put to him. About 15 family members of victims were in the public gallery. Mr Duckenfield, wearing a suit with a blue shirt and purple tie, spoke to confirm his name and enter his plea. He was the police officer in charge at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989. Former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell, 68, also pleaded not guilty to contravening a term or condition of the stadium's safety certificate and one health and safety offence. Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown, Dorset, is charged in relation to 95 people who died following the crush in the terrace pens of Sheffield Wednesday's ground. Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused. In June, Judge Sir Peter Openshaw lifted a historical stay put in place on Mr Duckenfield in 2000 which had halted further legal proceedings against him.

"Lee Boxell went missing on 10 September 1988, at the age of 15 The father of a teenager who went missing 30 years ago has pleaded with the public to end his ""limbo"" and help reveal if the boy was murdered or is still living. It was feared Lee Boxell, 15, may have been killed after witnessing child abuse at a teenagers' hangout near his home in Sutton, south-west London. Monday marks 30 years since he went missing on 10 September 1988. Lee's father Peter has issued a fresh appeal through charity Missing People. Peter Boxell has issued a fresh appeal through charity Missing People ""I have been living in limbo for 30 years, not knowing if he is alive, safe and well, or if he was murdered,"" Mr Boxell said.

It is possible that he had gone there to meet friends on the day he went missing. Lee may have been the victim of sexual assault In 2013, the Met carried out its longest ever forensic archaeological dig.

"Among the species for sale were Asiatic black bears and common palm civets More than 1,500 listings of live animals for sale have been found on Facebook in Thailand by a wildlife trafficking watchdog. Traffic, which monitors such activity, said many of the species, despite having international protection, were not native to the country, and so trading them was unregulated. The listings were found on 12 Facebook groups during one month in 2016. Facebook said it did not allow the trade of endangered species. Among the 200 different species listed for sale were two non-native species banned from international commercial trade - the Eurasian otter and the black spotted turtle. Some of the animals for sale which are banned from international commercial trade are native to Thailand, such as the helmeted hornbill and Siamese crocodile - which are both critically endangered - and the Asiatic black bear. Although only one helmeted hornbill was discovered for sale, Traffic said the critical status of the species meant that any number taken out of wild populations would have ""serious implications"" for its survival. Traffic's findings are to be published this week in a report on the use of Facebook for animal trading in Thailand. The anti-trafficking body analysed membership of the Facebook groups in 2016 and then again two years later. It found that, while two groups had ceased to exist, total membership had almost doubled - up from 106,111 in 2016 to 203,445 in 2018. The adverts included live and dead animals, as well as animal parts in some cases. Thailand's wildlife protection laws did not prohibit the sale of 47% of the advertised species - this was sometimes the case with non-native species. There were 105 species for sale despite protections under Thai law. ""Growing online wildlife trade will only pile further pressure on threatened non-native species that currently have no legal protection or regulation,"" said Kanitha Krishnasamy, Traffic's acting regional director in south-east Asia. The slow loris was the most commonly advertised animal A spokeswoman for Facebook said: ""Facebook does not allow the sale or trade of endangered species or their parts, and we remove this material as soon as we are aware of it. ""We are committed to working with Traffic and law enforcement authorities to help tackle the illegal online trade of wildlife in Thailand."" Cath Lawson, acting chief adviser for wildlife at conservation charity WWF, said the illegal trade of animals via websites was a growing concern. ""The illegal wildlife trade is a serious international crime problem,"" she said. ""It takes place in the real world, but also increasingly in digital spaces. ""This is a global problem and needs global solutions, which include increasing law enforcement, raising awareness and reducing demand for wildlife products.

I will work on calmly, as prime minister, respecting voters and the Swedish electoral system,"" he said. By Gavin Lee, BBC News in Stockholm The headline in a Swedish National newspaper says it all, DÃ¶tt Lopp, which means Dead Heat. The governing Social Democrat party is the largest party, but because the centre left doesn't have a collective majority, it can't govern together in a coalition. The opposition Moderate party is also unable to take over because even an established alliance with the centre-right parties doesn't make up the numbers needed for a majority. Hence the leader of the nationalist Sweden Democrats, Jimmy Akesson's claim, that he is the ""kingmaker"" being the third most popular party - but that's a simplified view. No other party will consider the anti-migrant hard-right group in any form of coalition. The Sweden Democrats could however play a role as possible home-wrecker for the Prime Minister Stefan Lofven. In roughly two weeks, Mr Lofven faces a confidence vote in parliament. If he is forced to stand down, parliament would be dissolved and fresh coalition attempts would start in September. Mr Akesson says Mr Lofven's party must enter into a dialogue with him, otherwise he will support a no confidence vote alongside the main opposition alliance and Mr Lofven would certainly go. The prime minister must choose between: risking losing core voters by dealing with the party he calls racist; and bargaining, for the sake of his career. The SD was linked for years to neo-Nazis and other far-right groups, only entering parliament in 2010. It has been working to rebrand itself, changing its logo from a flaming torch (similar to the one used by the UK far-right National Front) to a blue-and-yellow daisy, the colours of the Swedish flag. Jimmie Akesson said the SD now had ""huge influence"" Traditionally appealing to working-class men, it wants to attract more women and higher-income voters. Mr Akesson says there is zero tolerance towards racism in the party and several members have been expelled. However, the party has still been embroiled in various racism scandals. One municipal candidate shared a song on Facebook with the lyrics ""Swedes are white and the country is ours"", according to a report in tabloid Aftonbladet. Sweden's economy is booming but many voters are concerned that housing, healthcare and welfare services have come under pressure from a wave of immigration during the 2015 migrant crisis. The campaign has been dominated by immigration issues That year Sweden took in a record 163,000 asylum seekers - the highest such intake in the EU, per head of population. Sweden's traditional parties have since hardened their tone to reflect concerns about integration. Many voters are also concerned about violence. The SD links a rise in shootings to increased immigration, although official figures show no correlation. Is Malmo the 'rape capital' of Europe? The SD also wants to leave the European Union and has proposed a ""Swexit"" referendum. However, the centrist parties all oppose such a vote, so it is unlikely to go ahead. Aside from immigration, climate change is an issue many Swedes care about - particularly after a long, hot summer and severe forest fires. In pictures: Fighting the Swedish wildfires Sweden country profile During the heatwave, around 25,000 hectares of forest burned in wildfires. Support for the Green party, which had been struggling after various internal scandals, has crept up across the country. Have you voted in the Swedish election?

"Mr Johnson described Theresa May's Brexit plans as 'feeble and pathetic' Boris Johnson's call to scrap the Northern Ireland backstop has been called ""foolish"" and ""incendiary"". The MP has hit out at Theresa May's Brexit plans,accusing her of wrapping a suicide vest around the UK. Sinn FÃ©in said the comments showed Northern Ireland was ""collateral damage"" for party in-fighting. The SDLP said Mr Johnson was ""deliberately simplifying"" the Irish border issue. However, the DUP welcomed the former foreign secretary's input. The UK and the EU signed upto the principle of a backstop in December 2017, but neither can agree on what it should look like in a legally binding text. 'Political declaration needed for backstop' Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The hardest border - BBC News The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean NI staying in the customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system. But the UK government has rejected it as a threat to the integrity of the UK and has suggested a backstop that would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020. In his piece for the Mail on Sunday, Mr Johnson accused the EU of ""bullying"" the UK - but questioned why the response had been ""so utterly feeble"". He said the reason for this was ""simple"", namely Northern Ireland and the ""insanity of the so-called backstop"", and called for it to be scrapped. Mr Johnson said agreeing to a backstop had ""opened ourselves to perpetual political blackmail"" and given Brussels the ability to ""crack apart the Union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland"". Both the UK and the EU have said they do not want to see a hard Irish border Speaking to BBC News, Sinn FÃ©in MLA MÃ¡irtin Ã Muilleoir said Mr Johnson's comments were ""appalling"" and the language was ""foolish and dangerous"". ""Anyone who doesn't understand how fragile the peace here is, and how fragile the progress we have made is, mustn't be watching the news because for 600 days we haven't been able to form a local government here because fault lines within this society remain,"" he said. The SDLP's Brexit Spokesperson Claire Hanna said Mr Johnson had ""absolutely no regard for people on this island"". ""He is completely indifferent to the complexities of issues here; he is deliberately simplifying things and is implying the border issue is about marking a line and completely ignoring regulatory issues, as well as all of the political issues that plummet into peace and the Good Friday Agreement."" However, Sammy Wilson from the DUP welcomed the former foreign secretary's input. In a statement the MP for East Antrim said he wished Mr Johnson had made the comments sooner and that he believes the backstop needs to be rewritten. ""Those crying loudest are embarrassed at the truth of the impact of the arrogant EU demands on the UK being exposed,"" said Mr Wilson. ""Boris Johnson is saying nothing that the DUP has not been saying since the withdrawal agreement was first drafted in December 2017. ""The reason why we stopped it being signed in its original form was precisely for the reasons which Boris Johnson has outlined."" Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected the EU's backstop option The UK is due to leave the EU in just over six months' time. During the summer the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, referred on several occasions to the EU's willingness to ""improve"" the backstop. But he gave no indication that there would be significant movement on its substance. Several of the pro-remain parties in Northern Ireland are due to travel to Brussels later this monthto meet Mr Barnier about the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland.

"Chef and author Jamie Oliver is teaming up with Tesco for the first time to promote the company's food products. He has created a series of recipes and tips for Tesco, which will include ""healthier"" recipes from scratch. His fee has not been disclosed. Mr Oliver earned more than Â£10m from a previous 11-year deal with rival store chain Sainsbury, which ended in 2011. His restaurants, in common with many other High Street chains, have been closing branches to curb costs. In an interview with the Financial Times newspaper last week,external, he revealed he had put Â£13m of his own money into his Jamie's Italian restaurant business. Last month, Mr Oliver said he was considering selling his Barbecoa steakhouses and he is in the process of shutting about a third of his Jamie's Italian outlets as part of a rescue plan with creditors that would enable it to continue trading. Jamie Oliver in his first 1999 ""Naked Chef"" series Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket, said the campaign would see Mr Oliver promote ""helpful little swaps"" in stores, suggesting healthier alternatives with reduced levels of sugar, salt and fat. The retailer said a basket of these swaps would cost about 12% less than a regular basket. Independent retail adviser, Richard Hyman, said the tie-up was unlikely to bring in many new customers, but added that this was not necessarily the intention: ""It's a positive move but not a game changer. ""I'm not sure there's any single thing that is a game changer in what is a vastly rougher game than ever. What it does do is provide reassurance to customers, like celebrities do in fashion retailing. And he will help draw existing customers to a broader range of products."" Jamie Oliver left school with just two GCSEs but was ""discovered"" by a film crew while working at the River Cafe restaurant in west London. His Naked Chef TV series in 1999 made him a household name and he has written more than 20 books. He has campaigned on a number of health issues, including school meals and battery farmed chickens and eggs, and he was awarded an MBE in 2003.

"This video can not be played CCTV footage shows Kurt and Melissa Cochran moments before Westminster attack Lives were torn apart by ""82 seconds of high and terrible drama"" in the 2017 Westminster attack, an inquest into their deaths has been told. Khalid Masood ran down and killed four people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a policeman to death. The attack, on 22 March, ""cruelly and brutally"" ripped victims from their families, said the husband of Aysha Frade, who was killed on the bridge. Tributes to the five have been read out on the first day of the hearing. Those hit by Masood's car were Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes, Aysha Frade, and Andreea Cristea. PC Keith Palmer was killed in the forecourt of the Palace of Westminster. He made the ""ultimate sacrifice"", a colleague told the Old Bailey. Victims of the Westminster terror attack Westminster attack: What happened Masood was shot dead at the scene by armed police officers. Judge Mark Lucraft QC, chief coroner of England and Wales, said ""the lives of many were torn apart by high and terrible drama"" that day in little more than a minute. He warned that video footage shown during the inquest would be ""graphic and shocking"" and some family members chose to leave the court when it was played. Among the images shown was one of the moment US tourist Kurt Cochran saved his wife's life by pushing her away from the path of Masood's car before being hit by it himself. Gareth Patterson QC, representing three of the victims' families, said people were hit like ""human bowling pins"" and ""thrown in the air like rag dolls"". Mr Patterson said Masood would have ""seen and heard every impact as he drove over the bridge"", suggesting there was ""no getting away from the barbarity of what happened and the inhumanity of what took place"". Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives Det Supt John Crossley, who led the police investigation, said the attack began at 14:40 when Masood's vehicle, a rented Hyundai Tucson, mounted the kerb on Westminster Bridge, travelling at an average of 31mph. Mr Cochran - who was standing with his wife at the south end of the bridge - was the first to be hit. The CCTV also showed Mr Rhodes being knocked into the air and dragged by Masood's car. He was taken to hospital, but died the following day from head injuries. Ms Frade was thrown 17 metres into a bus lane, then fell under a slow-moving oncoming bus. Ms Cristea was knocked into the Thames from the bridge and was in the water for nearly nine minutes before being rescued. She died just over two weeks later. After crashing his car, Masood got out and ran around the fence to enter the Palace of Westminster's Carriage Gate, where he continued his attack. PC Palmer, who was unarmed, challenged him but was forced backwards into the Parliamentary estate and stabbed. One of the CCTV images seen in court showed Masood standing over PC Palmer with a knife in each hand. The court heard two of his colleagues ran towards the attacker to give PC Palmer the chance to get away, but he collapsed a short distance away. At the beginning of the hearing, a minute's silence was held and members of the victims' families embraced one another. The families and friends of victims read out tributes to their loved ones. First was Mr Cochran's sister-in-law, Angela Stoll, who read out a tribute on behalf of his wife Melissa, who had travelled to the inquest from the US. Melissa Payne Cochran's sister read a statement on her behalf She said: ""I was so lucky to have had 25 wonderful years with the man of my dreams. He made me laugh every single day. She said she was ""forever grateful"" for their time together, ""and especially his heroic actions on that day, saving my life"". By BBC News correspondent Helena Lee, at the Old Bailey Relatives of those who died came to court number one today, nearly 18 months after the attack, to share their memories, their pain and their loss. They read, through tears, powerful tributes to their loved ones from the witness box in front of a full, hushed courtroom. Pictures of those who died were put up on big screens for all to see. As the events of that day last March were recalled, the coroner warned them of the harrowing and graphic footage ahead. He told them they could leave if they wanted to - and some did. Those left behind watched as the horrifying footage was played of the attacker driving erratically along Westminster Bridge and ploughing into pedestrians. The families will return to the Old Bailey on Tuesday. They'll be hoping the days and weeks ahead will give them answers about the final moments of their loved ones' lives. Ms Frade's husband John said she had been ""cruelly and brutally ripped away from us"". ""Her spirit lives on in the eyes of her children,"" he added. John Frade told the court his wife's spirit lived on Romanian interior designer Ms Cristea, who would have turned 33 on the day the inquest began, was walking with her boyfriend Andrei Burnaz on a visit to London when she was hit. Andreea Cristea was visiting London with her boyfriend Her family described her as a ""lovely, enchanting and life-loving"" woman, who had a thriving business. PC Palmer's sister Angela said he had ""died protecting strangers whilst doing his job and he will be remembered by many for his courage and bravery"". Chief Inspector Neil Sawyer said the 48-year-old constable had made the ""ultimate sacrifice"". Amanda Rhodes, the niece of retired window cleaner Mr Rhodes, told the inquest the family was ""devastated"" and ""incredibly angry"" about the 75-year-old's death. Flowers and candles were left on Westminster Bridge in tribute to the victims The inquest is set to last about five weeks. A separate inquest into the death of Masood will be held but only once the one into his victims' deaths has concluded. The coroner is expected to examine Masood's background, police records, and look into the fact that he briefly featured in MI5 investigations in 2009 and 2010. The absence of armed officers at the scene will also be examined. Who was attacker Khalid Masood?

"Boris Johnson has faced criticism from fellow MPs for his language in the Mail on Sunday article Boris Johnson has attacked Theresa's May's Brexit plan, saying she had ""wrapped a suicide vest"" around the British constitution and ""handed the detonator"" to Brussels. In the Mail on Sunday,external, the former foreign secretary said the Chequers deal was ""feeble"" and ""pathetic"". He has been strongly criticised by some Tories - one minister said it marked a ""disgusting moment"" in politics. And Home Secretary Sajid Javid called for ""measured language"" to be used. Writing in the same paper,external, the current Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for people to rally behind Mrs May, backing her to hold the line ""in the face of intense pressure"". The UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, and the government's plan - agreed at Chequers in July - has sparked criticism from Brexiteer Tories as well as the EU. PSNI chief warning over post Brexit threat EU 'strongly opposed' to PM's Brexit plan The Chequers plan explained In his article, Mr Johnson accused the EU of ""bullying"" the UK - but questioned why the response had been ""so utterly feeble"". He said that rather than getting a ""generous free trade deal"", Britain is saying, ""yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir"", to Brussels.

Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said the ""scathing remarks"" by Mr Johnson showed his ""willingness to challenge the prime minister remains undimmed"" after recent revelations about his private life. It is Mr Johnson'ssecond attack on the prime minister's Brexit strategy inside a week, as last Monday he said the Chequers deal ""means disaster"" for Britain - Downing Street responded to that attack by saying he had offered ""no new ideas"". While Mr Javid voiced measured criticism of Mr Johnson, other Tories reacted more angrily to his remarks. Former Army officer and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat graphically described the aftermath of a suicide bomb that had gone off near his office in Helmand province, Afghanistan.

Another Foreign Office minister, Alistair Burt, tweeted: ""I'm stunned at the nature of this attack. There is no justification for such an outrageous, inappropriate and hurtful analogy. ""If we don't stop this extraordinary use of language over Brexit, our country might never heal. Again, I say, enough."" But backbench Tory MP Nadine Dorries defended Mr Johnson in the face of what she was ""vitriol"", saying his critics were ""terrified of his popular appeal"". And Tory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said the way Mr Johnson ""says it how he sees it and speaks truth unto power"" was ""something that endears him to a huge swathe of the British public"". On the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid said: ""I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences. I think it's a reminder for all of us in public policy, whichever political party we represent, to use measured language because I think that's what the public want to see."" He backed the Chequers proposals which he said represented ""the only deal that we've got on the table"". In his Mail on Sunday article, Mr Hunt said Parliament would get to debate and vote on any agreement, adding: ""Until then, we should not rush to judgement on a deal that is still under negotiation."" It is the first public comment from Mr Johnson since he and his wife, Marina Wheeler,confirmed they were getting divorcedearlier this week. The announcement followed newspaper allegations the former London mayor had been having an extra-marital affair. The Sunday Times has reported,externalthat Mrs May's aides wrote a 4,000-word ""dirty dossier"" on Mr Johnson in 2016, exposing a ""catalogue of lurid allegations"" against him. The paper says it has seen the document - said to have been written during the Conservative leadership contest - but officials at Downing Street and Conservative Campaign Headquarters have denied circulating it. Elsewhere the National Police Chiefs' Council said there was no intelligence to suggest there would be an increase in crime or disorder if the UK and the EU cannot agree a deal.

It also warned that the ""necessity to call on military assistance is a real possibility"" in the weeks after UK's departure from the EU.

"Evidence is marked out in north-east Paris French police have detained a man who stabbed seven people, injuring four seriously, in an attack on tourists and passers-by in Paris. The man, wielding a knife and iron bar, struck just before 23:00 (21:00 GMT) by a canal in Paris's 19th district. People playingpÃ©tanque-  a French bowling game - threw metal balls at the attacker, and he was overpowered. The man, said to be Afghan, was soon arrested. The incident is currently not being treated as a terrorist attack. Among the victims were two British tourists - police say the two men, in their fifties, suffered serious stab wounds to the chest and stomach. The knifeman initially stabbed two men and a woman near the MK2 cinema on the Quai de Loire, along the Ourcq canal on Sunday, reports say. Eyewitness Youssef Najah, 28, said he was walking beside the canal when he saw a man running and holding a knife about 25-30cm (10-11 inches) long. ""There were around 20 people chasing him. They started throwing pÃ©tanque balls at him,"" he said. PÃ©tanque is typically played with hand-sized hollow metal balls (file photo) ""Around four or five balls hit him in the head, but they weren't able to stop him,"" he added. The man then reportedly attacked the two British tourists in a nearby street. The British embassy in Paris told the BBC: ""Our consular staff are assisting two British people who have been hospitalised in Paris, and are in contact with French medical staff who are treating them.""

"Les Moonves is one of the most powerful men in US media The head of US media giant CBS, Les Moonves, has resigned with immediate effect following allegations of sexual misconduct. CBS had been investigating Mr Moonves since allegations appeared in the New Yorker in July - and fresh accusations from six more women appeared on Sunday. Mr Moonves, 68, denies the allegations, calling the latest ""appalling"". In a statement CBS said a $20m (Â£15.4m) would be paid immediately in support of the #MeToo movement. It said one or more organisations that supported #MeToo and female workplace equality stood to benefit, but did not specify which. The donation has been deducted from any severance benefits that may be due to Mr Moonves - the amount of which is pending the results of an ongoing independent investigation into his conduct. How can businesses tackle sexual harassment?,external What has #MeToo actually changed?,external Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo,external They appear in anew article in the New Yorker by Ronan Farrow,external, who also authored the July piece and this year shared a Pulitzer Prize for detailingassault accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein,external. The allegations have sparked a campaign for the removal of Mr Moonves The six women in the latest piece allege sexual harassment or assault by Mr Moonves between the 1980s and the first decade of this century. Some allege he forced them to perform oral sex or exposed himself without their consent. Some say he damaged their careers when they rebuffed him. TV executive Phyllis Golden-Gottlieb and writer Jessica Pallingston are two of the women who give graphic descriptions of the misconduct they accuse Mr Moonves of carrying out. Under Mr Moonves' leadership, CBS has been the most-watched network in the US. He developed hits like CSI and The Big Bang Theory, while his $69.3m (Â£53m) earnings in 2017 made him one of the highest paid chief executives in the world. His tenure at the top of CBS, which he joined in 1995, has been marked by a power struggle with Shari Redstone who, through her family's business National Amusements, is the controlling shareholder in both CBS and the media conglomerate, Viacom. Ms Redstone and Mr Moonves had been engaged in a court battle as he tried to thwart her plan to merge CBS and Viacom. But the announcement of Mr Moonves' departure came at the same time as CBS said it was ending legal action against National Amusements.  For its part, National Amusements said it would not seek a merger between the two companies for the next two years. In a statement it announced that Mr Moonves would step down as chairman, president and CEO with immediate effect. Joseph Ianniello will serve as president and acting CEO. The Financial Times said Mr Moonves was resigning because this would entitle him to a hefty severance package, including stock options. US media said the resignation package for Mr Moonves could amount to $100m. However, CBS said he would not receive any severance benefits until the result of an independent investigation into him. In a separate move, six directors have stepped down and six new ones have been elected. Mr Moonves issued a statement on Sunday saying: ""Untrue allegations from decades ago are now being made against me that are not consistent with who I am."" The New Yorker quoted a statement in which he says: ""The appalling accusations in this article are untrue. What is true is that I had consensual relations with three of the women some 25 years ago before I came to CBS. ""And I have never used my position to hinder the advancement or careers of women. In my 40 years of work, I have never before heard of such disturbing accusations."" A further six women also accused Mr Moonves earlier this year. All of them said they believed their careers had suffered because they rejected his advances. At the time Mr Moonves said he ""may have made some women uncomfortable"" in the past, adding: ""Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected... that 'no' means 'no'. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

"This video can not be played CCTV footage shows Kurt and Melissa Cochran moments before Westminster attack Lives were torn apart by ""82 seconds of high and terrible drama"" in the 2017 Westminster attack, an inquest into their deaths has been told. Khalid Masood ran down and killed four people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a policeman to death. The attack, on 22 March, ""cruelly and brutally"" ripped victims from their families, said the husband of Aysha Frade, who was killed on the bridge. Tributes to the five have been read out on the first day of the hearing. Those hit by Masood's car were Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes, Aysha Frade, and Andreea Cristea. PC Keith Palmer was killed in the forecourt of the Palace of Westminster. He made the ""ultimate sacrifice"", a colleague told the Old Bailey. Victims of the Westminster terror attack Westminster attack: What happened Masood was shot dead at the scene by armed police officers. Judge Mark Lucraft QC, chief coroner of England and Wales, said ""the lives of many were torn apart by high and terrible drama"" that day in little more than a minute. He warned that video footage shown during the inquest would be ""graphic and shocking"" and some family members chose to leave the court when it was played. Among the images shown was one of the moment US tourist Kurt Cochran saved his wife's life by pushing her away from the path of Masood's car before being hit by it himself. Gareth Patterson QC, representing three of the victims' families, said people were hit like ""human bowling pins"" and ""thrown in the air like rag dolls"". Mr Patterson said Masood would have ""seen and heard every impact as he drove over the bridge"", suggesting there was ""no getting away from the barbarity of what happened and the inhumanity of what took place"". Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives Det Supt John Crossley, who led the police investigation, said the attack began at 14:40 when Masood's vehicle, a rented Hyundai Tucson, mounted the kerb on Westminster Bridge, travelling at an average of 31mph. Mr Cochran - who was standing with his wife at the south end of the bridge - was the first to be hit. The CCTV also showed Mr Rhodes being knocked into the air and dragged by Masood's car. He was taken to hospital, but died the following day from head injuries. Ms Frade was thrown 17 metres into a bus lane, then fell under a slow-moving oncoming bus. Ms Cristea was knocked into the Thames from the bridge and was in the water for nearly nine minutes before being rescued. She died just over two weeks later. After crashing his car, Masood got out and ran around the fence to enter the Palace of Westminster's Carriage Gate, where he continued his attack. PC Palmer, who was unarmed, challenged him but was forced backwards into the Parliamentary estate and stabbed. One of the CCTV images seen in court showed Masood standing over PC Palmer with a knife in each hand. The court heard two of his colleagues ran towards the attacker to give PC Palmer the chance to get away, but he collapsed a short distance away. At the beginning of the hearing, a minute's silence was held and members of the victims' families embraced one another. The families and friends of victims read out tributes to their loved ones. First was Mr Cochran's sister-in-law, Angela Stoll, who read out a tribute on behalf of his wife Melissa, who had travelled to the inquest from the US. Melissa Payne Cochran's sister read a statement on her behalf She said: ""I was so lucky to have had 25 wonderful years with the man of my dreams. He made me laugh every single day. She said she was ""forever grateful"" for their time together, ""and especially his heroic actions on that day, saving my life"". By BBC News correspondent Helena Lee, at the Old Bailey Relatives of those who died came to court number one today, nearly 18 months after the attack, to share their memories, their pain and their loss. They read, through tears, powerful tributes to their loved ones from the witness box in front of a full, hushed courtroom. Pictures of those who died were put up on big screens for all to see. As the events of that day last March were recalled, the coroner warned them of the harrowing and graphic footage ahead. He told them they could leave if they wanted to - and some did. Those left behind watched as the horrifying footage was played of the attacker driving erratically along Westminster Bridge and ploughing into pedestrians. The families will return to the Old Bailey on Tuesday. They'll be hoping the days and weeks ahead will give them answers about the final moments of their loved ones' lives. Ms Frade's husband John said she had been ""cruelly and brutally ripped away from us"". ""Her spirit lives on in the eyes of her children,"" he added. John Frade told the court his wife's spirit lived on Romanian interior designer Ms Cristea, who would have turned 33 on the day the inquest began, was walking with her boyfriend Andrei Burnaz on a visit to London when she was hit. Andreea Cristea was visiting London with her boyfriend Her family described her as a ""lovely, enchanting and life-loving"" woman, who had a thriving business. PC Palmer's sister Angela said he had ""died protecting strangers whilst doing his job and he will be remembered by many for his courage and bravery"". Chief Inspector Neil Sawyer said the 48-year-old constable had made the ""ultimate sacrifice"". Amanda Rhodes, the niece of retired window cleaner Mr Rhodes, told the inquest the family was ""devastated"" and ""incredibly angry"" about the 75-year-old's death. Flowers and candles were left on Westminster Bridge in tribute to the victims The inquest is set to last about five weeks. A separate inquest into the death of Masood will be held but only once the one into his victims' deaths has concluded. The coroner is expected to examine Masood's background, police records, and look into the fact that he briefly featured in MI5 investigations in 2009 and 2010. The absence of armed officers at the scene will also be examined. Who was attacker Khalid Masood?

"This video can not be played ""I don't see why four days is not doable for most people"" A four-day working week will be possible this century if businesses are forced to share the benefits of new technology with their workforce. That's the claim from the TUC, which is using its annual conference to call on the government to take action to help people work less but get paid the same. Artificial intelligence, robotics and automation could provide a Â£200bn UK economic boost in the next decade. At one Welsh firm staff already get a full salary for four days work. Mark Hooper, founder of Cardiff-based IndyCube, said the transition to this new working arrangement over the last 18 months had not always been easy. ""We felt we had an opportunity to prove something, that you can be as productive in four days as five, and it has been worth it,"" he said. Now the company is outputting more and expanding outside of Wales. His colleague Russ Todd spreads his time out to help with school runs and family time. Russ Todd says the arrangement gives him more flexibility with his time ""My father would work long hours. He was up before I was up and he was home after I went to bed,"" he said. ""It is important to be there. It matters."" Employee Mari Dunning has used some of her extra time to get a collection of poetry published, amongst more menial tasks. Or if you use the extra day to get the housework done, ""you've then got your weekend wide open"", she said. ""I don't see why four days is not doable for most people,"" she added. But for most British workers the trend is going in the other direction. Some 1.4 million people now work a full seven days a week in the UK, according to the TUC, and 51% of people they surveyed said they feared the benefits of new technology would go to company managers and shareholders. A report this January from Centre for Cities found that 3.6m UK jobs could be replaced by machines by 2030. The TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady highlighted that unions had fought for two-day weekends and limits on long hours - and that this is their next challenge. Frances O'Grady has led the TUC since 2013 ""We know that some people are pessimistic about whether technology will make their lives better but technology could be a force for good, we can also make everyone's working lives better and richer,"" she explained. ""It doesn't have to be about surveillance and exploitation. This could be about creating more satisfying work."" But that may not be easy. The Communication and Workers Union just took on that fight - to have the benefits of automation evenly shared - at the Royal Mail. When the postal service invested in new sorting machines - thus cutting down on the amount of time workers were needed to sort out packages - it wanted the staff to work extended delivery rounds instead. New tech disrupted the working week for staff at Royal Mail Terry Pullinger was the lead union rep on the dispute that took two years to resolve. ""Our objective was to work towards a 35-hour week,"" he said. ""Crucial to us was to protect as many jobs as possible with the technology that is coming in, which is taking out a lot of the work that our members are doing.

"This video can not be played BBC Reporter Jonathan Gibson confronts someone who illegally supplied number plates to him. DVLA registered companies are selling vehicle licence plates to drivers without carrying out proper checks, a BBC investigation has found. In some cases this has led to registered owners facing fines or arrest when it wrongly appears their vehicles are involved in crime. One Birmingham firm made cloned plates in 10 minutes, with no log book checks. When confronted, another licence plate retailer said the business did not ""deliberately flout its obligations"". A vehicle user should be asked to prove their name and address and their right to use the registration number when they ask for a new licence plate to be made. Failure to make these checks can lead to companies producing plates showing licence numbers the buyers have no right to use, leaving them free to drive a vehicle bearing the identity of someone else's car. Adam Shirley's plates were able to be produced for a third time in as little as 10 minutes Neither the DVLA nor the police could provide an accurate figure for the number of cloned cars on the road, but told the BBC it was a significant problem. Midlands Live: Man guilty of 'rough sex' murder; Funding bid for Shakespeare birthplace Adam Shirley, from Camberley in Surrey, has received 18 letters demanding a total of more than Â£1,000 in fines after vehicles bearing his licence number picked up parking tickets in places he has not been to. Most came from the London borough of Wandsworth, 30 miles away. ""I'm kind of scared that someone will commit a bigger crime using a car with my licence plate on it,"" he said. You can only get a number plate made by a registered supplier The supplier will need to see original documents that prove your name and address The dealer must also see original documents showing you are allowed to use the registration number Details of registered suppliers and the documents you can use areavailable on the government website,external Two Birmingham retailers both failed to demand to see a log book, despite it being a DVLA requirement for all registered retailers, when a BBC undercover reporter asked for number plates to be made. One, Numberplatesrus, supplied three cloned plates and was able to produce a set in just 10 minutes. An employee claimed to have ""software with DVLA"" that ""comes up with your name and reg and stuff"" upon payment. The DVLA said no such system existed. The opioids being sold from a Birmingham doorstep Post workers 'paid to steal bank cards' Cloned cars being sold in eBay scam Undercover BBC reporter Jonathan Gibson was able to clone a BBC registered vehicle At another shop in Handsworth, C&C Car Spares and Accessories, nobody demanded to see a vehicle log book, and staff made a copy of Mr Shirley's already-cloned plates and also supplied plates from a BBC-registered vehicle. In a letter, C&C Car Spares and Accessories accepted there had been ""some failings"" after it was secretly filmed selling plates without the required checks, but said it felt ""deliberately and purposefully duped"". The owner said he would ""remain vigilant to ensure he is not placed in this position in future"". A DVLA spokesperson advised motorists who believed their plates had been cloned to contact police and said it undertook ""spot checks to ensure suppliers producing number plates are doing so correctly"".

"Final recommendations for new parliamentary boundaries that could see the number of MPs cut from 650 to 600 have been published. The Boundary Commission proposals, which still need to secure the backing of MPs and peers, have been laid in Parliament. The commission said it was ""confident"" in its new map, which covers constituencies across the UK. Parliament approved the principle of reducing the number of MPs in 2011. Since then, the Boundary Commissions ofEngland,external,Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalwere meant to redraw the UK's political map every five years to take account of changes in population shifts. How the changes affect Northern Ireland Why UK's political map is being re-drawn Do boundary changes exclude millions of voters? 'Bring forward' Commons boundaries vote According to analysis of the final proposals by politics professors Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, of Plymouth University, the Conservatives would have won a 16-seat majority at the last general election under the redrawn boundaries. They said there had been no material change to their prediction since last year's publication of proposed boundaries. The reduction in the number of parliamentary constituencies was meant to happen while the Coalition government was in power between 2010 to 2015. But it was abandoned in 2013 after the Liberal Democrats withdrew their support, having failed to agree on House of Lords reform with their Tory partners. As a result, the 2015 election was fought on the same boundaries as in 2010, as was the snap general election in 2017. The proposed number of seats for the next election are: England: 501 (down from 533) Scotland: 53 (down from 59) Wales: 29 (down from 40) Northern Ireland: 17 (down from 18) As well as reducing the number of seats, the review aims to make constituencies more equal in size, in terms of their total number of voters -  between 71,031 and 78,507. Although the changes are expected to most benefit the Conservatives at the ballot box, some big name Tories - including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit secretary David Davis - could face a tougher battle due to changes to the composition of their seats. If MPs reject the proposals, the next election will be fought on demographic data based on the 2000 electoral register and will not take into account changes since then. Critics of the changes have warned that Brexit will mean more legislation in the coming years - and that fewer MPs means less parliamentary scrutiny. Labour MP Nic Dakin, who represents Scunthorpe, said that the changes would not be good for democracy, pointing to the loss of MEPs that will come as a result of Brexit. But the Tories have insisted the system is currently weighed against them and the boundaries - decided by population figures - are out of date. Secretary to the commission, Sam Hartley, said: ""We're confident that the new map of constituencies best reflects the rules set for us by Parliament and we're especially pleased that our recommendations are based heavily on what members of the public have told us about their local areas. ""It is now up to the government to present our report to Parliament, and we look forward to being able to publish our recommendations once that has happened.""

"Officer Guyger has been with the police department four years A white police officer who shot and killed a black man in his Texas flat after apparently thinking she was in her own apartment has been charged. Officer Amber Guyger is accused of manslaughter. The family of the victim, 26-year-old Botham Shem Jean had demanded the officer be arrested. Protests were held outside the police HQ over the weekend. Tributes have been paid to Mr Jean, who worked for the professional services giant PricewaterhouseCoopers. US police shootings: How many die each year? Killer cop teaches about police shootings Police blunders that made the headlines Officer Guyger has been in the police department for four years and is assigned to the Southeast Patrol Division. She was booked at the Kaufman County Jail, the Texas Department of Public Safety said. She then posted $300,000 (Â£232,000) bail, ABC reported, and has been released. The victim's family have hired lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represented Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, unarmed black teenagers who were shot dead by a neighbourhood watch volunteer and a police officer respectively. Mr Crump told a news conference on Monday: ""Black people in America have been killed by police in some of the most unbelievable manners. Botham Shem Jean grew up on the Caribbean island of St Lucia ""You know, driving while black in our cars, black people have been killed walking while black in our neighbourhoods, and now here we are being killed living while black in our apartments."" He was joined at the news conference by the prime minister of the Caribbean island nation of St Lucia, where Mr Jean is a citizen. Allen Chastanet appeared to fight back tears as he spoke of his anger that a young man could be shot dead in his own apartment. The Dallas shooting occurred at an upmarket apartment complex just one block from the police department, south of the city centre. According to a police statement, the officer, still in uniform after her shift, walked into the unit she believed belonged to her and saw Botham Shem Jean inside. What happened next is unclear, but the officer eventually fired her gun. She then called for assistance and the victim was taken to hospital where he later died. An unnamed law enforcement official told the Dallas Morning News,externalthat the lights in the flat were off when Officer Guyger fired two shots at a figure moving in the darkness, fatally striking Mr Jean. The official said that she had just ended a 15-hour shift, when she parked in the wrong garage before making the tragic error. She was able to enter the flat, because Mr Jean's door was unlocked, the source said, adding that she did not notice Mr Jean's bright red door mat outside. Officer Guyger was tested for drugs and alcohol at the scene, but the results have yet to be announced. Video taken by a neighbour shows the officer pacing, and crying into her mobile phone after the shooting. In a 911 call made by the officer, she can be heard repeatedly telling Mr Jean that she is sorry, local media report. Botham Shem Jean graduated from a university in Arkansas. He was a devout Christian and an active member of a local church. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings called Mr Jean ""a model citizen"" and promised a transparent investigation. The victim's mother, Allison Jean, last weektold NBC 5,external: ""Whoever did it to him needs to pay. A heavy price."" PricewaterhouseCoopers said: ""This is a terrible tragedy. Botham Jean was a member of the PwC family in our Dallas office and we are simply heartbroken to hear of his death.""

"This video can not be played ""I don't see why four days is not doable for most people"" A four-day working week will be possible this century if businesses are forced to share the benefits of new technology with their workforce. That's the claim from the TUC, which is using its annual conference to call on the government to take action to help people work less but get paid the same. Artificial intelligence, robotics and automation could provide a Â£200bn UK economic boost in the next decade. At one Welsh firm staff already get a full salary for four days work. Mark Hooper, founder of Cardiff-based IndyCube, said the transition to this new working arrangement over the last 18 months had not always been easy. ""We felt we had an opportunity to prove something, that you can be as productive in four days as five, and it has been worth it,"" he said. Now the company is outputting more and expanding outside of Wales. His colleague Russ Todd spreads his time out to help with school runs and family time. Russ Todd says the arrangement gives him more flexibility with his time ""My father would work long hours. He was up before I was up and he was home after I went to bed,"" he said. ""It is important to be there. It matters."" Employee Mari Dunning has used some of her extra time to get a collection of poetry published, amongst more menial tasks. Or if you use the extra day to get the housework done, ""you've then got your weekend wide open"", she said. ""I don't see why four days is not doable for most people,"" she added. But for most British workers the trend is going in the other direction. Some 1.4 million people now work a full seven days a week in the UK, according to the TUC, and 51% of people they surveyed said they feared the benefits of new technology would go to company managers and shareholders. A report this January from Centre for Cities found that 3.6m UK jobs could be replaced by machines by 2030. The TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady highlighted that unions had fought for two-day weekends and limits on long hours - and that this is their next challenge. Frances O'Grady has led the TUC since 2013 ""We know that some people are pessimistic about whether technology will make their lives better but technology could be a force for good, we can also make everyone's working lives better and richer,"" she explained. ""It doesn't have to be about surveillance and exploitation. This could be about creating more satisfying work."" But that may not be easy. The Communication and Workers Union just took on that fight - to have the benefits of automation evenly shared - at the Royal Mail. When the postal service invested in new sorting machines - thus cutting down on the amount of time workers were needed to sort out packages - it wanted the staff to work extended delivery rounds instead. New tech disrupted the working week for staff at Royal Mail Terry Pullinger was the lead union rep on the dispute that took two years to resolve. ""Our objective was to work towards a 35-hour week,"" he said. ""Crucial to us was to protect as many jobs as possible with the technology that is coming in, which is taking out a lot of the work that our members are doing. And fortunately we ended up in a situation where the employer agreed with us."" He added: ""People are finding that they're being pushed to work harder, [but] how much can people take?""

"Mr Johnson described Theresa May's Brexit plans as 'feeble and pathetic' Boris Johnson's call to scrap the Northern Ireland backstop has been called ""foolish"" and ""incendiary"". The MP has hit out at Theresa May's Brexit plans,accusing her of wrapping a suicide vest around the UK. Sinn FÃ©in said the comments showed Northern Ireland was ""collateral damage"" for party in-fighting. The SDLP said Mr Johnson was ""deliberately simplifying"" the Irish border issue. However, the DUP welcomed the former foreign secretary's input. The UK and the EU signed upto the principle of a backstop in December 2017, but neither can agree on what it should look like in a legally binding text. 'Political declaration needed for backstop' Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The hardest border - BBC News The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean NI staying in the customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system. But the UK government has rejected it as a threat to the integrity of the UK and has suggested a backstop that would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020. In his piece for the Mail on Sunday, Mr Johnson accused the EU of ""bullying"" the UK - but questioned why the response had been ""so utterly feeble"". He said the reason for this was ""simple"", namely Northern Ireland and the ""insanity of the so-called backstop"", and called for it to be scrapped. Mr Johnson said agreeing to a backstop had ""opened ourselves to perpetual political blackmail"" and given Brussels the ability to ""crack apart the Union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland"". Both the UK and the EU have said they do not want to see a hard Irish border Speaking to BBC News, Sinn FÃ©in MLA MÃ¡irtin Ã Muilleoir said Mr Johnson's comments were ""appalling"" and the language was ""foolish and dangerous"". ""Anyone who doesn't understand how fragile the peace here is, and how fragile the progress we have made is, mustn't be watching the news because for 600 days we haven't been able to form a local government here because fault lines within this society remain,"" he said. The SDLP's Brexit Spokesperson Claire Hanna said Mr Johnson had ""absolutely no regard for people on this island"". ""He is completely indifferent to the complexities of issues here; he is deliberately simplifying things and is implying the border issue is about marking a line and completely ignoring regulatory issues, as well as all of the political issues that plummet into peace and the Good Friday Agreement."" However, Sammy Wilson from the DUP welcomed the former foreign secretary's input. In a statement the MP for East Antrim said he wished Mr Johnson had made the comments sooner and that he believes the backstop needs to be rewritten. ""Those crying loudest are embarrassed at the truth of the impact of the arrogant EU demands on the UK being exposed,"" said Mr Wilson. ""Boris Johnson is saying nothing that the DUP has not been saying since the withdrawal agreement was first drafted in December 2017. ""The reason why we stopped it being signed in its original form was precisely for the reasons which Boris Johnson has outlined."" Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected the EU's backstop option The UK is due to leave the EU in just over six months' time. During the summer the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, referred on several occasions to the EU's willingness to ""improve"" the backstop. But he gave no indication that there would be significant movement on its substance. Several of the pro-remain parties in Northern Ireland are due to travel to Brussels later this monthto meet Mr Barnier about the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland.

"Many areas of the police service in England and Wales are ""on the verge of crisis"", the president of the Police Superintendents' Association will warn. Chief Superintendent Gavin Thomas will give a speech to the group's conference on Tuesday saying forces are ""utterly reliant"" on fewer staff working longer. It comes a year after he warned policing faced a ""perfect storm""due to budget cuts and rising crime. The Home Office said it is committed to getting officers the support they need. Reality Check: Is police funding falling? Do Corbyn's police claims stack up? Ch Supt Thomas is expected to tell the conference: ""I cannot emphasise enough that the delivery of routine policing functions should not be dependent on officers effectively giving their time for free by staying past their shift times or working on leave days. ""That exploits police officers and defrauds the public."" As well as arguing policing is now in a worst state than last year, Ch Supt Thomas will say: ""I would now suggest that this great service is on the verge of crisis in many areas. ""The vision for policing has to be something more strategic than a hope for more collaborations, otherwise we will be in a perpetual state of crisis."" Ch Supt Thomas is also expected to urge the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, and leading officers to take ""difficult and bold"" decisions. ""There is a void in the long-term strategic vision for the police service of the future,"" he will add. ""We need to know what the overall goal is for reform. What are we ultimately working towards? What is the vision for policing in 21st Century England and Wales?"" The association has already highlighted concerns about force collaborations after it found some officers spent hours driving more than 100 miles to cover two areas, using two different laptops, IDs and email addresses, all for the same job. Ch Supt Thomas will say: ""We have been debating our structures for delivering service to the public on and off for years, and yet have been trying to make the same systems and structures work. ""The famous definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."" The Home Office said it is carrying out a review of front-line policing to bring about improvements. ""The home secretary has made it clear that he is committed to a good working relationship with the police and to ensuring that front-line officers get the support and professional development they deserve,"" said a spokeswoman. ""The ongoing front-line review will help officers and staff to drive change in policing and ensure that the barriers  they face on a day-to-day basis are identified and addressed.""

"The dig where evidence of the cheese was discovered Scientists have found traces of what they believe is the world's oldest cheese. It was made 7,000 years ago in what is now Croatia. An international team, including Heriot-Watt university researchers, say it led to the transformation of Europe. It is neither a sturdy cheddar nor a cheeky brie, rather some traces of fatty acids found on fragments of pottery from an archaeological site at Pokrovnik on the Dalmatian coast. But it is enough for the researchers from Heriot-Watt in Edinburgh and Pennsylvania State universities, Rochester Institute of Technology, and the Å ibenik City Museum to conclude the sieve-like pottery objects were used for straining curds out of whey to make cheese. Traces of ancient milk fats have been found before but the new study has used carbon dating to produce a definitive chemical diagnosis that the Pokrovnik samples are from the cheese making process. The team says their discovery means humans were making cheese 2,000 years earlier than previously thought, pushing the date back from the Bronze Age to the Neolithic era. Cheese making was a breakthrough technology which transformed humanity. More portable and longer lasting than liquid milk, it enabled early farming to spread into cooler central and northern areas. The sample of the world's oldest known cheese was discovered attached to Neolithic pots like these Dr Clayton Magill, a research fellow at the Heriot-Watt's Lyell Centre, says the discovery is both astounding and delightful. He is sure cheese lovers everywhere will be interested to find out more about the origins and antiquity of their cheese. ""We know that the consumption of milk and dairy products would have had many advantages for early farming populations because milk, yogurt and cheese are a good source of calories, protein and fat,"" Dr Magill said. ""They could have even been reliable food between harvests or during droughts and famines."" Ancient Egypt: Cheese discovered in 3,200-year-old tomb Previous archaeological finds have offered tantalising clues that humans made cheese in the New Stone Age. Some Neolithic objects have been tentatively identified as strainers or cheese graters but this is the first direct evidence that milk was being fermented. Pennsylvania State's associate professor of anthropology Dr Sarah McClure says that while young children of the era could drink milk, many adult farmers were lactose intolerant. Cheese changed that because adults could digest it. ""We suggest that milk and cheese production among Europe's early farmers reduced infant mortality,"" Dr McClure says, ""and helped stimulate demographic shifts that propelled farming communities to expand to northern latitudes."" How cheese was first produced is lost in prehistory.  One theory is that before pottery vessels were developed, milk was stored in bladders made from animals' stomachs.  The rennet in the skins would have reacted with the milk to create curds and whey.

"Boris Johnson has faced criticism from fellow MPs for his language in the Mail on Sunday article Boris Johnson has attacked Theresa's May's Brexit plan, saying she had ""wrapped a suicide vest"" around the British constitution and ""handed the detonator"" to Brussels. In the Mail on Sunday,external, the former foreign secretary said the Chequers deal was ""feeble"" and ""pathetic"". He has been strongly criticised by some Tories - one minister said it marked a ""disgusting moment"" in politics. And Home Secretary Sajid Javid called for ""measured language"" to be used. Writing in the same paper,external, the current Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for people to rally behind Mrs May, backing her to hold the line ""in the face of intense pressure"". The UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, and the government's plan - agreed at Chequers in July - has sparked criticism from Brexiteer Tories as well as the EU. PSNI chief warning over post Brexit threat EU 'strongly opposed' to PM's Brexit plan The Chequers plan explained In his article, Mr Johnson accused the EU of ""bullying"" the UK - but questioned why the response had been ""so utterly feeble"". He said that rather than getting a ""generous free trade deal"", Britain is saying, ""yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir"", to Brussels. ""At every stage of the talks so far, Brussels gets what Brussels wants,"" wrote Mr Johnson. ""It is a humiliation. We look like a seven-stone weakling being comically bent out of shape by a 500lb gorilla."" This video can not be played Theresa May speaks after meeting her cabinet at Chequers in July He said the reason for the UK's response was the ""insanity of the so-called backstop"" - the commitment by the UK and the EU to come up with a solution to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. However, his call to scrap the proposed backstop has beenheavily criticised by Sinn FÃ©in and the SDLP. Sinn Fein said Mr Johnson's comments were ""foolish and dangerous"", while the SDLP said he had ""absolutely no regard for people on this island"". Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said the ""scathing remarks"" by Mr Johnson showed his ""willingness to challenge the prime minister remains undimmed"" after recent revelations about his private life. It is Mr Johnson'ssecond attack on the prime minister's Brexit strategy inside a week, as last Monday he said the Chequers deal ""means disaster"" for Britain - Downing Street responded to that attack by saying he had offered ""no new ideas"". While Mr Javid voiced measured criticism of Mr Johnson, other Tories reacted more angrily to his remarks. Former Army officer and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat graphically described the aftermath of a suicide bomb that had gone off near his office in Helmand province, Afghanistan. He said comparing such an attack to the PM's plans ""isn't funny"", adding: ""Some need to grow up"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Foreign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan criticised his former boss,saying the article,externalwas ""one of the most disgusting moments in modern British politics."" If this latest broadside was not the end of Mr Johnson's political career, ""I will make sure it is later"", he said. Another Foreign Office minister, Alistair Burt, tweeted: ""I'm stunned at the nature of this attack. There is no justification for such an outrageous, inappropriate and hurtful analogy. ""If we don't stop this extraordinary use of language over Brexit, our country might never heal. Again, I say, enough."" But backbench Tory MP Nadine Dorries defended Mr Johnson in the face of what she was ""vitriol"", saying his critics were ""terrified of his popular appeal"". And Tory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said the way Mr Johnson ""says it how he sees it and speaks truth unto power"" was ""something that endears him to a huge swathe of the British public"". On the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid said: ""I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences. I think it's a reminder for all of us in public policy, whichever political party we represent, to use measured language because I think that's what the public want to see."" He backed the Chequers proposals which he said represented ""the only deal that we've got on the table"". In his Mail on Sunday article, Mr Hunt said Parliament would get to debate and vote on any agreement, adding: ""Until then, we should not rush to judgement on a deal that is still under negotiation."" It is the first public comment from Mr Johnson since he and his wife, Marina Wheeler,confirmed they were getting divorcedearlier this week. The announcement followed newspaper allegations the former London mayor had been having an extra-marital affair. The Sunday Times has reported,externalthat Mrs May's aides wrote a 4,000-word ""dirty dossier"" on Mr Johnson in 2016, exposing a ""catalogue of lurid allegations"" against him. The paper says it has seen the document - said to have been written during the Conservative leadership contest - but officials at Downing Street and Conservative Campaign Headquarters have denied circulating it. Elsewhere the National Police Chiefs' Council said there was no intelligence to suggest there would be an increase in crime or disorder if the UK and the EU cannot agree a deal. NPCC operations lead Chief Constable Charlie Hall was responding to aSunday Times report,externalof a leaked document about police contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. According to the paper, the document warned that concerns around medical supplies could ""feed civil disorder"", and that potential goods shortages raised concerns of ""widespread protest which could then escalate into disorder"". It also warned that the ""necessity to call on military assistance is a real possibility"" in the weeks after UK's departure from the EU. Mr Javid said he did not expect a no-deal outcome, adding: ""I'm glad the police and other experts are looking into this and thinking what might happen in a no-deal scenario.""
