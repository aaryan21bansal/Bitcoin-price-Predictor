He was suspended by the Scottish Conservative party in June. He had been co-leader of East Dunbartonshire council until the elections in May. Mr Polson previously said he was unable to comment because of a confidentiality clause relating to the civil action. He was originally arrested in June but was released pending further inquiries. He was re-arrested on Tuesday. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ""A 50-year-old man has been arrested and charged on Tuesday, 30 August, 2022, in connection with a series of financial crimes.

"Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot after a gunman ran into her home in Liverpool A police officer ""scooped"" up Olivia Pratt-Korbel and ran with her to try and save her life after she was shot at her home, an inquest has heard. Olivia was fatally shot as her mother tried to stop a gunman entering her Liverpool home on 22 August. Liverpool senior coroner Andre Rebello told Gerard Majella Courthouse that responding officers rushed to try to save the nine-year-old's life. He said a PC pressed his hand on her wound as he carried her to hospital. Mr Rebello, who also dealt with thedeath of 11-year-old Rhys Jonesafter he was shot in the city in 2007, spoke of his shock as he opened the inquest into Olivia's death. He said it was ""quite shocking that society has not changed for the better"". ""It is shocking that a nine-year-old little girl, with a full life in front of her, is shot anywhere, but to be shot in her own home, in the safety of her home, is heinous and unforgiving,"" he said. Olivia was fatally shot and her mother was injured after a gunman chased a man into her home in Dovecot at about 22:00 BST. Neither of the men had any links to her family. Mr Rebello said armed response officers found Olivia with a gunshot wound to her chest. ""Police officers scooped and ran with Olivia to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in the back of a police car,"" he said. Floral tributes have been left to Olivia close to the scene of the shooting He said she arrived at the hospital's main entrance at approximately 22:15 ""in the arms of a police officer"". ""The officer had covered the wound to her chest with his hand and she was noted to have a weak heart, which had stopped prior to her arrival in hospital,"" he said. He said medical teams met Olivia as she arrived and a major trauma call was put out. The nine-year-old then received cardiac massage and a rapid blood transfusion, but at 23:15, she had no cardiac output, the coroner said. Ten minutes later, ""after extensive efforts by all involved, the decision was made to stop resuscitation and Olivia was confirmed as having died,"" he added. Olivia was rushed to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in the back of a police car, her inquest was told A post-mortem examination found the cause of her death was a gunshot wound to the chest. The inquest heard Olivia was born in Liverpool to mother Cheryl Korbel, a support worker, and father John Francis Pratt, a mechanic. The coroner said Olivia's death would ""not just affect her immediate family and friends, but also school communities, church communities, not just in the Knotty Ash and Dovecot areas of Liverpool, but the whole city, Merseyside, and I know right across this country people are shocked by Olivia's death"". ""I understand Merseyside Police would be very grateful for anyone with any information who could bring some knowledge to the circumstances in which Olivia came by her death, no matter how insignificant that information may be,"" he added. Adjourning the inquest to 4 January, he released Olivia's body to her family for burial. Mr Rebello also opened the inquests into the deaths of28-year-old council worker Ashley DaleandSam Rimmer, a 22-year-old mechanic, at the courthouse. Mr Rimmer was shot in Dingle on 16 August, while Ms Dale was found with gunshot wounds in the back garden of her Old Swan home in the early hours of 21 August. He told Ms Dale's inquest that she was not believed to have been the intended target of the shooting and the door of her home ""had been forced"", with her being found lying unresponsive by officers close to her mobile phone and several bullet casings in her back garden. He said until someone was ""apprehended"" and the process of law was applied to ""this most heinous tragedy"", her family would ""struggle with a very difficult bereavement journey"". Mr Rimmer was shot on 16 August, while Ms Dale was found with gunshot wounds five days later Mr Rimmer's inquest was told he and his ""associates"" had been chased by four males on electric bikes, who had discharged firearms ""numerous times"". The 22-year-old died in hospital a short time later. Mr Rebello said it ""goes without saying"" that Mr Rimmer ""appears to have been murdered, and clearly somebody out there has information... and I would encourage anyone with any knowledge to provide it"". He added that it was ""difficult enough to deal with bereavement from natural causes, but when the death is from such a heinous, unnecessary act, a family and bereaved relatives clearly need some progress... to find at least some degree of closure"". A 36-year-old man from Huyton and a 33-year-old from Dovecot were arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder in connection with Olivia's death a few days after she was shot and have been released on bail. A 25-year-old man from Liverpool arrested on suspicion of Ms Dale's murder has been conditionally bailed pending further inquiries.

"Unilever's advert for one of its laundry detergents, Persil, has been banned for being misleading about its environmental benefits. The television advert said Persil was ""kinder to our planet"", and featured children picking up litter on a beach. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the advert's claim was unsubstantiated. Unilever, which owns brands including Hellmann's and Dove, said it is ""disappointed"" with the result. It follows a crackdown by the ASA on ""greenwashing"" - claims made by firms branding products as eco-friendly, green or sustainable. In the banned television advert, beaches are shown full of litter and then children are shown picking up the rubbish. A voiceover said: ""For real change we all need to roll up our sleeves and get dirty"". Text on the screen stating that the product ""removes stains at 30C"" is shown, with the Persil bottle, which the advert states is made with 50% recycled plastic. ""Tough on stains and kinder to our planet,"" the voiceover adds. A viewer complained to the watchdog that Persil's claims of being ""kinder"" to the planet were unsubstantiated. Greenwashing tricks: Seven ways not to be fooled Innocent drinks ads banned over environmental claim 20 firms make half of all one-use plastic - study The regulator upheld the complaint and said that the claims could only be justified if the product provides an environmental benefit over other similar products. ""Although we acknowledged Persil were undertaking actions to reduce the environmental impact of their products, we had not seen evidence or analysis to demonstrate the overall environmental impact of the featured liquid detergents over their full-life cycles, compared with Persil's own previous products or other products, in support of the claim 'kinder to our planet'"", the ASA said. Unilever countered that the advert showed how its liquid detergent was ""kinder"" to the planet because it saved energy by cleaning in fast washes and at lower temperatures. It also said it was ""kinder"" because the product used recycled plastic. A spokesperson for Unilever told the BBC that is was ""disappointed"" with the ASA's result. ""We are committed to making on-going improvements to all our products to make them more sustainable and will continue to look at how we can share this with our shoppers"", Unilever said. The ASA banned the advert because it concluded that the basis of the claim ""kinder to our planet"" had not been made clear. The regulator also said the ad featured ""various strands of messaging"" about Persil's wider environmental initiatives including encouraging people to ""personally take action to care for the environment"", and showing children collecting plastic litter. ""In the context of the entire ad with several messages relating to environmental issues, we considered the meaning and basis of the claim ""kinder to our planet"" was unclear,"" the ASA said. ""Additionally, in the absence of evidence demonstrating that the full-life cycle of the product had a lesser environmental impact compared to a previous formulation, we concluded the ad was likely to mislead,"" a spokesperson from the ASA added.

"Eurostar is to suspend its direct train service between London and Disneyland Paris. The company said the route would be axed from 5 June next year for the duration of the summer. It said the decision was taken to focus on ""core routes"" as it recovered from the pandemic and monitored plans for new European Union entry and exit rules. Eurostar said it would ""revisit options"" for 2024 next year. Direct trains between London St Pancras International and Marne-la-Vallee - a station next to Disneyland Paris, to the east of the French capital - take two hours and 24 minutes. The suspension of the service means passengers will now have to change at Paris or Lille. The route has operated since 1996 though it was stopped for a time at the height of Covid restrictions. Eurostar services may not stop in Kent before 2025 New rules for visitors to the EU are due to come into force by the end of May next year. The system will mean travellers from outside the bloc must have their fingerprints scanned and photograph taken, instead of having their passport manually stamped. A Eurostar spokeswoman said: ""Whilst we continue to recover financially from the pandemic and monitor developments in the proposed EU Entry Exit system, we need to focus on our core routes to ensure we can continue to provide the high level of service and experience that our customers rightly expect."" ""This decision applies from 5 June 2023, and as tickets are not yet on sale beyond this date, existing customer bookings will not be affected,"" she added. The BBC recently revealed that Eurostar services may not stop in Kent again until 2025. The company cited financial reasons and the post-Brexit border situation, adding that it ""must focus on our most profitable inter-capital routes"". Have you booked a trip to Disneyland? How will you be affected by this news? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Eurostar was hit hard by Covid travel restrictions andlast year secured a Â£250m rescue package from banks and investors. In 2019 - the last time the company reported financial results - its sales revenue was nearly Â£1bn. But at the height of the pandemic, Eurostar warned that it was ""fighting for survival"", after seeing a 95% drop in demand. This has left the company with a large amount of debt to repay. The Disneyland Paris connection is much less frequent than Eurostar's core routes from London, with only around four services a week, compared to as many as 14 services a day to the French capital. Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of Advantage Travel Partnership, a network of more than 700 UK travel agents, said the news would be ""disappointing"" for holidaymakers. ""Taking young ones and families to the famous park in France has been a highlight for thousands of British families for many years,"" she said. ""The reality is that Brexit has removed the ability for Brits to travel freely across Europe, and has taken away the seamless and frictionless travel that we all enjoyed prior to leaving the EU,"" she added.

"Ryanair will grow even faster in the event of an economic downturn in the UK, the company's boss has told the BBC. Michael O'Leary said people would still fly during a recession but they would choose low-fare airlines like Ryanair. The firm has announced what it described as its biggest ever winter schedule to and from the UK. Mr O'Leary said the expansion was because competitors - such as British Airways - had cut their capacity. He acknowledged a recession would be a worry ""for the sake of passengers"" and said high inflation was a risk. However, he predicted Ryanair would ""grow very strongly this winter"". The Bank of Englandhas forecast the UK economy will fall into recession later this year. This happens when the economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row. Mr O'Leary told the BBC: ""A deep recession in the UK or an energy crisis will certainly affect overall demand, but within that - as has happened in the last four or five recessions - you see people trading down from high-fare airlines like BA and Easyjet, to low-fare airlines like Ryanair."" He likened this to ""the same way many people have switched from shopping in Sainsbury's to Lidl and Aldi"", and insisted he was ""confident we'll grow even faster as a result of any recession here"". He said that Ryanair would be able to keep fares lower than other airlines due to its fuel-hedging strategy - where an airline agrees to purchase oil in the future at a predetermined price. However he repeated comments he had recently made to the BBC that super-cheap â¬10 tickets would not be possible in the near future, with the soaring cost of fuel pushing up the airline's average fare from around â¬40 (Â£33.75) last year to roughly â¬50 over the next five years. Era of â¬10 flights is over, says Ryanair boss Ryanair hits out at airports: 'They had one job' Mr O'Leary said Ryanair still had not been able to provide Covid refunds to 200,000 passengers, out of a total of 30 million. He insisted this was because they had booked through online travel agents, whom he accused of being ""pirates"", and that Ryanair could not contact such passengers because details such as email addresses were often incorrect. Mr O'Leary said the problems with staff shortages at airports seen at the start of the summer appeared to have been resolved ""at every airport with the exception of Heathrow"". He has started referring to Britain's biggest airport - from where Ryanair does not operate - as ""Hopeless Heathrow"",after it introduced a cap on passenger numberswhich has prompted cancellations and ticket sales limits. Heathrow says its cap has been successful in reducing on-the-day disruption for passengers. British Airways has been severely affected by the cap, cutting around two dozen flights a day until it ends. BA also said that to ensure it can cope over winter, it will be cutting 10,000 flights between late October and March. Airports including London's Heathrow have suffered from queues and cancellations this summer due to staff shortages When it comes to staff wages, Mr O'Leary said he wanted to give pay rises, and things were now moving beyond agreements to restore pay to pre-Covid levels, to discussions over pay increases. He could not give guarantees across the board now, citing uncertainties such as how well the market recovers this winter, and the situation with the war in Ukraine. But he said he was moving ""aggressively"" towards negotiating increases in pay. Ryanair has faced battles with unions after it cut salaries during the pandemic but it has been less affected by staff shortages and cancellations than other airlines. The company has said this was because it kept staff on, albeit on reduced pay, and maintained training at the height of Covid restrictions. Mr O'Leary also urged the victor in the ongoing Conservative party leadership contest to scrap Air Passenger Duty - which is paid by airlines for every passenger who flies from the UK - and to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU when they became prime minister. He said the lack of free movement under the current ""hard Brexit"" deal had caused staffing challenges in the UK economy, including in airports, and accused Boris Johnson's government of being ""economically illiterate"". He previously told the BBCa more ""practical, common sense"" approach to post-Brexit policy was needed, to allow more workers from Europe to fill vacancies. Mr O'Leary said he expected passenger growth in the next few years to be largely made possible by taking delivery of 51 new, more efficient Boeing aircraft - although he cast some doubt upon whether they would be delivered on time.

East Dunbartonshire councillor, Andrew Polson, 50, was previously named in a separate civil court action by a woman who claimed he had breached her trust. In legal papers, the woman, 68, said Mr Polson had persuaded her to let him manage her finances and used her money to buy property for himself. He was suspended by the Scottish Conservative party in June. He had been co-leader of East Dunbartonshire council until the elections in May.

"Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot after a gunman ran into her home in Liverpool A police officer ""scooped"" up Olivia Pratt-Korbel and ran with her to try and save her life after she was shot at her home, an inquest has heard. Olivia was fatally shot as her mother tried to stop a gunman entering her Liverpool home on 22 August. Liverpool senior coroner Andre Rebello told Gerard Majella Courthouse that responding officers rushed to try to save the nine-year-old's life. He said a PC pressed his hand on her wound as he carried her to hospital. Mr Rebello, who also dealt with thedeath of 11-year-old Rhys Jonesafter he was shot in the city in 2007, spoke of his shock as he opened the inquest into Olivia's death. He said it was ""quite shocking that society has not changed for the better"". ""It is shocking that a nine-year-old little girl, with a full life in front of her, is shot anywhere, but to be shot in her own home, in the safety of her home, is heinous and unforgiving,"" he said. Olivia was fatally shot and her mother was injured after a gunman chased a man into her home in Dovecot at about 22:00 BST. Neither of the men had any links to her family. Mr Rebello said armed response officers found Olivia with a gunshot wound to her chest. ""Police officers scooped and ran with Olivia to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in the back of a police car,"" he said. Floral tributes have been left to Olivia close to the scene of the shooting He said she arrived at the hospital's main entrance at approximately 22:15 ""in the arms of a police officer"". ""The officer had covered the wound to her chest with his hand and she was noted to have a weak heart, which had stopped prior to her arrival in hospital,"" he said. He said medical teams met Olivia as she arrived and a major trauma call was put out. The nine-year-old then received cardiac massage and a rapid blood transfusion, but at 23:15, she had no cardiac output, the coroner said. Ten minutes later, ""after extensive efforts by all involved, the decision was made to stop resuscitation and Olivia was confirmed as having died,"" he added. Olivia was rushed to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in the back of a police car, her inquest was told A post-mortem examination found the cause of her death was a gunshot wound to the chest. The inquest heard Olivia was born in Liverpool to mother Cheryl Korbel, a support worker, and father John Francis Pratt, a mechanic. The coroner said Olivia's death would ""not just affect her immediate family and friends, but also school communities, church communities, not just in the Knotty Ash and Dovecot areas of Liverpool, but the whole city, Merseyside, and I know right across this country people are shocked by Olivia's death"". ""I understand Merseyside Police would be very grateful for anyone with any information who could bring some knowledge to the circumstances in which Olivia came by her death, no matter how insignificant that information may be,"" he added. Adjourning the inquest to 4 January, he released Olivia's body to her family for burial. Mr Rebello also opened the inquests into the deaths of28-year-old council worker Ashley DaleandSam Rimmer, a 22-year-old mechanic, at the courthouse. Mr Rimmer was shot in Dingle on 16 August, while Ms Dale was found with gunshot wounds in the back garden of her Old Swan home in the early hours of 21 August. He told Ms Dale's inquest that she was not believed to have been the intended target of the shooting and the door of her home ""had been forced"", with her being found lying unresponsive by officers close to her mobile phone and several bullet casings in her back garden. He said until someone was ""apprehended"" and the process of law was applied to ""this most heinous tragedy"", her family would ""struggle with a very difficult bereavement journey"". Mr Rimmer was shot on 16 August, while Ms Dale was found with gunshot wounds five days later Mr Rimmer's inquest was told he and his ""associates"" had been chased by four males on electric bikes, who had discharged firearms ""numerous times"". The 22-year-old died in hospital a short time later. Mr Rebello said it ""goes without saying"" that Mr Rimmer ""appears to have been murdered, and clearly somebody out there has information... and I would encourage anyone with any knowledge to provide it"". He added that it was ""difficult enough to deal with bereavement from natural causes, but when the death is from such a heinous, unnecessary act, a family and bereaved relatives clearly need some progress... to find at least some degree of closure"". A 36-year-old man from Huyton and a 33-year-old from Dovecot were arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder in connection with Olivia's death a few days after she was shot and have been released on bail. A 25-year-old man from Liverpool arrested on suspicion of Ms Dale's murder has been conditionally bailed pending further inquiries. Four men arrested on suspicion of Mr Rimmer's murder havealso been bailed. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

"Shamima Begum, who fled the UK and joined the Islamic State group, was smuggled into Syria by an intelligence agent for Canada. Files seen by the BBC show he claimed to have shared Ms Begum's passport details with Canada, and smuggled other Britons to fight for IS. Ms Begum's lawyers are challenging the removal of her citizenship, arguing she was a trafficking victim. Canada and the UK declined to comment on security issues. Ms Begum was 15 when she and two other east London schoolgirls - Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-old Amira Abase - travelled to Syria to join the IS group in 2015. At the main Istanbul bus station, the girls met Mohammed Al Rasheed, who would facilitate their journey to IS-controlled Syria. A senior intelligence officer, at an agency which is part of the global coalition against IS, has confirmed to the BBC that Rasheed was providing information to Canadian intelligence while smuggling people to IS. The BBC has obtained a dossier on Rasheed that contains information gathered by law enforcement and intelligence, as well as material recovered from his hard drives, which provide extraordinary detail about how he operated. He told authorities that he had gathered information on the people he helped into Syria because he was passing it to the Canadian embassy in Jordan. Shamima Begum offers to help fight terror in UK Can you be stripped of your British citizenship? Shamima Begum cannot return to UK, court rules Rasheed, who was arrested in Turkey within days of smuggling Ms Begum to IS, told authorities he had shared a photo of the passport the British schoolgirl was using. The Metropolitan Police were searching for her, although by the time Canada received her passport details, Ms Begum was already in Syria. The dossier shows that Ms Begum was moved to Syria through a substantial IS people-smuggling network that was controlled from the group's de-facto capital in Raqqa. Rasheed was in charge of the Turkish side of this network and facilitated the travel of British men, women and children to IS for at least eight months before he helped Ms Begum and her two friends. Ms Begum toldthe BBC's forthcoming I'm Not A Monster podcast: ""He organised the entire trip from Turkey to Syriaâ¦ I don't think anyone would have been able to make it to Syria without the help of smugglers. ""He had helped a lot of people come inâ¦ We were just doing everything he was telling us to do because he knew everything, we didn't know anything."" Rasheed kept information about the people he helped, often photographing their ID documents or secretly filming them on his phone. One recording shows Ms Begum and her friends get out of a taxi and into a waiting car not far from the Syrian border. This video can not be played WATCH: Video shows Shamima Begum during journey to Syria Rasheed also gathered information about IS, mapping the locations of the homes of Western IS fighters in Syria, identifying IP addresses and locations of internet cafes in IS-controlled territory, and taking screenshots of conversations he was having with IS fighters. In one conversation, Rasheed spoke to a man believed to be notorious British IS fighter and recruiter, Raphael Hostey, who says to him: ""I need you to work under me. Officiallyâ¦ I want you to help us bring people in."" In a follow-up text, Rasheed asks Hostey: ""Can you explain a little, please?"" Hostey says: ""Same thing that you're doing now, but you work for us bringing equipment, bringing in brothers and sisters"". Mohammed Al Rasheed replies: ""I am ready, brother."" Rasheed was arrested in the Turkish city of Sanliurfa not long after he had facilitated the girl's journey to Syria. In a statement to law enforcement, he said that the reason he had gathered information on everyone he had helped, including Shamima, was because ""I was passing this information to the Canadian embassy in Jordan"". Rasheed said that in 2013 he had gone to the Canadian Embassy in Jordan to try to apply for asylum. He said: ""They told me they were going to grant me my Canadian citizenship if I collect information about the activities of ISIS."" The BBC has been able to confirm that Rasheed passed in and out of Jordan multiple times between 2013 and his arrest in 2015. Tasnime Akunjee, the lawyer for the Begum family, said there will be a legal hearing in November to challenge the removal of Ms Begum's citizenship and ""one of the main arguments"" will be that then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid did not consider that she was a victim of trafficking. ""The UK has international obligations as to how we view a trafficked person and what culpability we prescribe to them for their actions,"" he said. Mr Akunjee said it was ""shocking"" that a Canadian intelligence asset was a key part of the smuggling operation - ""someone who is supposed to be an ally, protecting our people, rather than trafficking British children into a war zone"". ""Intelligence-gathering looks to have been prioritised over the lives of children,"" he said. Shamima Begum is now held in a detention camp in north-east Syria. Her citizenship was taken away in 2019 after she emerged from the ashes of the so-called IS caliphate. A British government spokesperson said: ""It is our long-standing policy that we do not comment on operational intelligence or security matters."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he could not ""comment on intelligence matters"", but added that ""at the moment"" he did not recognise ""what's being reported"". Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said intelligence services needed to be ""flexible"" and ""creative in their approaches"" to fight terrorism, but ""they are bound by strict rules"". ""We will continue to ensure that proper oversight is done, and as necessary look at further steps"", he added, while speaking at a press conference in Ottawa. A Canadian Security Intelligence Service spokesman said he could not ""publicly comment on or confirm or deny the specifics of CSIS investigations, operational interests, methodologies or activities"".

"This video can not be played Watch: A 'monsoon on steroids' -  UN chief in Pakistan floods Pakistan is facing ""a monsoon on steroids"", the UN's secretary general has warned, after floods submerged much of the country. Antonio Guterres urged the world to come to Pakistan's aid as he launched a $160m appeal to help the tens of millions affected in the disaster. He blamed ""the relentless impact of epochal levels of rain and flooding"". At least 1,136 people have been killed since June and roads, crops, homes and bridges washed away across the country. This year's record monsoon is comparable to the devastating floods of 2010 - the deadliest in Pakistan's history - which left more than 2,000 people dead. Makeshift relief camps have sprung up all over Pakistan to cope with the many displaced In a video message, Mr Guterres called South Asia a ""climate crisis hotspot"" where people were 15 times more likely to die from climate impacts. ""Let's stop sleepwalking towards the destruction of our planet by climate change. Today, it's Pakistan. Tomorrow, it could be your country."" EXPLAINED: How do we know climate change is happening? Extreme weather: What is it and how is it connected to climate change? He said the UN appeal aimed to provide 5.2 million people with food, water, sanitation, emergency education and health support. Officials estimate that more than 33 million Pakistanis - one in seven people - have been affected by the flooding. Sadia, a student in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, said she felt helpless as her family were cut off in their home village of Jhal Magsi, about eight hours away. ""You can't find a single home that is safe now,"" she told the BBC's Outside Source programme.  ""They are under the sky with no help. ""Right now, we are in need of first aid relief like tents, some shelter and some basic food, they can't cook anything. And they need clean water to drink."" Clearing up in Sindh - countless properties have been damaged or destroyed On Monday, Pakistan's climate change minister Sherry Rehman described the situation as a ""climate-induced humanitarian disaster of epic proportions"". Pakistan produces less than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions,externalbut ranks consistently in the top 10 countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.

"This video can not be played Watch: A 'monsoon on steroids' -  UN chief in Pakistan floods Pakistan is facing ""a monsoon on steroids"", the UN's secretary general has warned, after floods submerged much of the country. Antonio Guterres urged the world to come to Pakistan's aid as he launched a $160m appeal to help the tens of millions affected in the disaster. He blamed ""the relentless impact of epochal levels of rain and flooding"". At least 1,136 people have been killed since June and roads, crops, homes and bridges washed away across the country. This year's record monsoon is comparable to the devastating floods of 2010 - the deadliest in Pakistan's history - which left more than 2,000 people dead. Makeshift relief camps have sprung up all over Pakistan to cope with the many displaced In a video message, Mr Guterres called South Asia a ""climate crisis hotspot"" where people were 15 times more likely to die from climate impacts. ""Let's stop sleepwalking towards the destruction of our planet by climate change. Today, it's Pakistan. Tomorrow, it could be your country."" EXPLAINED: How do we know climate change is happening? Extreme weather: What is it and how is it connected to climate change? He said the UN appeal aimed to provide 5.2 million people with food, water, sanitation, emergency education and health support. Officials estimate that more than 33 million Pakistanis - one in seven people - have been affected by the flooding. Sadia, a student in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, said she felt helpless as her family were cut off in their home village of Jhal Magsi, about eight hours away. ""You can't find a single home that is safe now,"" she told the BBC's Outside Source programme.  ""They are under the sky with no help. ""Right now, we are in need of first aid relief like tents, some shelter and some basic food, they can't cook anything. And they need clean water to drink."" Clearing up in Sindh - countless properties have been damaged or destroyed On Monday, Pakistan's climate change minister Sherry Rehman described the situation as a ""climate-induced humanitarian disaster of epic proportions"". Pakistan produces less than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions,externalbut ranks consistently in the top 10 countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

"Wildlife watchers were treated to the sight of a group of adult and young dolphins after they were spotted from a supermarket car park. The nursery pod of Risso's dolphins were visible from the coast at Thurso in Caithness last Friday. Keen wildlife photographer Karen Munro, from nearby Scrabster, was among those to drop everything and go in search of the dolphins. She said: ""Friday was really funny as I was at home just about to start cutting the grass when friends Jackie and Barry Osborne messaged to say that they had just spotted Risso's dolphins from the car park at Lidl while in town to do some shopping. ""Needless to say the lawn mower was abandoned in the back garden."" Karen could see the dolphins from the front of her house, but not close enough to get good photographs. She said: ""After a few hours of trying to follow the dolphins and keeping in contact with Jackie and Barry, I was eventually able to get some good photos as they swam close into the cliffs west of Thurso. ""It was wonderful to see six adults, each having a juvenile swimming close in alongside them."" The Osbornes spotted more Risso's dolphins from their own home further around the coast. Karen, meanwhile, went on to enjoy a weekend of more wildlife spotting including a large group of Risso's dolphins north of Lybster, and later Aquarius and John Coe -two members of a well-known group of west coast orcas. Risso's dolphins are a deep-water species and the bodies of adults are covered in distinctive scars from tussles with their favourite prey - squid. All images copyright of Karen Munro.

"The Edinburgh Tram Inquiry will cost more than Â£13m, Transport Scotland has projected. The inquiry was established in June 2014 to find out why the tram project was Â£400m over budget and was completed five years late. It is investigating what went wrong with the Â£776m project. However, more than eight years after the inquiry was ordered by former first minister Alex Salmond, it has yet to produce its report. The latest figures on its costs were provided following aFreedom of Information request from the i newspaper,externalto Transport Scotland. When is the last stop for Edinburgh Tram Inquiry? Huge tram extension planned for Edinburgh 'Cheaper' to carry on with Edinburgh tram extension They show that the vast majority of the Â£13.100,812m has been spent on staff and legal fees. Staff costs are due to reach more than Â£6m by the end of this financial year, while legal fees are projected to hit more than Â£3m. A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: ""We have agreed to continue to fund the costs of the Edinburgh Trams Inquiry until it is completed, final costs will be published when they become available. ""Staffing matters, including how many people the inquiry employs and how much they are paid, are a matter for the inquiry. This is because, as a statutory inquiry, it is independent of Scottish government. ""The Edinburgh Tram Inquiry was, of course, established to look at how any mistakes or failures could be avoided in future major tram and light rail infrastructure projects and we look forward to receiving Lord Hardie's findings when they are made available."" The tram project was first mooted in 2003 when the Labour-led Scottish executive proposed building a network of tram lines at a cost of Â£375m by 2009. When the SNP minority government was elected in 2007, it planned to scrap the project. But that decision was overturned when the other parties in the Scottish Parliament voted in favour of pressing ahead. Read more stories from Edinburgh, Fife and East Scotland,external After that, the government said it would not provide additional funding beyond the Â£500m committed by MSPs. By the time the first trams started running on the 8.7mile (14km) route in May 2014, the total cost of the project had reached Â£776m. Conservative MSP Miles Briggs questioned why the inquiry had not yet completed its findings. He said: ""The final submissions to this inquiry were received in 2018, yet the public inquiry is somehow still in progress - siphoning off millions of pounds of public money in the process. ""It shouldn't be too much to ask for Edinburgh residents to get the answers they deserve out of this inquiry, while also delivering value for money for the taxpayer.""

"Edinburgh's Melville Monument in St Andrew Square is now dedicated to those enslaved because of Henry Dundas' actions Edinburgh is to become the latest Scottish city to apologise for its role in the slave trade. Councillors unanimously accepted all 10 recommendations from a review group looking at its colonial legacy. Those included a public acknowledgement of the ""city's past role in sustaining slavery and colonialism"", and to issue an apology to people who suffered. Statues, monuments and street names will be retained but ""re-presented"" to explain their historical significance. Among those highlightedÂ as problematic were the first minister's official residence in Charlotte Square, of which three historic ownersÂ ""directly benefitedÂ from Atlantic slavery,"" the report stated. Glasgow's statues connected to Atlantic slave trade How Scotland's city streets tell a story of slavery Edinburgh's Dundas statue to be dedicated to slavery victims India Street and JamaicaÂ Street in the city's New Town were both ""named as a celebration of empire"" while St Andrew Square's controversial Melville Monument dedicated toÂ Henry Dundas - which now has a plaque dedicated to those enslaved because of his actions - was also listed. Edinburgh's city council will now set up a working group to progress the details ofthe recommendations,external. It follows a similar move by Glasgow in March, while other UK cities such as Liverpool and London have previously issued formal apologies. Council leader Cammy Day said the review, which cost the local authorityÂ Â£18,500, showed ""commitmentÂ from the council to be progressive, open and honest about the history of Edinburgh"". He told BBC Scotland the city's Lord Provost, councillor Robert Aldridge, would be asked to make the apology on behalf of the city ""as soon as possible"". The latest headlines from Scotland,external Read more stories from Edinburgh, Fife and East Scotland,external Set up in 2020 in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, the review was chaired by Jamaican-born academic Sir Geoff Palmer, a human rights activist and campaigner on the issue. ""It is a wonderful achievement for all of us,"" Sir Geoff, professor emeritus at Heriot-Watt University, told BBC Scotland. ""If we look even further, it is a wonderful achievement for the people of Edinburgh and Scotland. ""I have lived in Scotland since 1964 and what I find about the Scottish people is they will believe what they know. ""But once you tell them something they can check themselves, which seems obviously true to them, then the lie goes and the truth goes in its place. Henceforth they only accept the truth."" Sir Geoff Palmer, Scotland's first black professor, chaired the review group into Edinburgh's colonial past The review group's report, running to nearly 150 pages, was based on a survey of about 4,000 people, and further research. Prof Palmer said the council's decision to accept its recommendations was ""very significant"" and a civic apology was an important step. ""An apology doesn't buy bread but it gives another form of sustenance,"" he said. ""It is about feeling that somebody has looked at something and recognised it was wrong. They are saying to you, the person offended, that they regret what has happened. ""Even though many people say 'we weren't there, it wasn't our doing', we all have responsibilities. We are responsible for what happened in the past, because the past has consequences. We can't change the past but we can change the consequences of racism. ""I feel this movement to try to redress the 300 years of enslaving people because of their colour will become universal."" Sir Geoff said that most people who took part in the survey agreed that taking down statues and renaming streets was not the best way to help redress past iniquities. ""When you look at our history of slavery, if you remove the evidence, you remove the deed,"" he added. ""That is what taking down a statue or street name is. You are trying to hide that history and that is what we should not do."" Sir Geoff believes the death of George Floyd in May 2020 was the catalyst for a significant change in attitudes towards racism. Mr Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage showed a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the ground. His death triggered a wave of protests across the United States. ""I think the world saw over nine minutes how a black person was murdered, for no other reason that somebody thought he was inferior and you could do it and could get away with it,"" Prof Palmer told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme. ""I think that was one of the most significant moments in the history of slavery.""

"Shamima Begum, who fled the UK and joined the Islamic State group, was smuggled into Syria by an intelligence agent for Canada. Files seen by the BBC show he claimed to have shared Ms Begum's passport details with Canada, and smuggled other Britons to fight for IS. Ms Begum's lawyers are challenging the removal of her citizenship, arguing she was a trafficking victim. Canada and the UK declined to comment on security issues. Ms Begum was 15 when she and two other east London schoolgirls - Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-old Amira Abase - travelled to Syria to join the IS group in 2015. At the main Istanbul bus station, the girls met Mohammed Al Rasheed, who would facilitate their journey to IS-controlled Syria. A senior intelligence officer, at an agency which is part of the global coalition against IS, has confirmed to the BBC that Rasheed was providing information to Canadian intelligence while smuggling people to IS. The BBC has obtained a dossier on Rasheed that contains information gathered by law enforcement and intelligence, as well as material recovered from his hard drives, which provide extraordinary detail about how he operated. He told authorities that he had gathered information on the people he helped into Syria because he was passing it to the Canadian embassy in Jordan. Shamima Begum offers to help fight terror in UK Can you be stripped of your British citizenship? Shamima Begum cannot return to UK, court rules Rasheed, who was arrested in Turkey within days of smuggling Ms Begum to IS, told authorities he had shared a photo of the passport the British schoolgirl was using. The Metropolitan Police were searching for her, although by the time Canada received her passport details, Ms Begum was already in Syria. The dossier shows that Ms Begum was moved to Syria through a substantial IS people-smuggling network that was controlled from the group's de-facto capital in Raqqa. Rasheed was in charge of the Turkish side of this network and facilitated the travel of British men, women and children to IS for at least eight months before he helped Ms Begum and her two friends. Ms Begum toldthe BBC's forthcoming I'm Not A Monster podcast: ""He organised the entire trip from Turkey to Syriaâ¦ I don't think anyone would have been able to make it to Syria without the help of smugglers. ""He had helped a lot of people come inâ¦ We were just doing everything he was telling us to do because he knew everything, we didn't know anything."" Rasheed kept information about the people he helped, often photographing their ID documents or secretly filming them on his phone. One recording shows Ms Begum and her friends get out of a taxi and into a waiting car not far from the Syrian border. This video can not be played WATCH: Video shows Shamima Begum during journey to Syria Rasheed also gathered information about IS, mapping the locations of the homes of Western IS fighters in Syria, identifying IP addresses and locations of internet cafes in IS-controlled territory, and taking screenshots of conversations he was having with IS fighters. In one conversation, Rasheed spoke to a man believed to be notorious British IS fighter and recruiter, Raphael Hostey, who says to him: ""I need you to work under me. Officiallyâ¦ I want you to help us bring people in."" In a follow-up text, Rasheed asks Hostey: ""Can you explain a little, please?"" Hostey says: ""Same thing that you're doing now, but you work for us bringing equipment, bringing in brothers and sisters"". Mohammed Al Rasheed replies: ""I am ready, brother."" Rasheed was arrested in the Turkish city of Sanliurfa not long after he had facilitated the girl's journey to Syria. In a statement to law enforcement, he said that the reason he had gathered information on everyone he had helped, including Shamima, was because ""I was passing this information to the Canadian embassy in Jordan"". Rasheed said that in 2013 he had gone to the Canadian Embassy in Jordan to try to apply for asylum. He said: ""They told me they were going to grant me my Canadian citizenship if I collect information about the activities of ISIS."" The BBC has been able to confirm that Rasheed passed in and out of Jordan multiple times between 2013 and his arrest in 2015. Tasnime Akunjee, the lawyer for the Begum family, said there will be a legal hearing in November to challenge the removal of Ms Begum's citizenship and ""one of the main arguments"" will be that then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid did not consider that she was a victim of trafficking. ""The UK has international obligations as to how we view a trafficked person and what culpability we prescribe to them for their actions,"" he said. Mr Akunjee said it was ""shocking"" that a Canadian intelligence asset was a key part of the smuggling operation - ""someone who is supposed to be an ally, protecting our people, rather than trafficking British children into a war zone"". ""Intelligence-gathering looks to have been prioritised over the lives of children,"" he said. Shamima Begum is now held in a detention camp in north-east Syria. Her citizenship was taken away in 2019 after she emerged from the ashes of the so-called IS caliphate. A British government spokesperson said: ""It is our long-standing policy that we do not comment on operational intelligence or security matters."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he could not ""comment on intelligence matters"", but added that ""at the moment"" he did not recognise ""what's being reported"". Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said intelligence services needed to be ""flexible"" and ""creative in their approaches"" to fight terrorism, but ""they are bound by strict rules"". ""We will continue to ensure that proper oversight is done, and as necessary look at further steps"", he added, while speaking at a press conference in Ottawa. A Canadian Security Intelligence Service spokesman said he could not ""publicly comment on or confirm or deny the specifics of CSIS investigations, operational interests, methodologies or activities"".

"Figures from across the world are paying tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev who has died in Moscow at the age of 91 Gorbachev was the last leader of the Soviet Union - from which modern Russia emerged - and is best known for opening up the USSR to the world Many Russians blame him and his policies for the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 - which Vladimir Putin sees as a historic mistake The head of the UN said Gorbachev ""changed the course of history"", while US President Joe Biden called him a ""rare leader"" who imagined a different future for his country Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says he was a statesman who will go down in history but that his romanticism about relations with the West ""did not work out"" Gorbachev will be buried in Moscowâs Novodevichy Cemetery next to his wife Raisa, who died in 1999 Edited by Claudia Allen Thank you for following our live coverage of reaction to the death of Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader who helped bring the Cold War to a peaceful end. Let's recap what we've heard: Read our full storyhereand watch BBC Russia editor Steve Rosenberg's obituary below: This video can not be played Watch: How Mikhail Gorbachev changed the world We've been getting more reaction from people who knew the former Soviet leader. Nina Khrusheva is the granddaughter of former Soviet leader, Nikita Krushchev. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Gorbachev's death marked the end of an era. Regarding Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Khrusheva says ""it seems we moved back the clock"" to something Gorbachev ""tried to save us from"". She says she had heard he was ""completely devastated"" by the war. When President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden met in Geneva in June 2021, Gorbachev had hoped it would be a turning point in international relations, like he was able to do with US President Ronald Regan and the UK's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Khrusheva says Gorbachev was ""devastated by the development of global affairs"". Khrusheva, who is professor of international affairs at The New School in New York, says she once spoke to him about his unpopularity in Russia. Gorbachev said: ""I gave Poland to the Poles, what is it I'm accused of?"" She says he remembered in 1989, when the Berlin Wall was falling, he was called by Socialist leaders who told him to ""save the Soviet Socialist Bloc"". He retorted: ""I can't dictate the fates of the world to the world... if they don't want to be with us we really have to let them go."" Until that time, says Khrusheva, Soviet tanks would have been sent into areas wanting to break away from the Soviet Union. Gorbachev, in 1989, was the first Russian leader in history to refuse to do so. Mikhail Gorbachev (c) and John Major (r) meet in London, July 1991 Former British Prime Minister John Major has paid tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev. In a statement, Major says the former Soviet leader ""was the most remarkable figure in post-war Russia, and was instrumental in bringing the Cold War to a close"". ""At the moment it was needed, he acted and spoke for peace, and stood on the right side of history,"" he adds. John Major was the UK's prime minister from 1990 to 1997. Our colleagues at BBC Monitoring have been looking at how the Russian media are covering Mikhail Gorbachev's death. Here's a quick round up from them: In a 10-minute
tribute, news channel Rossiya 24 noted Gorbachev's popularity abroad,
but said that inside the country his policies provoked ""increasingly more
questions"". It also
sought to present Gorbachev as having been in favour of Russia's
actions in Ukraine: in a clip from a 2014 interview, he is shown saying
that apart from the western part of the country, Ukraine was populated by
""people who are very close to us"". ""He has
always been considered an extremely controversial figure in modern Russian
history,"" said Channel One. ""Will
there be a monument to Mikhail Gorbachev in Russia?"" wondered NTV,
adding that attitudes to him inside the country were ""ambivalent"". The
pro-Kremlin daily newspaper Izvestia described Gorbachev
as ""the leader of a great country, which he did not manage to hold
together"". We've got a fresh response to the death of Mikhail Gorbachev from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Gorbachev was a statesman who will go down in history, Peskov says, according to the Reuters news agency. But the man who opened up the Soviet Union and had famously good relationships with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher had a misplaced âromanticismâ about the possibility of cordial relations with the West, he adds. Peskov continues: ""The bloodthirstiness of our opponents showed itself."" Mikhail Gorbachev and Vladimir Putin in 2004 Russian president Vladimir Putin has expressed his ""deep sympathies"" after Mikhail Gorbachev's death. But the two men haven't always seen eye to eye, with the former Soviet leader becoming a strong critic of the leader in the Kremlin in recent years. For Putin, the end of the Soviet Union - which Gorbachev's presided over - was a tragic mistake. Speaking to the BBC in 2013, Gorbachev said he supported Putin during his first term as president - more than two decades ago - but then ""relations between us soured"". He decried new laws passed by Putin as an ""attack on the rights of citizens"", saying the Russian leader should change his style and ""not be afraid of his own people"". He also said Putin's inner circle was full of ""thieves and corrupt officials"". However, in 2014, Gorbachev defended Putin's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. His statements led Ukraine to ban him from entering the country for five years. In 2016, Gorbachev told the UK's Sunday Times that he would have acted the same way as Putin in a similar situation. He also said he thought the loss of trust between Russia and the West was ""catastrophic"". At the end of last year - before Russia's invasion of Ukraine  - Gorbachev criticised American ""arrogance"" after the the Cold War as a reason for tensions in eastern Europe. Despite their frictions, on Gorbachev's 90th birthday in March 2021, President Putin praised him as ""one of the most outstanding statesmen of modern times who made a considerable impact on the history of our nation and the world"". The German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz has praised Mikhail Gorbachev as a ""courageous reformer"". His policy allowed Germany to unify and for the Iron Curtain to disappear. Thanks to Gorbachev, Russia had the opportunity to establish democracy, but he died at a time when democracy failed in Russia and President Putin opened new rifts in Europe.  Mikhail Gorbachev (left) and Boris Johnson pictured in London in 2009 UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been adding to his earlier tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev, describing the former Soviet leader as someone who changed the world for the better. ""When you look at what he did to make Europe whole, free to give freedom to the countries of the former Soviet Union, it was a quite extraordinary thing,"" he says. ""Of course, Mikhail Gorbachev was one of those people who triggered a series of changes that perhaps he didnât anticipate. Maybe he paid his own political price for it. But when history is written he will be I think one of the authors of fantastic change for the better in the world.  ""What I worry about today is that the current leadership in Moscow is intent on undoing the good Gorbachev did and is intent on a revenge-driven attempt to recreate that Soviet Empire. ""And you are seeing that in Ukraine. That is the tragedy [and] something I think Gorbachev would have thought was unthinkable, unwarranted and irrational."" Mikhail Gorbachev (right) with Erich Honecker (left) in East Berlin in October 1989 Former senior BBC correspondent Bridget Kendall first took up her post as Moscow correspondent in the summer of 1989 and witnessed Mikhail Gorbachev's political style first-hand during a trip to East Berlin that year. The visit marked 40 years of the East German Socialist Republic under the communist socialist leader Erich Honecker and came at a ""very tense time"", she says. ""It was already a time when people in East Germany, particularly young people, were on the streets protesting in large numbers to say they wanted more freedom, freedom to be able to travel to the West,"" she tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I remember it was very bizarre. On the one hand, the East German capital was full of goose-stepping East German soldiers celebrating the anniversary with Honecker - and Gorbachev was next to him standing on a podium saying 'We'll be here another 40 years'. Mikhail Gorbachev kisses Erich Honecker during the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic ""And then Gorbachev ducked away after the official programme and went into a park where he was surrounded by East Germans. And he began to talk to them in Russian, saying, 'It's up to you what your future is'."" Kendall recalls this ""vividly"" as most journalists there were German and didn't speak Russian, leaving her to translate. ""Of course, he did this entirely deliberately because he knew very well that West German television companies would broadcast his words back into East Germany and it would go throughout the country as a kind of counterpoint to what was happening on the stage with Honecker,"" she adds. ""So that's a good example of his political style, the way he realised that he could play one side off against the other to try and further what he was trying to do."" Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor Mikhail Gorbachev pictured in 1984 Mikhail Gorbachev had set out to modernise the Soviet Union. By the time he left office, the country didn't exist. He'll be remembered by many in Russia as the leader who lost an empire. And yet it was Gorbachev who gave so many in his country their first taste of freedom. He was instrumental in ending the Cold War, and he worked with the US President Ronald Reagan to slash nuclear arsenals. His reforms at home inspired millions across Central and Eastern Europe. They began pushing for their own freedoms from Moscow. Communist regimes tumbled as the Berlin Wall, the most potent symbol of the Iron Curtain, came crashing down. But much of what Gorbachev changed didn't last. In today's Russia, democratic freedoms are being eroded and east-west confrontation is back. In April 1989, then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev met Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 10 Downing Street. Thatcher hailed the talks as ""deep, very wide-ranging and very friendly"". Gorbachev was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize a year later ""for the leading role he played in the radical changes in East-West relations"". Watch Thatcher and Gorbachev hail their 1989 meeting as an celebration of the ""opening up"" of East and West. This video can not be played When Mikhail Gorbachev visited Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street A former British ambassador has shared a touching message penned by Mikhail Gorbachev to the diplomat's son, Charlie. Tom Fletcher, a former UK ambassador to Lebanon and adviser to three prime ministers, wrote on Twitter that he had frequently asked world leaders to write down pieces of advice to his son. He asked them what they'd like to say to him on his 14th birthday in 2020. The note from Gorbachev, dated 6 June 2008, and which was written in Russian before being translated by an aide, noted that the former Soviet leader ""may no longer be around"" by the time Charlie read the message. ""The success you take will ultimately be equal to what you put in,"" the then-77-year old scrawled in looping handwriting. ""My best wishes for a life that makes a difference,"" concluded Gorbachev.

""When you see a chance to make an impact, to leave a better world for the next generation, I hope youâll think about Mikhail Gorbachev and ask yourself, 'If not me, who? If not now, when?'

""When he came to power, the Cold War had gone on for nearly 40 years and communism for even longer, with devastating consequences,"" says Biden. Gorbachev was brave enough to embrace democratic reforms and nuclear disarmament, says Biden. ""These were the acts of a rare leader â one with the imagination to see that a different future was possible and the courage to risk his entire career to achieve it. The result was a safer world and greater freedom for millions of people."" Biden says that even after leaving the Kremlin, Gorbachev remained ""deeply engaged"". People everywhere benefited from Gorbachev's ""belief in a better world"", says the US president. Gorbachev became one of the most influential figures of the 20th Century, but he was born into relative poverty on 2 March 1931 in the Stavropol region of southern Russia.

Read Steve's thoughts on Gorbachev here: Mikhail Gorbachev: Remembering a warm-hearted and generous man Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev were married for 46 years before her death in 1999 Former US Secretary of State James A Baker has paid tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev and said that the world will miss his influence on international affairs. Baker, who negotiated the reunification of Germany with Gorbachev in 1990, hailed the Soviet leader and said his efforts had ensured the peaceful conclusion of the Cold War. ""History will remember Mikhail Gorbachev as a giant who steered his great nation toward democracy,"" Baker said. ""He played the critical role in a peaceful conclusion of the Cold War by his decision against using force to hold the empire together. I found him to be an honest broker and could count on his word despite domestic pressure in Moscow."" ""The free world misses him greatly,"" Baker concluded. A number of EU leaders have paid tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev after the announcement of the former Soviet leader's death. French President Emmanuel Macron said Gorbachev's ""commitment to peace in Europe changed our common history"". Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin tweeted his condolences and hailed Gorbachev's ""commitment to openness, reform, and building bridges with the West"". Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said the 91-year-old ""shaped the rapprochement between East and West after the fall of the Iron Curtain in Europe"". And Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte lamented the loss of a ""a courageous reformer with immense influence on history"". When the BBC's Steve Rosenberg interviewed Mikhail Gorbachev in 2013, he certainly didn't expect it to end in a singalong. Here's what Steve wrote about the encounter: The interview was over and Mr Gorbachev was showing us the grand piano in the corner of the room. 'Can any of you play?' he asked. I nodded. 'Then, please, play something,' he replied. I sat down and played the Russian classic 'Moscow Nights' - and Mr Gorbachev began to sing. That was followed by 'Dark is the Night' and 'The Misty Morning' - a song he said was a favourite of his late wife. 'Raisa liked my singing,' he smiled. It was a slightly surreal, but rather special moment which I think shows the warm human side of the man who ended the Cold War. Watch the clip here: Duetting with Mikhail Gorbachev Â© 2025 BBC.

tribute, news channel Rossiya 24 noted Gorbachev's popularity abroad,
but said that inside the country his policies provoked ""increasingly more
questions"". It also
sought to present Gorbachev as having been in favour of Russia's
actions in Ukraine: in a clip from a 2014 interview, he is shown saying
that apart from the western part of the country, Ukraine was populated by
""people who are very close to us"". ""He has
always been considered an extremely controversial figure in modern Russian
history,"" said Channel One. ""Will
there be a monument to Mikhail Gorbachev in Russia?"" wondered NTV,
adding that attitudes to him inside the country were ""ambivalent"". The
pro-Kremlin daily newspaper Izvestia described Gorbachev
as ""the leader of a great country, which he did not manage to hold
together"". We've got a fresh response to the death of Mikhail Gorbachev from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Gorbachev was a statesman who will go down in history, Peskov says, according to the Reuters news agency. But the man who opened up the Soviet Union and had famously good relationships with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher had a misplaced âromanticismâ about the possibility of cordial relations with the West, he adds. Peskov continues: ""The bloodthirstiness of our opponents showed itself."" Mikhail Gorbachev and Vladimir Putin in 2004 Russian president Vladimir Putin has expressed his ""deep sympathies"" after Mikhail Gorbachev's death. But the two men haven't always seen eye to eye, with the former Soviet leader becoming a strong critic of the leader in the Kremlin in recent years. For Putin, the end of the Soviet Union - which Gorbachev's presided over - was a tragic mistake. Speaking to the BBC in 2013, Gorbachev said he supported Putin during his first term as president - more than two decades ago - but then ""relations between us soured"". He decried new laws passed by Putin as an ""attack on the rights of citizens"", saying the Russian leader should change his style and ""not be afraid of his own people"". He also said Putin's inner circle was full of ""thieves and corrupt officials"". However, in 2014, Gorbachev defended Putin's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. His statements led Ukraine to ban him from entering the country for five years. In 2016, Gorbachev told the UK's Sunday Times that he would have acted the same way as Putin in a similar situation. He also said he thought the loss of trust between Russia and the West was ""catastrophic"". At the end of last year - before Russia's invasion of Ukraine  - Gorbachev criticised American ""arrogance"" after the the Cold War as a reason for tensions in eastern Europe. Despite their frictions, on Gorbachev's 90th birthday in March 2021, President Putin praised him as ""one of the most outstanding statesmen of modern times who made a considerable impact on the history of our nation and the world"". The German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz has praised Mikhail Gorbachev as a ""courageous reformer"". His policy allowed Germany to unify and for the Iron Curtain to disappear. Thanks to Gorbachev, Russia had the opportunity to establish democracy, but he died at a time when democracy failed in Russia and President Putin opened new rifts in Europe.  Mikhail Gorbachev (left) and Boris Johnson pictured in London in 2009 UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been adding to his earlier tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev, describing the former Soviet leader as someone who changed the world for the better. ""When you look at what he did to make Europe whole, free to give freedom to the countries of the former Soviet Union, it was a quite extraordinary thing,"" he says. ""Of course, Mikhail Gorbachev was one of those people who triggered a series of changes that perhaps he didnât anticipate. Maybe he paid his own political price for it. But when history is written he will be I think one of the authors of fantastic change for the better in the world.  ""What I worry about today is that the current leadership in Moscow is intent on undoing the good Gorbachev did and is intent on a revenge-driven attempt to recreate that Soviet Empire. ""And you are seeing that in Ukraine. That is the tragedy [and] something I think Gorbachev would have thought was unthinkable, unwarranted and irrational."" Mikhail Gorbachev (right) with Erich Honecker (left) in East Berlin in October 1989 Former senior BBC correspondent Bridget Kendall first took up her post as Moscow correspondent in the summer of 1989 and witnessed Mikhail Gorbachev's political style first-hand during a trip to East Berlin that year. The visit marked 40 years of the East German Socialist Republic under the communist socialist leader Erich Honecker and came at a ""very tense time"", she says. ""It was already a time when people in East Germany, particularly young people, were on the streets protesting in large numbers to say they wanted more freedom, freedom to be able to travel to the West,"" she tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I remember it was very bizarre. On the one hand, the East German capital was full of goose-stepping East German soldiers celebrating the anniversary with Honecker - and Gorbachev was next to him standing on a podium saying 'We'll be here another 40 years'. Mikhail Gorbachev kisses Erich Honecker during the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic ""And then Gorbachev ducked away after the official programme and went into a park where he was surrounded by East Germans. And he began to talk to them in Russian, saying, 'It's up to you what your future is'."" Kendall recalls this ""vividly"" as most journalists there were German and didn't speak Russian, leaving her to translate. ""Of course, he did this entirely deliberately because he knew very well that West German television companies would broadcast his words back into East Germany and it would go throughout the country as a kind of counterpoint to what was happening on the stage with Honecker,"" she adds. ""So that's a good example of his political style, the way he realised that he could play one side off against the other to try and further what he was trying to do."" Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor Mikhail Gorbachev pictured in 1984 Mikhail Gorbachev had set out to modernise the Soviet Union. By the time he left office, the country didn't exist. He'll be remembered by many in Russia as the leader who lost an empire. And yet it was Gorbachev who gave so many in his country their first taste of freedom. He was instrumental in ending the Cold War, and he worked with the US President Ronald Reagan to slash nuclear arsenals. His reforms at home inspired millions across Central and Eastern Europe. They began pushing for their own freedoms from Moscow. Communist regimes tumbled as the Berlin Wall, the most potent symbol of the Iron Curtain, came crashing down. But much of what Gorbachev changed didn't last. In today's Russia, democratic freedoms are being eroded and east-west confrontation is back. In April 1989, then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev met Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 10 Downing Street. Thatcher hailed the talks as ""deep, very wide-ranging and very friendly"". Gorbachev was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize a year later ""for the leading role he played in the radical changes in East-West relations"". Watch Thatcher and Gorbachev hail their 1989 meeting as an celebration of the ""opening up"" of East and West. This video can not be played When Mikhail Gorbachev visited Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street A former British ambassador has shared a touching message penned by Mikhail Gorbachev to the diplomat's son, Charlie. Tom Fletcher, a former UK ambassador to Lebanon and adviser to three prime ministers, wrote on Twitter that he had frequently asked world leaders to write down pieces of advice to his son. He asked them what they'd like to say to him on his 14th birthday in 2020. The note from Gorbachev, dated 6 June 2008, and which was written in Russian before being translated by an aide, noted that the former Soviet leader ""may no longer be around"" by the time Charlie read the message. ""The success you take will ultimately be equal to what you put in,"" the then-77-year old scrawled in looping handwriting. ""My best wishes for a life that makes a difference,"" concluded Gorbachev.

Sir Rodric Braithwaite, who served as the UK's ambassador to Moscow from 1988-92, told the BBC that despite how he is portrayed in Russian media, Gorbachev was a brave man who tried and failed to save his country. ""He's now, by the hard men in Russia, regarded as incompetent, weak and perhaps even a traitor who sold out to the West,"" says Braithwaite. ""He was a decent man who really did try to do something original for his country."" The former top diplomat adds: ""He's in the long line of Russian reformers who tried to do something about the burdensome legacy that Russia suffers from - and who failed."" Arnold Schwarzeneggerhas paid tribute to the statesman on Twitter,,externalsharing how he admired Gorbachev's reformist courage as leader of the USSR. ""Imagine rising to the very top of any organization, and then having the wisdom AND the courage to look around and say, 'This doesnât work for the people, someone has to fix it. If not me, who? If not now, when?'"" wrote the action star. ""He did exactly that in the old Soviet Union. He will be remembered for all time as a hero who dismantled the communist system despite what it meant for his own power. ""He belongs to history now,"" continued Schwarzenegger. ""When you see a chance to make an impact, to leave a better world for the next generation, I hope youâll think about Mikhail Gorbachev and ask yourself, 'If not me, who? If not now, when?' I know I will."" US President Joe Biden has released a statement hailing ""a man of remarkable vision"" and sending his condolences. ""When he came to power, the Cold War had gone on for nearly 40 years and communism for even longer, with devastating consequences,"" says Biden. Gorbachev was brave enough to embrace democratic reforms and nuclear disarmament, says Biden. ""These were the acts of a rare leader â one with the imagination to see that a different future was possible and the courage to risk his entire career to achieve it. The result was a safer world and greater freedom for millions of people."" Biden says that even after leaving the Kremlin, Gorbachev remained ""deeply engaged"". People everywhere benefited from Gorbachev's ""belief in a better world"", says the US president. Gorbachev became one of the most influential figures of the 20th Century, but he was born into relative poverty on 2 March 1931 in the Stavropol region of southern Russia.

Together they have discussed everything from his lasting legacy and Putin's grip on Russia to popular Soviet-era  songs and the importance of chicken in Russian life. Read Steve's thoughts on Gorbachev here: Mikhail Gorbachev: Remembering a warm-hearted and generous man Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev were married for 46 years before her death in 1999 Former US Secretary of State James A Baker has paid tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev and said that the world will miss his influence on international affairs. Baker, who negotiated the reunification of Germany with Gorbachev in 1990, hailed the Soviet leader and said his efforts had ensured the peaceful conclusion of the Cold War. ""History will remember Mikhail Gorbachev as a giant who steered his great nation toward democracy,"" Baker said. ""He played the critical role in a peaceful conclusion of the Cold War by his decision against using force to hold the empire together. I found him to be an honest broker and could count on his word despite domestic pressure in Moscow."" ""The free world misses him greatly,"" Baker concluded. A number of EU leaders have paid tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev after the announcement of the former Soviet leader's death. French President Emmanuel Macron said Gorbachev's ""commitment to peace in Europe changed our common history"". Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin tweeted his condolences and hailed Gorbachev's ""commitment to openness, reform, and building bridges with the West"". Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said the 91-year-old ""shaped the rapprochement between East and West after the fall of the Iron Curtain in Europe"". And Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte lamented the loss of a ""a courageous reformer with immense influence on history"". When the BBC's Steve Rosenberg interviewed Mikhail Gorbachev in 2013, he certainly didn't expect it to end in a singalong. Here's what Steve wrote about the encounter: The interview was over and Mr Gorbachev was showing us the grand piano in the corner of the room. 'Can any of you play?' he asked. I nodded. 'Then, please, play something,' he replied. I sat down and played the Russian classic 'Moscow Nights' - and Mr Gorbachev began to sing. That was followed by 'Dark is the Night' and 'The Misty Morning' - a song he said was a favourite of his late wife. 'Raisa liked my singing,' he smiled. It was a slightly surreal, but rather special moment which I think shows the warm human side of the man who ended the Cold War. Watch the clip here: Duetting with Mikhail Gorbachev Â© 2025 BBC.

"Shamima Begum, who fled the UK and joined the Islamic State group, was smuggled into Syria by an intelligence agent for Canada. Files seen by the BBC show he claimed to have shared Ms Begum's passport details with Canada, and smuggled other Britons to fight for IS. Ms Begum's lawyers are challenging the removal of her citizenship, arguing she was a trafficking victim. Canada and the UK declined to comment on security issues. Ms Begum was 15 when she and two other east London schoolgirls - Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-old Amira Abase - travelled to Syria to join the IS group in 2015. At the main Istanbul bus station, the girls met Mohammed Al Rasheed, who would facilitate their journey to IS-controlled Syria. A senior intelligence officer, at an agency which is part of the global coalition against IS, has confirmed to the BBC that Rasheed was providing information to Canadian intelligence while smuggling people to IS. The BBC has obtained a dossier on Rasheed that contains information gathered by law enforcement and intelligence, as well as material recovered from his hard drives, which provide extraordinary detail about how he operated. He told authorities that he had gathered information on the people he helped into Syria because he was passing it to the Canadian embassy in Jordan. Shamima Begum offers to help fight terror in UK Can you be stripped of your British citizenship? Shamima Begum cannot return to UK, court rules Rasheed, who was arrested in Turkey within days of smuggling Ms Begum to IS, told authorities he had shared a photo of the passport the British schoolgirl was using. The Metropolitan Police were searching for her, although by the time Canada received her passport details, Ms Begum was already in Syria. The dossier shows that Ms Begum was moved to Syria through a substantial IS people-smuggling network that was controlled from the group's de-facto capital in Raqqa. Rasheed was in charge of the Turkish side of this network and facilitated the travel of British men, women and children to IS for at least eight months before he helped Ms Begum and her two friends. Ms Begum toldthe BBC's forthcoming I'm Not A Monster podcast: ""He organised the entire trip from Turkey to Syriaâ¦ I don't think anyone would have been able to make it to Syria without the help of smugglers. ""He had helped a lot of people come inâ¦ We were just doing everything he was telling us to do because he knew everything, we didn't know anything."" Rasheed kept information about the people he helped, often photographing their ID documents or secretly filming them on his phone. One recording shows Ms Begum and her friends get out of a taxi and into a waiting car not far from the Syrian border. This video can not be played WATCH: Video shows Shamima Begum during journey to Syria Rasheed also gathered information about IS, mapping the locations of the homes of Western IS fighters in Syria, identifying IP addresses and locations of internet cafes in IS-controlled territory, and taking screenshots of conversations he was having with IS fighters. In one conversation, Rasheed spoke to a man believed to be notorious British IS fighter and recruiter, Raphael Hostey, who says to him: ""I need you to work under me. Officiallyâ¦ I want you to help us bring people in."" In a follow-up text, Rasheed asks Hostey: ""Can you explain a little, please?"" Hostey says: ""Same thing that you're doing now, but you work for us bringing equipment, bringing in brothers and sisters"". Mohammed Al Rasheed replies: ""I am ready, brother."" Rasheed was arrested in the Turkish city of Sanliurfa not long after he had facilitated the girl's journey to Syria. In a statement to law enforcement, he said that the reason he had gathered information on everyone he had helped, including Shamima, was because ""I was passing this information to the Canadian embassy in Jordan"". Rasheed said that in 2013 he had gone to the Canadian Embassy in Jordan to try to apply for asylum. He said: ""They told me they were going to grant me my Canadian citizenship if I collect information about the activities of ISIS."" The BBC has been able to confirm that Rasheed passed in and out of Jordan multiple times between 2013 and his arrest in 2015. Tasnime Akunjee, the lawyer for the Begum family, said there will be a legal hearing in November to challenge the removal of Ms Begum's citizenship and ""one of the main arguments"" will be that then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid did not consider that she was a victim of trafficking. ""The UK has international obligations as to how we view a trafficked person and what culpability we prescribe to them for their actions,"" he said. Mr Akunjee said it was ""shocking"" that a Canadian intelligence asset was a key part of the smuggling operation - ""someone who is supposed to be an ally, protecting our people, rather than trafficking British children into a war zone"". ""Intelligence-gathering looks to have been prioritised over the lives of children,"" he said. Shamima Begum is now held in a detention camp in north-east Syria. Her citizenship was taken away in 2019 after she emerged from the ashes of the so-called IS caliphate. A British government spokesperson said: ""It is our long-standing policy that we do not comment on operational intelligence or security matters."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he could not ""comment on intelligence matters"", but added that ""at the moment"" he did not recognise ""what's being reported"". Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said intelligence services needed to be ""flexible"" and ""creative in their approaches"" to fight terrorism, but ""they are bound by strict rules"". ""We will continue to ensure that proper oversight is done, and as necessary look at further steps"", he added, while speaking at a press conference in Ottawa. A Canadian Security Intelligence Service spokesman said he could not ""publicly comment on or confirm or deny the specifics of CSIS investigations, operational interests, methodologies or activities"".

"Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is under Russian occupation The EU is giving more than five million anti-radiation tablets to Ukraine, as fears grow of an accident at Europe's largest nuclear power plant. The Zaporizhzhia plant is under Russian occupation and has recently come under fire, with both sides blaming each other for the attacks. In some areas, officials are already handing out the pills, which can stop the body absorbing radioactive iodine. Residents have been told only to take it if a radiation leak is confirmed. So far, only people living within 50km (30 miles) of the power plant are being offered the potassium iodide tablets, but the European Union is providing Ukraine with more than five million doses which would allow for much wider distribution. How risky is the stand-off over Ukraine's nuclear plant? Preparing for the worst at Ukraine nuclear plant Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine was occupied by Russia soon after it invaded Ukraine in February. Ukrainian staff who continue to operate the plant have told the BBC that Russian troops have used it as a military base and thatworkers are in effect held at gunpoint. While recent fighting in the area has caused some damage to the plant, so far there has not been any recorded increase in radiation levels in the area. Nevertheless, officials are concerned further damage could cause a radiation leak, which could spread over a large area. The UN's nuclear agency has been demanding access to the facility for several months, and a team has arrived in Ukrainein the hope of finally being allowed to inspect the sitein the coming days. The EU said on Tuesday,externalit was providing the tablets as a ""preventative safety measure"" to increase protection in the area around the nuclear plant. Five million pills will come from its emergency reserves and another 500,000 from Austria. Potassium iodide tablets were already being handed out to residents in one part of Zaporizhzhia city on Monday, and 25,000 tablets have been sent to Enerhodar - the city closest to the nuclear plant. ""In the event of an emergency, both adults and children will already be provided with iodide and will be able to protect themselves in time,"" said Anatoliy Kurtyev from Zaporizhzhia city council. He stressed that residents should only take the drug if an accident happens - not as a precautionary measure. Potassium iodide is taken to prevent radioactive iodine - the main cancer-causing isotope also known as iodine-131 - from being absorbed by the thyroid gland. High levels of radioactive iodine can increase the risk of thyroid cancer in infants, children and young people, even years after exposure. If taken at the right time at the right dose, potassium iodide will be absorbed by the thyroid gland instead of the more dangerous iodine-131, reducing the associated health risks. The European Commission says it is to distribute 5.5 million potassium iodide tablets for residents living in vicinity of Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Many countries, including the UK, have a stockpile of these tablets in case of a major nuclear accident or leak. They should only be used if recommended by medical experts, though, for good reason. There are health risks associated with taking them, so they are not something people should try and buy or acquire themselves to take. They are a useful countermeasure because radioactive iodine that is breathed in or consumed in food and drink can be stored in the thyroid gland for some time. The tablets only help protect the thyroid, not other parts of the body. ANALYSIS:The war is static, but ousting Russia is a seismic task ON THE GROUND:What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?

"Producing renewable energy can help tackle costs, and cuts carbon emissions Farmers and energy experts say a lack of capacity in the electricity network is preventing some renewable energy projects from seeing the light of day. NFU Cymru said more Welsh farmers and landowners want to produce clean energy to help reach net zero targets - which means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The farming union's president spoke of ""huge potential untapped in Wales."" An energy expert said the problem was ""pretty significant"". Energy regulator Ofgem said a priority was ""reaching net zero at the lowest cost to consumers and in both a sustainable and efficient way"". It added: ""We are consulting on proposals to alter existing price controls to empower transmission network companies."" For many in the agricultural industry, tackling spiralling costs is a constant challenge, but producing renewable energy brings opportunity, not only to deal with those costs, but also to ensure that agriculture reduces its carbon emissions. How will Wales go green by 2050? Wales' green landscape at risk from climate change Families turn off power as bills rocket - charity Garry Williams, a sheep and beef farmer on the edge of the Brecon Beacons National Park, said: ""We've got 3.9kw of solar panels on site at the moment. We're looking at the possibility of expanding the renewable energy production as a form of diversification. ""The problem is there isn't the capacity in the national grid to take the electric produced down the line,"" says Garry Williams ""But we've got a major problem, and the problem is there isn't the capacity in the National Grid to take the electric produced down the line."" According to NFU Cymru's president, Aled Jones, the lack of capacity on the electricity network is a major barrier for farmers wanting to produce clean energy. He said: ""A lot of members who've been trying to get into diversification projects and renewable energy have found themselves unable to get grid connection because the availability in the grid was insufficient. ""Another issue was getting three phase connection. The cost in some of these rural areas has been prohibitive for some of these projects. ""It's a real, real issue and we've highlighted several times before and government should've known this by now."" He continued: ""We are facing a climate emergency, and farmers are wanting to get on and diversify into other projects. ""At NFU Cymru we've set an ambition to be net zero by 2040, and we've said there are ways of doing it, but other people have got to work with us. ""If government and the availability of grid capacity is not there, it stifles innovation and investment as well. This is serious, there a huge potential, untapped in Wales with renewable projects wanting to proceed but unable to get on."" There are worries that the lack of investment in infrastructure could have an impact on larger scale energy projects in Wales. Plans are in place to generate electricity throughfloating wind farms off the coast of south west Wales. But lack of infrastructure means there are questions about how this project would be connected to the electricity network. ""It's pretty significant because it's such a fundamental change,"" says Duncan Sinclair, of consultancy firm Baringa ""It is a concern, because we've got such a good opportunity in terms of off-shore wind, that if that opportunity goes elsewhere we in Pembrokeshire really do miss out,"" said Samuel Kurtz, the Member of the Senedd (MS) for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire. ""I have got fears that people may be looking elsewhere to take on-shore the cables that would be carrying the electricity. ""But I think that Pembrokeshire lends itself so well to the opportunity that presents itself, and I really do hope that all the stakeholders get together to make sure we take up this opportunity."" Duncan Sinclair, who specialises in energy networks for consultancy firm Baringa, said the issues the grid faced was due to a change in the way it works. ""Electricity networks have been designed based on the old paradigm. ""It's a classic chicken and egg problem in many ways. Generators want to connect to the system, but network operators won't take that step unless they can see enough people needing that capacity. ""So you get into this problem where they're waiting for more requests, but people are reluctant to have to wait and join a queue to connect to the grid."" He added: ""In the old days we had big power stations connected to the transmission system, power flowing through the transmissions system to the distribution network and to the end consumer. That's the way it worked for a number of years. ""Now things are changing fundamentally, with a lot more smaller assets connecting to the distribution networks. ""So small scale renewables, solar, wind farms, and those might be rooftop solar panels on people's houses or projects on agricultural land."" ""The issue there is that now we're putting electricity into the grid from the edges, and the problem comes if there's too much electricity being pumped into the distribution network, and it isn't used locally then it has to flow up the grid. If there isn't enough capacity on the grid then there's a problem because it can't reach customers further away."" National Grid ESO, which operates the electricity system in Wales, England and Scotland, said it was ""working closely with distribution network operators, transmission owners, customers and the Welsh government to support the development of a long term plan for the electricity networks in Wales, to resolve any existing issues with connections and to support delivery against shared ambitions for net zero."" Plaid Cymru's climate change spokeswoman Delyth Jewell said: ""This is yet another example of the dysfunctionality of an overcentralised UK, where the Welsh government is being hampered in its efforts to realise its renewable energy ambitions by not having control over decisions in terms of how the Welsh share of tax money which contributes to the National Grid is spent."" She added farmers were being told to contribute towards Wales' climate change targets and want to do this by producing renewable energy, but were prevented from doing so because of a lack of grid capacity. ""The system should be changed so that a statutory obligation is placed on the National Grid to deliver the grid capacity the Welsh government requires in order to deliver its policy objectives and support the agricultural, industrial and renewable energy industries,"" she added. A Welsh government spokesperson said it recognised the urgent need to increase grid capacity to help Wales reach net zero by 2050 and has repeatedly raised concerns with Ofgem and National Grid ESO. It said it was working with energy experts ""to trigger grid investment to meet Wales's future needs for low carbon heat and transport,"" and expected this to be considered by National Grid ESO. It added: ""Investment is needed so we can better connect new demands for renewable energy and the new generation to meet the needs across Wales.""

"Mikhail Gorbachev was one of the most influential political figures of the 20th Century. He presided over the dissolution of a Soviet Union that had existed for nearly 70 years and had dominated huge swathes of Asia and Eastern Europe. Yet, when he set out his programme of reforms in 1985, his sole intention had been to revive his country's stagnant economy and overhaul its political processes. His efforts became the catalyst for a series of events that brought an end to communist rule, not just within the USSR, but also across its former satellite states. Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev was born on 2 March 1931 in the Stavropol region of southern Russia. His parents both worked on collective farms and the young Gorbachev operated combine harvesters while in his teens. By the time he graduated from Moscow State University in 1955 he was an active member of the Communist Party. He was brought up in rural southern Russia On his return to Stavropol with his new wife Raisa, he began a rapid rise through the regional party structure. Gorbachev was one of a new generation of party activists who became increasingly impatient with the ageing figures at the top of the Soviet hierarchy. By 1961 he was regional secretary of the Young Communist League and had become a delegate to the Party Congress. His role as an agricultural administrator gave him the opportunity to introduce innovations and this, coupled with his status in the party, gave him considerable influence in the region. In 1978 he went to Moscow as a member of the Central Committee's Secretariat for Agriculture and just two years later he was appointed a full member of the Politburo. During Yuri Andropov's tenure as general secretary, Gorbachev made a number of trips abroad, including a 1984 visit to London where he made an impression on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. In a BBC interview she said she was optimistic about future relations with the USSR. ""I like Mr Gorbachev,"" she said. ""We can do business together."" He found an admirer in Margaret Thatcher Gorbachev had been expected to succeed Andropov when the latter died in 1984 but instead the ailing Konstantin Chernenko became general secretary. Within a year, he too was dead and Gorbachev, the youngest member of the Politburo, succeeded him. He was the first general secretary to have been born after the 1917 revolution and was seen as a breath of fresh air after the stagnation of the Leonid Brezhnev years. Gorbachev's stylish dress and open, direct manner were unlike those of any of his predecessors, and Raisa was more like an American first lady than a general secretary's wife. His first task was to revive the moribund Soviet economy, which was almost at the point of collapse. He was also shrewd enough to understand that there needed to be root-and-branch reform of the Communist Party itself if his economic reforms were to succeed. Gorbachev's solution brought two Russian words into common usage. He said the country needed ""perestroika"" or restructuring and his tool for dealing with it was ""glasnost"" - openness. ""You're lagging behind the rest of the economy,"" he told the communist bosses of Leningrad, which was renamed Saint Petersburg in 1991. ""Your shoddy goods are a disgrace."" But it was not his intention to replace state control with a free market economy - as he made clear in a speech to party delegates in 1985. ""Some of you look at the market as a lifesaver for your economies. But, comrades, you should not think about lifesavers but about the ship, and the ship is socialism."" His other weapon for dealing with the stagnation of the system was democracy. For the first time there were free elections for the Congress of People's Deputies. This relaxation of the repressive regime caused a stirring among the many diverse nationalities that comprised the sprawling Soviet Union. Riots in Kazakhstan in December 1986 heralded a period of unrest. Gorbachev wanted to end the Cold War, successfully negotiating with US President Ronald Reagan for the abolition of a whole class of weapons through the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty. And he announced unilateral cuts in Soviet conventional forces, while finally ending the humiliating and bloody occupation of Afghanistan. Under Gorbachev the Cold War rapidly thawed But his toughest test came from those countries that had been unwillingly annexed by the Soviet Union. Here openness and democracy led to calls for independence, which initially Gorbachev put down by force. The break-up of the USSR began in the Baltic republics in the north. Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia broke free from Moscow, starting a rollercoaster that spread to Russia's Warsaw Pact allies. It culminated on 9 November 1989 when, following mass demonstrations, the citizens of East Germany, the most hard-line of the Soviet satellites, were allowed to cross freely into West Berlin. Gorbachev's reaction was not to send in tanks, the traditional Soviet reaction to such blatant opposition, but to announce that reunification of Germany was an internal German affair. In 1990, Gorbachev was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize ""for the leading role he played in the radical changes in East-West relations"". But by August 1991 the communist old guard in Moscow had had enough. They staged a military coup and Gorbachev was arrested while holidaying on the Black Sea. The Moscow party boss, Boris Yeltsin, seized his chance, ending the coup, arresting the demonstrators and stripping Gorbachev of almost all his political power in return for his freedom. Protests in 1991. The coup that year signalled the end of Gorbachev's time in power Six months later, Gorbachev had gone; the Communist Party itself was outlawed and Russia set out on a new, uncertain, future. Mikhail Gorbachev continued to play a vocal role in both Russian and international matters, but his reputation abroad was always higher than at home. When he stood for the Russian presidency in 1996 he received less than 5% of the vote. During the 1990s he took to the international lecture circuit and kept up contacts with world leaders, remaining a heroic figure to many non-Russians, winning numerous awards and honours. He suffered a personal blow in 1999 when Raisa died of leukaemia. Her constant presence at his side had lent a humanising touch to his political reforms. Raisa took a high-profile role alongside her husband Gorbachev remained a strong critic of President Vladimir Putin, who he accused of running an increasingly repressive regime. ""Politics is increasingly turning into imitation democracy, said Gorbachev, ""with all power in the hands of the executive branch."" However, in 2014, Gorbachev defended the referendum that led to Russia's annexation of Crimea. ""While Crimea had previously been joined to Ukraine based on the Soviet laws, which means party laws, without asking the people,"" Gorbachev declared, ""now the people themselves have decided to correct that mistake."" On Gorbachev's 90th birthday in March 2021, President Putin praised him as ""one of the most outstanding statesmen of modern times who made a considerable impact on the history of our nation and the world"". And Gorbachev's own views of his legacy? It was right to end the totalitarian system and the Cold War, and reduce nuclear weapons, he said. But there was still lament over the coup and the end of the Soviet Union. Many Russians still hold him responsible for its collapse. Although a pragmatic and rational politician, Mikhail Gorbachev failed to realise that it was impossible to bring in his reforms without destroying a centralised communist system that millions in the USSR and beyond no longer wanted.

"The Environment Agency has now moved 11 of the 14 areas it covers in England into drought status A drought has been declared across South West England. Bristol, Somerset, south Gloucestershire, Dorset and parts of Wiltshire have been moved to drought status following some of the driest conditions in nearly 90 years. The Environment Agency (EA) decision followsdrought announcements in 10 other areas of the country. People have been urged to ""use water wisely"" due to the impact of the dry summer on the environment. This video can not be played South West England drought The EA confirmed the drought status of the South West based on data including rainfall, river flows, groundwater levels, reservoir levels, and the dryness of soils. Its water situation national report for July found it was the driest July across England since 1935. Rivers, groundwater levels and reservoir stocks had all decreased after five consecutive months of below average rainfall and above average temperatures, added the EA. The EA's latest water situation report shows some river levels are the lowest ever recorded Chris Paul, the EA's area drought lead, said despite there having been some heavy rain over the past two weeks, it had not been enough to compensate for the dry summer. ""River levels across our Wessex area are exceptionally low - many showing the lowest flows on record,"" he said. ""This places incredible strain on local wildlife and this is why we are moving to drought status. ""We are prioritising our local operations to minimise impacts on the environment,"" added Mr Paul. The EA said it will be monitoring the effects of the dry weather on rivers and responding to environmental emergencies, such as rescuing stranded fish. ""We will also be ensuring people and companies who have water abstraction licences only operate within the terms of their licence and taking legal action against those who fail to comply or against anyone who abstracts water without a licence,"" added Mr Paul.

"Mr Watt has been Newsnight's political editor since 2016 A group of anti-lockdown protesters has been sentenced after verbally abusing BBC journalist Nick Watt. The Newsnight political editor was chased and called a traitor near Downing Street on 14 June 2021. A large group had gathered at Westminster to protest against the government's extension of coronavirus restrictions in England by four weeks. Four men and one woman had denied the charges but were found guilty at a trial earlier this month. Martin Hockridge pictured before entering Westminster Magistrates' Court for the trial Each had denied using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress. But footage shared on social media showed demonstrators shouting abuse in the face of Mr Watt, who was wearing a BBC lanyard. Three men, Gary Purnell, 45, Alexander Peat, 34, and Martin Hockridge, 58, were handed 12-month community orders, with a requirement to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. Djazia Chaib-Eddour, 44, was given a 12-month community order, with a requirement to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work and 20 hours of rehabilitation. Djazia Chaib-Eddour leaving Westminster Magistrates' Court after receiving a 12-month community order They were each ordered to pay a total of Â£395 in costs and other charges and given an indefinite restraining order not to contact Mr Watt. District Judge Louisa Cieciora issued an arrest warrant for Christopher Aitken, 62, who did not attend the hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. Prosecutor Sudara Weerasena said Mr Watt had faced further intimidation after attending court for the trial, and the prosecution barrister also needed a police escort. ""Having given evidence in this particular case, he was intimidated leaving the court,"" she said. ""The prosecution advocate had to be escorted out of the building by police."" Police and demonstrators faced each other outside Downing Street during the protest in June 2021 But Ms Cieciora said the allegations could not be ""laid at the door of any of the defendants"", who were still in court at the time. ""This was an extremely unpleasant incident in which each of you used abusive words and threatening behaviour towards Mr Watt,"" the judge said. ""This was committed against somebody who was providing a service to the public, even if you did not agree that service was being performed to the standard it should have been."" Alexander Peat pictured arriving at Westminster Magistrates Court In a victim impact statement, Mr Watt told how he ran to the gates of Downing Street ""as fast as I could"" because of the ""size and aggression of the crowd"". ""At the time of the incident I was shocked and alarmed at what was happening to me,"" he said. ""I felt I was in immense danger."" Mr Watt said he had been the subject of death threats on ""conspiracy theorist forums"" and had concerns ""my safety can no longer be guaranteed"". ""Whilst not from identified suspects in this case, they were clearly inspired by the incident,"" he said. ""My family and I found them very distressing.""

"The Edinburgh Tram Inquiry will cost more than Â£13m, Transport Scotland has projected. The inquiry was established in June 2014 to find out why the tram project was Â£400m over budget and was completed five years late. It is investigating what went wrong with the Â£776m project. However, more than eight years after the inquiry was ordered by former first minister Alex Salmond, it has yet to produce its report. The latest figures on its costs were provided following aFreedom of Information request from the i newspaper,externalto Transport Scotland. When is the last stop for Edinburgh Tram Inquiry? Huge tram extension planned for Edinburgh 'Cheaper' to carry on with Edinburgh tram extension They show that the vast majority of the Â£13.100,812m has been spent on staff and legal fees. Staff costs are due to reach more than Â£6m by the end of this financial year, while legal fees are projected to hit more than Â£3m. A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: ""We have agreed to continue to fund the costs of the Edinburgh Trams Inquiry until it is completed, final costs will be published when they become available. ""Staffing matters, including how many people the inquiry employs and how much they are paid, are a matter for the inquiry. This is because, as a statutory inquiry, it is independent of Scottish government. ""The Edinburgh Tram Inquiry was, of course, established to look at how any mistakes or failures could be avoided in future major tram and light rail infrastructure projects and we look forward to receiving Lord Hardie's findings when they are made available."" The tram project was first mooted in 2003 when the Labour-led Scottish executive proposed building a network of tram lines at a cost of Â£375m by 2009. When the SNP minority government was elected in 2007, it planned to scrap the project. But that decision was overturned when the other parties in the Scottish Parliament voted in favour of pressing ahead. Read more stories from Edinburgh, Fife and East Scotland,external After that, the government said it would not provide additional funding beyond the Â£500m committed by MSPs. By the time the first trams started running on the 8.7mile (14km) route in May 2014, the total cost of the project had reached Â£776m. Conservative MSP Miles Briggs questioned why the inquiry had not yet completed its findings. He said: ""The final submissions to this inquiry were received in 2018, yet the public inquiry is somehow still in progress - siphoning off millions of pounds of public money in the process. ""It shouldn't be too much to ask for Edinburgh residents to get the answers they deserve out of this inquiry, while also delivering value for money for the taxpayer.""

"The Duchess of Sussex says she upset the ""dynamic of the hierarchy"" of the Royal Family ""just by existing"". Inan interview with US magazine The Cut,external, Meghan, 41, talks about her life when she was a royal and why she and the Duke of Sussex moved to the US. Talking about her exit from the Royal Family the duchess said it ""takes a lot of effort to forgive"". She also spoke about Prince Harry's relationship with his father, the Prince of Wales. Asked by journalist Alison P Davis about the impact ofher privacy caseagainst the Mail on Sunday, Meghan said: ""Harry said to me, 'I lost my dad in this process.' ""It doesn't have to be the same for them as it was for me, but that's his decision."" A spokeswoman for the duchess later told BBC News that Meghan was referring to her own father, from whom she is estranged, and was saying she hoped the same would not happen to her husband. A source close to Prince Charles told the PA news agency he would be saddened if Prince Harry felt their relationship was lost, adding: ""The Prince of Wales loves both his sons"". The 37-year-old prince has previously said his father""stopped taking my calls""after thecouple stepped back as senior working royals in 2020. Under the arrangement, the couple gave up their Royal Highness titles, and became able to work to become financially independent. Harry retained the title of prince through birth. Who's in the UK Royal Family and how does it work? Why is Archie not a prince? Prior to this, the Sussexes reportedly set out a vision for continuing to be working royals in the Commonwealth and to earn their own money, in the hope this would reduce ""the noise"" about them. Meghan told The Cut: ""That, for whatever reason, is not something that we were allowed to do, even though several other members of the family do that exact thing."" After announcing they would step back from royal duties, Prince Harry and Meghan initially moved to Canada in January 2020. But,after Canada said it would stop providing security for the family, the family moved to California, where they lived in a home provided by media mogul Tyler Perry before buying their own property in Montecito. Meghan is media dynamite, so a fairly gentle interview, with some open-to-interpretation comments, has blasted its way on to the front pages. For her fans, it was another slice of the unfair, crabby-minded pressures of royal life that forced Meghan and Harry to move to California. For her critics, it was more deluded self-promotion, seizing on quotes such as Meghan being told that her marriage to Harry was greeted in South Africa with rejoicing the same as ""when Mandela was freed from prison"". The article describes them living in the ""home equivalent of billionaires dressing down in denim"" and their complaints might grate with families worried sick about paying energy bills. But the interview raised some of the contradictions facing Harry and Meghan. They wanted to get away from the suffocation of royal life, but their royal links are their most bankable assets. It's like old rockers not wanting to talk about their early records, when that's the only reason people are interested. They also wanted to escape media intrusion and they have in effect become part of the media, with deals with Spotify and Netflix. And Harry voiced the perennial royal dilemma: ""If you do something, they criticise you. If you don't do anything, they criticise you anyway."" Davis, a features writer who has previously interviewed celebrities such as Jada Pinkett Smith and Lena Dunham, asked Meghan if she thought there was room for forgiveness between her and her royal in-laws and her own family. The duchess responded: ""I think forgiveness is really important. It takes a lot more energy to not forgive. ""But it takes a lot of effort to forgive. I've really made an active effort, especially knowing that I can say anything."" In the 6,450-word interview, Meghan also: spoke of her fears that staying in the UK may have exposed her son, Archie, three, to excessive media attention criticised the lack of control she had over the release of family photographs when she was a senior royal said Archie is taught the importance of manners, with the phrase ""manners make the man"" often repeated told how the couple initially resisted viewing their $14.65m (Â£12.48m) California home as they did not think they could afford it divulged that she packed up their belongings at Frogmore Cottage, Windsor, while visiting for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee revealed she was considering a return to Instagram The Cut interview was part of a promotion effort for the duchess'sSpotify podcast, Archetypes,,externalwhich launched last week. The series promises to ""investigate, dissect and subvert the labels that try to hold women back"", with tennis legend Serena Williams discussing ambition on the first episode, while pop star Mariah Carey features in the second instalment, released on Tuesday. In Carey's episode the duchess says there was more focus on her race once she started dating her husband. ""Then I started to understand what it was like to be treated like a black woman, because up until then I had been treated like a mixed woman and things really shifted,"" she said. The Sussexes, who also have a one-year-old daughter, Lilibet, have signed deals with Spotify and Netflix since leaving the UK. Prince Harry told Davis he did not believe some members of the Royal Family could live and work together as closely as he and his wife do. The article described the Sussexes running their company Archewell while sitting at a single desk in a shared home office. ""Most people that I know and many of my family, they aren't able to work and live together,"" Prince Harry said. ""It's actually really weird because it'd seem like a lot of pressure. But it just feels natural and normal."" Both Harry and Meghan have had legal battles with parts of the British media and the duchess told Davis she would not have been able to pick Archie up from school in the UK ""without it being a royal photo call with a press pen of 40 people snapping pictures"". ""Sorry, I have a problem with that. That doesn't make me obsessed with privacy. That makes me a strong and good parent protecting my child,"" she said. Several royal correspondents have taken to social media to say this would not be the case. The 6,450-word interview appears in US magazine The Cut, part of New York magazine During the interview Davis talks about accompanying Meghan to collect Archie from pre-school, with the three-year-old wanting to roll down the car window as they pass a favourite bush, while munching on a quesadilla. There are other insights into the duke and duchess's lives in California in the course of the article, with the young family dancing around to Prince Harry's beatboxing - while Lilibet watches on from her nanny's arms - and Archie calling his parents ""Momma"" and ""Papa"".

"Pubs across the UK will be forced to close due to energy costs soaring by as much as 300%, brewery bosses have said. Leaders of six of the country's largest breweries have called for ""immediate government intervention"" on sky-high energy bills this winter. The landlord of one pub in Essex told the BBC that his energy costs had risen from about Â£13,000 a year to Â£35,000. Pub owners said the energy crisis would cause ""real and serious irreversible"" damage to the industry without support. In an open letter to the government, six pub and brewing groups - JW Lees, Carlsberg Marston's, Admiral Taverns, Drake & Morgan, Greene King and St Austell Brewery - called for urgent intervention, including a support package and a cap on the price of energy for businesses. Rocketing energy bills come at a time when the number of pubs in England and Wales is falling,hitting the lowest level on record - 39,970 in June, according to analysis. Energy bills could break firms, warns ex-chancellor Simon Cleary, who runs the Plough in Great Chesterford, Essex, said his gas and electricity bills had nearly tripled to Â£35,000 a year. It means the pub now needs to generate a further Â£1,800 in takings per week to cover the costs. ""It really is that bad,"" he told the BBC. ""I think it's going to be really tough unless there is intervention from the government."" Landlord Simon Cleary needs to take another Â£1,800 each week to afford the bill hikes Mr Cleary said heating the pub in the winter made up the majority of his gas bill, with about 20% used for cooking food. In a bid to try to reduce his electricity bill, the landlord has fitted LED bulbs. However, there is only so much energy he can save because fridges, freezers and the cooling system for the cellar need to be on all the time. ""You cannot turn your cellar cooling off, you need it on even in the winter."" He added: ""Many pubs are very older buildings, few pubs have got cavity wall insulation. This pub was built in 1780. Back in those days nobody was thinking about conserving energy."" Chris Jowsey, boss of Admiral Taverns which has 1,600 pubs, said his tenanted pubs now pay more in energy bills than they do in rent. He told the BBC that one of his tenants told him he was leaving after 20 years due to his electricity bill going up 450% - an increase so large he couldn't pass it on to pub customers. Mr Jowsey said Admiral was investing in energy-saving equipment for pub cellars and to control how much energy fridges use. He also said the company was ""looking very closely at a scheme to try and buy energy in bulk and to allow licensees to make use of our own scale"". But he said: ""Even when we went to the energy market in recent months, no-one was initially willing to supply even us, never mind an individual licensee and their pub. ""So we're trying to do everything we can,"" said Mr Jowsey. ""But frankly, this is of such a scale that even we can't support this on our own, we desperately need government intervention to help because actually the market is broken."" The Department for Business, Energy and Industry said ""no government"" would be able to control the ""global factors pushing up the price of energy and other business costs"". ""But we will continue to support the hospitality sector in navigating the months ahead,"" a spokesman added. The government said it was providing a ""50% business rates relief for businesses across the UK, freezing alcohol duty rates on beer, cider, wine and spirits and reducing employer national insurance"". Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, warned the rise in energy bills would cause more damage to the industry than the pandemic did if it didn't receive support in the next few weeks. The government has previously said no new policies will be announced until the new prime minister is announced on 5 September. But Mr Jowsey said: ""I find it incredible that we have to wait for one person to get elected before we actually get some decisions and some policy which will protect not just jobs, not just people's livelihoods, but also their homes - because remember most people that run pubs in this country actually live above the shop."" Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's shadow business secretary, said businesses couldn't ""afford another day of this zombie government"", saying his party would bring down costs for small firms by cutting business rates. Nick Mackenzie, the boss of Greene King - one of the UK's largest pub groups with over 3,100 pubs - said the company could face ""the prospect of pubs being unable to pay their bills, jobs being lost and beloved locals across the country forced to close their doors"". He added that would mean all the support given to pubs through the pandemic to stay in businesses ""could be wasted"". Meanwhile, William Lees Jones, of JW Lees, said the government needed to extend the energy cap to business as well as households. He said with more fixed-price contracts coming up for renewal the ""time to act is now"". On Friday, the energy regulator Ofgem, which sets the price cap on household bills, said it would rise by 80% in October. But unlike households, businesses aren't covered by a regulated energy price cap, meaning bills are even higher. Aside from bills, breweries also highlighted a possible shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2) which is used in the production of beer. CF Industries, the UK's largest CO2 producer, recently announced that it would temporarily stop production at one of its plants because rising energy prices made it too expensive to continue.

"A 750g tub of Lurpak was on sale in this Sainsbury's store for Â£7.25 in July The maker of butter brand Lurpak has said it expects dairy prices to remain high due to a decline in global milk production and soaring costs. Arla reported a 17% rise in revenues during the first six months of the year driven by significant price increases. Shoppers recently expressed shock that the price of a 750gtub of Lurpak surpassed Â£7 in some supermarkets. Arla, the UK's largest supplier of fresh milk and cream, said the Ukraine war had pushed up farmers' costs. Russia and Ukraine are among the world's biggest exporters of fertiliser and animal feed but the Kremlin's invasion has disrupted supplies, leading to increased prices. Fuel prices were already rising as demand for energy increased after Covid restrictions were eased. But the war has pushed them up further because of sanctions and severe disruptions to shipments. Soaring food prices drove the UK's inflation rate - the pace at which prices rise - toa four decade-high of 10.1% in Julylargely due to the cost of staples such as milk, cheese, eggs and bread. Cost of living: Why are prices rising so quickly? Arla, which is the fifth-biggest dairy company in the world, said it had increased the pre-paid milk price to its farmers due to the significant cost increases they faced. However, it said ""this has yet to secure an increase in milk production due to the continued and significant increase in on-farm costs and uncertainty created by the current global market conditions"". It said the price of fertiliser had increased by an average of 145%, fuel by 134%, feed by 36% and energy by 346%, compared to last year. The company said it expected the second half of the year to be ""even more challenging"" due to ""on-going inflationary pressure and political unrest"". During the first half of its financial year, revenues rose to â¬6.3bn (Â£5.3bn) which Arla said was ""almost exclusively driven by increased prices"" as the volume of products the company sold dipped slightly in some markets. Pre-tax profit grew by 9% to â¬230m. Arla said that global milk production was expected to decline further and ""contribute to sustained high dairy prices"", which was likely to further reduce consumption. After a strong performance during the pandemic fuelled by increased at-home consumption, the company said growth for its branded products like Lurpak was flat. It said consumers were already buying less and ""trading down"" to cheaper products, most notably in the butter and spreadable category. Earlier this year, Lurpak trended on Twitter as customers complained of soaring prices.  A 750g tub of the spreadable butter currently costs Â£6.75 from Tesco's online delivery and Â£6 from Asda. In July some shoppers shared photos of the product covered in security tags, which Asda said was a decision for individual stores, who may have noticed a certain product going missing.

"Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is under Russian occupation The EU is giving more than five million anti-radiation tablets to Ukraine, as fears grow of an accident at Europe's largest nuclear power plant. The Zaporizhzhia plant is under Russian occupation and has recently come under fire, with both sides blaming each other for the attacks. In some areas, officials are already handing out the pills, which can stop the body absorbing radioactive iodine. Residents have been told only to take it if a radiation leak is confirmed. So far, only people living within 50km (30 miles) of the power plant are being offered the potassium iodide tablets, but the European Union is providing Ukraine with more than five million doses which would allow for much wider distribution. How risky is the stand-off over Ukraine's nuclear plant? Preparing for the worst at Ukraine nuclear plant Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine was occupied by Russia soon after it invaded Ukraine in February. Ukrainian staff who continue to operate the plant have told the BBC that Russian troops have used it as a military base and thatworkers are in effect held at gunpoint. While recent fighting in the area has caused some damage to the plant, so far there has not been any recorded increase in radiation levels in the area. Nevertheless, officials are concerned further damage could cause a radiation leak, which could spread over a large area. The UN's nuclear agency has been demanding access to the facility for several months, and a team has arrived in Ukrainein the hope of finally being allowed to inspect the sitein the coming days. The EU said on Tuesday,externalit was providing the tablets as a ""preventative safety measure"" to increase protection in the area around the nuclear plant. Five million pills will come from its emergency reserves and another 500,000 from Austria. Potassium iodide tablets were already being handed out to residents in one part of Zaporizhzhia city on Monday, and 25,000 tablets have been sent to Enerhodar - the city closest to the nuclear plant. ""In the event of an emergency, both adults and children will already be provided with iodide and will be able to protect themselves in time,"" said Anatoliy Kurtyev from Zaporizhzhia city council. He stressed that residents should only take the drug if an accident happens - not as a precautionary measure. Potassium iodide is taken to prevent radioactive iodine - the main cancer-causing isotope also known as iodine-131 - from being absorbed by the thyroid gland. High levels of radioactive iodine can increase the risk of thyroid cancer in infants, children and young people, even years after exposure. If taken at the right time at the right dose, potassium iodide will be absorbed by the thyroid gland instead of the more dangerous iodine-131, reducing the associated health risks. The European Commission says it is to distribute 5.5 million potassium iodide tablets for residents living in vicinity of Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Many countries, including the UK, have a stockpile of these tablets in case of a major nuclear accident or leak. They should only be used if recommended by medical experts, though, for good reason. There are health risks associated with taking them, so they are not something people should try and buy or acquire themselves to take. They are a useful countermeasure because radioactive iodine that is breathed in or consumed in food and drink can be stored in the thyroid gland for some time. The tablets only help protect the thyroid, not other parts of the body. ANALYSIS:The war is static, but ousting Russia is a seismic task ON THE GROUND:What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?

"The Environment Agency has now moved 11 of the 14 areas it covers in England into drought status A drought has been declared across South West England. Bristol, Somerset, south Gloucestershire, Dorset and parts of Wiltshire have been moved to drought status following some of the driest conditions in nearly 90 years. The Environment Agency (EA) decision followsdrought announcements in 10 other areas of the country. People have been urged to ""use water wisely"" due to the impact of the dry summer on the environment. This video can not be played South West England drought The EA confirmed the drought status of the South West based on data including rainfall, river flows, groundwater levels, reservoir levels, and the dryness of soils. Its water situation national report for July found it was the driest July across England since 1935. Rivers, groundwater levels and reservoir stocks had all decreased after five consecutive months of below average rainfall and above average temperatures, added the EA. The EA's latest water situation report shows some river levels are the lowest ever recorded Chris Paul, the EA's area drought lead, said despite there having been some heavy rain over the past two weeks, it had not been enough to compensate for the dry summer. ""River levels across our Wessex area are exceptionally low - many showing the lowest flows on record,"" he said. ""This places incredible strain on local wildlife and this is why we are moving to drought status. ""We are prioritising our local operations to minimise impacts on the environment,"" added Mr Paul. The EA said it will be monitoring the effects of the dry weather on rivers and responding to environmental emergencies, such as rescuing stranded fish. ""We will also be ensuring people and companies who have water abstraction licences only operate within the terms of their licence and taking legal action against those who fail to comply or against anyone who abstracts water without a licence,"" added Mr Paul.

"More than 40,000 CWU members are striking today and on Wednesday Thousands of BT and Openreach staff staged fresh strike action on Tuesday as part of an ongoing pay dispute with the telecoms giant. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said more than 40,000 of its members are striking today and on Wednesday. It coincides withfurther strikes at Royal Mail, where 115,000 CWU members are set to walk out on 31 August. Separately, major unions are seeking to co-ordinate strike action this autumn as theystep up demands for better pay. Unite and Unison have have submitted motions ahead of the Trade Union Congress next month which call for future walkouts to be synchronised. It follows a wave of strike action across the UK which has spanned a range of sectors including rail workers, barristers and rubbish collectors. The CWU said its members are striking against a Â£1,500 pay rise offered by BT Group. ""The reason for the strike is simple: workers will not accept a massive deterioration in their living standards,"" said CWU general secretary Dave Ward. BT Group said the offer represented an increase of around 5% on average which rose to 8% for the lowest paid and was the highest pay rise in more than 20 years. But Mr Ward said: ""In the context of Retail Price Index inflation levels already hitting 11.7% this year, this is a dramatic real-terms pay cut."" ""These are the same workers who kept the country connected during the pandemic,"" he said. ""Without CWU members, there would have been no home-working revolution, and vital technical infrastructure may have malfunctioned or been broken when our country most needed it."" A spokesperson for BT said: ""We know that our colleagues are dealing with the impacts of high inflation and, although we're disappointed, we respect their decision to strike. ""We have made the best pay award we could and we are in constant discussions with the CWU to find a way forward from here."" It is the second time that BT workers havegone out on strike this year. Postal workers at Royal Mail will also be going out on strike again, resuming on Wednesday - while two more days of industrial action will be held on 8-9 September. A Royal Mail spokesperson said: ""The CWU's self-centred actions with the wider trade union movement is putting jobs at risk, and making pay rises less affordable... making Royal Mail's future more uncertain than at any time in its long history."" ""The CWU is deflecting to avoid talking about the changes we need to make as a business,"" the spokesperson added. The BBC has contacted the CWU for a response.

"Galapagos giant tortoises are protected but more than a dozen have been hunted in recent years Ecuador has launched an investigation into the killing of four Galapagos giant tortoises, which prosecutors fear were hunted and eaten. Remains of the reptiles were found in a national park on Isabela, the largest island of the Galapagos archipelago. Killing the endangered animals has been banned since 1933 but more than a dozen have been hunted in the last two years. Tortoise meat was once considered a delicacy, but those who hunt them now face up to three years in jail. In September 2021, park rangers found the remains of 15 Sierra Negra giant tortoises on Isabela. Photos of their empty shells were widely shared on social media and caused outrage in Ecuador - of which the Galapagos Islands are part of - and beyond. Evidence gathered at the time suggested the 15 had been hunted for their meat. The recent discovery of remains of four more animals has reignited fears that the practice continues despite the total hunting ban. Experts will carry out post-mortems on the remains and a unit specialising in environmental crimes is collecting testimonies from national park agents. Galapagos giant tortoises have a lifespan of more than 100 years and were made famous by Charles Darwin, who pioneered the theory of evolution studying them. The ship Darwin sailed on, The Beagle, took 30 live tortoises on its long voyage from the Galapagos to Polynesia. Most of them were eaten by the crew. There are currently about 15,000 of the giant tortoises in the world, compared to 200,000 in the 19th Century.

"This video can not be played Bin workers in Edinburgh begin a massive clear up after 12 days of strike action A major clear-up is under way in Edinburgh after a first wave of strikes by council bin workers came to an end. Unions launched industrial action on 18 August in the middle of the Edinburgh Festival, in a pay dispute with local government body Cosla. The walkout in the capital ended at 04:59 as rubbish continues to pile up in other Scottish council areas. On Monday Unite, the GMB and Unison confirmed further strikes would be heldafter rejecting an increased pay offer. City of Edinburgh Council said additional resources would be deployed to support the clean up. When are the next bin strikes planned? The people hiring skips and using baths to store rubbish Read more stories from Edinburgh, Fife and East Scotland,external However, it said many residents would not have their full backlog of waste collected before the next round of action on 6 September. People are being asked to store their waste ""a little longer"" while waste and recycling staff catch up. The 140,000 households that have kerbside pickups in the city have landfill waste and dry recycling waste collected on alternate weeks. The council said only one type of rubbish would be picked up per household. Workers scooped the mountains of litter by hand on Tuesday morning By Angie Brown, BBC Scotland Edinburgh reporter I saw the first signs of the great clean-up of Edinburgh when I reached the West Port from the south of the city this morning. A young refuse collector was filling a large black street bin with bags full of rubbish for the fourth time that hour. He said it was a ""nightmare"" task as the bin lorry, which mechanically empties the large street bins, only had a certain capacity. He said he was filling the bin with all the bags piled beside it before waiting until the lorry had emptied it before starting again. The driver told me his young colleague would be ""exhausted within an hour at this rate"". After lorries lifted bin loads of rubbish the remnants were tackled by street sweepers The driver also said a one-hour job was taking four hours because they normally only had to empty each bin once. He said it was the worst he had ever seen, and that they would not have the city centre cleaned up by the end of their 12-hour shift. Cleansing workers then cleared the loose rubbish left on the street with road sweepers and manually with brushes. One road sweeper said they would try their best to get as much of it cleaned as possible but that it was a ""mammoth task"". Cleansing staff later in the day in the West Port said it was ""disgusting"" work. They also said the strike had been hard and they had all lost money but that ""you have to lose a bit of money to make a bit of money"". Edinburgh wakes up to the bin strike hangover The leader of City of Edinburgh Council, Cammy Day, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme he expected to see residual waste collected by Sunday and the city returning to its pre-strike state next week. However, he said there was a chance this could be disrupted if impending strikes next week were not resolved. He said: ""We have another Cosla leaders' meeting this Friday. I think there's probably only one thing hanging which is the consolidation of pay into the lowest paid. ""I think if Cosla and the government could secure that, we would have an offer at least to go back to the trade unions' membership."" Public Health Scotland has warned of a human health risk from overflowing waste and advised councils to decontaminate areas where bins have overflowed. Edinburgh Councillor Scott Arthur said: ""I think it's really important that we get things back to normal so we can be proud of our city and proud of our council staff. ""I feel ashamed at some of the sights we've seen in the city centre. ""I say that as someone who absolutely supports the staff because I think they deserve a fair pay rise."" Unions had been seeking an agreement from Cosla similar to the one made to council workers in England - which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay increase. The pay dispute led to action by refuse staff at two-thirds of Scotland's councils and is also set to close schools and nurseries. Edinburgh began the first of a series of strikes around the country after the GMB, Unite and Unison rejected an initial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. The action escalated last week when refuse workers at a further 20 local authorities walked out despite the revised 5% offer. Workers in 13 areas, including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, are still on strike until Wednesday. Asecond wave of strikesis due to begin on 6 September, with hundreds of schools and nurseries also scheduled to close from 6 to 8 September. The action affecting Angus, Dundee and Perth and Kinross will take place from 7 to 9 September. On Monday, Unite and the GMB rejected a further offer from Cosla, while Unison said it would put it to its members.

The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay increase for staff. Deputy First Minister John Swinney also said a further Â£200m would be offered over two years to provide a cost-of-living payment to workers earning below Â£39,000.

"Chris Dawson outside the New South Wales Supreme Court An Australian man who became the subject of a popular crime podcast has been found guilty of his wife's murder - 40 years after she went missing. Chris Dawson's trial followed decades of speculation about the 1982 disappearance of his wife, Lynette. A judge ruled Dawson killed his wife so he could continue his relationship with his teenage lover and babysitter, known only as JC for legal reasons. Mrs Dawson's body is still missing and all the evidence was circumstantial. Dawson was charged in 2018 after the podcast, The Teacher's Pet, garnered global attention and prompted a renewed investigation. A sentencing date is yet to be set and Dawson's lawyer has indicated he is likely to appeal against the conviction. The 74-year-old denies killing Mrs Dawson, maintaining she had abandoned him and their two children - possibly to join a religious group. But while handing down his verdict on Tuesday, Justice Ian Harrison said the evidence against Dawson was ""persuasive and compelling"". The judge found Dawson was obsessed with JC, who was also a student at the school where he taught, and wanted her as a ""replacement"" for his wife. Justice Harrison said Dawson had become increasingly desperate as previous plans to leave his marriage failed and JC had wanted to end their relationship. ""I'm satisfied that the prospect that he would lose [JC] so distressed, frustrated, and ultimately overwhelmed him that... Mr Dawson resolved to kill his wife,"" he told the New South Wales Supreme Court. JC and Dawson eventually married and had a child, but divorced several years later. At the trial, she said Dawson had ""groomed"" her and treated her like a ""slave"" after Mrs Dawson disappeared. Lynette Dawson's body has never been found Mrs Dawson's brother welcomed the verdict, but said ""the journey is not yet complete"" and called for her body to be returned. Greg Simms appealed for Dawson to ""finally do the decent thing"" and ""allow us to bring Lynette home to a peaceful rest, finally showing her some dignity she deserves"". Phil Mercer, BBC News at NSW Supreme Court Ashen and dazed. Chris Dawson appeared to be in shock as he stepped into a lift on the 13th floor of the court with his older brother, Peter, and his lawyer during a break in the judge's deliberations. I stood an arm's length away from a man who a couple of hours later would become a convicted killer. After 40 years, the mystery and tragedy of Lynette Dawson's disappearance have finally been solved. The judge demolished her husband's defence, labelling key parts ""absurd"" and ""fanciful"". There were gasps from his family members when the guilty verdict was eventually handed down. There were tears from Lynette Dawson's relatives who sat quietly nearby. The former teacher was led away in handcuffs, shaking his head. Justice Harrison's lengthy verdict has finally exposed his lies and deceit. The case shot to global prominence when it was investigated by journalist Hedley Thomas in podcast The Teacher's Pet. The series won Australian journalism's highest honour and has been downloaded more than 60 million times, topping charts around the world. The podcast and its impact were key issues in the trial, with Justice Harrison criticising its ""less than balanced view"" on the case and ruling it had affected the evidence of some witnesses. The case was initially delayed due to publicity the podcast created, and Dawson's lawyers tried to halt it altogether, arguing the series had contaminated his shot at a fair trial. Dawson was instead granted a trial before a single judge, rather than jury. Lynette Dawson, a 33-year-old mother of two, disappeared from her Sydney home in January 1982. Police have never found any trace of her. Two separate inquests into her disappearance concluded that she was killed by a ""known person"". But until the podcast explored the case, prosecutors had said there was not enough evidence to lay charges. Lynette Dawson's brother Greg Simms and his wife Merilyn fought for a renewed investigation Dawson has maintained his wife phoned him one weekend in January 1982 and said she needed time away. He said he also received several calls from her afterwards. His defence team pointed to alleged sightings by five people after Mrs Dawson was reported missing as evidence she could have been alive after January 1982. But prosecutors argued Dawson was driven to murder after his failed plots to leave the marriage - which they said included contemplating hiring a hitman, and a thwarted move to Queensland to start a new life with JC. Justice Harrison rejected the claim about the hitman, but said he was satisfied that Chris Dawson had intentionally caused Lynette Dawson's death. The judge said Mrs Dawson appeared to ""adore"" her husband, had made several plans for the future and did not have the financial means to support herself for long, all of which made it ""extremely unlikely"" that she would decide to leave. None of Mrs Dawson's friends and family have heard from her since she disappeared. Considering the circumstantial evidence as a whole, Justice Harrison said he was ""left with no doubt"" that Dawson had indeed killed his wife and disposed of her body.

"The UK Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has arrived in the United States for talks on how to tackle the spiralling cost of living. During what could be his final week in the job, Mr Zahawi is meeting US banks and officials to seek ""international solutions"" to soaring costs. Labour has criticised the trip, saying he should be focusing on the UK. The two candidates for prime minister have signalled they will offer more help if elected on 5 September. The government has been accused of not doing enough to help people cope with the crisis, amid warnings that people are facing a dire winter with rocketing energy bills. Many people are having to make tough choicessuch as skipping meals,while others are dreading the colder months. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, one of whom will be announced as the next prime minister,have pledged further support, though neither has given details. James Murray, Labour's shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, accused Mr Zahawi of being part of a ""do-nothing Tory government"" - adding that the chancellor was ""jetting off to an international chinwag"". ""Rather than going on another junket at the taxpayers' expense, the chancellor should start listening to people here at home and implementing Labour's fully funded plan to freeze energy bills,"" he said. Trade union leader Frances O'Grady expressed surprised that Mr Zahawi had travelled to the US. She told the Today programme that trade unions had asked to meet him, adding: ""I would've thought it was a priority to meet representatives of working people... who are just  looking to keep their wages at least up with inflation."" Mr Zahawi hasinsisted he has been working tirelessly to come up with proposalsfor either leadership candidate to bring in more cost-of-living support. The chancellor - who could be replaced when the new Tory leader comes to power - is meeting banking chiefs in New York to discuss co-operating on financial services, before heading to Washington DC to discuss support for Ukraine, the global economic outlook and energy security at the US central bank. In a video released on Twitter,,externalMr Zahawi said he would be talking about ""Putin's use of energy as a tool, a weapon to get back at us for the help we are putting in Ukraine and how we can coordinate further to deal with the challenge of remaining resilient in the face of that particular challenge"". How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Ofgem: Check if the energy price cap affects you,external What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? Ms Truss's campaign team says she will not finalise her plans for crucial cost-of-living support before receiving the ""full support and advice"" only available to the government of the day. A campaign source told PA: ""Liz and her team are working to ensure that they are able to hit the ground running if she is elected prime minister."" The foreign secretary's team said she is leaning towards targeted support over help for all, but maintained she is not ""ruling anything out"", while it was also reported she is considering slashing VAT by 5% across the board. Asource close to her also told the BBC this weekthat she would prioritise tax cuts over giving direct payments to every household. Mr Sunak has said the government ""must provide some direct support"" to all. Ms Truss - who polls suggest is the favourite in the leadership race - has so far promised to help households by reversing April's National Insurance rise and temporarily cutting energy levies on fuel bills. Mr Sunak has proposed spending billions of pounds on further payments to pensioners and the low-paid over winter, arguing tax cuts would not help them enough - but has not set out details. He also wants to cut VAT on fuel bills. Tory leadership candidates Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are under pressure to detail how they would help households this winter Experts and charities have warned lives will be at risk this winter after the energy regulator hiked the price cap on household bills by 80%. A typical household gas and electricity billwill rise to Â£3,549 a year from October, Ofgem announced on Friday. The increase in consumers' bills follows sharp rises in wholesale gas largely due to the conflict in Ukraine, which has reduced supplies of Russian gas. The government has already said all households will get a Â£400 rebate on energy bills. It means about Â£60 will be knocked off energy bills every month for six months. Low income and vulnerable households will receive an additional Â£650. However, energy prices have soared since that package of measures was revealed, and from October a typical household will see monthly energy bills of nearly Â£300 a month. Meanwhile Boris Johnson, in his last week in office, will be in Dorset on Tuesday to see preparations for a government-funded scheme to give 7,000 rural homes superfast broadband. It comes as work kicks off on the first major contract under the government's Â£5bn Project Gigabit - the biggest broadband rollout in British history.

"This video can not be played Bin workers in Edinburgh begin a massive clear up after 12 days of strike action A major clear-up is under way in Edinburgh after a first wave of strikes by council bin workers came to an end. Unions launched industrial action on 18 August in the middle of the Edinburgh Festival, in a pay dispute with local government body Cosla. The walkout in the capital ended at 04:59 as rubbish continues to pile up in other Scottish council areas. On Monday Unite, the GMB and Unison confirmed further strikes would be heldafter rejecting an increased pay offer. City of Edinburgh Council said additional resources would be deployed to support the clean up. When are the next bin strikes planned? The people hiring skips and using baths to store rubbish Read more stories from Edinburgh, Fife and East Scotland,external However, it said many residents would not have their full backlog of waste collected before the next round of action on 6 September. People are being asked to store their waste ""a little longer"" while waste and recycling staff catch up. The 140,000 households that have kerbside pickups in the city have landfill waste and dry recycling waste collected on alternate weeks. The council said only one type of rubbish would be picked up per household. Workers scooped the mountains of litter by hand on Tuesday morning By Angie Brown, BBC Scotland Edinburgh reporter I saw the first signs of the great clean-up of Edinburgh when I reached the West Port from the south of the city this morning. A young refuse collector was filling a large black street bin with bags full of rubbish for the fourth time that hour. He said it was a ""nightmare"" task as the bin lorry, which mechanically empties the large street bins, only had a certain capacity. He said he was filling the bin with all the bags piled beside it before waiting until the lorry had emptied it before starting again. The driver told me his young colleague would be ""exhausted within an hour at this rate"". After lorries lifted bin loads of rubbish the remnants were tackled by street sweepers The driver also said a one-hour job was taking four hours because they normally only had to empty each bin once. He said it was the worst he had ever seen, and that they would not have the city centre cleaned up by the end of their 12-hour shift. Cleansing workers then cleared the loose rubbish left on the street with road sweepers and manually with brushes. One road sweeper said they would try their best to get as much of it cleaned as possible but that it was a ""mammoth task"". Cleansing staff later in the day in the West Port said it was ""disgusting"" work. They also said the strike had been hard and they had all lost money but that ""you have to lose a bit of money to make a bit of money"". Edinburgh wakes up to the bin strike hangover The leader of City of Edinburgh Council, Cammy Day, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme he expected to see residual waste collected by Sunday and the city returning to its pre-strike state next week. However, he said there was a chance this could be disrupted if impending strikes next week were not resolved. He said: ""We have another Cosla leaders' meeting this Friday. I think there's probably only one thing hanging which is the consolidation of pay into the lowest paid. ""I think if Cosla and the government could secure that, we would have an offer at least to go back to the trade unions' membership."" Public Health Scotland has warned of a human health risk from overflowing waste and advised councils to decontaminate areas where bins have overflowed. Edinburgh Councillor Scott Arthur said: ""I think it's really important that we get things back to normal so we can be proud of our city and proud of our council staff. ""I feel ashamed at some of the sights we've seen in the city centre. ""I say that as someone who absolutely supports the staff because I think they deserve a fair pay rise."" Unions had been seeking an agreement from Cosla similar to the one made to council workers in England - which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay increase. The pay dispute led to action by refuse staff at two-thirds of Scotland's councils and is also set to close schools and nurseries. Edinburgh began the first of a series of strikes around the country after the GMB, Unite and Unison rejected an initial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. The action escalated last week when refuse workers at a further 20 local authorities walked out despite the revised 5% offer. Workers in 13 areas, including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, are still on strike until Wednesday. Asecond wave of strikesis due to begin on 6 September, with hundreds of schools and nurseries also scheduled to close from 6 to 8 September. The action affecting Angus, Dundee and Perth and Kinross will take place from 7 to 9 September.

"This video can not be played Watch: A 'monsoon on steroids' -  UN chief in Pakistan floods Pakistan is facing ""a monsoon on steroids"", the UN's secretary general has warned, after floods submerged much of the country. Antonio Guterres urged the world to come to Pakistan's aid as he launched a $160m appeal to help the tens of millions affected in the disaster. He blamed ""the relentless impact of epochal levels of rain and flooding"". At least 1,136 people have been killed since June and roads, crops, homes and bridges washed away across the country. This year's record monsoon is comparable to the devastating floods of 2010 - the deadliest in Pakistan's history - which left more than 2,000 people dead. Makeshift relief camps have sprung up all over Pakistan to cope with the many displaced In a video message, Mr Guterres called South Asia a ""climate crisis hotspot"" where people were 15 times more likely to die from climate impacts. ""Let's stop sleepwalking towards the destruction of our planet by climate change. Today, it's Pakistan. Tomorrow, it could be your country."" EXPLAINED: How do we know climate change is happening? Extreme weather: What is it and how is it connected to climate change? He said the UN appeal aimed to provide 5.2 million people with food, water, sanitation, emergency education and health support. Officials estimate that more than 33 million Pakistanis - one in seven people - have been affected by the flooding. Sadia, a student in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, said she felt helpless as her family were cut off in their home village of Jhal Magsi, about eight hours away. ""You can't find a single home that is safe now,"" she told the BBC's Outside Source programme.  ""They are under the sky with no help. ""Right now, we are in need of first aid relief like tents, some shelter and some basic food, they can't cook anything. And they need clean water to drink."" Clearing up in Sindh - countless properties have been damaged or destroyed On Monday, Pakistan's climate change minister Sherry Rehman described the situation as a ""climate-induced humanitarian disaster of epic proportions"". Pakistan produces less than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions,externalbut ranks consistently in the top 10 countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Pakistan's planning minister saysestimates suggest the floods have caused at least $10bn (Â£8.5bn) of damage, and many people face serious food shortages. The country was already suffering from an economic crisis. Vaste swathes of rich agricultural land have been devastated in this year's monsoon, damaging food supplies and sending prices soaring.

The flood situation is most severe in provinces such as Sindh and Balochistan, but mountainous regions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have also been badly hit. Thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate villages cut off in northern Swat Valley, where bridges and roads have been swept away - but even with the help of helicopters, authorities are still struggling to reach those trapped. ""Village after village has been wiped out. Millions of houses have been destroyed,"" Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Sunday after flying over the area in a helicopter.

"Pakistan's planning minister says early estimates show the devastating floods that hit the country have caused at least $10bn (Â£8.5bn) of damage. His comment comes as another government minister said that one-third of the South Asian nation has been submerged. Separately on Monday, Pakistan received a $1.1bn bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). That money is aimed to help the cash-strapped economy avoid defaulting on its debts. The flash floods, caused by record monsoon rains, have killed at least 1,136 people and affected more than 33 million, over 15% of the country's population. The torrential rains have also washed away roads, crops, homes, bridges and other infrastructure. One-third of Pakistan is under water - minister Pakistan flood victims throw note pleading for help Sri Lanka crisis is a warning to other Asian nations ""I think it is going to be huge. So far, [a] very early, preliminary estimate is that it is big, it is higher than $10 billion,"" Pakistan's planning minister Ahsan Iqbal told the Reuters news agency. Mr Iqbal said the country would face serious food shortages in the coming weeks and months and believed that the floods were worse than those that hit Pakistan in 2010, the deadliest in the country's history which left more than 2,000 people dead. He also called on richer countries to help Pakistan financially as he said it was a victim of climate change, which had been caused by the ""irresponsible development of the developed world"". To address food shortages, finance minister Miftah Ismail said Pakistan could consider importing vegetables from arch-rival India. On Monday, the country's climate change minister Sherry Rehman described the situation as a ""climate-induced humanitarian disaster of epic proportions."" ""Literally, one-third of Pakistan is underwater right now, which has exceeded every boundary, every norm we've seen in the past,"" Ms Rehman told the AFP news agency. Even before the floods Pakistan was suffering from an economic crisis and had been negotiating with the IMF over a bailout. Official figures released in recent weeks showed that the country had only enough foreign currencies in reserve for about a month of imports as its economy struggles with an annual inflation rate of almost 25%. In a statement on the $1.1bn bailout,external, IMF deputy managing director Antoinette Sayeh said: ""Pakistan's economy has been buffeted by adverse external conditions, due to spillovers from the war in Ukraine, and domestic challenges, including from accommodative policies that resulted in uneven and unbalanced growth."" The floods were not mentioned in the statement. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

"Pubs across the UK will be forced to close due to energy costs soaring by as much as 300%, brewery bosses have said. Leaders of six of the country's largest breweries have called for ""immediate government intervention"" on sky-high energy bills this winter. The landlord of one pub in Essex told the BBC that his energy costs had risen from about Â£13,000 a year to Â£35,000. Pub owners said the energy crisis would cause ""real and serious irreversible"" damage to the industry without support. In an open letter to the government, six pub and brewing groups - JW Lees, Carlsberg Marston's, Admiral Taverns, Drake & Morgan, Greene King and St Austell Brewery - called for urgent intervention, including a support package and a cap on the price of energy for businesses. Rocketing energy bills come at a time when the number of pubs in England and Wales is falling,hitting the lowest level on record - 39,970 in June, according to analysis. Energy bills could break firms, warns ex-chancellor Simon Cleary, who runs the Plough in Great Chesterford, Essex, said his gas and electricity bills had nearly tripled to Â£35,000 a year. It means the pub now needs to generate a further Â£1,800 in takings per week to cover the costs. ""It really is that bad,"" he told the BBC. ""I think it's going to be really tough unless there is intervention from the government."" Landlord Simon Cleary needs to take another Â£1,800 each week to afford the bill hikes Mr Cleary said heating the pub in the winter made up the majority of his gas bill, with about 20% used for cooking food. In a bid to try to reduce his electricity bill, the landlord has fitted LED bulbs. However, there is only so much energy he can save because fridges, freezers and the cooling system for the cellar need to be on all the time. ""You cannot turn your cellar cooling off, you need it on even in the winter."" He added: ""Many pubs are very older buildings, few pubs have got cavity wall insulation. This pub was built in 1780. Back in those days nobody was thinking about conserving energy."" Chris Jowsey, boss of Admiral Taverns which has 1,600 pubs, said his tenanted pubs now pay more in energy bills than they do in rent. He told the BBC that one of his tenants told him he was leaving after 20 years due to his electricity bill going up 450% - an increase so large he couldn't pass it on to pub customers. Mr Jowsey said Admiral was investing in energy-saving equipment for pub cellars and to control how much energy fridges use. He also said the company was ""looking very closely at a scheme to try and buy energy in bulk and to allow licensees to make use of our own scale"". But he said: ""Even when we went to the energy market in recent months, no-one was initially willing to supply even us, never mind an individual licensee and their pub. ""So we're trying to do everything we can,"" said Mr Jowsey. ""But frankly, this is of such a scale that even we can't support this on our own, we desperately need government intervention to help because actually the market is broken."" The Department for Business, Energy and Industry said ""no government"" would be able to control the ""global factors pushing up the price of energy and other business costs"". ""But we will continue to support the hospitality sector in navigating the months ahead,"" a spokesman added. The government said it was providing a ""50% business rates relief for businesses across the UK, freezing alcohol duty rates on beer, cider, wine and spirits and reducing employer national insurance"". Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, warned the rise in energy bills would cause more damage to the industry than the pandemic did if it didn't receive support in the next few weeks. The government has previously said no new policies will be announced until the new prime minister is announced on 5 September. But Mr Jowsey said: ""I find it incredible that we have to wait for one person to get elected before we actually get some decisions and some policy which will protect not just jobs, not just people's livelihoods, but also their homes - because remember most people that run pubs in this country actually live above the shop."" Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's shadow business secretary, said businesses couldn't ""afford another day of this zombie government"", saying his party would bring down costs for small firms by cutting business rates. Nick Mackenzie, the boss of Greene King - one of the UK's largest pub groups with over 3,100 pubs - said the company could face ""the prospect of pubs being unable to pay their bills, jobs being lost and beloved locals across the country forced to close their doors"". He added that would mean all the support given to pubs through the pandemic to stay in businesses ""could be wasted"". Meanwhile, William Lees Jones, of JW Lees, said the government needed to extend the energy cap to business as well as households. He said with more fixed-price contracts coming up for renewal the ""time to act is now"". On Friday, the energy regulator Ofgem, which sets the price cap on household bills, said it would rise by 80% in October. But unlike households, businesses aren't covered by a regulated energy price cap, meaning bills are even higher. Aside from bills, breweries also highlighted a possible shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2) which is used in the production of beer. CF Industries, the UK's largest CO2 producer, recently announced that it would temporarily stop production at one of its plants because rising energy prices made it too expensive to continue.

"The Duchess of Sussex says she upset the ""dynamic of the hierarchy"" of the Royal Family ""just by existing"". Inan interview with US magazine The Cut,external, Meghan, 41, talks about her life when she was a royal and why she and the Duke of Sussex moved to the US. Talking about her exit from the Royal Family the duchess said it ""takes a lot of effort to forgive"". She also spoke about Prince Harry's relationship with his father, the Prince of Wales. Asked by journalist Alison P Davis about the impact ofher privacy caseagainst the Mail on Sunday, Meghan said: ""Harry said to me, 'I lost my dad in this process.' ""It doesn't have to be the same for them as it was for me, but that's his decision."" A spokeswoman for the duchess later told BBC News that Meghan was referring to her own father, from whom she is estranged, and was saying she hoped the same would not happen to her husband. A source close to Prince Charles told the PA news agency he would be saddened if Prince Harry felt their relationship was lost, adding: ""The Prince of Wales loves both his sons"". The 37-year-old prince has previously said his father""stopped taking my calls""after thecouple stepped back as senior working royals in 2020. Under the arrangement, the couple gave up their Royal Highness titles, and became able to work to become financially independent. Harry retained the title of prince through birth. Who's in the UK Royal Family and how does it work? Why is Archie not a prince? Prior to this, the Sussexes reportedly set out a vision for continuing to be working royals in the Commonwealth and to earn their own money, in the hope this would reduce ""the noise"" about them. Meghan told The Cut: ""That, for whatever reason, is not something that we were allowed to do, even though several other members of the family do that exact thing."" After announcing they would step back from royal duties, Prince Harry and Meghan initially moved to Canada in January 2020. But,after Canada said it would stop providing security for the family, the family moved to California, where they lived in a home provided by media mogul Tyler Perry before buying their own property in Montecito. Meghan is media dynamite, so a fairly gentle interview, with some open-to-interpretation comments, has blasted its way on to the front pages. For her fans, it was another slice of the unfair, crabby-minded pressures of royal life that forced Meghan and Harry to move to California. For her critics, it was more deluded self-promotion, seizing on quotes such as Meghan being told that her marriage to Harry was greeted in South Africa with rejoicing the same as ""when Mandela was freed from prison"". The article describes them living in the ""home equivalent of billionaires dressing down in denim"" and their complaints might grate with families worried sick about paying energy bills. But the interview raised some of the contradictions facing Harry and Meghan. They wanted to get away from the suffocation of royal life, but their royal links are their most bankable assets. It's like old rockers not wanting to talk about their early records, when that's the only reason people are interested. They also wanted to escape media intrusion and they have in effect become part of the media, with deals with Spotify and Netflix. And Harry voiced the perennial royal dilemma: ""If you do something, they criticise you. If you don't do anything, they criticise you anyway."" Davis, a features writer who has previously interviewed celebrities such as Jada Pinkett Smith and Lena Dunham, asked Meghan if she thought there was room for forgiveness between her and her royal in-laws and her own family. The duchess responded: ""I think forgiveness is really important. It takes a lot more energy to not forgive. ""But it takes a lot of effort to forgive. I've really made an active effort, especially knowing that I can say anything."" In the 6,450-word interview, Meghan also: spoke of her fears that staying in the UK may have exposed her son, Archie, three, to excessive media attention criticised the lack of control she had over the release of family photographs when she was a senior royal said Archie is taught the importance of manners, with the phrase ""manners make the man"" often repeated told how the couple initially resisted viewing their $14.65m (Â£12.48m) California home as they did not think they could afford it divulged that she packed up their belongings at Frogmore Cottage, Windsor, while visiting for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee revealed she was considering a return to Instagram The Cut interview was part of a promotion effort for the duchess'sSpotify podcast, Archetypes,,externalwhich launched last week. The series promises to ""investigate, dissect and subvert the labels that try to hold women back"", with tennis legend Serena Williams discussing ambition on the first episode, while pop star Mariah Carey features in the second instalment, released on Tuesday. In Carey's episode the duchess says there was more focus on her race once she started dating her husband. ""Then I started to understand what it was like to be treated like a black woman, because up until then I had been treated like a mixed woman and things really shifted,"" she said. The Sussexes, who also have a one-year-old daughter, Lilibet, have signed deals with Spotify and Netflix since leaving the UK. Prince Harry told Davis he did not believe some members of the Royal Family could live and work together as closely as he and his wife do. The article described the Sussexes running their company Archewell while sitting at a single desk in a shared home office. ""Most people that I know and many of my family, they aren't able to work and live together,"" Prince Harry said. ""It's actually really weird because it'd seem like a lot of pressure. But it just feels natural and normal."" Both Harry and Meghan have had legal battles with parts of the British media and the duchess told Davis she would not have been able to pick Archie up from school in the UK ""without it being a royal photo call with a press pen of 40 people snapping pictures"". ""Sorry, I have a problem with that. That doesn't make me obsessed with privacy. That makes me a strong and good parent protecting my child,"" she said. Several royal correspondents have taken to social media to say this would not be the case. The 6,450-word interview appears in US magazine The Cut, part of New York magazine During the interview Davis talks about accompanying Meghan to collect Archie from pre-school, with the three-year-old wanting to roll down the car window as they pass a favourite bush, while munching on a quesadilla. There are other insights into the duke and duchess's lives in California in the course of the article, with the young family dancing around to Prince Harry's beatboxing - while Lilibet watches on from her nanny's arms - and Archie calling his parents ""Momma"" and ""Papa"".

"A team from the United Nations nuclear watchdog has left the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, for Zaporizhzhia to inspect the Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there There has been shelling around the facility recently with both Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of carrying out the attacks Fierce battles have been reported as Ukraine tries to retake the Russian-occupied Kherson region But military experts have told the BBC any change in control of the southern region, which was seized at the very start of the war, ""won't happen quickly"" Meanwhile Russia is shutting down gas supplies from a major pipeline to Europe for the next three days A Kremlin spokesman blamed Western sanctions against Russia, which he claimed prevented normal repair work, for the shutdown Edited by Robert Greenall We're pausing our
live coverage for today. Thanks for joining
us as we brought you the latest updates from Ukraine. Letâs recap what happened on Wednesday. Raphael Grossi and a team of IAEA inspectors are on their way to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant UN inspectors will try to establish ""a permanent presence"" at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said. Rafael Grossi explained the mission was ""mostly technical"" work, with the team heading to the plant looking to conduct a ""comprehensive evaluation"" of the ""physical integrity of the site and the functioning of the security systems"". He said the inspectors must talk to the workers at the plant, but also acknowledged it was a ""very complicated situation"". We are trying to establish a permanent presence of the agency starting from that moment, but this is something I have to still work on with the people on site.""  Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels Some countries have been calling for an EU-wide blanket ban on tourist visas, but the bloc was divided on the issue. EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, warned
against cutting off people
who are against the war or ""civil society"" in Russia. He pointed out that some specific individuals who support Putinâs âregimeâ
are already subject to travel bans. Borrell also acknowledged countries can take measures at a national
level to restrict entry into the EU. Among the opponents of a total ban were France and Germany German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said she was unsure it would work, saying that the EU had already seen a
decline in visa numbers from Russians in recent months. She
added visas had been issued to ""people who stood up courageously"" against
the war, like journalists or students, giving them a ""chance to get out of
Russia very, very quickly"" to safety. But earlier Estoniaâs Foreign
Minister said the EU must ""ramp up"" its response to Russiaâs invasion of
Ukraine. ""The loss of time is paid by blood of Ukrainians,"" Urmas
Reinsalu said, Meanwhile Dutch Foreign Minister
Wopke Hoekstra said: âWe now have the situation that it is primarily rich
Russians who come to Europe to go shopping. ""That is something that overall is
probably not a very good idea."" Grain silos in Mykolaiv have frequently been the target of Russian attacks, like this one in June In Mykolaiv, a Ukrainian-controlled city to the east of Kherson, Ukrainian officials say grain silos have been hit by Russian shells. Shelling on Tuesday caused a fire thatâs still burning a day
later, they say in a post on Facebook, affecting a 650 sq ft (200 sq m)
area. Mykolaiv is a major port city on the Southern Bug river
close to the Black Sea, and has several major grain terminals. Ukrainian officials have said they want to reopen it for
grain exports, halted by the war, following the reopening of three other ports
last month under a deal with Russia. Germany's chief of defence is warning of Russia's scope to open up a second front in its attempt to capture more ground in Ukraine. Gen Eberhard Zorn, the highest-ranking soldier in the Bundeswehr, says the West should not underestimate Moscow's military
strength. ""The bulk of the Russian land forces may be tied down in
Ukraine at the moment but, even so, we should not underestimate
the Russian land forces' potential to open a second theatre of
war,"" he told Reuters. ""Most of the Russian navy has not yet been deployed in the
war on Ukraine, and the Russian air force still has significant
potential as well, which poses a threat to Nato too."" Zorn, speaking before the start of an Ukrainian offensive in
the south, said
the dynamic of Russia's attack had slowed down but its forces were still pressing steadily ahead. However, he nevertheless said he doesn't anticipate any far-reaching offensives deep into Ukrainian-held territory at the moment. Josep Borrell is the EU's foreign policy chief Earlier we reported that EU foreign ministers had agreed to fully suspend a visa facilitation
agreement with Russia. The bloc's foreign policy
chief Josep Borrell has now confirmed the move, stating that an increase in border
crossings from Russia has become a security risk. The suspension will make it harder and more costly for
Russian citizens to enter the EU, he said. ""This has become a security risk for these neighbouring
states,"" Borrell told a news conference in Prague. ""In addition to that, we have seen many
Russians travelling for leisure and shopping as if no war was
raging in Ukraine."" Earlier Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the EU had voted not to impose a blanket ban on Russian visas. Frank GardnerBBC News, Security Correspondent Like tectonic plates beneath the
earthâs surface, things are moving on several fronts here in Ukraine. The
much-heralded Ukrainian counter-offensive to retake the southern city of
Kherson is happening but donât expect any quick victories. Ukrainian officials
have hinted this is more likely to be a long, slow process of wearing down the
Russian invaders, breaking their morale by targeting their supply lines using
long range artillery. A lot of those Russian soldiers wonât want to be there
while Ukrainians have a patriotic interest in regaining their land. There is, though, an urgency to Ukraineâs actions. All the signs are that with slow
progress on the battlefield, Russia plans to soon hold staged plebiscites in
territory it's seized, leading to it being annexed and made a part of the
Russian state. Once that happens it will be harder for Ukraine to get it
back. Meanwhile in Zaporizhzhia there continue to be claims and
counter-claims as to which side is to blame for the ongoing shelling around
Europeâs largest nuclear plant. Reports suggest there has been shelling on the
road the UN inspectors need to take to reach it and Russia is clearly unwilling
to let them stay there for more than a day at most. The IAEA mission departed Kyiv this morning We're hearing more now on the visit from the UN's nuclear watchdog to the
Russian-held Zaporizhzhia plant in southern Ukraine. The 14-strong team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are aiming to prevent ""a nuclear accident"", according to its director general Rafael Grossi. Speaking from the city of Zaporizhzhia today, Ukraine's Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said the mission is a
step towards ""deoccupying and demilitarising"" the nuclear site. ""It is important from our view... that the mission can speak
to the staff, and get the real information, not Russian
information, on what is inside,"" he told Reuters. The IAEA team are now in the city of Zaporizhzhia, which remains under Ukrainian control, unlike the power plant which is 34 miles (55km) away. A man rides a motocycle as black smoke rises from the front line in the Mykolaiv region Just joining us or need a recap? Here are the latest developments in the Ukraine war: Austria has announced it will bail out the country's main energy supplier with a â¬2bn (Â£1.7bn) loan as prices rise across Europe due to the war in Ukraine. Chancellor Karl Nehammer said the loan to Wien Energie was an ""extraordinary rescue measure"" to ensure its two million customers - in the capital Vienna - continue to receive electricity. It will last until April. Wien Energie requested a bailout due to financial problems amid huge hikes in energy prices and speculation the firm mismanaged funds, which it denies. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto The European Union has voted not to impose a blanket ban on Russian visas but has agreed to suspend
an agreement that eases visa issuance. That's according to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, who said in a post on Facebook that the decision was made at the EU Foreign Ministers' Summit in Prague. Szijjarto said Hungary, along with some other member states,
opposed a Russian visa ban. ""There won't be a general blanket visa ban imposed for
Russian citizens,"" he said. ""Several member states have raised
their voice against this, including myself."" He added that the agreement which eases visa issuance will be
suspended with qualified majority support, Reuters reports. Eastern and Nordic countries strongly back a tourism ban,
while Germany and France have warned their peers it would be
counter-productive, saying ordinary Russians should still be
allowed access to the West. Szijjarto also announced that Hungary has
signed a deal with Russia's Gazprom on additional gas shipments
from 1 September. Reality Check As we have been reporting, Russia has halted gas supplies via a major pipeline to Germany, called Nord Stream 1. It's just the latest in a series of supply stops that have fuelled an energy crisis in Europe - so let's take a closer look at what's happening: What is Nord Stream 1?It's a pipeline used to send gas, stretching 1,200km (745 miles) under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany. How has Russia cut supplies?Russiahas completely halted all gas supplies to Europe through the pipeline, claiming repairs are needed. Russian officials claim Western sanctions have caused the interruptions by damaging Russian infrastructure. How is it hurting Europe?Europe - and in particular Germany - has historically been very reliant on Russian gas to meet its energy needs. Gas prices have also soared - they're now about 450% higher than they were this time last year. How is Europe reducing demand for gas?The EU has worked outa dealin which member states cut usage by 15%. Get more on all of the abovehere. The fight over Kherson is part of Ukraine's push back against the Kremlin's plans to ""forcibly integrate"" the east and south into the Russian government system, an expert on Russian security and the military has said. Mathieu Boulegue, senior research fellow at the Chatham House think-tank, tells BBC News that Russia is engaged in a ""slow burning territorial appropriation"" of Ukrainian land. He says that because the Russian authorities are unable to achieve this ""Russification"" by design ""they need to do it by force"". Boulegue notes that because very few people ""want to live under a so-called Peopleâs Republic of Kherson"" like the annexed Donetsk or Luhansk regions, this must mostly be achieved by the combination of the use of force and imposing huge social changes. ""They need to Russianise the region, not just politically, economically and culturally, but civilisationally almost."" Boulegue explains this process involves things like changes to the education system, introducing the rouble as the currency and ensuring the Russian Orthodox Church as the established religion in the area. It involves physically installing their own people into positions of authority to ""control all the corridors of power so that they are all Russian and no longer respond to Kyiv politics"", he adds. Boulegue also says the process will almost certainly involve a ""fig leaf of legitimacy"" through a ""bogus referendum"" likely to be held in the autumn or early next year - similar to that held in Crimea after Russia annexed the peninsula in 2014. ""Itâs how they rubber stamp it to present it to the Russian population, which is effective through the use of state propaganda."" The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is right next to the town of Energodar Ukraine has accused Russian forces of firing on a town near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as UN nuclear watchdog inspectors were en route to inspect the facility. ""The Russian army is shelling Enerhodar,"" Evhen Yevtushenko, head of Nikopol district military administration, which is located opposite Enerhodar town where the nuclear plant is located. ""These provocations are dangerous."" He describes the alleged attack as a provocation because Enerhodar is under Russian occupation. One of the shells hit the building where Enerhodar's city council is located, Mayor Dmytro Orlovwrote on Telegram.,external He posted pictures of a damaged high-rise with a hole punched into the side and debris littering the ground. A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Kyiv this morning heading towards the Zaporizhzhia plant, to assess the conditions at the facility, and any damage caused by recent shelling in the area. Emzar (right) runs a drill with fellow firefighters at their fire station as they wait between calls Let's turn to the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has been battered by shelling for much of the last six months. Roman Kachanov leads the local fire station in Ukraine's second-largest city, and he spoke to the Reuters news agency about what his firefighters have to face nowadays. ""When you go in and you see six or seven apartments burning at the same time and you don't know where some people are and you have only three trucks... [it is] the lucky lottery where you need to put your troops,"" he says. ""You don't know what happened - they just bombed some place, we don't know, will they bomb again?"" His firefighters now wear helmets and bulletproof vests, adding about 20kg to the weight of their usual equipment, according to a press officer for the regional state emergency service. Let's take a look at some of the photos of life at the station: Margarita and other firefighters look at a scene outside their fire station through blackout curtains Firefighters work on putting out a blaze started by shelling inside a warehouse in Kharkiv Firefighters share dinner at the station Firefighters Dmytro and Mykolay read news on their phones during downtime at the station The Ukrainian military is pushing to recapture Kherson for both its strategic importance and to prevent the Russians from holding a ""pseudo-referendum"" in the area, according to an expert on Russian security. Dr Domitila Sagramoso, from King's College London, tells BBC News the ""operational and strategic"" importance of the city comes from three broad areas: As one of the only cities north of the river that Russia controls, Kherson has been and could theoretically again be used as a ""staging point"" for Russia to push towards other key cities in the south of Ukraine, like Mykolaiv and Odesa. Moreover, the North Crimean Canal - which originates from Dnipro and supplies the vast majority of Crimea's fresh water - allows Russia to re-supply water resources to the peninsula they have controlled since 2014, Sagramoso explains. Securing the city would also help Ukraine better protect its Black Sea coast and key ports, which would allow it to ""continue the trade of grain and protect the whole region"", she adds. But beyond the obvious tactical benefits of controlling this vital port city, Ukraine regards the region as a key target for ""swift"" recapture for political reasons, she says. Dr Sagramoso also notes the city in the south of the country was taken very early on in the war by Russia and remains one of the only major urban areas they have been able to secure and hold so far. She explains Ukrainians want to ""avoid the pseudo-referendum on integrating the area into
Russia"" similar to the vote held in Crimea in 2014  that the Kremlin has reportedly been planning for the summer or early autumn. Even if such a vote isn't carried out in a legal, transparent and adequate manner, it can still send a message that the area is slowly being integrated into Russia. It could cement Russiaâs political control over the area.""  Hugo BachegaReporting from Kyiv Ukraineâs military says Russian forces have sustained
significant losses in the south of the country, where an offensive is under way
against occupying forces in the Kherson area. Russia, however, has previously dismissed any advance by
Ukraine. Itâs difficult to independently verify the claims. This
region has been under Russian control since the early days of the war. And,
publicly, Ukrainian officials have refused to discuss details of the operation. Is it the much-anticipated counter-offensive to retake
Kherson, one of the largest cities in Russian hands? Itâs still not clear. The renewed fighting comes after
weeks of Ukrainian attacks on Russian supply lines and infrastructure deep
inside invaded territory, which have had a destabilising effect on Russian
troops. This has only been possible because of the sophisticated
weapons supplied by the West. But any operation is unlikely to be easy, or
quick. Yet, if this is indeed a major Ukrainian push, it could
be a turning point in the six-month conflict that, for weeks, has remained
static. For now though, the claims and counterclaims are likely
to continue. Russia has halted gas supplies via a major pipeline to Germany, the latest in a series of supply stops that have fuelled an energy crisis in Europe. The key Nord Stream 1 pipeline has been shut for the second time this summer, with energy giant Gazprom saying the latest restrictions will last for three days and are necessary to allow repairs. European countries have faced soaring energy prices since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February and subsequently curbed its gas deliveries to the region. The Kremlin has denied using gas as a political weapon. Europe - and in particular Germany - has historically been very reliant on Russian gas to meet its energy needs and when Russia announced its intention to restrict supply in July, within a day it had pushed up the wholesale price of gas by 10%. The EU is preparing to take emergency action to reform the electricity market in order to bring galloping prices under control, with energy ministers scheduled to hold talks next week. Read more. An apartment building destroyed by a missile strike in Bakhmut in June Five people in eastern Ukraine suspected of serving as spotters for the Russian military to help direct their missile strikes have been detained by the Ukrainian security services. Officials alleged the suspects were recruited by Russian security services to help adjust the precision of strikes on Slovyansk, Bakhmut and Kramatorsk and prepare acts of sabotage, the Unian news agency reports. They allegedly used anonymous Telegram channels to pass on to their Russian handlers information about the location of Ukrainian military positions and movement of hardware. All five have been remanded in custody. Meanwhile a former chief inspector for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been sharing his outlook on what might happen when the inspection team reach the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Olli Heinonen says the international community needs facts on what's happening at the Russian-controlled facility, including the status of the reactor and how the Ukrainian operating staff are doing after months of stressful conditions. He says inspectors, led by IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, may have to ""read between the lines"" when speaking to workers as they may be fearful of speaking truthfully due to the plant being controlled by Russian forces. ""They cannot be as open as they would like to be, they don't want to take risks, they might be threatened,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""They are human beings. They have families, they have dependents, they also have worries about that. ""The last thing you want to have there [as an inspecting team] is any confrontation either between you and the Ukrainians or between you and the Russians or between all three of them. So it's a very delicate mission and what I know is that Mr Grossi is a capable person so he can handle this very well."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"A team from the United Nations nuclear watchdog has left the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, for Zaporizhzhia to inspect the Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there There has been shelling around the facility recently with both Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of carrying out the attacks Fierce battles have been reported as Ukraine tries to retake the Russian-occupied Kherson region But military experts have told the BBC any change in control of the southern region, which was seized at the very start of the war, ""won't happen quickly"" Meanwhile Russia is shutting down gas supplies from a major pipeline to Europe for the next three days A Kremlin spokesman blamed Western sanctions against Russia, which he claimed prevented normal repair work, for the shutdown Edited by Robert Greenall We're pausing our
live coverage for today. Thanks for joining
us as we brought you the latest updates from Ukraine. Letâs recap what happened on Wednesday. Raphael Grossi and a team of IAEA inspectors are on their way to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant UN inspectors will try to establish ""a permanent presence"" at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said. Rafael Grossi explained the mission was ""mostly technical"" work, with the team heading to the plant looking to conduct a ""comprehensive evaluation"" of the ""physical integrity of the site and the functioning of the security systems"". He said the inspectors must talk to the workers at the plant, but also acknowledged it was a ""very complicated situation"". We are trying to establish a permanent presence of the agency starting from that moment, but this is something I have to still work on with the people on site.""  Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels Some countries have been calling for an EU-wide blanket ban on tourist visas, but the bloc was divided on the issue. EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, warned
against cutting off people
who are against the war or ""civil society"" in Russia. He pointed out that some specific individuals who support Putinâs âregimeâ
are already subject to travel bans. Borrell also acknowledged countries can take measures at a national
level to restrict entry into the EU. Among the opponents of a total ban were France and Germany German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said she was unsure it would work, saying that the EU had already seen a
decline in visa numbers from Russians in recent months. She
added visas had been issued to ""people who stood up courageously"" against
the war, like journalists or students, giving them a ""chance to get out of
Russia very, very quickly"" to safety. But earlier Estoniaâs Foreign
Minister said the EU must ""ramp up"" its response to Russiaâs invasion of
Ukraine. ""The loss of time is paid by blood of Ukrainians,"" Urmas
Reinsalu said, Meanwhile Dutch Foreign Minister
Wopke Hoekstra said: âWe now have the situation that it is primarily rich
Russians who come to Europe to go shopping. ""That is something that overall is
probably not a very good idea."" Grain silos in Mykolaiv have frequently been the target of Russian attacks, like this one in June In Mykolaiv, a Ukrainian-controlled city to the east of Kherson, Ukrainian officials say grain silos have been hit by Russian shells. Shelling on Tuesday caused a fire thatâs still burning a day
later, they say in a post on Facebook, affecting a 650 sq ft (200 sq m)
area. Mykolaiv is a major port city on the Southern Bug river
close to the Black Sea, and has several major grain terminals. Ukrainian officials have said they want to reopen it for
grain exports, halted by the war, following the reopening of three other ports
last month under a deal with Russia. Germany's chief of defence is warning of Russia's scope to open up a second front in its attempt to capture more ground in Ukraine. Gen Eberhard Zorn, the highest-ranking soldier in the Bundeswehr, says the West should not underestimate Moscow's military
strength. ""The bulk of the Russian land forces may be tied down in
Ukraine at the moment but, even so, we should not underestimate
the Russian land forces' potential to open a second theatre of
war,"" he told Reuters. ""Most of the Russian navy has not yet been deployed in the
war on Ukraine, and the Russian air force still has significant
potential as well, which poses a threat to Nato too."" Zorn, speaking before the start of an Ukrainian offensive in
the south, said
the dynamic of Russia's attack had slowed down but its forces were still pressing steadily ahead. However, he nevertheless said he doesn't anticipate any far-reaching offensives deep into Ukrainian-held territory at the moment. Josep Borrell is the EU's foreign policy chief Earlier we reported that EU foreign ministers had agreed to fully suspend a visa facilitation
agreement with Russia. The bloc's foreign policy
chief Josep Borrell has now confirmed the move, stating that an increase in border
crossings from Russia has become a security risk. The suspension will make it harder and more costly for
Russian citizens to enter the EU, he said. ""This has become a security risk for these neighbouring
states,"" Borrell told a news conference in Prague. ""In addition to that, we have seen many
Russians travelling for leisure and shopping as if no war was
raging in Ukraine."" Earlier Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the EU had voted not to impose a blanket ban on Russian visas. Frank GardnerBBC News, Security Correspondent Like tectonic plates beneath the
earthâs surface, things are moving on several fronts here in Ukraine. The
much-heralded Ukrainian counter-offensive to retake the southern city of
Kherson is happening but donât expect any quick victories. Ukrainian officials
have hinted this is more likely to be a long, slow process of wearing down the
Russian invaders, breaking their morale by targeting their supply lines using
long range artillery. A lot of those Russian soldiers wonât want to be there
while Ukrainians have a patriotic interest in regaining their land. There is, though, an urgency to Ukraineâs actions. All the signs are that with slow
progress on the battlefield, Russia plans to soon hold staged plebiscites in
territory it's seized, leading to it being annexed and made a part of the
Russian state. Once that happens it will be harder for Ukraine to get it
back. Meanwhile in Zaporizhzhia there continue to be claims and
counter-claims as to which side is to blame for the ongoing shelling around
Europeâs largest nuclear plant. Reports suggest there has been shelling on the
road the UN inspectors need to take to reach it and Russia is clearly unwilling
to let them stay there for more than a day at most. The IAEA mission departed Kyiv this morning We're hearing more now on the visit from the UN's nuclear watchdog to the
Russian-held Zaporizhzhia plant in southern Ukraine. The 14-strong team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are aiming to prevent ""a nuclear accident"", according to its director general Rafael Grossi. Speaking from the city of Zaporizhzhia today, Ukraine's Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said the mission is a
step towards ""deoccupying and demilitarising"" the nuclear site. ""It is important from our view... that the mission can speak
to the staff, and get the real information, not Russian
information, on what is inside,"" he told Reuters. The IAEA team are now in the city of Zaporizhzhia, which remains under Ukrainian control, unlike the power plant which is 34 miles (55km) away. A man rides a motocycle as black smoke rises from the front line in the Mykolaiv region Just joining us or need a recap? Here are the latest developments in the Ukraine war: Austria has announced it will bail out the country's main energy supplier with a â¬2bn (Â£1.7bn) loan as prices rise across Europe due to the war in Ukraine. Chancellor Karl Nehammer said the loan to Wien Energie was an ""extraordinary rescue measure"" to ensure its two million customers - in the capital Vienna - continue to receive electricity. It will last until April. Wien Energie requested a bailout due to financial problems amid huge hikes in energy prices and speculation the firm mismanaged funds, which it denies. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto The European Union has voted not to impose a blanket ban on Russian visas but has agreed to suspend
an agreement that eases visa issuance. That's according to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, who said in a post on Facebook that the decision was made at the EU Foreign Ministers' Summit in Prague. Szijjarto said Hungary, along with some other member states,
opposed a Russian visa ban. ""There won't be a general blanket visa ban imposed for
Russian citizens,"" he said. ""Several member states have raised
their voice against this, including myself."" He added that the agreement which eases visa issuance will be
suspended with qualified majority support, Reuters reports. Eastern and Nordic countries strongly back a tourism ban,
while Germany and France have warned their peers it would be
counter-productive, saying ordinary Russians should still be
allowed access to the West. Szijjarto also announced that Hungary has
signed a deal with Russia's Gazprom on additional gas shipments
from 1 September. Reality Check As we have been reporting, Russia has halted gas supplies via a major pipeline to Germany, called Nord Stream 1. It's just the latest in a series of supply stops that have fuelled an energy crisis in Europe - so let's take a closer look at what's happening: What is Nord Stream 1?It's a pipeline used to send gas, stretching 1,200km (745 miles) under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany. How has Russia cut supplies?Russiahas completely halted all gas supplies to Europe through the pipeline, claiming repairs are needed. Russian officials claim Western sanctions have caused the interruptions by damaging Russian infrastructure. How is it hurting Europe?Europe - and in particular Germany - has historically been very reliant on Russian gas to meet its energy needs. Gas prices have also soared - they're now about 450% higher than they were this time last year. How is Europe reducing demand for gas?The EU has worked outa dealin which member states cut usage by 15%. Get more on all of the abovehere. The fight over Kherson is part of Ukraine's push back against the Kremlin's plans to ""forcibly integrate"" the east and south into the Russian government system, an expert on Russian security and the military has said. Mathieu Boulegue, senior research fellow at the Chatham House think-tank, tells BBC News that Russia is engaged in a ""slow burning territorial appropriation"" of Ukrainian land. He says that because the Russian authorities are unable to achieve this ""Russification"" by design ""they need to do it by force"". Boulegue notes that because very few people ""want to live under a so-called Peopleâs Republic of Kherson"" like the annexed Donetsk or Luhansk regions, this must mostly be achieved by the combination of the use of force and imposing huge social changes. ""They need to Russianise the region, not just politically, economically and culturally, but civilisationally almost."" Boulegue explains this process involves things like changes to the education system, introducing the rouble as the currency and ensuring the Russian Orthodox Church as the established religion in the area. It involves physically installing their own people into positions of authority to ""control all the corridors of power so that they are all Russian and no longer respond to Kyiv politics"", he adds. Boulegue also says the process will almost certainly involve a ""fig leaf of legitimacy"" through a ""bogus referendum"" likely to be held in the autumn or early next year - similar to that held in Crimea after Russia annexed the peninsula in 2014. ""Itâs how they rubber stamp it to present it to the Russian population, which is effective through the use of state propaganda.""

Here are the latest developments in the Ukraine war: Austria has announced it will bail out the country's main energy supplier with a â¬2bn (Â£1.7bn) loan as prices rise across Europe due to the war in Ukraine. Chancellor Karl Nehammer said the loan to Wien Energie was an ""extraordinary rescue measure"" to ensure its two million customers - in the capital Vienna - continue to receive electricity. It will last until April. Wien Energie requested a bailout due to financial problems amid huge hikes in energy prices and speculation the firm mismanaged funds, which it denies. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto The European Union has voted not to impose a blanket ban on Russian visas but has agreed to suspend
an agreement that eases visa issuance. That's according to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, who said in a post on Facebook that the decision was made at the EU Foreign Ministers' Summit in Prague. Szijjarto said Hungary, along with some other member states,
opposed a Russian visa ban. ""There won't be a general blanket visa ban imposed for
Russian citizens,"" he said. ""Several member states have raised
their voice against this, including myself."" He added that the agreement which eases visa issuance will be
suspended with qualified majority support, Reuters reports. Eastern and Nordic countries strongly back a tourism ban,
while Germany and France have warned their peers it would be
counter-productive, saying ordinary Russians should still be
allowed access to the West. Szijjarto also announced that Hungary has
signed a deal with Russia's Gazprom on additional gas shipments
from 1 September. Reality Check As we have been reporting, Russia has halted gas supplies via a major pipeline to Germany, called Nord Stream 1. It's just the latest in a series of supply stops that have fuelled an energy crisis in Europe - so let's take a closer look at what's happening: What is Nord Stream 1?It's a pipeline used to send gas, stretching 1,200km (745 miles) under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany. How has Russia cut supplies?Russiahas completely halted all gas supplies to Europe through the pipeline, claiming repairs are needed. Russian officials claim Western sanctions have caused the interruptions by damaging Russian infrastructure. How is it hurting Europe?Europe - and in particular Germany - has historically been very reliant on Russian gas to meet its energy needs. Gas prices have also soared - they're now about 450% higher than they were this time last year. How is Europe reducing demand for gas?The EU has worked outa dealin which member states cut usage by 15%. Get more on all of the abovehere. The fight over Kherson is part of Ukraine's push back against the Kremlin's plans to ""forcibly integrate"" the east and south into the Russian government system, an expert on Russian security and the military has said. Mathieu Boulegue, senior research fellow at the Chatham House think-tank, tells BBC News that Russia is engaged in a ""slow burning territorial appropriation"" of Ukrainian land. He says that because the Russian authorities are unable to achieve this ""Russification"" by design ""they need to do it by force"". Boulegue notes that because very few people ""want to live under a so-called Peopleâs Republic of Kherson"" like the annexed Donetsk or Luhansk regions, this must mostly be achieved by the combination of the use of force and imposing huge social changes. ""They need to Russianise the region, not just politically, economically and culturally, but civilisationally almost."" Boulegue explains this process involves things like changes to the education system, introducing the rouble as the currency and ensuring the Russian Orthodox Church as the established religion in the area. It involves physically installing their own people into positions of authority to ""control all the corridors of power so that they are all Russian and no longer respond to Kyiv politics"", he adds. Boulegue also says the process will almost certainly involve a ""fig leaf of legitimacy"" through a ""bogus referendum"" likely to be held in the autumn or early next year - similar to that held in Crimea after Russia annexed the peninsula in 2014. ""Itâs how they rubber stamp it to present it to the Russian population, which is effective through the use of state propaganda."" The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is right next to the town of Energodar Ukraine has accused Russian forces of firing on a town near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as UN nuclear watchdog inspectors were en route to inspect the facility. ""The Russian army is shelling Enerhodar,"" Evhen Yevtushenko, head of Nikopol district military administration, which is located opposite Enerhodar town where the nuclear plant is located. ""These provocations are dangerous."" He describes the alleged attack as a provocation because Enerhodar is under Russian occupation. One of the shells hit the building where Enerhodar's city council is located, Mayor Dmytro Orlovwrote on Telegram.,external He posted pictures of a damaged high-rise with a hole punched into the side and debris littering the ground. A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Kyiv this morning heading towards the Zaporizhzhia plant, to assess the conditions at the facility, and any damage caused by recent shelling in the area. Emzar (right) runs a drill with fellow firefighters at their fire station as they wait between calls Let's turn to the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has been battered by shelling for much of the last six months. Roman Kachanov leads the local fire station in Ukraine's second-largest city, and he spoke to the Reuters news agency about what his firefighters have to face nowadays. ""When you go in and you see six or seven apartments burning at the same time and you don't know where some people are and you have only three trucks... [it is] the lucky lottery where you need to put your troops,"" he says. ""You don't know what happened - they just bombed some place, we don't know, will they bomb again?"" His firefighters now wear helmets and bulletproof vests, adding about 20kg to the weight of their usual equipment, according to a press officer for the regional state emergency service. Let's take a look at some of the photos of life at the station: Margarita and other firefighters look at a scene outside their fire station through blackout curtains Firefighters work on putting out a blaze started by shelling inside a warehouse in Kharkiv Firefighters share dinner at the station Firefighters Dmytro and Mykolay read news on their phones during downtime at the station The Ukrainian military is pushing to recapture Kherson for both its strategic importance and to prevent the Russians from holding a ""pseudo-referendum"" in the area, according to an expert on Russian security. Dr Domitila Sagramoso, from King's College London, tells BBC News the ""operational and strategic"" importance of the city comes from three broad areas: As one of the only cities north of the river that Russia controls, Kherson has been and could theoretically again be used as a ""staging point"" for Russia to push towards other key cities in the south of Ukraine, like Mykolaiv and Odesa. Moreover, the North Crimean Canal - which originates from Dnipro and supplies the vast majority of Crimea's fresh water - allows Russia to re-supply water resources to the peninsula they have controlled since 2014, Sagramoso explains. Securing the city would also help Ukraine better protect its Black Sea coast and key ports, which would allow it to ""continue the trade of grain and protect the whole region"", she adds. But beyond the obvious tactical benefits of controlling this vital port city, Ukraine regards the region as a key target for ""swift"" recapture for political reasons, she says. Dr Sagramoso also notes the city in the south of the country was taken very early on in the war by Russia and remains one of the only major urban areas they have been able to secure and hold so far. She explains Ukrainians want to ""avoid the pseudo-referendum on integrating the area into
Russia"" similar to the vote held in Crimea in 2014  that the Kremlin has reportedly been planning for the summer or early autumn. Even if such a vote isn't carried out in a legal, transparent and adequate manner, it can still send a message that the area is slowly being integrated into Russia. It could cement Russiaâs political control over the area.""  Hugo BachegaReporting from Kyiv Ukraineâs military says Russian forces have sustained
significant losses in the south of the country, where an offensive is under way
against occupying forces in the Kherson area. Russia, however, has previously dismissed any advance by
Ukraine. Itâs difficult to independently verify the claims. This
region has been under Russian control since the early days of the war. And,
publicly, Ukrainian officials have refused to discuss details of the operation. Is it the much-anticipated counter-offensive to retake
Kherson, one of the largest cities in Russian hands? Itâs still not clear. The renewed fighting comes after
weeks of Ukrainian attacks on Russian supply lines and infrastructure deep
inside invaded territory, which have had a destabilising effect on Russian
troops. This has only been possible because of the sophisticated
weapons supplied by the West. But any operation is unlikely to be easy, or
quick. Yet, if this is indeed a major Ukrainian push, it could
be a turning point in the six-month conflict that, for weeks, has remained
static. For now though, the claims and counterclaims are likely
to continue. Russia has halted gas supplies via a major pipeline to Germany, the latest in a series of supply stops that have fuelled an energy crisis in Europe. The key Nord Stream 1 pipeline has been shut for the second time this summer, with energy giant Gazprom saying the latest restrictions will last for three days and are necessary to allow repairs. European countries have faced soaring energy prices since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February and subsequently curbed its gas deliveries to the region. The Kremlin has denied using gas as a political weapon. Europe - and in particular Germany - has historically been very reliant on Russian gas to meet its energy needs and when Russia announced its intention to restrict supply in July, within a day it had pushed up the wholesale price of gas by 10%. The EU is preparing to take emergency action to reform the electricity market in order to bring galloping prices under control, with energy ministers scheduled to hold talks next week. Read more. An apartment building destroyed by a missile strike in Bakhmut in June Five people in eastern Ukraine suspected of serving as spotters for the Russian military to help direct their missile strikes have been detained by the Ukrainian security services. Officials alleged the suspects were recruited by Russian security services to help adjust the precision of strikes on Slovyansk, Bakhmut and Kramatorsk and prepare acts of sabotage, the Unian news agency reports. They allegedly used anonymous Telegram channels to pass on to their Russian handlers information about the location of Ukrainian military positions and movement of hardware. All five have been remanded in custody. Meanwhile a former chief inspector for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been sharing his outlook on what might happen when the inspection team reach the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Olli Heinonen says the international community needs facts on what's happening at the Russian-controlled facility, including the status of the reactor and how the Ukrainian operating staff are doing after months of stressful conditions. He says inspectors, led by IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, may have to ""read between the lines"" when speaking to workers as they may be fearful of speaking truthfully due to the plant being controlled by Russian forces. ""They cannot be as open as they would like to be, they don't want to take risks, they might be threatened,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""They are human beings. They have families, they have dependents, they also have worries about that. ""The last thing you want to have there [as an inspecting team] is any confrontation either between you and the Ukrainians or between you and the Russians or between all three of them. So it's a very delicate mission and what I know is that Mr Grossi is a capable person so he can handle this very well."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"A team from the United Nations nuclear watchdog has left the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, for Zaporizhzhia to inspect the Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there There has been shelling around the facility recently with both Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of carrying out the attacks Fierce battles have been reported as Ukraine tries to retake the Russian-occupied Kherson region But military experts have told the BBC any change in control of the southern region, which was seized at the very start of the war, ""won't happen quickly"" Meanwhile Russia is shutting down gas supplies from a major pipeline to Europe for the next three days A Kremlin spokesman blamed Western sanctions against Russia, which he claimed prevented normal repair work, for the shutdown Edited by Robert Greenall We're pausing our
live coverage for today. Thanks for joining
us as we brought you the latest updates from Ukraine. Letâs recap what happened on Wednesday. Raphael Grossi and a team of IAEA inspectors are on their way to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant UN inspectors will try to establish ""a permanent presence"" at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said. Rafael Grossi explained the mission was ""mostly technical"" work, with the team heading to the plant looking to conduct a ""comprehensive evaluation"" of the ""physical integrity of the site and the functioning of the security systems"". He said the inspectors must talk to the workers at the plant, but also acknowledged it was a ""very complicated situation"". We are trying to establish a permanent presence of the agency starting from that moment, but this is something I have to still work on with the people on site.""  Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels Some countries have been calling for an EU-wide blanket ban on tourist visas, but the bloc was divided on the issue. EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, warned
against cutting off people
who are against the war or ""civil society"" in Russia. He pointed out that some specific individuals who support Putinâs âregimeâ
are already subject to travel bans. Borrell also acknowledged countries can take measures at a national
level to restrict entry into the EU. Among the opponents of a total ban were France and Germany German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said she was unsure it would work, saying that the EU had already seen a
decline in visa numbers from Russians in recent months. She
added visas had been issued to ""people who stood up courageously"" against
the war, like journalists or students, giving them a ""chance to get out of
Russia very, very quickly"" to safety. But earlier Estoniaâs Foreign
Minister said the EU must ""ramp up"" its response to Russiaâs invasion of
Ukraine. ""The loss of time is paid by blood of Ukrainians,"" Urmas
Reinsalu said, Meanwhile Dutch Foreign Minister
Wopke Hoekstra said: âWe now have the situation that it is primarily rich
Russians who come to Europe to go shopping. ""That is something that overall is
probably not a very good idea."" Grain silos in Mykolaiv have frequently been the target of Russian attacks, like this one in June In Mykolaiv, a Ukrainian-controlled city to the east of Kherson, Ukrainian officials say grain silos have been hit by Russian shells. Shelling on Tuesday caused a fire thatâs still burning a day
later, they say in a post on Facebook, affecting a 650 sq ft (200 sq m)
area. Mykolaiv is a major port city on the Southern Bug river
close to the Black Sea, and has several major grain terminals. Ukrainian officials have said they want to reopen it for
grain exports, halted by the war, following the reopening of three other ports
last month under a deal with Russia. Germany's chief of defence is warning of Russia's scope to open up a second front in its attempt to capture more ground in Ukraine. Gen Eberhard Zorn, the highest-ranking soldier in the Bundeswehr, says the West should not underestimate Moscow's military
strength. ""The bulk of the Russian land forces may be tied down in
Ukraine at the moment but, even so, we should not underestimate
the Russian land forces' potential to open a second theatre of
war,"" he told Reuters. ""Most of the Russian navy has not yet been deployed in the
war on Ukraine, and the Russian air force still has significant
potential as well, which poses a threat to Nato too."" Zorn, speaking before the start of an Ukrainian offensive in
the south, said
the dynamic of Russia's attack had slowed down but its forces were still pressing steadily ahead. However, he nevertheless said he doesn't anticipate any far-reaching offensives deep into Ukrainian-held territory at the moment. Josep Borrell is the EU's foreign policy chief Earlier we reported that EU foreign ministers had agreed to fully suspend a visa facilitation
agreement with Russia. The bloc's foreign policy
chief Josep Borrell has now confirmed the move, stating that an increase in border
crossings from Russia has become a security risk. The suspension will make it harder and more costly for
Russian citizens to enter the EU, he said. ""This has become a security risk for these neighbouring
states,"" Borrell told a news conference in Prague. ""In addition to that, we have seen many
Russians travelling for leisure and shopping as if no war was
raging in Ukraine."" Earlier Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the EU had voted not to impose a blanket ban on Russian visas. Frank GardnerBBC News, Security Correspondent Like tectonic plates beneath the
earthâs surface, things are moving on several fronts here in Ukraine. The
much-heralded Ukrainian counter-offensive to retake the southern city of
Kherson is happening but donât expect any quick victories. Ukrainian officials
have hinted this is more likely to be a long, slow process of wearing down the
Russian invaders, breaking their morale by targeting their supply lines using
long range artillery. A lot of those Russian soldiers wonât want to be there
while Ukrainians have a patriotic interest in regaining their land. There is, though, an urgency to Ukraineâs actions. All the signs are that with slow
progress on the battlefield, Russia plans to soon hold staged plebiscites in
territory it's seized, leading to it being annexed and made a part of the
Russian state. Once that happens it will be harder for Ukraine to get it
back. Meanwhile in Zaporizhzhia there continue to be claims and
counter-claims as to which side is to blame for the ongoing shelling around
Europeâs largest nuclear plant. Reports suggest there has been shelling on the
road the UN inspectors need to take to reach it and Russia is clearly unwilling
to let them stay there for more than a day at most. The IAEA mission departed Kyiv this morning We're hearing more now on the visit from the UN's nuclear watchdog to the
Russian-held Zaporizhzhia plant in southern Ukraine. The 14-strong team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are aiming to prevent ""a nuclear accident"", according to its director general Rafael Grossi. Speaking from the city of Zaporizhzhia today, Ukraine's Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said the mission is a
step towards ""deoccupying and demilitarising"" the nuclear site. ""It is important from our view... that the mission can speak
to the staff, and get the real information, not Russian
information, on what is inside,"" he told Reuters. The IAEA team are now in the city of Zaporizhzhia, which remains under Ukrainian control, unlike the power plant which is 34 miles (55km) away.

"Chris Dawson outside the New South Wales Supreme Court An Australian man who became the subject of a popular crime podcast has been found guilty of his wife's murder - 40 years after she went missing. Chris Dawson's trial followed decades of speculation about the 1982 disappearance of his wife, Lynette. A judge ruled Dawson killed his wife so he could continue his relationship with his teenage lover and babysitter, known only as JC for legal reasons. Mrs Dawson's body is still missing and all the evidence was circumstantial. Dawson was charged in 2018 after the podcast, The Teacher's Pet, garnered global attention and prompted a renewed investigation. A sentencing date is yet to be set and Dawson's lawyer has indicated he is likely to appeal against the conviction. The 74-year-old denies killing Mrs Dawson, maintaining she had abandoned him and their two children - possibly to join a religious group. But while handing down his verdict on Tuesday, Justice Ian Harrison said the evidence against Dawson was ""persuasive and compelling"". The judge found Dawson was obsessed with JC, who was also a student at the school where he taught, and wanted her as a ""replacement"" for his wife. Justice Harrison said Dawson had become increasingly desperate as previous plans to leave his marriage failed and JC had wanted to end their relationship. ""I'm satisfied that the prospect that he would lose [JC] so distressed, frustrated, and ultimately overwhelmed him that... Mr Dawson resolved to kill his wife,"" he told the New South Wales Supreme Court. JC and Dawson eventually married and had a child, but divorced several years later. At the trial, she said Dawson had ""groomed"" her and treated her like a ""slave"" after Mrs Dawson disappeared. Lynette Dawson's body has never been found Mrs Dawson's brother welcomed the verdict, but said ""the journey is not yet complete"" and called for her body to be returned. Greg Simms appealed for Dawson to ""finally do the decent thing"" and ""allow us to bring Lynette home to a peaceful rest, finally showing her some dignity she deserves"". Phil Mercer, BBC News at NSW Supreme Court Ashen and dazed. Chris Dawson appeared to be in shock as he stepped into a lift on the 13th floor of the court with his older brother, Peter, and his lawyer during a break in the judge's deliberations. I stood an arm's length away from a man who a couple of hours later would become a convicted killer. After 40 years, the mystery and tragedy of Lynette Dawson's disappearance have finally been solved. The judge demolished her husband's defence, labelling key parts ""absurd"" and ""fanciful"". There were gasps from his family members when the guilty verdict was eventually handed down. There were tears from Lynette Dawson's relatives who sat quietly nearby. The former teacher was led away in handcuffs, shaking his head. Justice Harrison's lengthy verdict has finally exposed his lies and deceit. The case shot to global prominence when it was investigated by journalist Hedley Thomas in podcast The Teacher's Pet. The series won Australian journalism's highest honour and has been downloaded more than 60 million times, topping charts around the world. The podcast and its impact were key issues in the trial, with Justice Harrison criticising its ""less than balanced view"" on the case and ruling it had affected the evidence of some witnesses. The case was initially delayed due to publicity the podcast created, and Dawson's lawyers tried to halt it altogether, arguing the series had contaminated his shot at a fair trial. Dawson was instead granted a trial before a single judge, rather than jury. Lynette Dawson, a 33-year-old mother of two, disappeared from her Sydney home in January 1982. Police have never found any trace of her. Two separate inquests into her disappearance concluded that she was killed by a ""known person"". But until the podcast explored the case, prosecutors had said there was not enough evidence to lay charges. Lynette Dawson's brother Greg Simms and his wife Merilyn fought for a renewed investigation Dawson has maintained his wife phoned him one weekend in January 1982 and said she needed time away. He said he also received several calls from her afterwards. His defence team pointed to alleged sightings by five people after Mrs Dawson was reported missing as evidence she could have been alive after January 1982. But prosecutors argued Dawson was driven to murder after his failed plots to leave the marriage - which they said included contemplating hiring a hitman, and a thwarted move to Queensland to start a new life with JC. Justice Harrison rejected the claim about the hitman, but said he was satisfied that Chris Dawson had intentionally caused Lynette Dawson's death. The judge said Mrs Dawson appeared to ""adore"" her husband, had made several plans for the future and did not have the financial means to support herself for long, all of which made it ""extremely unlikely"" that she would decide to leave. None of Mrs Dawson's friends and family have heard from her since she disappeared. Considering the circumstantial evidence as a whole, Justice Harrison said he was ""left with no doubt"" that Dawson had indeed killed his wife and disposed of her body.

"Andy Murray extended his US Open first-round record to 15 wins and just one loss US Open 2022 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:29 August-11 September Coverage:Daily radio commentaries across BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and app Britain's Andy Murray demonstrated his grit and guile to frustrate Argentine 24th seed Francisco Cerundolo and start the 10th anniversary of his US Open victory with a first-round win. Murray, 35, took a tight first set 7-5 and impressively won the next two 6-3 6-3 as Cerundolo became despondent. He is joined in the next round byJack Draper,who beat Finland's Emil Ruusuvuori 6-4 6-3 6-3. Fellow BritonHarriet Dartadvanced by overcoming 10th seed Daria Kasatkina. The 26-year-old world number 88 claimed her first main-draw win in New York as well as her first victory against a top-10 player as she beat the world number nine 7-6 (10-8) 1-6 6-3. But former British number one Kyle Edmund lost 6-3 7-5 6-2 against Norwegian fifth seed Casper Ruud as he made his Grand Slam singles comeback after a serious knee injury, Emma Raducanu starts her title defence on Tuesday, with seventh seed Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans also playing on day two. Williams starts US Open farewell with a win Defending champion Medvedev wins on US Open return Halep suffers shock loss to Ukrainian Snigur Murray was one of seven British players competing in the US Open singles and was the first through to the second round after opening play on Louis Armstrong Stadium, which is the second show court at Flushing Meadows. Almost four years on from having major hip surgery, the former world number one has struggled to string wins together in a season he recently described as ""OK"" and wanted ""to be better"". Climbing the rankings sufficiently to be seeded for the New York major was the target after Wimbledon, where he lost to 20th seed John Isner in the second round. Inconsistent performances in North America since did not enable him to achieve his goal and, as a result, the world number 51 ended up being drawn against a seeded player at Flushing Meadows. While 24-year-old Cerundolo has largely climbed the rankings this year because of his results on clay, it felt like his forehand could cause problems for Murray on the hard court and many predicted a long slog between the pair. However, that did not play out as Murray, who earned the first of his three major titles in New York ground down his opponent to win his first Grand Slam match in straight sets since Wimbledon in 2017. Murray, who will play 20-year-old American wildcard Emilio Nava next, said: ""It felt like five sets to me, it was tricky conditions, very humid and hot. ""But I'm happy with the way I got through that one. He has had a brilliant year, I knew I had to play well and I did that in the important moments."" When asked if he was using the US Open's new rule permitting off-court coaching, Murray said: ""Sometimes when you are in those conditions, it's quite easy to focus on yourself and how you are feeling. But it's good to sometimes have a look down the other end and see how your opponent is getting on. ""Ivan [Lendl, Murray's coach] was trying to get me to keep moving him around the court, because he felt physically Cerundolo was struggling. I tried to do that certainly at the beginning of the sets and managed to get a good lead because of it."" Murray had never played Cerundolo before their first-round match at Flushing Meadows Murray impressed by keeping the pressure on Cerundolo, who became animated between points towards the end of the first set as his head began to drop. After losing serve in the first game, Murray fought back with four on the bounce and looked increasingly assured in his ball-striking. Things are often complicated with Murray, though. He suddenly became edgy when serving for the set and a poor game put the opener back on serve. There was an unusual incident in the ninth game, with Murray leading 5-4, when Cerundolo initially won a point despite a double bounce before sportingly handing it over to the Scot after replays on the big screens showed what had happened. After sealing victory Murray - who also failed to serve out the second and third sets at the first attempts - thanked Cerundolo for his sportsmanship when they met at the net. ""What he did was brilliant and I don't think that loads of players on the tour would have done that. Fair play to him,"" said Murray, who added he thought there was an argument for video assistant review-style challenges in these instances. Another positive for Murray was there appeared to be no sign of the cramping which he has been hampered by recently, despite the warm weather which would have been even hotter on the sun-soaked court. ""I did well physically and mentally to put that to the back of my mind and find a way to get through. So I was really happy with that,"" he added. On paper Draper appeared to have been handed a tricky opponent in Ruusuvuori, who got the better of him at Queen's in June. However, the 20-year-old left-hander delivered a mature display as he made a confident US Open debut to back up recent victories against Stefanos Tsitsipas and Dominic Thiem against another top-50 ranked player. Draper converted all of the five break points he created and dropped serve just once himself. He will now face Canadian sixth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in an intriguing second-round contest. Harriet Dart reached the quarter-finals at Nottingham and Eastbourne earlier this summer Dart had earned direct entry into the US Open draw for the first time after making it into the world top 100 this year and she proved herself more than worthy of the place. The Briton reached the second round on her third attempt in New York after a rollercoaster match against the in-form Kasatkina, who won two titles in North America this summer. After a first set featuring 10 breaks of serve, Dart saved two set points as she battled her way to victory in the tie-break. However, her level dropped as Kasatkina's rose to give the Russian a swift second-set win. But, after loudly berating herself for being ""so unfit"" when she failed to reach a ball at 2-0 down in the decider, Dart proved she was anything but as she scrapped to an unlikely victory in two hours and 30 minutes. ""I'm a little bit in shock right now,"" she told Amazon Prime. ""Physically I don't feel great but I really tried to stick at it and push through. I can't believe I got the win. ""What's so exciting about women's tennis is anyone can win."" Dart will play Hungarian Dalma Galfi, ranked three places below her at 91, in the second round. Edmund was playing his first Grand Slam singles match since the 2020 US Open Simply being back playing singles at a major tournament was a result for Edmund aftera hellish two years dealing with a knee injurywhich left him wondering about his future. The 27-year-old Yorkshireman was given an unkind draw in the shape of world number seven Ruud, who reached the French Open final this year and recently enjoyed a run to the Montreal semi-finals on the hard courts. Edmund, using a protected injury ranking to play, said he was keen to see his level against one of the world's best and after some encouraging signs early on, the former world number 14 lost in straight sets. Edmund broke for an early 2-1 lead in the first set and showed glimpses of his quality, particularly with his trademark forehand. But there were also signs of rustiness and eventually tiredness, understandable in only his 10th singles match back after three operations, as Ruud fought back to earn a comfortable win.

"Pakistan's planning minister says early estimates show the devastating floods that hit the country have caused at least $10bn (Â£8.5bn) of damage. His comment comes as another government minister said that one-third of the South Asian nation has been submerged. Separately on Monday, Pakistan received a $1.1bn bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). That money is aimed to help the cash-strapped economy avoid defaulting on its debts. The flash floods, caused by record monsoon rains, have killed at least 1,136 people and affected more than 33 million, over 15% of the country's population. The torrential rains have also washed away roads, crops, homes, bridges and other infrastructure. One-third of Pakistan is under water - minister Pakistan flood victims throw note pleading for help Sri Lanka crisis is a warning to other Asian nations ""I think it is going to be huge. So far, [a] very early, preliminary estimate is that it is big, it is higher than $10 billion,"" Pakistan's planning minister Ahsan Iqbal told the Reuters news agency. Mr Iqbal said the country would face serious food shortages in the coming weeks and months and believed that the floods were worse than those that hit Pakistan in 2010, the deadliest in the country's history which left more than 2,000 people dead. He also called on richer countries to help Pakistan financially as he said it was a victim of climate change, which had been caused by the ""irresponsible development of the developed world"". To address food shortages, finance minister Miftah Ismail said Pakistan could consider importing vegetables from arch-rival India. On Monday, the country's climate change minister Sherry Rehman described the situation as a ""climate-induced humanitarian disaster of epic proportions."" ""Literally, one-third of Pakistan is underwater right now, which has exceeded every boundary, every norm we've seen in the past,"" Ms Rehman told the AFP news agency. Even before the floods Pakistan was suffering from an economic crisis and had been negotiating with the IMF over a bailout. Official figures released in recent weeks showed that the country had only enough foreign currencies in reserve for about a month of imports as its economy struggles with an annual inflation rate of almost 25%. In a statement on the $1.1bn bailout,external, IMF deputy managing director Antoinette Sayeh said: ""Pakistan's economy has been buffeted by adverse external conditions, due to spillovers from the war in Ukraine, and domestic challenges, including from accommodative policies that resulted in uneven and unbalanced growth."" The floods were not mentioned in the statement. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

"This video can not be played Overflowing bins are seen on nearly every street, including along the busy Grassmarket Unions have confirmed they will continue strike action after turning down a new pay offer from councils. Unite and the GMB both rejected the Cosla offer while Unison, Scotland's largest council union, said it would put it to members. Rubbish has been building up in many town and city centres after several days of bin strikes. The dispute led to action in two-thirds of Scotland's councils and is set to close schools and nurseries next week. Cosla said it was ""disappointed"" with the response from unions. Unions had been seeking an agreement from the local government body similar to the one made to council workers in England - which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay increase. They said that offering a percentage pay rise would mean the most money would go to the best paid staff. Public health warning as bin strikes continue Is there a bin strike in my area? The people hiring skips and using baths to store rubbish The current round of strikes is due to end on Wednesday in many local authority areas, and at 04:59 in Edinburgh. The first bin strike began in the capital city on 18 August, in the midst of festival season, after the GMB, Unite and Unison rejected aninitial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. Edinburgh's strike is due to end on Tuesday morning but more action is planned next week It escalated last week when refuse workers at a further 20 local authorities, including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, walked out despite a revised 5% offer. A second wave of strikes, which will include school workers, is due to begin in a bid to ""achieve a significantly improved pay offer"". Hundreds of schools and nurseries are scheduled to close from 6 to 8 September. Cosla's offer of a Â£1,925 pay uplift matched an offer to council workers south of the border, but only part of this payment was consolidated into council workers' ongoing pay. The rest would be given as one-off cost of living payments. Those earning less than Â£20,500 - about 20% of council staff in Scotland - would receive a pro-rata gross pay increase in 2022 equal to Â£2,000. All staff would also get an extra day of leave. Unite criticised the negotiations as a ""waste of precious time"" because new offer disproportionately hits the lowest paid. The union's industrial officer Wendy Dunsmore said: ""In real terms it leaves the lowest paid workers no better-off and a significant proportion of the offer does not enhance overtime, allowances or pensions."" Mark Ferguson, chair of Unison's local government committee, said strike action was the ""last resort"". ""Half of council workers earn less than Â£25,000 per year and 85% earn less than Â£39,000 per year - they are all worrying about paying their bills,"" he said. GMB Scotland senior organiser Keir Greenaway said they had written to Cosla urging them to return to talks as soon as possible. He said: ""It's not credible that in the grip of the biggest cost of living crisis in forty years, a head of service gets four times the consolidated increase than a bin collector, cleaner or carer."" BBC reporter Angie Brown says residents are dodging massive middens in the streets By Angie Brown, BBC Scotland Edinburgh reporter The noxious ooze now covering Edinburgh's city centre streets from leaking bins full of rotting mountains of rubbish is quite startling. Not only is it now quite hard to dodge these massive middens, as the Scots call them, but it is almost impossible to avoid walking through the rivulets of slime washing over our pavements in Auld Reekie. I tasted the nastiness of this when I mistakenly touched my bike wheel and caught a whiff of the worst smell on my hands that I had ever encountered. In the first few days of the strike, litter was swirling around in our narrow cobbled streets in the Old Town and I remember being quite horrified when the inside of a brown-smeared vegetarian haggis packet slapped me in the face. Now all that rubbish is stuck to the ground - trampled and glued to the pavements by I don't know what - causing a layer of detritus you might expect from the days, hundreds of years ago, when Edinburgh folk threw their rubbish out of their tenement windows shouting ""gardyloo"". Cosla said its offer was at the ""absolute extremes"" of affordability. Resources spokesperson Katie Hagmann said: ""This is already an offer which is stretching our already stretched finance like never before. ""We have done everything we possibly can to get to this stage and that this offer - which is still on the table - is as good as it gets."" The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay increase for staff and had urged both sides to seek a ""fair resolution"" to the dispute. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said it was offering a further Â£200m over two years to provide a cost of living payment to workers earning below Â£39,000. He said this additional payment would mean workers on a Â£20,000 salary would receive a Â£2,000 increase pay - equivalent to 10%. Mr Swinney said: ""Intensive discussions between the trades unions and COSLA over recent days has led to a revised pay offer being made. ""No deal is perfect and I wish we could go further but this deal does offer significant increases for those on low pay.

The 140,000 households which have kerbside pickups in the city have landfill waste and dry recycling waste collected on alternate weeks. The city council confirmed only one type of rubbish would be picked up per household. However, additional resources will be deployed to support the clean up when the strike ends in the capital on Tuesday. Council leader Cammy Day said: ""This dispute has brought the value of our waste and cleansing teams - and their right to fair wage - into sharp focus and I'm delighted they'll be back out from Tuesday, helping to return our city to its best."" He asked residents to store their waste ""little longer"" while refuse workers catch up with the backlog. Residents are being asked to put their bins out as normal on their scheduled collection day, when extra waste will be collected if it is bagged. The strikes have led to huge piles of waste building up in Edinburgh Environment convenor Scott Arthur said while he had been ""ashamed"" of some of the images of the capital over the past week said he supported waste collection workers and believed they deserved a pay rise. Public Health Scotland has warned of a human health risk from overflowing waste, and advised councils to decontaminate areas where bins have overflowed. Professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh Linda Bauld told BBC Scotland their concerns included pests and vermin that are attracted to waste, bacteria, and the effects on surface water. ""There certainly could be an opportunity for germs and bacteria to spread if we don't sort this out,"" she said. She warned people not to touch the waste. ""I know people are trying to still shove things in the bins if there is a bit of space - don't do that and if you do please use a hand sanitiser or wash your hands,"" Prof Bauld added.

"Pubs across the UK will be forced to close due to energy costs soaring by as much as 300%, brewery bosses have said. Leaders of six of the country's largest breweries have called for ""immediate government intervention"" on sky-high energy bills this winter. The landlord of one pub in Essex told the BBC that his energy costs had risen from about Â£13,000 a year to Â£35,000. Pub owners said the energy crisis would cause ""real and serious irreversible"" damage to the industry without support. In an open letter to the government, six pub and brewing groups - JW Lees, Carlsberg Marston's, Admiral Taverns, Drake & Morgan, Greene King and St Austell Brewery - called for urgent intervention, including a support package and a cap on the price of energy for businesses. Rocketing energy bills come at a time when the number of pubs in England and Wales is falling,hitting the lowest level on record - 39,970 in June, according to analysis. Energy bills could break firms, warns ex-chancellor Simon Cleary, who runs the Plough in Great Chesterford, Essex, said his gas and electricity bills had nearly tripled to Â£35,000 a year. It means the pub now needs to generate a further Â£1,800 in takings per week to cover the costs. ""It really is that bad,"" he told the BBC. ""I think it's going to be really tough unless there is intervention from the government."" Landlord Simon Cleary needs to take another Â£1,800 each week to afford the bill hikes Mr Cleary said heating the pub in the winter made up the majority of his gas bill, with about 20% used for cooking food. In a bid to try to reduce his electricity bill, the landlord has fitted LED bulbs. However, there is only so much energy he can save because fridges, freezers and the cooling system for the cellar need to be on all the time. ""You cannot turn your cellar cooling off, you need it on even in the winter."" He added: ""Many pubs are very older buildings, few pubs have got cavity wall insulation. This pub was built in 1780. Back in those days nobody was thinking about conserving energy."" Chris Jowsey, boss of Admiral Taverns which has 1,600 pubs, said his tenanted pubs now pay more in energy bills than they do in rent. He told the BBC that one of his tenants told him he was leaving after 20 years due to his electricity bill going up 450% - an increase so large he couldn't pass it on to pub customers. Mr Jowsey said Admiral was investing in energy-saving equipment for pub cellars and to control how much energy fridges use. He also said the company was ""looking very closely at a scheme to try and buy energy in bulk and to allow licensees to make use of our own scale"". But he said: ""Even when we went to the energy market in recent months, no-one was initially willing to supply even us, never mind an individual licensee and their pub. ""So we're trying to do everything we can,"" said Mr Jowsey. ""But frankly, this is of such a scale that even we can't support this on our own, we desperately need government intervention to help because actually the market is broken."" The Department for Business, Energy and Industry said ""no government"" would be able to control the ""global factors pushing up the price of energy and other business costs"". ""But we will continue to support the hospitality sector in navigating the months ahead,"" a spokesman added. The government said it was providing a ""50% business rates relief for businesses across the UK, freezing alcohol duty rates on beer, cider, wine and spirits and reducing employer national insurance"". Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, warned the rise in energy bills would cause more damage to the industry than the pandemic did if it didn't receive support in the next few weeks. The government has previously said no new policies will be announced until the new prime minister is announced on 5 September. But Mr Jowsey said: ""I find it incredible that we have to wait for one person to get elected before we actually get some decisions and some policy which will protect not just jobs, not just people's livelihoods, but also their homes - because remember most people that run pubs in this country actually live above the shop."" Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's shadow business secretary, said businesses couldn't ""afford another day of this zombie government"", saying his party would bring down costs for small firms by cutting business rates. Nick Mackenzie, the boss of Greene King - one of the UK's largest pub groups with over 3,100 pubs - said the company could face ""the prospect of pubs being unable to pay their bills, jobs being lost and beloved locals across the country forced to close their doors"". He added that would mean all the support given to pubs through the pandemic to stay in businesses ""could be wasted"". Meanwhile, William Lees Jones, of JW Lees, said the government needed to extend the energy cap to business as well as households. He said with more fixed-price contracts coming up for renewal the ""time to act is now"". On Friday, the energy regulator Ofgem, which sets the price cap on household bills, said it would rise by 80% in October. But unlike households, businesses aren't covered by a regulated energy price cap, meaning bills are even higher. Aside from bills, breweries also highlighted a possible shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2) which is used in the production of beer. CF Industries, the UK's largest CO2 producer, recently announced that it would temporarily stop production at one of its plants because rising energy prices made it too expensive to continue.
