"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""We lost the public's trust in the Labour Party as a force for good"" Candidates hoping to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader have questioned the party's manifesto choices while opening up dividing lines on Brexit. Sir Keir Starmer said its election offer was ""over-loaded"" while both Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips said voters did not trust its free broadband pledge. Ms Phillips also said she would not rule out rejoining the EU if Brexit turned out not to be a success. She said she would not change her view that the UK was ""better off"" in the EU. Sir Keir and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry - both strong supporters of another referendum before the election - said Labour's focus as an opposition should now be on ensuring Boris Johnson negotiated the best economic and trade partnership with the EU. Five candidates, also including Clive Lewis, have so far entered the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Who will be Labour's next leader? Labour contest timings could be crucial Keir Starmer enters Labour leadership contest Labour's ruling body is due to meet on Monday to decide the timetable for the election. Would-be candidates have to be nominated by more than 20 MPs and must also get the backing of at least 5% of constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey is also expected to officially declare her candidacy in the coming days. The contest was called after Mr Corbyn announced he would stand down as leader after Labour's heavy election defeat. Both Sir Keir and Ms Phillips told the BBC's Andrew Marr the party must learn the lessons of the defeat and why some many previously rock-solid Labour seats in the Midlands and the North of England turned to the Conservatives. This video can not be played Jess Phillips: ""The country didn't trust us to govern"" Sir Keir said the manifesto was one of a number of ""cumulative"" factors  that eroded trust, on top of concerns over the party's Brexit policy, its leadership and its record on tackling anti-Semitism. ""There was a general feeling the manifesto was over-loaded. We lost the public's trust in the Labour Party as a force for good and a force for change,"" he said. ""After four general election losses we have to address that straight away."" But he warned Labour against ""unpicking"" the last manifesto when it should be focused on its offer to voters in five years time. He also said it would be wrong to ""retreat"" from Mr Corbyn's focus on reducing inequality and protecting the public services. While not the sole reason for its defeat, Ms Phillips also identified the manifesto - which pledged to bring rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership and extend the role of the state into new areas - as one of Labour's weak points. ""The fundamental thing is that the country did not trust us to govern,"" she said. ""They did not trust to deliver on the things we were saying."" Rebecca Long-Bailey is expected to join the race While there was a strong case for nationalising the railways and ending private involvement in the prison and probation services, she suggested tackling deep-seated social problems, such as homelessness and social care, were more important than public control of key utilities. ""We lost them on some of the basics. My son does not go to school five days a week. Lots of people in the country can give you their own example. While that was the case, offering free broadband was just not believable."" Lisa Nandy joins Labour leadership race Jess Phillips joins Labour leadership race Thornberry enters Labour leadership race Clive Lewis joins Labour leadership race The Birmingham Yardley MP said the party must stop obsessing with factionalism and internal positioning and speak honestly to people. ""People have to feel a connection with us again. People have to feel we are on their side."" Ms Nandy also distanced herself from the broadband pledge, telling BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics: ""People said to us, 'It's all very well promising free broadband but can you sort out the buses?' and that was the more pressing issue in their lives. It's not about whether you're radical or not it's about whether you're relevant."" Ms Thornberry said Labour had been wrong to allow the Conservatives to fight the election on the ""single issue"" of Brexit. She told Sky News that the opposition's focus should now be on ensuring the UK had a relationship with Europe in the coming years that's ""going to work for jobs and the economy"". Sir Keir, who like Ms Thornberry was a supporter of another referendum, suggested the issue of EU membership was now closed and the party needed to move on from an argument between Remain and Leave. Asked whether she would support, as leader, the UK going back into the EU, Ms Phillips said it was sensible to ""wait and see"". ""If we are living in an absolute paradise of trade and totally safe in the world...then maybe I will be proven wrong. But if the reality is if if our country is safer and more economically viable to be in the EU, I will fight for that regardless of how difficult that argument is to make."" The candidates have also been pressed on the UK's relationship with the US following the killing of Iran's top military leader, Qasem Soleimani, in Iraq. Ms Phillips said people were ""not shedding any tears"" over the Iranian general's death and, while she opposed the Iraq War, she would always support the deployment of British forces abroad if there was a ""moral case"" for it. ""What we have to make sure is that when we take action, it is lawful, proportionate and there is a moral case for it. If those questions can be answered, then I would absolutely take action to protect British lives."" However, Sir Keir said the UK should never find itself in the position of ""blindly following the Americans"". If he became prime minister, he said he would pass legislation to circumscribe the ability of governments to take military action. He suggested it would have to pass three tests - if it was lawful, had been supported by Parliament and was part of a viable plan. Who will be Labour's next leader?

"The 77th Golden Globe Awards take place in Los Angeles, California on Sunday evening. The awards, which celebrate excellence in film and television, are dished out on behalf of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) - who'll be hoping to set the agenda once again ahead of next month's Oscars (they're right about that roughly half the time). And despite it being #DryJanuary for some, many Tinseltown stars have traditionally been known to enjoy a drink or three on the night, making for interesting viewing. But if you don't have an invitation (or even a tuxedo) then don't worry, as we're about to tell you what you need to know. ""Yeah, he drinks"" - Ricky Gervais first hosted the Golden Globe Awards in 2010 Ricky Gervais is back to present the Golden Globes for the fifth time this year. He says this will be his ""very last"" time fronting it, though we'd take that assertion with a shovel of salt as he's said it before. The English comedian, actor and writer has entertained and offended in equal measure on his previous four outings since 2010. The 58-year-oldtold The Hollywood Reporter,externalthat once US broadcaster NBC asked him to host again, he thought ""that's Christmas ruined"", as he had to start work right away on scripting his best put-downs. ""People think that I'd go out there and I'd get drunk and say off-the-cuff [things],"" he said. ""I don't. I write jokes."" The Office and After Life creator admitted it's fun to poke fun at some of the ""privileged egos in the room"" on behalf of the millions of people watching at home, but that he's ever more conscious of making sure his jokes are ""bulletproof"". ""Nowadays, you've got to make sure they're bulletproof in 10 years' time, with people going through saying: 'He said this once, 10 years [ago]'.Kevin Hart [lost] his job[as Oscars host] for 10-year-old tweets that he said he was sorry about and deleted at the time."" (Left to right) Guest award presenters and nominees Margot Robbie, Rami Malek and Scarlett Johansson On Thursday, the Golden Globes announced a raft of celebrities who will hand out individual awards on the night, including nominees Margot Robbie, Rami Malek, Scarlett Johansson, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Charlize Theron and Daniel Craig. They'll all be praying for kinder introductions from Gervais than the likes of Mel Gibson, Johnny Depp and Matt Damon have endured in previous years (gulp!). Harvey Keitel, Chris Evans, Glenn Close, Reese Witherspoon and previous host Amy Poehler would be wise to have something witty up their sleeves too, as well as Salma Hayek, Will Ferrell, Dakota Fanning, Tiffany Haddish and Pierce Brosnan. Let's hope none of the above have just vowed to take themselves more seriously as their New Year's resolution. This video can not be played With 27 nominations, it's a strong year for British talent A lot of the focus this year will be on the many British stars who have taken US screens by storm, receiving a combined 27 nominations. Olivia Colman's regal performance in The Crown, Dame Helen Mirren's Catherine the Great and Jodie Comer being dead-set on Killing Eve sees them all listed in the acting categories, alongside Fleabag star and creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The darkly comic show, which recentlyreturned to the West Endas its original one-woman stage show, is also nominated for best musical or comedy series. Kit Harrington is the ""loner Throner"", as he put it.  In other words the only member of Game of Thrones cast to be nominated this year, in the best drama actor category for his role as the longsuffering Jon Snow. Rocketman star Taron Egerton is going to be hi-i-igh as a kite (emotionally speaking) if he takes the best actor gong, in the musical or comedy section. The freshly-knighted Sir Sam Mendes, meanwhile, could pick up best director for his war film 1917. British stars nominated for Golden Globes Golden Globes: 2020 nominees in full Another interesting subplot to this year's awards is the emergence of streaming giants Netflix as an original creative force to be reckoned with, having 17 nods apiece in both the TV and film sections. Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese and Al Pacino join forces on the Netflix mobster movie, The Irishman Marriage Story, directed by Noah Baumbach, is the most nominated film all told, being up for six awards, while Martin Scorsese's similarly Netflix-backed epic, The Irishman, is up for five. Their Vatican drama, The Two Popes, has four nods too, while Eddie Murphy is the frontrunner to win best comedy actor for the blaxploitation biopic Dolomite Is My Name. All of which demonstrates that Netflix - who previously only really had the Oscar-winning Roma to show for their investment since 2015 - aren't messing about. Away from Netflix, Quentin Tarantino's movie Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is bound to interest plenty of the Hollywood types in the room and that has five nominations, including nods for stars Pitt and DiCaprio - who remarkably acted alongside each other for the first time. Joaquin Phoenix winning best drama actor for his portrayal of the pre-Batman Joker would almost certainly put a smile his face. This video can not be played Ronan, Pugh and Gerwig discuss Little Women in a separate interview with Radio 4 Today One thing we can be certain of already is that the award for best director will (once again) not be going to a woman. Since 2000, the awards show has nominated more than 100 men for the category, and only four women. Five men are nominated this year alone. Two years ago, when presenting the award, Natalie Portman delivered a pointed: ""Here are the all-male nominees"". HFPA president Lorenzo Soria recentlytold Variety,external: ""What happened is that we don't vote by gender. We vote by film and accomplishment."" With that in mind, the omission of Little Women filmmaker Greta Gerwig from the list was particularly notable this time around. ""There are so many beautiful films made by women this year,"" Gerwig told AFP last month, adding the overall low number of female-directed movies was ""dreadful"" for the industry. The food this year may look a little different from this in 2017 While #DryJanuary may well be ditched for the night, in a move that appears to have maddened some of the UK tabloids, the Golden Globes have decided to fully embrace #Veganuary. Guests on Sunday will be having a completely meat free plant-based Sunday dinner.Soria told The Associated Press,externalthe menu change was in order to raise awareness of climate change. ""If there's a way we can, not change the world, but save the planet, maybe we can get the Golden Globes to send a signal and draw attention to the issue about climate change,"" he declared.

"Ms Ballas said she had suffered ""quite a lot of bullying"" Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas had hate mail hand-delivered to a theatre in Darlington where she is appearing in pantomime. Ms Ballas condemned the ""cowardly"" act in a video post on Instagram in which she said the note contained ""not nice comments or words"". As well as several expletives, the note also said it was a ""sad day"" when she was made head judge on the BBC show. In November she told BBC Breakfast she had alsosuffered online abuse. Ms Ballas, who is starring in the Jack and the Beanstalk pantomime at the Darlington Hippodrome, said it was ""cowardly to just drop off at my place of work"" and that ""enough is enough now"". In the post, the 59-year-old said: ""As we know, I had quite a lot of bullying on Strictly this time, and my inbox on Instagram was full of horrific and horrendous messages, but this has gone a step further now. ""I've had a hand-delivered message which I'm going to share with you, hand-delivered to the Hippodrome, addressed to me, with not such nice comments or words. ""My message for young people, or anybody out there who receives awful messages or hate mail or things from people that don't know them, the issue is the other person's, it's not so much ours, even though I do find it quite upsetting when I've been out there performing, and then I read something like this from someone who doesn't even know me."" Shirley Ballas urged people ""not to be fazed"" by bullies She added: ""The message out there is to be strong going into 2020, really, really love yourself and don't be fazed by the bullies."" In November, Ms Ballas told BBC Breakfast: ""I've had more online bullying this time than I've had in any series of Strictly, particularly direct messaging, more so from the younger fans if their chosen one gets sent away. ""My concern is not so much for myself, it's for the younger people out there... if they do that kind of bullying online, what do they do in the workplace, what do they do at the school? So my concern is always for the younger generation."" Fellow Strictly judge Motsi Mabuse replied: ""Love you miss @shirleyballas there are always going to be sad people on this world! Lets us just ignore the negative!!! Happy new year miss you!!"" Strictly Come Dancing host Claudia Winkleman added: ""We love you xxxx."" Ms Ballas, who is performing as Mother Nature in the panto for the last time on Sunday, became the head judge on Strictly after Len Goodman's departure.

"Hong Kong airport is health screening passengers arriving from Wuhan A mysterious viral pneumonia that has infected dozens in central China is not Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), health chiefs have said. They also discounted bird flu and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and said investigations were continuing. A total of 59 cases have been reported in the city of Wuhan, seven of which are considered critical. The outbreak prompted Singapore and Hong Kong to bring in screening processes for travellers from the city. An epidemic of the potentially deadly, flu-like Sars virus killed more than 700 people around the world in 2002-03, after originating in China. Mystery virus probed in Wuhan The people who risked their lives to stop the virus In a statement posted on its website late on Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 163 people who had had contact with those infected had been placed under medical observation. It said efforts were continuing to identify the virus and its source. The commission said previously that there had been no human-to-human transmission of the illness. It added that a number of those infected worked at a seafood market in the city, leading authorities to sanitise the area. The outbreak occurred in the city of Wuhan Singapore and Hong Kong have both set up systems to check travellers arriving from Wuhan for possible fever. Hong Kong has admitted 16 travellers with pneumonia-like symptoms to hospital, the South China Morning Post reported, but none have so far been found to have the unidentified strain. Singapore has had one suspicious case, it added. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is aware of the outbreak and is in contact with the Chinese government. ""There are many potential causes of viral pneumonia, many of which are more common than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronovirus,"" a spokesman said last week.

"Georges Duboeuf applied traditional methods of winemaking to his craft Georges Duboeuf, one of the great wine merchants of the 20th Century, has died at the age of 86. He was best known for turning the release of a little-known French product - a red wine called Beaujolais Nouveau - into a global phenomenon. By the 1980s, Mr Duboeuf's enthusiastic promotion of the wine had led to its annual release date being known across the world as Beaujolais Nouveau Day. It also earned him the nickname ""the Pope of Beaujolais"". Mr Duboeuf died of a stroke at about 18:00 (17:00 GMT) on Saturday at his home in the eastern village of RomanÃ¨che-Thorins, his daughter-in-law Anne told AFP news agency. The natural wine making space for wildlife Why red wine can be good for you - in moderation What makes a bottle of wine worth thousands of pounds? In the 1950s Mr Duboeuf set up L'Ãcrin MÃ¢connais-Beaujolais, an association of wine producers, to help promote local wines. Through the association, he developed strong relationships with traders and restaurateurs across the region. He then opened his own winery, Georges Duboeuf Wines, in 1964. He applied traditional methods of winemaking to his craft, including rigorous monitoring of the wine and an apparently almost clinical dedication to hygiene. The winery later grew to other regions, and in 1993 Mr Duboeuf set up a shop and museum of winemaking in RomanÃ¨che-Thorins. But it was his tireless promotion of Beaujolais Nouveau in particular that set Mr Duboeuf apart. Duboeuf, pictured in RomanÃ¨che-Thorins in 2010, was a tireless ambassador for Beaujolais Nouveau Throughout the 1980s he held Beaujolais Nouveau festivals which were attended by celebrities of all kinds, including Michelin-starred restaurateurs. By the time he passed the company on to his son Franck in 2018, the company was producing about 30 million bottles a year that were sold internationally. Dominique Piron, president of the Inter Beaujolais company, said Mr Duboeuf was responsible for ""raising the Beaujolais flag all over the world"". ""He had a nose, an intuition, [he was] a step ahead of everyone,"" he said. The natural wine making space for wildlife.

"New rules are to be introduced to ensure all new homes built in Scotland use renewable or low-carbon heating. The regulations, being introduced by the Scottish government from 2024, are part of plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable and low-carbon systems will also be phased in for new non-domestic buildings from 2024. Low-carbon heating is often used to refer to systems that use heat pumps or other alternatives to gas boilers. What do you know about saving energy at home? Central heating boilers 'put climate change goals at risk' The project will run alongside a Â£30m investment in renewable heat projects. Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said the change was part of Scotland's plans to tackle climate change and reach a ""net zero"" emissions target by 2045. To achieve net zero, emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 will have to be avoided completely or offset by initiatives such as tree planting which can soak up CO2 from the atmosphere. Low carbon heating is often used to refer to heat pump systems or alternatives to gas boilers Mr Wheelhouse added: ""It's becoming increasingly clear that the pace of decarbonising Scotland's domestic and non-domestic buildings has to increase significantly to achieve those aims, and emissions from our buildings will have to fall close to zero.

"Ms Ballas said she had suffered ""quite a lot of bullying"" Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas had hate mail hand-delivered to a theatre in Darlington where she is appearing in pantomime. Ms Ballas condemned the ""cowardly"" act in a video post on Instagram in which she said the note contained ""not nice comments or words"". As well as several expletives, the note also said it was a ""sad day"" when she was made head judge on the BBC show. In November she told BBC Breakfast she had alsosuffered online abuse. Ms Ballas, who is starring in the Jack and the Beanstalk pantomime at the Darlington Hippodrome, said it was ""cowardly to just drop off at my place of work"" and that ""enough is enough now"". In the post, the 59-year-old said: ""As we know, I had quite a lot of bullying on Strictly this time, and my inbox on Instagram was full of horrific and horrendous messages, but this has gone a step further now. ""I've had a hand-delivered message which I'm going to share with you, hand-delivered to the Hippodrome, addressed to me, with not such nice comments or words. ""My message for young people, or anybody out there who receives awful messages or hate mail or things from people that don't know them, the issue is the other person's, it's not so much ours, even though I do find it quite upsetting when I've been out there performing, and then I read something like this from someone who doesn't even know me."" Shirley Ballas urged people ""not to be fazed"" by bullies She added: ""The message out there is to be strong going into 2020, really, really love yourself and don't be fazed by the bullies."" In November, Ms Ballas told BBC Breakfast: ""I've had more online bullying this time than I've had in any series of Strictly, particularly direct messaging, more so from the younger fans if their chosen one gets sent away. ""My concern is not so much for myself, it's for the younger people out there... if they do that kind of bullying online, what do they do in the workplace, what do they do at the school? So my concern is always for the younger generation."" Fellow Strictly judge Motsi Mabuse replied: ""Love you miss @shirleyballas there are always going to be sad people on this world! Lets us just ignore the negative!!! Happy new year miss you!!"" Strictly Come Dancing host Claudia Winkleman added: ""We love you xxxx."" Ms Ballas, who is performing as Mother Nature in the panto for the last time on Sunday, became the head judge on Strictly after Len Goodman's departure.

"New rules are to be introduced to ensure all new homes built in Scotland use renewable or low-carbon heating. The regulations, being introduced by the Scottish government from 2024, are part of plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable and low-carbon systems will also be phased in for new non-domestic buildings from 2024. Low-carbon heating is often used to refer to systems that use heat pumps or other alternatives to gas boilers. What do you know about saving energy at home? Central heating boilers 'put climate change goals at risk' The project will run alongside a Â£30m investment in renewable heat projects. Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said the change was part of Scotland's plans to tackle climate change and reach a ""net zero"" emissions target by 2045. To achieve net zero, emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 will have to be avoided completely or offset by initiatives such as tree planting which can soak up CO2 from the atmosphere. Low carbon heating is often used to refer to heat pump systems or alternatives to gas boilers Mr Wheelhouse added: ""It's becoming increasingly clear that the pace of decarbonising Scotland's domestic and non-domestic buildings has to increase significantly to achieve those aims, and emissions from our buildings will have to fall close to zero. ""We will ensure that new homes and buildings across Scotland meet the challenge of the climate emergency, combining the action we need to take on climate change with our ambition to provide affordable, warm homes.""

"Boris Johnson has said ""we will not lament"" the death of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, describing him as ""a threat to all our interests"". But the prime minister called for ""de-escalation from all sides"" following thekilling in a US airstrike in Iraq on Friday. Mr Johnson's intervention came asIraqi MPs called for foreign troops to leave. And in a separate joint statement, Mr Johnson and his French and German counterparts urged restraint. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel joined the PM in calling on Iran to refrain from further violent action and proliferation. ""The current cycle of violence in Iraq must be stopped,"" the joint statement, released late on Sunday night, said. With tensions rising in the region following the drone strike ordered by US President Donald Trump, Iran has responded by vowing revenge andannouncing it will no longer abide by the restrictions in its 2015 nuclear deal. In the statement, the three leaders urged the country to ""reverse all measures inconsistent with"" the deal. Why kill Soleimani now and what happens next? Who was Iran's Qasem Soleimani? Your questions: Will Soleimani killing spark war? Meanwhile, Mr Johnson is preparing to assemble key ministers to discuss the spiralling crisis in the Middle East. The prime minister said he spoke with Mr Trump on Sunday about the assassination of the Iranian general, who spearheaded the country's military operations in the Middle East as head of the elite Quds Force. Earlier on Sunday, in his first public statement since Soleimani's death, Mr Johnson said the 62-year-old had been ""responsible for a pattern of disruptive, destabilising behaviour in the region"". ""Given the leading role he has played in actions that have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians and western personnel, we will not lament his death,"" Mr Johnson said. ""It is clear, however, that all calls for retaliation or reprisals will simply lead to more violence in the region and they are in no one's interest."" Mr Johnson said the UK was in ""close contact"" with all sides to encourage de-escalation and said Parliament will be updated when it returns on Tuesday. Mr Johnson accused Soleimani of ""destabilising"" the region Iraqi MPs have responded to the drone strike by passing a non-binding resolution calling for an end to the foreign military presence. Caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi spoke in favour of US and other foreign forces leaving, although most Sunni and Kurdish MPs boycotted the vote. About 400 British troops are stationed in Iraq, while the US has 5,200. A UK government spokesman said that coalition forces were in Iraq to protect its people and others from the Islamic State group. ""We urge the Iraqi government to ensure the coalition is able to continue our vital work countering this shared threat,"" he said. Meanwhile, HMS Montrose and HMS Defender are to start accompanying UK-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf, where a tanker was seized by Iran last July. This video can not be played Dominic Raab says he found out about the Soleimani killing ""as it happened"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that he learned of the US attack on Soleimani ""as it happened"", spoke to the Iraqi prime minister on Sunday morning. Mr Raab defended the killing because of the US's ""right to self-defence"" against Soleimani's use of militia's to destabilise the region and attack Western forces. He also defended Mr Johnson for being on holiday as the crisis unfolded, saying that he had been ""in constant contact with the prime minister over the Christmas break on a whole range of foreign policy issues"".

"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (R) had threatened to restart enrichment if sanctions continued Iran has declared that it will no longer abide by any of the restrictions imposed by the 2015 nuclear deal. In a statement, it said it would no longer observe limitations on its capacity for enrichment, the level of enrichment, the stock of enriched material, or research and development. The announcement followed a meeting of the Iranian cabinet in Tehran. Tensions have been high over the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani by the US in Baghdad. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Why do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter? How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard Reports from Baghdad say the US embassy compound there was targeted in an attack on Sunday evening. A source told the BBC that four rounds of ""indirect fire "" had been launched in the direction of the embassy. There were no reports of casualties. Hundreds of thousands turned out in Iran on Sunday to give Soleimani a hero's welcomeahead of his funeral on Tuesday. Earlier,Iraqi MPs had passed a non-binding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave the countryafter the general's killing in a drone strike at Baghdad airport on Friday. Who was Qasem Soleimani? Jeremy Bowen on Iran's options for response How strong is Iran's military? About 5,000 US soldiers are in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State (IS) group. The coalition paused operations against IS in Iraq just before Sunday's vote. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened that the US will strike back at Iran in the event of retaliation for Soleimani's death, and said it could do so ""perhaps in a disproportionate manner"".

The 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, on life support ever since the Trump administration abandoned it in May 2018, may now be in its final death throes. Donald Trump, throughout his presidential campaign and then as president, has never failed to rail against what he calls his predecessor President Barack Obama's ""bad deal"".  But all its other signatories - the UK, France, Russia, China, Germany and the EU - believe that it still has merit. The agreement, known as the JCPOA, constrained Iran's nuclear programme for a set period in a largely verifiable way. But its greatest significance - even more so given the current crisis - is that it helped to avert an imminent war. Before it was signed, there was mounting concern about Tehran's nuclear activities and every chance that Israel (or possibly Israel and the US in tandem) might attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Since the US withdrawal, Iran has successively breached key constraints of the JCPOA. Now it appears to be throwing these constraints out altogether. What matters now is what precisely it decides to do. Will it up its level of uranium enrichment, for example, to 20%? This would reduce significantly the time it would take Tehran to obtain suitable material for a bomb. Will it continue to abide by enhanced international inspection measures? We are now at the destination the Trump administration clearly hoped for in May 2018. But the major powers, while deeply unhappy about Iran's breaches of the deal, are also shocked at the controversial decision by Mr Trump to kill the head of Iran's Quds Force, a decision that has again brought the US and Iran to the brink of war. Under the 2015 accord, Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions. US President Donald Trump abandoned it in 2018, saying he wanted to force Iran to negotiate a new deal that would place indefinite curbs on its nuclear programme and also halt its development of ballistic missiles. Iran refused, and had since been gradually rolling back its commitments under the agreement. It had been expected to announce its latest stance on the agreement this weekend, before news of Soleimani's death. This video can not be played 'Nothing off limits for US' Hezbollah warns US Iranian state media announced on Sunday that the country will no longer respect any limits laid down in the 2015 deal. ""Iran will continue its nuclear enrichment with no limitations and based on its technical needs,"" a statement said. However, the statement did not say that Iran was actually withdrawing from the agreement and it added that the country would continue to co-operate with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. Iran, it said, was ready to return to its commitments once it enjoyed the benefits of the agreement. Correspondents say this is a reference to its inability to sell oil and have access to its income under US sanctions. The country has always insisted that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful - but suspicions that it was being used to develop a bomb covertly prompted the UN Security Council, US and EU to impose crippling sanctions in 2010. The 2015 deal was designed to constrain the programme in a verifiable way in return for sanctions relief. Iran nuclear deal: Key details It restricted Iran's enrichment of uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, to 3.67%. Iran was also required to redesign a heavy-water reactor being built, whose spent fuel would contain plutonium suitable for a bomb, and allow international inspections. Before July 2015, Iran had a large stockpile of enriched uranium and almost 20,000 centrifuges, enough to create eight to 10 bombs, according to the White House at the time. US experts estimated back then that if Iran had decided to rush to make a bomb, it would take two to three months until it had enough 90%-enriched uranium to build a nuclear weapon - the so-called ""breakout time"". Iran's current ""breakout time"", should it attempt to build a nuclear bomb, is estimated to be around a year, but this could be reduced to half a year or even a matter of months if enrichment levels are increased to 20%, for example. The other parties to the 2015 deal - the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - tried to keep the agreement alive after the US withdrew in 2018. Late on Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British PM Boris Johnson released a joint statement urging Iran to drop measures that go against the deal. ""We are ready to continue talks with all parties in order to contribute to de-escalating tensions and re-establishing stability in the region,"" they said. Earlier on SundayMr Johnson said ""we will not lament"" the death of Soleimani, describing him as ""a threat to all our interests"". EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has invited Iran's Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to visit Brussels to discuss both the nuclear deal and how to defuse the crisis over the Soleimani assassination.

"The government's Troubled Families project is getting Â£165m in funding to ensure it continues for another year. Launched by David Cameron in 2012, the scheme targets families with multiple and complex social and health issues. Existing support for the project was due to run out later this year, prompting speculation about its future. But Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it had proved a success in transforming lives and relieving the burden on public services. The programme was set up by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition governmentin response to the 2011 riots in English cities, at a cost of Â£448m. It was revamped in 2015, with the aim of helping 400,000 families by 2020. About Â£920m has been spent since then, averaging about Â£157.6m, a year, with councils being paid on the basis of their results in helping the most vulnerable families. Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, said the government announcement was ""welcome"" but needed to be followed by ""long term and extended funding commitments"" in this year's spending review. Writing on Twitter,,externalshe highlighted the ""vital"" role children's centres and so-called family hubs played in the initiative. Under the project, local authorities identify and support families in England with multiple problems, including domestic abuse, unemployment, mental health problems and truancy. Some big lessons from Troubled Families IDS's issues with Troubled Families scheme How one night in the riots changed my life Central government funds local authorities to work with these families on a payment-by-performance basis. In 2016,a report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchconcluded that the initiative had had no measurable effect on school attendance, employment or behaviour. And former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith suggested last year that the scheme had become a high-profile ""distraction"" and some of its targets were ""slightly nebulous"". But ministerssaid an evaluation published last April,externaldemonstrated that the programme had reduced the proportion of children going into care by a third, reduced the proportion of adults going to prison by a quarter and had cut the number of adults claiming Jobseeker's Allowance. Their latest analysis suggests 297,733 families have ""made improvements"" with the problems that led to them joining the programme since 2015. In 26,848 of these families, one or more adults has moved off benefits and into work. The scheme was set up in the wake of the 2011 riots in England The Treasury indicated in September's Spending Review that the programme would be extended, although ministers have yet to commit to its long-term future. Mr Jenrick said the new funding would be used to help families with inter-connected problems, including unemployment, poorâ¯school attendance, mental health issues, anti-social behaviour and domestic abuse. ""The programme will help more people in need get access to the early, practical and coordinated support to transform their lives for the better,"" he said. ""This is the right thing to do for families and for society as a whole, and these reforms will reduce the demand and dependency on costly, reactive key public services."" In their election manifesto, the Conservatives promised to develop ""family hubs"" to give vulnerable families intensive, integrated support to help care for their children, both in the early years and through to adulthood. Mr Jenrick's predecessor, James Brokenshire, suggested last year that the Troubled Families project could potentially be renamed to ensure it is not ""getting in the way of the positive objectives"". The Department for Communities said any future changes would be considered and announced in due course.

"Tata Steel runs the UK's largest steel works in Port Talbot The chairman of the Tata group has said the company ""can't have a situation where India keeps funding losses"" at its Port Talbot steelworks. Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of theTata Sons group,externalwhich owns the steelworks in Port Talbot, said the plant needed to be ""self-sustaining"" in an interview with theSunday Times,external. Tata Steel's pre-tax losses were Â£371m last year, up from Â£222m in 2017-18. The Unite union said the claims added ""more pressure"" on workers. ""Everyone will tell you that the Tatas have gone way beyond to keep this going,"" said Mr Chandrasekaran. ""Anybody else would have walked away. ""I don't want to make those tall statements [about commitment]. We are taking some hard calls. So, hopefully, we should see some results."" Union's plan to save Tata's Orb steelworks Why is Port Talbot steel important? How important is steel to our economy? In November, Tata announced plans tocut 3,000 jobs across Europe. Welsh Economy MinisterKen Skates said it ""appears to be the case"" that about 1,000 of thosecould be in Wales. Tata has two large steelworks in Europe - Port Talbot, and one near Ijmuiden in the Netherlands, about 18 miles (30km) north-west of Amsterdam. Just under half of Tata's 8,385-strong UK workforce are based in Port Talbot. This video can not be played What is the future for the UK steel industry? A new Â£50m blast furnace was opened in Port Talbot in January 2019, after which Hans Fischer, chief executive of Tata Steel's European operations, said: ""We are committed to build on our future for the UK."" Steel industry analyst Dr Kathryn Ringwald Wildman said she was ""surprised"" at the way Mr Chandrasekaran made his comments, but not the nature of them. ""The problem is there are no market implications to suggest that things are going to get any better in the short term. ""The price of steel is still relatively low, demand is still very low, the industry is over capacity and the costs to the industry are still relatively high. ""The growth there is in the market is going to be in China rather than in Europe. ""I think it's now becoming clear that Tata can't afford these losses the way they are now. It can't go on, no company can sustain those losses - it's Â£1m per day."" In June, a planned merger between Tata and German steelmakerThyssenkrupp was blocked by the European Commission,externalover competition concerns. Port Talbot employs 4,000 workers - nearly half of Tata's UK workforce Paul Evans, the Unite union's regional officer for Wales, said: ""This interview just adds more pressure on the Tata workers at Port Talbot. The site is obviously key to the future of the other Tata plants in Wales. ""The workforce at Port Talbot have for many years proved they are the producers of world class quality steel and Wales and the UK can't afford to lose the expertise and commitment they have shown over the years."" A spokesman for Tata Steel's European operations said: ""What our chairman said in the interview has already been communicated to colleagues through our transformation programme. ""That programme is about building a stronger and more sustainable European steel business by improving profitability so we can pay for investments necessary to secure our long-term future. ""The plans include productivity improvements, reduced bureaucracy and increased sales of higher-value steels, as well as employment cost savings."" The Welsh Government said it had ""shown its strong commitment over the last few years to working with Tata and steel unions to secure a long-term future for steel making in Port Talbot and across Wales and we will go on doing that in the future"".

Some big lessons from Troubled Families IDS's issues with Troubled Families scheme How one night in the riots changed my life Central government funds local authorities to work with these families on a payment-by-performance basis. In 2016,a report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchconcluded that the initiative had had no measurable effect on school attendance, employment or behaviour. And former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith suggested last year that the scheme had become a high-profile ""distraction"" and some of its targets were ""slightly nebulous"". But ministerssaid an evaluation published last April,externaldemonstrated that the programme had reduced the proportion of children going into care by a third, reduced the proportion of adults going to prison by a quarter and had cut the number of adults claiming Jobseeker's Allowance. Their latest analysis suggests 297,733 families have ""made improvements"" with the problems that led to them joining the programme since 2015. In 26,848 of these families, one or more adults has moved off benefits and into work. The scheme was set up in the wake of the 2011 riots in England The Treasury indicated in September's Spending Review that the programme would be extended, although ministers have yet to commit to its long-term future. Mr Jenrick said the new funding would be used to help families with inter-connected problems, including unemployment, poorâ¯school attendance, mental health issues, anti-social behaviour and domestic abuse. ""The programme will help more people in need get access to the early, practical and coordinated support to transform their lives for the better,"" he said. ""This is the right thing to do for families and for society as a whole, and these reforms will reduce the demand and dependency on costly, reactive key public services."" In their election manifesto, the Conservatives promised to develop ""family hubs"" to give vulnerable families intensive, integrated support to help care for their children, both in the early years and through to adulthood. Mr Jenrick's predecessor, James Brokenshire, suggested last year that the Troubled Families project could potentially be renamed to ensure it is not ""getting in the way of the positive objectives"". The Department for Communities said any future changes would be considered and announced in due course.

"Some trains would be 400m (1,300ft) long with as many as 1,100 seats There is ""overwhelming evidence"" that the costs of HS2 are ""out of control"" and its benefits overstated, the deputy chair of its review panel has said. Lord Berkeley said the high-speed rail line, linking London and northern England, is likely to cost over Â£108bn. A vocal critic of HS2, the Labour peer said he believed MPs had been ""misled"" about the price - set at Â£55bn in 2015. He has published a ""dissenting report"" on the project, but the government said it represented his personal view. And a coalition of northern political leaders and businesses has also rejected Lord Berkeley's criticism of the project. ""We need HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail delivered together, in full,"" said the leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese, part of the Connecting Britain campaign. Trains are due to start running on HS2 between London and Birmingham in 2029. However, Lord Berkeley says there is little prospect of that before 2031, and warns high-speed trains will not reach Manchester and Leeds until 2040. He told the BBC that spending money on improving rail services in the north of England was far more important. ""That's where the really bad quality railways are,"" Lord Berkeley said, adding that a complete upgrade ""could probably be done at half the cost of HS2"". Review says HS2 should happen despite rising cost HS2 review criticised by deputy chair of panel How much will the rail scheme cost? HS2 buys Â£1.25bn of property in London Lord Berkeley was the deputy chairman of the independent Oakervee Review in to HS2, set up by the government. However, he has withdrawn his backing from the review, which is expected to be published in the coming months. He says he disagrees with a draft version of its official report and as a result has published his own version. He said he and other members of the panel were prevented from contributing to the final draft of the government-commissioned report because the review was ""effectively terminated"" on 31 October. This video can not be played HS2: How much work has already been done? He also said the official report has been ""unduly influenced"" by HS2 promoters, and said both HS2 Ltd and the Department for Transport failed to co-operate with the review properly to substantiate their claims about the cost and benefits. HS2 Ltd denies this claim, saying it provided ""full co-operation"" with the review. His report concludes that ministers will either have to accept the higher cost of the line or only build part of the proposed high-speed rail network. This option, which would save the government Â£50bn, would also involve upgrading existing Network Rail lines in the Midlands and the north of England, he said. ""The aim must be to give these areas the same standard of commuting service as the south east, whilst, at the same time, improving the existing lines from London northwards,"" Lord Berkeley said in the report. He rejected suggestions that the increased costs were due to delays in the project, telling the BBC on Sunday: ""The real cause is [HS2] has been over-designed. You do not need to go 400kph in a country as small as ours... The higher the speed makes a big difference to the cost."" He added: ""People want a reliable, frequent service on which they can get a seat."" Anti-HS2 campaigners welcomed the report. ""The case for HS2 has always been poor, and is simply getting worse,"" said Penny Gaines, chair of Stop HS2. ""It is time for this white elephant of a project to be cancelled as quickly as possible."" And Greenpeace said that if the government was serious about climate change then it must listen to HS2's critics. ""The protection of ancient woodlands must be a priority for rail development,"" said John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK. However, HS2 Ltd, the company responsible for building the new line, says the economic case is strong and it is determined to deliver a railway that is good value for money. A spokesman said the high-speed line was ""critical"" for the UK's future low-carbon transport network, would increase rail capacity and was ""integral"" to improving the rail network in the Midlands and North of England. That view was backed by Sir Richard, who helps lead the Connecting Britain campaign. ""After decades of underinvestment in strategic rail infrastructure, this is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform capacity and connectivity and level-up communities across the North, and beyond."" And he added: ""We don't much appreciate being told by a peer, who divides his time between London and Cornwall, what the North wants."" A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""The government commissioned the Oakervee review to provide advice on how and whether to proceed with HS2, with an independent panel representing a range of viewpoints... Lord Berkeley's report represents his personal view."" Construction on the HS2 high-speed rail link has begun at Euston, in London Asked whether the government was still committed to building HS2, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Sky's Ridge On Sunday programme: ""Yes, the prime minister's made it clear and we've got a review under way. ""We want to look at the best way to get value for money in relation to that substantial investment. ""We also want to make sure that we've got the best benefit from it in terms of the connectivity - not just in the South but in relation to the east, west in the northern region."" Members of the review panel told the BBC in November that a draft version of the report recommends that HS2 should be built with only minor alterations. They include reducing the planned number of trains per hour from 18 to 14, in line with other high-speed networks around the world. According to the Times,external, the draft report also says that ""large ticket price rises"" would be needed if HS2 does not go ahead, to prevent excessive demand for travel at peak times.

"The man in charge of next week's giant CES tech expo has said that Ivanka Trump has done ""great work"" and will help it focus attendees' minds on job-related issues for the future. A decision to offer the US president's daughter one of the show's ""keynote"" sessions has caused controversy. Critics have said other women with more expertise have failed to be granted lower-profile slots at the trade show. But Gary Shapiro told the BBC that he did not regret the decision. ""There's a lot of focus on jobs of the future, and certainly the keynote that I'll be doing with Ivanka Trump will be focusing on... how industry is working with government on this very important issue,"" he said. He will interview Ms Trump - who serves as a jobs creation adviser to the president - when she appears on stage on Tuesday 7 January. He declined, however, to say if her appearance had been his organisation's idea or if the White House had requested the address. The US Consumer Technology Association (CTA) confirmed Ms Trump would headline a discussion about ""the path to the future of work"" in a press releaseshortly before Christmas,external. Over the following days hundreds of people tweeted objections to the announcement, often using the hashtag #BoycottCES. ""I was far from pleased at the news and the reason is certainly not found in my political beliefs,""blogged CES regular Carolina Milanesi,externalfrom the tech consultancy Creative Strategies. ""The reason for my upset is rooted in the fact that there are many more women who are in tech and are entrepreneurs who could run circles around Trump on how technology will impact the future of work."" Rachel Sklar, an entrepreneur who has campaigned for women to have more opportunities in the tech industry, added: ""What an insult to the years and years of protesting how few women were invited to keynote... there are so many great, qualified women. Shame."" The BBC sought comment fromseveral of CES's other featured speakers,external. Only Mark Cuban, the entrepreneur and star of US TV series Shark Tank replied. ""I don't care one way or another,"" he said. ""No one has to go to her keynote if they don't want to."" For his part, Mr Shapiro suggested that Ms Trump had the credentials to warrant the honour. In total, CES is scheduled to hosteight keynote-branded events,externalthis year featuring external speakers. Nine of the speakers and moderators are men and eight are women, excluding CTA staff. One session features both the US Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and President Trump's top technology advisor Michael Kratsios. CES 2020: Preview of tomorrow's tech on show in Las Vegas Mirriad's AI slips ads into empty spaces in online videos How AI fitness apps now rival personal trainers More than 175,000 people are expected to attend this year's CES tech expo, which is open to industry insiders but not the public The transcript below of the interview with Mr Shapiro has been edited for clarity and length: How did the invitation come about? There is a concern in the US and elsewhere about jobs. And working with the White House, this jobs-focus is something we're starting to talk about in a very deep way. There's an obligation by our industry to say we need people that are trained as data scientists and in artificial intelligence. There's a huge shortage in the United States of these type of workers. And there's concern about displacement and jobs. The White House - through great work by Ivanka Trump and [Secretary of Commerce] Wilbur Ross and others - has basically gotten industry together and said: 'Look, we have to approach this with a national strategy'. And part of that strategy is that companies that are involved in technology have to stand up and reskill workers. We are, in a sense, in an economic battle with other countries, specifically China, over artificial intelligence, self driving, 5G, and other areas where we need skilled workers. China is producing a million scientists and engineers a year, and we need our own strategy. And that is where these type of discussions will be occurring at CES. People are curious though, was it the case that your organisation invited Ivanka Trump? Or did the White House ask if she could appear? We've gone out to every administration - we've had Democrats and Republicans - and we invite them. Sometimes it's a discussion and a dialogue. In terms of this one, I'm not going to go into the details, but we are so excited to have them because it's very important that these issues be discussed in a meaningful way. There's has been quite a backlash, with questions posed about whether Ivanka Trump deserves the honour and what she could possibly say that her audience doesn't already know. Why do you think she warrants the appearance rather than somebody else who's had more to do with technology in the administration? One of the big things we did not focus on enough a couple of years ago is jobs. Now, last year, we really went into it big time with apprenticeships and other things. Ivanka Trump actually co-chairs the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, whose members include companies like Apple, Walmart and IBM. She also co-chairs the National Council for the American Worker, which has received pledges for more than 300 companies, to create over 12 million new training opportunities for students and workers over the next five years. She also championed the continuation of the Obama-created Global Entrepreneurship Summit. She's been involved in criminal justice reform. We just got a bill signed into law two weeks ago, which gives governmental employees paid parental leave. There's been a whole range of issues - substantively, definitely a focus there on workforce issues. And that is part of the CES discussion. You've previously criticised Ivanka Trump's father, Donald Trump for his behaviour before he became President, and then his trade tariffs after taking power. So might we expect you to ask Ms Trump some tough questions when you interview her? Our focus at this point is not to make this a political event, but to focus on the fact that this is about jobs in the future. CES has about 1,300 speakers. There will be a range of policy discussion. Our focus is generally on issues that are important to innovation.

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""We lost the public's trust in the Labour Party as a force for good"" Candidates hoping to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader have questioned the party's manifesto choices while opening up dividing lines on Brexit. Sir Keir Starmer said its election offer was ""over-loaded"" while both Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips said voters did not trust its free broadband pledge. Ms Phillips also said she would not rule out rejoining the EU if Brexit turned out not to be a success. She said she would not change her view that the UK was ""better off"" in the EU. Sir Keir and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry - both strong supporters of another referendum before the election - said Labour's focus as an opposition should now be on ensuring Boris Johnson negotiated the best economic and trade partnership with the EU. Five candidates, also including Clive Lewis, have so far entered the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Who will be Labour's next leader? Labour contest timings could be crucial Keir Starmer enters Labour leadership contest Labour's ruling body is due to meet on Monday to decide the timetable for the election. Would-be candidates have to be nominated by more than 20 MPs and must also get the backing of at least 5% of constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey is also expected to officially declare her candidacy in the coming days. The contest was called after Mr Corbyn announced he would stand down as leader after Labour's heavy election defeat. Both Sir Keir and Ms Phillips told the BBC's Andrew Marr the party must learn the lessons of the defeat and why some many previously rock-solid Labour seats in the Midlands and the North of England turned to the Conservatives. This video can not be played Jess Phillips: ""The country didn't trust us to govern"" Sir Keir said the manifesto was one of a number of ""cumulative"" factors  that eroded trust, on top of concerns over the party's Brexit policy, its leadership and its record on tackling anti-Semitism. ""There was a general feeling the manifesto was over-loaded. We lost the public's trust in the Labour Party as a force for good and a force for change,"" he said. ""After four general election losses we have to address that straight away."" But he warned Labour against ""unpicking"" the last manifesto when it should be focused on its offer to voters in five years time. He also said it would be wrong to ""retreat"" from Mr Corbyn's focus on reducing inequality and protecting the public services. While not the sole reason for its defeat, Ms Phillips also identified the manifesto - which pledged to bring rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership and extend the role of the state into new areas - as one of Labour's weak points. ""The fundamental thing is that the country did not trust us to govern,"" she said. ""They did not trust to deliver on the things we were saying."" Rebecca Long-Bailey is expected to join the race While there was a strong case for nationalising the railways and ending private involvement in the prison and probation services, she suggested tackling deep-seated social problems, such as homelessness and social care, were more important than public control of key utilities. ""We lost them on some of the basics. My son does not go to school five days a week. Lots of people in the country can give you their own example. While that was the case, offering free broadband was just not believable."" Lisa Nandy joins Labour leadership race Jess Phillips joins Labour leadership race Thornberry enters Labour leadership race Clive Lewis joins Labour leadership race The Birmingham Yardley MP said the party must stop obsessing with factionalism and internal positioning and speak honestly to people. ""People have to feel a connection with us again. People have to feel we are on their side."" Ms Nandy also distanced herself from the broadband pledge, telling BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics: ""People said to us, 'It's all very well promising free broadband but can you sort out the buses?' and that was the more pressing issue in their lives. It's not about whether you're radical or not it's about whether you're relevant."" Ms Thornberry said Labour had been wrong to allow the Conservatives to fight the election on the ""single issue"" of Brexit. She told Sky News that the opposition's focus should now be on ensuring the UK had a relationship with Europe in the coming years that's ""going to work for jobs and the economy"". Sir Keir, who like Ms Thornberry was a supporter of another referendum, suggested the issue of EU membership was now closed and the party needed to move on from an argument between Remain and Leave. Asked whether she would support, as leader, the UK going back into the EU, Ms Phillips said it was sensible to ""wait and see"". ""If we are living in an absolute paradise of trade and totally safe in the world...then maybe I will be proven wrong. But if the reality is if if our country is safer and more economically viable to be in the EU, I will fight for that regardless of how difficult that argument is to make."" The candidates have also been pressed on the UK's relationship with the US following the killing of Iran's top military leader, Qasem Soleimani, in Iraq. Ms Phillips said people were ""not shedding any tears"" over the Iranian general's death and, while she opposed the Iraq War, she would always support the deployment of British forces abroad if there was a ""moral case"" for it. ""What we have to make sure is that when we take action, it is lawful, proportionate and there is a moral case for it. If those questions can be answered, then I would absolutely take action to protect British lives."" However, Sir Keir said the UK should never find itself in the position of ""blindly following the Americans"". If he became prime minister, he said he would pass legislation to circumscribe the ability of governments to take military action. He suggested it would have to pass three tests - if it was lawful, had been supported by Parliament and was part of a viable plan. Who will be Labour's next leader?

Ms Phillips also said she would not rule out rejoining the EU if Brexit turned out not to be a success. She said she would not change her view that the UK was ""better off"" in the EU. Sir Keir and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry - both strong supporters of another referendum before the election - said Labour's focus as an opposition should now be on ensuring Boris Johnson negotiated the best economic and trade partnership with the EU. Five candidates, also including Clive Lewis, have so far entered the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Who will be Labour's next leader? Labour contest timings could be crucial Keir Starmer enters Labour leadership contest Labour's ruling body is due to meet on Monday to decide the timetable for the election. Would-be candidates have to be nominated by more than 20 MPs and must also get the backing of at least 5% of constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey is also expected to officially declare her candidacy in the coming days. The contest was called after Mr Corbyn announced he would stand down as leader after Labour's heavy election defeat. Both Sir Keir and Ms Phillips told the BBC's Andrew Marr the party must learn the lessons of the defeat and why some many previously rock-solid Labour seats in the Midlands and the North of England turned to the Conservatives. This video can not be played Jess Phillips: ""The country didn't trust us to govern"" Sir Keir said the manifesto was one of a number of ""cumulative"" factors  that eroded trust, on top of concerns over the party's Brexit policy, its leadership and its record on tackling anti-Semitism. ""There was a general feeling the manifesto was over-loaded. We lost the public's trust in the Labour Party as a force for good and a force for change,"" he said. ""After four general election losses we have to address that straight away."" But he warned Labour against ""unpicking"" the last manifesto when it should be focused on its offer to voters in five years time. He also said it would be wrong to ""retreat"" from Mr Corbyn's focus on reducing inequality and protecting the public services. While not the sole reason for its defeat, Ms Phillips also identified the manifesto - which pledged to bring rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership and extend the role of the state into new areas - as one of Labour's weak points. ""The fundamental thing is that the country did not trust us to govern,"" she said. ""They did not trust to deliver on the things we were saying."" Rebecca Long-Bailey is expected to join the race While there was a strong case for nationalising the railways and ending private involvement in the prison and probation services, she suggested tackling deep-seated social problems, such as homelessness and social care, were more important than public control of key utilities. ""We lost them on some of the basics. My son does not go to school five days a week. Lots of people in the country can give you their own example. While that was the case, offering free broadband was just not believable."" Lisa Nandy joins Labour leadership race Jess Phillips joins Labour leadership race Thornberry enters Labour leadership race Clive Lewis joins Labour leadership race The Birmingham Yardley MP said the party must stop obsessing with factionalism and internal positioning and speak honestly to people. ""People have to feel a connection with us again. People have to feel we are on their side."" Ms Nandy also distanced herself from the broadband pledge, telling BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics: ""People said to us, 'It's all very well promising free broadband but can you sort out the buses?' and that was the more pressing issue in their lives. It's not about whether you're radical or not it's about whether you're relevant."" Ms Thornberry said Labour had been wrong to allow the Conservatives to fight the election on the ""single issue"" of Brexit. She told Sky News that the opposition's focus should now be on ensuring the UK had a relationship with Europe in the coming years that's ""going to work for jobs and the economy"". Sir Keir, who like Ms Thornberry was a supporter of another referendum, suggested the issue of EU membership was now closed and the party needed to move on from an argument between Remain and Leave. Asked whether she would support, as leader, the UK going back into the EU, Ms Phillips said it was sensible to ""wait and see"". ""If we are living in an absolute paradise of trade and totally safe in the world...then maybe I will be proven wrong. But if the reality is if if our country is safer and more economically viable to be in the EU, I will fight for that regardless of how difficult that argument is to make."" The candidates have also been pressed on the UK's relationship with the US following the killing of Iran's top military leader, Qasem Soleimani, in Iraq. Ms Phillips said people were ""not shedding any tears"" over the Iranian general's death and, while she opposed the Iraq War, she would always support the deployment of British forces abroad if there was a ""moral case"" for it. ""What we have to make sure is that when we take action, it is lawful, proportionate and there is a moral case for it. If those questions can be answered, then I would absolutely take action to protect British lives."" However, Sir Keir said the UK should never find itself in the position of ""blindly following the Americans"". If he became prime minister, he said he would pass legislation to circumscribe the ability of governments to take military action. He suggested it would have to pass three tests - if it was lawful, had been supported by Parliament and was part of a viable plan. Who will be Labour's next leader?

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab says he found out about the Soleimani killing ""as it happened"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has urged Iran to ""take a diplomatic route"" to reduce tensions following the US killing of Iran's top military leader. Mr Raab said the UK understood whythe US killed Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Iraqlast week, and the US ""had a right to exercise self-defence"". But he told the BBC the UK now wanted to ""de-escalate tensions"" and avoid ""a major war"". Iraqi MPs have sincecalled for foreign troops to leave the country. And the US-led coalition against the Islamic State group said it will not be training local allies. Instead,it said,externalit would focus for now on protecting Iraqi bases that host US, UK and other coalition troops. A UK government spokesman said it was urging the Iraqi government to ensure the coalition would be able to continue its ""vital work"" against a ""shared threat"". ""The coalition is in Iraq to help protect Iraqis and others from the threat from Daesh (Islamic State), at the request of the Iraqi government,"" the spokesman said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to return to the UK later and will talk to foreign leaders in the coming days. Why kill Soleimani now and what happens next? Who was Iran's Qasem Soleimani? Your questions: Will Soleimani killing spark war? Soleimani, who had been head of the elite Iranian Quds Force, died in the drone strike in Baghdad on Friday. Tehran has vowed to avenge the general's killing. The US has pledged to send 3,000 extra troops to the region while the UK has 400 troops in the Middle East. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr programme on Sunday, Mr Raab rejected the idea the killing was an act of war, adding: ""Iran has for a long period been engaged in menacing, de-stabilising activities."" Pressed on whether the killing was legal, Mr Raab said: ""My view is - and the operational assessment has been done by the Americans - is that there is a right of self-defence. ""It was General Soleimani's job description to engage proxies, militias across not just Iraq but the whole region, not just to destabilize those countries but to attack Western countries... In those circumstances the right of self-defence clearly applies."" By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins Under enormous pressure from the Trump Administration, Britain has edged very slightly closer to the Americans over the killing of Soleimani, but has still stopped well short of the sort of full-throated support Washington has demanded from its allies. In the absence of Boris Johnson on holiday in the Caribbean, it's been the foreign secretary who has articulated Britain's response. Dominic Raab is now stressing a little more the threat posed by Soleimani in life, without retreating from British warnings of the possible consequences of his death. So when Mr Raab told the BBC: ""We understand the action they took but we need to be clearly focused on what happens next,"" it's important to note that ""understanding"" falls a long way short of endorsement or support. And in that single sentence, Mr Raab is determined to keep the focus on fears for the future. The foreign secretary made little effort to conceal widely-held British fears that Washington has no coherent step-by-step strategy to help get Iran to a better place on the world stage. Indeed, President Trump's tweets threatening 52 targets in Iran - one for each of the American hostages taken back in 1979 - seem to many observers to play right into the Iranian fundamentalist mindset by clinging to a history of grievance that seeks to avenge every wrong done by one side to the other. Taken at face value, the approach offers the bleak possibility of unending violence as long as neither side offers a different path. Mr Raab said he first became aware of the killing of Soleimani ""as it happened"" and spoke to US counterpart Mike Pompeo - who he will meet for pre-arranged talks in Washington this week - on Friday. Mr Raab is also expected to meet his French and German counterparts before travelling to the US. Dominic Raab will travel to the US to speak with Mike Pompeo this week Mr Raab said the ""important thing now is to de-escalate the tensions and try and restore some stability"" - while trying to contain Iran's ""nefarious actions"". ""We also need to see that there's a route, a door left ajar for a diplomatic solution so that when the leadership in Tehran wake up to their options, they understand there is a positive route through for them."" Asked about the criticism over Mr Johnson being on holiday, Mr Raab said he had been ""in constant contact with the prime minister over the Christmas break on a whole range of foreign policy issues"". Speaking on Sky's Sophy Ridge programme, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry accused Mr Johnson of ""sunning himself"" while there had been three Cobra meetings where Mark Sedwill, the chief civil servant, had to chair. Mr Johnson has yet to speak publicly about the US airstrike or threats from Iran. Ms Thornberry accused the government of doing ""too little, too late"" HMS Montrose and HMS Defender will accompany UK-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz. On Sunday, a crowd of more than 100 people waving Iranian and Iraqi flags protested against the killing of Soleimani outside the US embassy in London, with chants aimed at Mr Johnson and Mr Raab. Mr Pompeo had criticised America's European allies for not being ""helpful"" in the wake of the killing but later tweeted he was ""thankful that our allies recognise the continuing aggressive threats posed by the Iranian Quds Force"". Soleimani, 62, spearheaded Iran's Middle East operations as head of the elite Quds Force Following the airstrike, the Foreign Officehas hardened its travel advicefor Britons in Iraq and Iran. It said there is a risk British or British-Iranian dual nationals ""could be arbitrarily detained or arrested in Iran"". The Foreign Office also said alerts for other parts of the Middle East were being increased, with calls for citizens to ""remain vigilant"" in nations including Afghanistan, Israel, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

"Some trains would be 400m (1,300ft) long with as many as 1,100 seats There is ""overwhelming evidence"" that the costs of HS2 are ""out of control"" and its benefits overstated, the deputy chair of its review panel has said. Lord Berkeley said the high-speed rail line, linking London and northern England, is likely to cost over Â£108bn. A vocal critic of HS2, the Labour peer said he believed MPs had been ""misled"" about the price - set at Â£55bn in 2015. He has published a ""dissenting report"" on the project, but the government said it represented his personal view. And a coalition of northern political leaders and businesses has also rejected Lord Berkeley's criticism of the project. ""We need HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail delivered together, in full,"" said the leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese, part of the Connecting Britain campaign. Trains are due to start running on HS2 between London and Birmingham in 2029. However, Lord Berkeley says there is little prospect of that before 2031, and warns high-speed trains will not reach Manchester and Leeds until 2040. He told the BBC that spending money on improving rail services in the north of England was far more important. ""That's where the really bad quality railways are,"" Lord Berkeley said, adding that a complete upgrade ""could probably be done at half the cost of HS2"". Review says HS2 should happen despite rising cost HS2 review criticised by deputy chair of panel How much will the rail scheme cost? HS2 buys Â£1.25bn of property in London Lord Berkeley was the deputy chairman of the independent Oakervee Review in to HS2, set up by the government. However, he has withdrawn his backing from the review, which is expected to be published in the coming months. He says he disagrees with a draft version of its official report and as a result has published his own version. He said he and other members of the panel were prevented from contributing to the final draft of the government-commissioned report because the review was ""effectively terminated"" on 31 October. This video can not be played HS2: How much work has already been done? He also said the official report has been ""unduly influenced"" by HS2 promoters, and said both HS2 Ltd and the Department for Transport failed to co-operate with the review properly to substantiate their claims about the cost and benefits. HS2 Ltd denies this claim, saying it provided ""full co-operation"" with the review. His report concludes that ministers will either have to accept the higher cost of the line or only build part of the proposed high-speed rail network. This option, which would save the government Â£50bn, would also involve upgrading existing Network Rail lines in the Midlands and the north of England, he said. ""The aim must be to give these areas the same standard of commuting service as the south east, whilst, at the same time, improving the existing lines from London northwards,"" Lord Berkeley said in the report. He rejected suggestions that the increased costs were due to delays in the project, telling the BBC on Sunday: ""The real cause is [HS2] has been over-designed. You do not need to go 400kph in a country as small as ours... The higher the speed makes a big difference to the cost."" He added: ""People want a reliable, frequent service on which they can get a seat."" Anti-HS2 campaigners welcomed the report. ""The case for HS2 has always been poor, and is simply getting worse,"" said Penny Gaines, chair of Stop HS2. ""It is time for this white elephant of a project to be cancelled as quickly as possible."" And Greenpeace said that if the government was serious about climate change then it must listen to HS2's critics. ""The protection of ancient woodlands must be a priority for rail development,"" said John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK. However, HS2 Ltd, the company responsible for building the new line, says the economic case is strong and it is determined to deliver a railway that is good value for money. A spokesman said the high-speed line was ""critical"" for the UK's future low-carbon transport network, would increase rail capacity and was ""integral"" to improving the rail network in the Midlands and North of England. That view was backed by Sir Richard, who helps lead the Connecting Britain campaign. ""After decades of underinvestment in strategic rail infrastructure, this is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform capacity and connectivity and level-up communities across the North, and beyond."" And he added: ""We don't much appreciate being told by a peer, who divides his time between London and Cornwall, what the North wants."" A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""The government commissioned the Oakervee review to provide advice on how and whether to proceed with HS2, with an independent panel representing a range of viewpoints... Lord Berkeley's report represents his personal view."" Construction on the HS2 high-speed rail link has begun at Euston, in London Asked whether the government was still committed to building HS2, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Sky's Ridge On Sunday programme: ""Yes, the prime minister's made it clear and we've got a review under way. ""We want to look at the best way to get value for money in relation to that substantial investment. ""We also want to make sure that we've got the best benefit from it in terms of the connectivity - not just in the South but in relation to the east, west in the northern region."" Members of the review panel told the BBC in November that a draft version of the report recommends that HS2 should be built with only minor alterations. They include reducing the planned number of trains per hour from 18 to 14, in line with other high-speed networks around the world. According to the Times,external, the draft report also says that ""large ticket price rises"" would be needed if HS2 does not go ahead, to prevent excessive demand for travel at peak times.

"The man in charge of next week's giant CES tech expo has said that Ivanka Trump has done ""great work"" and will help it focus attendees' minds on job-related issues for the future. A decision to offer the US president's daughter one of the show's ""keynote"" sessions has caused controversy. Critics have said other women with more expertise have failed to be granted lower-profile slots at the trade show. But Gary Shapiro told the BBC that he did not regret the decision. ""There's a lot of focus on jobs of the future, and certainly the keynote that I'll be doing with Ivanka Trump will be focusing on... how industry is working with government on this very important issue,"" he said. He will interview Ms Trump - who serves as a jobs creation adviser to the president - when she appears on stage on Tuesday 7 January. He declined, however, to say if her appearance had been his organisation's idea or if the White House had requested the address. The US Consumer Technology Association (CTA) confirmed Ms Trump would headline a discussion about ""the path to the future of work"" in a press releaseshortly before Christmas,external. Over the following days hundreds of people tweeted objections to the announcement, often using the hashtag #BoycottCES. ""I was far from pleased at the news and the reason is certainly not found in my political beliefs,""blogged CES regular Carolina Milanesi,externalfrom the tech consultancy Creative Strategies. ""The reason for my upset is rooted in the fact that there are many more women who are in tech and are entrepreneurs who could run circles around Trump on how technology will impact the future of work."" Rachel Sklar, an entrepreneur who has campaigned for women to have more opportunities in the tech industry, added: ""What an insult to the years and years of protesting how few women were invited to keynote... there are so many great, qualified women.

There is a concern in the US and elsewhere about jobs. And working with the White House, this jobs-focus is something we're starting to talk about in a very deep way. There's an obligation by our industry to say we need people that are trained as data scientists and in artificial intelligence. There's a huge shortage in the United States of these type of workers. And there's concern about displacement and jobs. The White House - through great work by Ivanka Trump and [Secretary of Commerce] Wilbur Ross and others - has basically gotten industry together and said: 'Look, we have to approach this with a national strategy'. And part of that strategy is that companies that are involved in technology have to stand up and reskill workers. We are, in a sense, in an economic battle with other countries, specifically China, over artificial intelligence, self driving, 5G, and other areas where we need skilled workers. China is producing a million scientists and engineers a year, and we need our own strategy. And that is where these type of discussions will be occurring at CES. People are curious though, was it the case that your organisation invited Ivanka Trump? Or did the White House ask if she could appear? We've gone out to every administration - we've had Democrats and Republicans - and we invite them. Sometimes it's a discussion and a dialogue. In terms of this one, I'm not going to go into the details, but we are so excited to have them because it's very important that these issues be discussed in a meaningful way. There's has been quite a backlash, with questions posed about whether Ivanka Trump deserves the honour and what she could possibly say that her audience doesn't already know. Why do you think she warrants the appearance rather than somebody else who's had more to do with technology in the administration? One of the big things we did not focus on enough a couple of years ago is jobs. Now, last year, we really went into it big time with apprenticeships and other things. Ivanka Trump actually co-chairs the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, whose members include companies like Apple, Walmart and IBM. She also co-chairs the National Council for the American Worker, which has received pledges for more than 300 companies, to create over 12 million new training opportunities for students and workers over the next five years. She also championed the continuation of the Obama-created Global Entrepreneurship Summit. She's been involved in criminal justice reform. We just got a bill signed into law two weeks ago, which gives governmental employees paid parental leave. There's been a whole range of issues - substantively, definitely a focus there on workforce issues. And that is part of the CES discussion. You've previously criticised Ivanka Trump's father, Donald Trump for his behaviour before he became President, and then his trade tariffs after taking power. So might we expect you to ask Ms Trump some tough questions when you interview her? Our focus at this point is not to make this a political event, but to focus on the fact that this is about jobs in the future. CES has about 1,300 speakers. There will be a range of policy discussion. Our focus is generally on issues that are important to innovation.
