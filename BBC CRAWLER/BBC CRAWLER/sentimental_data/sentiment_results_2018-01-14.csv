The deal follows a legal fight by Ms Ewing's daughter after her mother and five others were killed by an out-of-control truck driven by Harry Clarke. A fatal accident inquiry found Clarke lost consciousness at the wheel before the crash in December 2014. The compensation case was settled out of court last month.

"This video can not be played The government is seeking to calm days of unrest The Tunisian government has announced a wave of social reforms, reacting to days of demonstrations by anti-austerity protesters. There were fresh protests on Sunday, the seventh anniversary of the ousting of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. Emergency government meetings have been held in response to the protests, which have seen more than 800 arrests. President Beji Caid Essebsi visited a district of Tunis on Sunday, saying he understood the people's suffering. Protesters have taken to the streets again following calls from opposition parties. They argue conditions have not improved since Ben Ali was deposed as president at the start of the so-called Arab Spring uprisings. Demonstrations began on 7 January after the government raised value-added tax and social contributions, and increased some prices on goods in its 2018 budget. Rallies have taken place in at least 10 different areas. Tunisia: The revolution that didn't deliver for women On Sunday, hundreds of people poured into one of the flashpoints of the 2011 uprising, Habib Bourguiba Avenue in Tunis. This video can not be played Some anti-austerity protests have turned violent in recent days Demonstrators also rallied outside the offices of the UGTT union, demanding the budget be abandoned and venting anger at price rises. Last week saw a wave of protests, some of which turned violent after dark. The government accused demonstrators of setting fire to police cars and attacking officials. Some people tried to take over shopping malls and stores, while others blocked roads. In the town of Thala, near the Algerian border, the army was called in on Wednesday after protesters burned down the national security offices and police were forced to retreat. Interior ministry spokesman Khlifa Chibani said on Saturday that 803 people had been arrested so far on suspicion of violence, theft and looting. He said 97 members of the security forces had been injured, but did not say how many protesters had been hurt. Demonstrators accused police of a violent crackdown. The announcement came after two hours of crisis talks at the presidential palace that included President Essebsi, political parties and trade unionists. Political parties, unions and employers met on Saturday for crisis talks amid protests Officials said plans had been submitted to parliament to reform medical care, housing and increase aid to the poor. Social affairs minister Mohammed Trabelsi said the government proposed increasing welfare payments to those in need by 170m dinars ($70m; Â£50m). ""This will affect about 250,000 families. It will help the poor and middle class,"" he said. Mr Trabelsi also alluded to plans for guaranteed medical care and housing reform. He visited the marginalised Tunis district of Ettdhamon, opening a youth centre there. In a short and informal speech, he promised to address youth unemployment and highlighted the government's move to help poorer families, saying: ""We feel for you, these are our families."" But he also said: ""Be modest, your country does not have a lot of means."" Tunisia has been struggling economically since Ben Ali was ousted after more than 20 years in power. That revolution was sparked by high unemployment and worries about corruption. Seven years on, some of the same problems remain. Youth unemployment stands at more than 35%, the UN's International Labour Organisation says. Terror attacks that hit the country's vital tourism industry have helped knock its currency down 60% since 2011. Inflation is at a three-and-a-half-year high, with the price of meat and other foods rising by more than 10% annually. In December 2017, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) told Tunisia it needed to take ""urgent action"" and ""decisive measures"" to reduce its deficit. The IMF gave the country a $2.9bn (Â£2.2bn) loan in 2015. Ben Ali, who lives in exile in Saudi Arabia, was convicted in absentia by a Tunisian court in 2011 of embezzlement and misuse of public funds and sentenced to 35 years.

"Carillion worked on the Battersea Power Station revamp The troubled government contractor Carillion has held talks with its creditor banks this weekend and further meetings are planned for Monday, the BBC understands. The construction firm owes Â£900m to RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Santander. The banks may be able to show Carillion more leniency if the government is able to do its part, according to sources. The firm's future is also being discussed by government officials. Carillion is involved in major public projects such as the HS2 high-speed rail line, as well as managing schools and prisons. Simon Jack: Carillion's uncertain future Where did it go wrong for Carillion? How exactly the banks want the government to intervene is unclear. They could want the government to offer some guarantees in case Carillion cannot pay back its debts. Or they may want the government to take some of Carillion's key projects back into the public sector. The TUC has called on the government to ""step in"" to ""guarantee jobs and services"". Deputy general secretary Paul Nowak said: ""Tens of thousands of jobs are now at risk, along with vital public services and major infrastructure projects across the country."" New Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis told the BBC the government was keeping ""a very close eye on this"". Mr Lewis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the government was ""making sure all plans and contingency plans are in place"". But he refused to be drawn on whether the government would bail Carillion out. ""It's a very commercially sensitive situation so I wouldn't comment further than to say I would hope to see that the working capital that they need will be there working with their partners,"" he said. Labour peer Lord Adonis,who last month quit a head of the National Infrastructure Commisson,tweeted that the government has ""got questions to answer about propping up Carillion with contracts long after its problems clear. Looks like another Grayling bailout!"" Last summer Transport Secretary Chris Grayling awarded Carillion part of the contract to build HS2, a week after the company had issued a profits warning and its chief executive had departed. Carillion's banks are owed about Â£900m, in the form of overdrafts as well as credit card facilities and other loans. The banks will likely show forbearance for a few weeks if a sustainable solution to this debt can be found. But they would also like the government to get involved when it comes to managing its key public contracts. This could mean that they would need taxpayers to act as guarantor on future payments from Carillion or that the important contracts to maintain schools and hospitals be taken back in house by Whitehall officials. The government is in a bind. Let Carillion fail and risk thousands of job losses, or bail it out and risk propping up a private company with public money - only a few months after it paid out dividends to its shareholders. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has urged the government not to agree to a taxpayer-funded bailout for Carillion. Alastair Stewart, a construction and property analyst at Stockdale Securities, said none of the solutions involving the government were ""particularly palatable"". ""The biggest intervention they could make is actually take a stake in the company as part of raising a large amount of capital, but they'll look back and look at the background of Lloyds and RBS,"" he said. Carillion has debts of Â£1.5bn, including a Â£587m pension shortfall. The UK's second-largest construction company employs 43,000 people worldwide, with about 20,000 of them in the UK. It specialises in construction, as well as facilities management and ongoing maintenance. As recently as 2016 it had sales of Â£5.2bn and until July 2017 its market capitalisation was close to Â£1bn. Since then, its share price has plummeted and it is now worth just Â£61m. Its problems stem in part from a string of risky contracts which have proved unprofitable. It also faced payment delays in the Middle East that hit its accounts. It has worked on high-profile projects, including the Battersea Power station redevelopment and the Anfield Stadium expansion. It is also the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail and maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence, manages nearly 900 schools and manages roads and prisons. The concern is that if it were to collapse these key public sector services could suffer a lot of disruption. Where did it go wrong for Carillion?

"Houses in Arequipa province were damaged by the quake A huge earthquake off south-western Peru's Pacific coast has killed at least one person and injured at least 65, as buildings collapsed. The magnitude 7.1 tremor struck at 04:18 local time (09:18 GMT), at a depth of 36km (22 miles), 40km south-west of AcarÃ­ (population 4,445). President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said rescue teams were on their way to verify the extent of the damage, The areas affected are mainly rural and blocked roads are slowing down aid. Early reports that 17 people were missing at a collapsed mine were later discounted. The area between the South America and Nazca plates, where the tremor occurred, is prone to earthquakes,external, with 13 above magnitude 6.5 occurring over the past century, the US Geological Survey says. The regions of Arequipa, Ica and Ayacucho have been affected. Falling rock crushed a man to death in the town of Yauca, in Arequipa, officials confirmed. Arequipa Governor Yamila Osorio said adobe houses had collapsed in some areas and landslides were blocking some roads. Power cuts were also reported. President Kuczynski said he was heading for AcarÃ­ and Chala to assess the damage and needs of local people. Tents, blankets and humanitarian aid were being delivered by air, Ms Osorio said, tweeting photos of a military plane being loaded. Allow Twitter content?

"Worboys asked passengers to help him celebrate a big lottery win and gave them drug-laced champagne The government is doing ""everything we can"" to make sure rapist John Worboys stays in prison, Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis has said. The Parole Board has said ex-black cab driver Worboys, jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women, can be released. But the government is considering challenging that decision in court. Mr Lewis said it was crucial victims were ""properly protected"", while a lawyer for victims said releasing Worboys would ""put many women at risk"". Justice Secretary David Gauke is looking into the possibility of applying for judicial review, but will only proceed if there is a good chance of success. If a judge finds the Parole Board did not follow the correct process or reached its decision on the wrong basis, that decision would be quashed and Worboys would have to make a fresh application for parole. The Parole Board said it was ""confident correct procedures were followed"" in the case. 'No plans' for CPS to review Worboys cases Worboys victims 'terrified' by release Cabbie who preyed on young women Mr Lewis, who was appointed in the prime minister's recent reshuffle,  told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show he understood the public outrage at the decision to release Worboys. ""Every victim out there, every friend and family of victims, everybody who has read about this case will want to know that we are doing everything we can to make sure that the victims are properly protected,"" he said. He added: ""The Secretary of State for Justice will be doing everything he can to make sure this man stays behind bars."" This video can not be played Government trying to keep Worboys ""behind bars"" Victims' groups and representatives were outraged by news of Worboys's imminent release earlier this month, saying many victims were not informed before it was made public. Lawyer Richard Scorer, from the firm Slater and Gordon which represented some of the victims, said his clients' ""fears and concerns are finally being recognised"". He said the victims hope the government will be able to take action on the parole decision, adding: ""We believe this manipulative, dangerous serial sex offender is still a danger to the public and releasing him now would put many women at risk."" Sarah Green, from the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said the justice secretary's efforts were ""very welcome"". ""Women have been singularly failed throughout this case, from initial investigations all the way through to the parole board decision,"" she said. This video can not be played Solicitor: My client is ""absolutely horrified"" at the news that Worboys will be released She added that swift action was needed to review the risk Worboys poses to women's safety and to ""restore public confidence in the system's ability to do justice and to protect"". At his trial,Croydon Crown Court heard,external60-year-old Worboys gave his lone victims drug-laced champagne, saying he was celebrating a big lottery or casino win, before attacking them in his London taxi. By Alex Forsyth, BBC political correspondent There was a huge backlash to the Parole Board's decision to release John Worboys - from those who thought it was the wrong decision and from those who were critical about the way victims had been informed about it. At this stage, David Gauke's actions are just a scoping exercise, he won't proceed unless he feels there are grounds to do so. Nonetheless, this is significant. It is highly unusual for a justice secretary to intervene in the decisions of the Parole Board in this way, and that's because the Parole Board is very deliberately independent of government. It's understood that Mr Gauke, who is new to the job of justice secretary, takes that independence very seriously and wants to maintain it, which is why at this stage he is just collecting information about the possibility of judicial review. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Mr Gauke commissioned, mid-last week, advice on the plausibility of a judicial review and the prospect of success of any judicial review. ""The secretary of state is minded to move forward only if there was a reasonable prospect of success."" It came asThe Sunday Times,externalreported four cabinet ministers had warned Worboys's release might be unlawful because victims were not consulted. The handling ofWorboys's release has already triggered a government reviewto look at how the Parole Board reaches its decisions. Labour's London MayorSadiq Khan said in a tweet,externalthat he was ""astonished"" by its decision, saying ""it must listen to Worboys's victims"". ""He should not be allowed to set foot in London,"" he added. Parole Board chairman Nick Hardwick has said hearing the decision must have been ""horrible"" for the women, but the board was ""confident"" Worboys would not reoffend. He said the fact some victims were not informed was a fault with the parole system, but the decision itself would have been carefully considered.

"Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan A Qatari royal says he is being held against his will in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali al-Thani - who played a role in negotiating with Saudi Arabia during the Qatar diplomatic crisis last year - made the claims in a YouTube video released on Sunday. He claims he is being held by Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince, who will be ""fully responsible"" if anything happens to him. A UAE official denied the accusations. In the video statement, the Qatari sheikh, a relative of the current Qatari emir, is seated in an armchair, talking directly to camera. ""I'm currently in Abu Dhabi, being hosted by Sheikh Mohamed. But this is not a hosting status. Rather, it is a 'holding' one. They told me not to move,"" he says. The Qatar crisis explained He continues: ""I'd like to inform you that if something happens to me, Qatar will be innocent of it."" Ali Rashid al-Nuaimi, who heads Abu Dhabi's education department and a counter-extremism centre, sent a series of tweets saying Sheikh Abdullah is free to go ""whenever he wants"". Sheikh Abdullah brokered a deal with Saudi Arabiato allow Qatari pilgrims into the country after Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region cut diplomatic ties with Qatar in June 2017. The video was published on a YouTube channel run by UAE 71 website. By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab Affairs Editor This is a complete turnaround from last year when Sheikh Abdullah appeared out of nowhere as a significant player in the political feud pitting the Saudis and Emiratis against Qatar. He won a diplomatic coup in apparently brokering a deal with Saudi Arabia to reopen its land border with Qatar so that its citizens could attend the Hajj. A descendant of the founding father of Qatar, Sheikh Abdullah's branch of the royal family had been sidelined for decades. But suddenly he was everywhere, with legions of followers on Twitter. The consensus was that he was very much acting with the approval of the UAE and Saudi Arabia - with even some speculation that they might be considering him as a replacement leader in Qatar.

"This video can not be played People were warned to take shelter The US state of Hawaii has been told it did not have ""reasonable"" safeguards in place to prevent the false missile alert that caused panic on Saturday. Ajit Pai, chairman of America's media regulator, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), said the error was ""absolutely unacceptable"". The 38-minute delay in issuing the correction made it worse, he added. He called for officials at all levels throughout the US to work together to rectify any vulnerabilities. Residents and visitors to Hawaii were shocked to receive the false alert of an incoming ballistic missile, sent to their mobile phones early on Saturday morning. Apologising afterwards, Hawaii's Governor David Ige said a member of staff had pressed the wrong button, releasing the alert which was also broadcast on TV and radio stations. The alert system is in place because of the potential proximity of Hawaii to North Korean missiles. How should you react to a missile alert? In a statement, Mr Pai said the alert had caused a ""wave of panic across the state - worsened by the 38-minute delay before a correction alert was issued"". ""False alerts undermine public confidence in the alerting system and thus reduce their effectiveness during real emergencies,"" he said. This video can not be played One man told US broadcaster CBS that he started running when the alarm sounded An FCC investigation, he continued, had already established that the ""government of Hawaii did not have reasonable safeguards or process controls in place to prevent the transmission of a false alert"". ""Moving forward, we will focus on what steps need to be taken to prevent a similar incident from happening again,"" he said. It was a mistake by an employee at Hawaii's Emergency Management Agency during procedures that occur in a shift handover. The message was reportedly sent despite an onscreen prompt requesting confirmation. Mobile phone users received the message at 08:07 (18:07 GMT): ""Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill."" The eventual correction said: ""There is no missile threat or danger to the state of Hawaii."" One of the problems was that the alert system did not allow for a correction to be sent quickly to mobiles. State officials saida ""cancellation template"" would be created to address the problem, the New York Times reported,external. Two people are also now required to sign off the issuing of an alert, it said. Hawaiian state officials were profusely apologetic. Governor Ige said: ""I am sorry for the pain and confusion it caused. I, too, am extremely upset about this."" Vern Miyagi, administrator of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, also apologised for the ""inadvertent mistake"". Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard told ABC News there had been an ""epic failure of leadership"". ""It was unacceptable that this went out in the first place but the fact that it took so long for them to put out that second message, to calm people, to allay their fears that this was a mistake, a false alarm is something that has to be fixed, corrected with people held accountable,"" she said. Brigette Namata, a television reporter in Honolulu, said it was ""mind-boggling that we have officials here, we have state workers that are in charge of our public safety and a huge, egregious mistake like this happened"". President Donald Trump, who was playing golf in Florida at the time of the alert, has been criticised for not commenting publicly on the event. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme is seen as a growing threat to the United States. Hawaii is one of the US states closest to the country. In September Pyongyang carried out its sixth nuclear test. Last month, the Star-Advertiser reported that a missile launched from North Korea could strike Hawaii within 20 minutes of launch. So Hawaii has reintroduced Cold War-era warning sirens. During a test last month, it was reported that 93% of them worked properly, althoughsome could hardly be heard and 12 mistakenly played the ambulance siren,external.

"This video can not be played Falklands veteran Simon Weston and Surgeon Commander Anthony Lambert remember Capt Rick Jolly A Royal Navy medical officer who saved the lives of hundreds of British and Argentine troops during the Falklands War has died, aged 71. Working amid terrible conditions in the field, Surgeon Capt Rick Jolly, from Torpoint, Cornwall, saved the life of every British serviceman he treated. He was the only person to have been decorated by both Britain and Argentina for his service during the conflict. Falklands veteran Simon Weston called him an ""incredible man"". He said: ""Without his organisational skills the surgeons and medics would never have functioned. I can only thank him for saving my life, and many others. ""It's a tragedy for everyone who knew him and a tragedy especially for his family."" Capt Jolly (left) established a field hospital at Ajax Bay where around 1,000 personnel were treated After the war, Capt Jolly wrote books and gave lectures to share his experiences from the conflict. Known as ""Doc"", he was the senior medical officer of Plymouth-based 3 Commando Brigade and ran the field hospital at Ajax Bay where about 1,000 troops were treated. Despite the poor conditions, only three of the 580 British soldiers and Royal Marines wounded in action were to die of their wounds, and none while under his care. Rick Jolly OBE is the only man to have been decorated by Britain and Argentina for service during the Falklands conflict The hospital was known as the ""red and green life machine"" and this became the title of one of his books. He was appointed an OBE by the Queen, and awarded the Orden de Mayo (Order of May) by Argentina for his service during the war. Surgeon Cmdr Anthony Lambert met him several times, the first time shortly after he returned from the Falklands in 1982. He said: ""As medics, we aren't heroes, we just do our job. But he did his job incredibly well and was an inspiration to my generation"". Tributes on social media include the commanding officer of the Royal Marines 40 Commando who called him a ""true hero"".

"This video can not be played Passengers have criticised a 'mistimed' announcement on London's buses Bus passengers have criticised Transport for London (TfL) over a ""mistimed"" announcement designed to stop people falling over on board. The warning, ""Please hold on, the bus is about to move"", is supposed to sound just before buses pull away from stops. But a technical glitch means many warnings sound after the bus has started moving. Some passengers have branded the idea ""annoying and useless"", but TfL said it would make journeys safer. It said about 3,000 people were injured each year by slips, trips and falls on London buses. TfL said many of these happened ""because people have shopping in one hand and phones in the other"". But it accepted that the new warnings ""have not quite got the timing right yet"". ""Clearly there are some adjustments we need to make and we're working on that now,"" TfL's director of bus operations Claire Mann said The alert is currently triggered by a computer that sends out the message after the average amount of time a bus would spend at a bus stop. So for passengers on buses that spend less time at a stop, the alert does not sound until the bus is moving. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Plastic waste is ""one of the great environmental scourges of our time"". These are the words of Prime Minister Theresa May, who has pledged to ban all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042. About 6.3bn tonnes of plastic waste had been generated globally by 2015, with almost 80% of it going to landfills or the natural environment. And despite extending the 5p charge on single-use plastic bags, major retailers in England stillsold 2.1 billion,externalin the last financial year. In a bid to tackle the problem, the PM has called on supermarkets to introduce ""plastic-free"" aisles and consider taxes and charges on single-use plastic items like food containers. But organisations like Greenpeace UK are sceptical about the plan, citing Mrs May's ""vague aspirations"" and calling for ""concrete action"", such as a bottle deposit return scheme or a ""latte levy"" on disposable coffee cups. So what are Britain's 10 biggest supermarkets doing to combat the ""scourge"" of plastic? By 2025, Tesco wantsall its packaging to be recyclable or compostable,externaland its total packaging weight to be halved compared to 2007. It has removedall polystyrene from its fish packaging,external, and claims that more than 78% of its packaging is recyclable, though this depends on the type of material accepted by local authorities. Replacing two layer plastic trays with single layer plastic has also helped them toremove 92 tonnes of plastic,external. Sainsbury's has set a target toreduce packaging by a half by 2020,external, compared to 2005. It has also committed to remove all plastic cotton buds, a major source of ocean plastic pollution. The supermarket recycles carrier bags, and has achieved a33% reduction,externalin its own brand-packaging since 2006. Between 2015 and 2016, it also redesigned its two-pint milk bottles, saving580 tonnes of plastic a year,external. Asda has reduced the weight of its packagingby 27% since 2007,external, partly by introducing ""skin"" packaging on some of its meat products. It also saved82 tonnes of plastic,externalby making its two-litre own-brand water bottles lighter. Theresa May defends 'long-term' plastic waste plan Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Morrisons recycles its carrier bags and uses""returnable bins"",externalfor fish products to reduce the use of poly boxes. The company says it keeps95% of its store waste,externalout of direct landfill. It has also banned microbeads and plastic cotton buds in its own-brand cosmetic products, and plans to phase out drinking straws in its cafes. In September, ittrialled removing single-use carrier bags,externalentirely in six of its stores. Aldi wants tosource all its pulp-based packaging from certified forests,externalby 2020 and has seen arelative 11% reduction,externalin packaging of 11% between 2012 to 2015. It has not sent any waste directly to landfill since 2014, andrecycles 100%,externalof its cardboard and plastic. Co-Op aims for 80% of its products to have""easily recyclable"" packaging by 2020,external. It hasreplaced polystyrene pizza discs with cardboard,external, saving 200 tonnes of plastic from landfill, and uses single-plastic packaging for meat, poultry and fish products. It has alsosupported the idea,externalof a deposit return scheme for bottles. Waitrose has thinned its prepared salad bags and reduced smoked salmon packaging by 50%. It charges 30p or 40p for its food to be delivered or collected in plastic bags. Despite plastic bag charging, Waitrose says itsupplied 63 million,externalbags in England from April 2016 to April 2017. Byswitching to biodegradable cotton buds,external, Waitrose estimates it has saved 21 tonnes of plastic. Last July, the supermarketintroduced a new sandwich wrapper,external, the plastic and cardboard of which can be more easily separated for recycling than other packaging. It also trialled anon-plastic punnet,externalmade from tomato leaf and cardboard pulp in October, and does not sell any productscontaining microbeads,external. It plans to make its own-label packaging widely recyclable, reusable or home compostable by 2025. Lidl says it is in the process of setting targets for plastic waste. It removed microbeads from all its cosmetic and household products last year, and has also committed to switching to biodegradable cotton buds. For the last 24 years it has charged for plastic carrier bags, and it stopped selling single-use bags last year. Iceland announced plans in January 2018 toeliminate or drastically reduce plastic packagingof all its own-label products by the end of 2023.  It had previouslysupported the idea,externalof a deposit return scheme for bottles. Plastic bag charge: Where does the money go? M&S to stop selling 'cauliflower steak' Marks & Spencer says thatmore than 90%,externalof all its UK packaging is recyclable, and less than 1% (by weight) of all its packaging can be traced back to polystyrene. It hastrialled new materials,externalto replace its blackCPET (a type of plastic) packaging,external, and the foils in packaging for biscuits and crisps. Between 2007 and 2012 itreduced its total packaging by 25%,external, and between 2012 and 2014, its food packaging usage per itemdecreased by 10%,external. It is also looking at using plastics made from plant-based oils. Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said that while initiatives like these were good, ""more radical and comprehensive policies"" were needed to tackle the plastic waste crisis. ""We need to see supermarkets making firm commitments to move away from using disposable plastic packaging altogether, starting with going plastic free in their own brands."" Businesses should be using ""reusable containers wherever possible"", she said, and investment in research and development was ""vital"" to finding less problematic packaging materials. Supermarkets also needed to avoid solving one problem by causing another, such as reducing the weight of packaging by replacing glass with plastic, she said. But the most important step for retailers was to make an open commitment to reducing the use of resources and carbon emissions. ""None of these processes will be reliable without significantly increased transparency,"" she added. Greenpeace UK suggests retailers should: Eliminate all non-recyclable plastics from own brand products Remove single-use plastic packaging for own brand products Trial dispensers and refillable containers for own brand items like shampoos, house cleaning products, beverages Push national brand suppliers to eliminate non-recyclable plastics and to stop using single use plastic packaging Install free water fountains in-store and water re-fill stations Support deposit return schemes in-store Trial reusable packaging and product refills via home deliveries A spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was committed to stemming the damage caused by plastic waste and had made great progress in boosting recycling rates. ""We are encouraged by industry action to reduce plastic and packaging waste and look forward to seeing others following its lead,"" it said. Written and researched by Becca Meier.

"Many women in Sri Lanka see alcohol consumption as contrary to the nation's culture A move to grant women in Sri Lanka the same rights as men to buy alcohol legally has been overruled by President Maithripala Sirisena. He told a rally he had ordered the government to withdraw the reform, which would also have allowed women to work in bars without a permit. He said he had only found out about the move from the newspapers. The government announced on Wednesday it was amending a 1955 law, agreeing that it discriminated against women. Critics have accused the president of not taking gender equality seriously. ""This is not just about this archaic sexist law but the archaic sexist system in which this law is just one more tool of control,"" wrote one Sri Lankan blogger. Sri Lanka profile While the previous law was not always strictly enforced, many Sri Lankan women had welcomed the change. It would have allowed women over the age of 18 to buy alcohol legally for the first time in more than 60 years. A ban on alcohol being sold outside the hours of 09:00 to 21:00 would have been changed to allow sales between 08:00 and 22:00. Maithripala Sirisena has been president for three years Leading monks in the Buddhist-majority country had criticised the decision to lift the ban, arguing it  would destroy Sri Lankan family culture by getting more women addicted to alcohol. Saying he had listened to criticism of the government's step, President Sirisena told the rally he had ordered the government to withdraw its notification announcing the lifting of the ban. It came as no surprise to some as he runs an anti-alcohol campaign and has warned in the past that alcohol consumption among Sri Lankan women is increasing ""drastically"". However, commentators say the abrupt cancellation of the government's reform suggests there are differences within the coalition government. Mr Sirisena has encouraged women in the country to play a more active part in politics, boasting last year that his government had acted to ensure more women were returned at future elections. His apparent double standards over the alcohol issue drew anger from both women and men on Twitter on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Carrick Prentice-Underwood died on Thursday A couple have said they are ""heartbroken"" after losing a third child to a rare heart condition. Carrick Prentice-Underwood, 19, from Redditch, died on Thursday. It follows the death of his sister Charlotte, 16, in 2010 and 17-year-old brother Craig in 2013. Parents Robert and Maggie Underwood say they felt ""numb"" after their loss, but would continue fundraising for equipment that could help prevent future deaths. The couple have been calling fordefibrillators in schoolssince losing Charlotte. At the time, her death was put down toSudden Arrythmia Death Syndrome (Sads),external. Charlotte Prentice-Underwood was 16 when she died in December 2010 But when Craig died, he underwent tests which showed he hadVascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,external, which causes heart problems. They now believe that may also have been the cause of Charlotte's death. Their older children including Carrick, Christopher, 25, Caroline, 24, and Cameron, 17, had tests which showed they had the same genetic condition. Mr Underwood said they would now be pushing for tests for their younger children, five-year-old Poppy and Mitchell, seven. He added: ""We're just numb, angry, upset."" Carrick's parents said they felt ""numb"" They informed people of Carrick's death in theCharlotte and Craig Saving Hearts Foundation,externalFacebook group. The couple said: ""We are heartbroken, numb and totally lost."" They have received hundreds of messages of support online since the announcement. Craig Prentice-Underwood died almost exactly three years after the death of his sister, aged 17 Two days after Carrick's death, the couple and son Mitchell were outfundraising in Sainsbury's, Redditch, in his memory,external. Mr Underwood said: ""We are the Sainsbury's charity of the year and we have had a couple of dates set up. ""When it came to it, we thought about cancelling but we asked Mitchell what he wanted to do and he said he wanted to go fundraising for Carrick and the charity.

"Photographers Mario Testino and Bruce Weber have been suspended from working with fashion magazines including Vogue, amid allegations they sexually exploited male models and assistants. A series of claims,externalwere made against the pair in a New York Times article. Weber denies the claims, while lawyers for Testino said his accusers ""cannot be considered reliable sources"". Vogue publisher Conde Nast said it would not work with the men ""for the foreseeable future"". Artistic director Anna Wintour, who is also Vogue's editor-in-chief,external, said in a statement that the claims had ""been hard to hear and heartbreaking to confront"". In a separate statement,external, Wintour and Conde Naste chief Bob Sauerberg also said they were ""deeply disturbed"" by the accusations. Other Conde Nast titles include GQ and Vanity Fair. Anna Wintour, artistic director of Conde Nast, said the allegations had been ""hard to hear"" In a statement to the New York Times from his lawyer, Weber said he was ""shocked and saddened by the outrageous claims being made against me, which I absolutely deny"". Testino, whose past subjects include Kate Moss, Madonna, Michelle Obama and members of the Royal Family, was accused by 13 male assistants and models of subjecting them to sexual advances. The paper reported that the legal firm representing Testino, 63, said those complaining of harassment could not be considered reliable, and that his lawyers had spoken to several former employees who were ""shocked by the allegations"" and ""could not confirm any of the claims"". The allegations against Testino date back to the mid-1990s and include groping and masturbation, the paper reported. Ryan Locke, a model who worked with Testino on Gucci campaigns, described him as a ""sexual predator"". Hugo Tillman, a photographic assistant, said Testino pinned him down on a bed before being removed by another person. Another assistant, Roman Barrett, said sexual harassment was a ""constant reality"". He claims the photographer masturbated in front of him. In 2014, the Peruvian photographer wasmade an honorary OBEfor his services to photography and charity. Testino has also long had ties to the Royal Family, photographing Diana, Princess of Wales, and more recently the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeon their engagementand later, for the christening of Princess Charlotte.

"Mr Bolton took over as UKIP leader in September UKIP leader Henry Bolton has said he will not stand down, despite calls for his resignation over racist comments reportedly made by his girlfriend. Jo Marneyapologised in the Mail on Sunday,externalfor saying black people were ugly and Prince Harry's fiancee, Meghan Markle, would ""taint"" the Royal Family. Senior party members have questioned Mr Bolton's judgement, calling his private life an ""unhelpful distraction"". Butin a video,externalobtained by the Daily Mail, he said he would not resign. Ms Marney, a 25-year-old model, claimed her texts, published by the Mail on Sunday, were taken out of context. More offensive comments alleged to have been written by her have appeared in Monday's papers. Mr Bolton is due to speak to the media on Monday morning.

Mr Etheridge had previously said Mr Bolton, 54, should step aside ""quickly"", calling him a ""naive political lightweight"" whose personal life was distracting from policy. He cited several other complaints including a rise in membership fees, adding that Mr Bolton did not have the ""experience or the political nous or the correct advice to deal with the issue that he faces"". ""He must go, he must go quickly, he must go as quietly as possible,"" he said. Former UKIP leadership candidate Suzanne Evans told BBC News it was ""scandal after scandal with Mr Bolton"". Analysis:By BBC political correspondent, Alex Forsyth UKIP was riding high after the EU referendum result, but since then the party has struggled with internal divisions. When elected last September, Henry Bolton became its fourth leader in little over a year. Many had hoped he'd unite the party and restore its focus on Brexit. Now, as his future hangs in the balance, five UKIP members have come up with what they call a proposal for the party's transformation. MEPs Stuart Agnew and Bill Etheridge join Freddy Vachha, Ben Walker and Catherine Blaiklock to lead what they call an interim task force. It's stark in its assessment of UKIP's current standing - saying it doesn't deserve to run anything and is rightly perceived to be incompetent. The group suggests radical financial and structural changes - including an all-new managerial team, a new leader and a crackdown on rental costs and expenses. Whether their idea is adopted or not, most in UKIP recognise it needs a drastic solution to its current problems. The party chairman, Paul Oakden, said on Sunday that the leader had ""some difficult decisions"" to make. ""He intends on making those decisions today, and I'm sure whatever he does will be in the best interests of the party,"" he told BBC's Sunday Politics. Mr Oakden declined to give his own views on Mr Bolton's situation, but said the party needs to be ""behind our leader 100% in taking that battle (for Brexit) forward"". ""Whether or not the party decides it is willing to give that support to Henry is for the party to decide,"" he said. This video can not be played Henry Bolton tells the BBC's Daily Politics he did not want the publicity his relationship with a 25-year-old model attracted The Mail on Sunday said Ms Marney sent the messages three weeks before her relationship with Mr Bolton started. When a reply to one of her texts suggested her comments were racist, she added ""so what?"" and said she did not want other races invading her culture. In a statement to the newspaper, Ms Marney said: ""I apologise unreservedly for the shocking language I used. ""The opinions I expressed were deliberately exaggerated in order to make a point and have, to an extent, been taken out of context. Yet I fully recognise the offence they have caused."" Mr Bolton earlier replied to a party member online who urged him to call for Ms Marney to have her membership removed. ""She has to go or he and @UKIP are doomed if we let this behaviour happen in the party,"" the teenage activist said. In replying, Mr Bolton tweeted: ""Jo was suspended immediately upon us receiving this information.""

In a letter to supporters he said he expected his new relationship to be made public in The Sun newspaper. A photo of him with Ms Marney was also published on the front page of the Daily Mail. Mr Bolton said the story would ""confirm that in recent weeks I've had a change in my relationship status"" but ""might also suggest (inaccurately) that this change has involved a clandestine affair with a young lady who happens also to be a member of UKIP"". He said he had not ""hidden"" his new relationship and had made clear on social media that he had recently been spending time ""with somebody who has become increasingly important to me"". He continued: ""I am in a new relationship and the media have latched on to that. ""However, whilst I fully accept that as a national political figure I can expect to be the subject of media attention, I also believe we're all entitled to a certain degree of privacy. ""As such, I'll be making no further comment on the matter."" UKIP's youth wing, Young Independence, apologised for a post on Twitter about the news, later removed, whichthe Sun reported,externalpraised Mr Bolton for ""getting amongst the youth wing"" - alongside a picture of Ms Marney posing in her underwear. Ina statement,externalYoung Independence said the remarks ""do not represent the views"" of the group and it was looking into who might have published the tweet. Henry Bolton and wife Tatiana Smurova-Bolton Ms Marney posted photographs of herself celebrating Christmas Day and Boxing Day with Mr Bolton. He wrote on Twitter on New Year's Day: ""Myself and @Jo-Marney nearly run over by George Osborne in Covent Garden"". He urged UKIP supporters not to allow the relationship to distract him or the party from their ""vital mission"", promising a ""significant ramping up"" of political activity in the coming months.

"Jeremy Corbyn backed Remain in the EU referendum Jeremy Corbyn says Labour is ""not supporting or calling for a second referendum"" on the UK's EU membership. The party leader reiterated his call for MPs to have a ""meaningful vote"" on the final Brexit deal. Meanwhile, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said that if 90% of people were calling for another vote, it would present a challenge ""for all of us who are democrats"". But as things stand the UK is leaving the EU, she said. Mr Corbyn also hit back at critics within the party calling for the UK to remain in the EU single market and customs union after Brexit. ""The single market is dependent on membership of the European Union,"" he said. But he said the existing arrangements needed improvement. Sturgeon to decide on indyref2 by end of year Seven thoughts on an EU referendum Both Labour and the Conservatives have said the 2016 vote to leave the EU should be honoured. But some in the pro-EU campaign, like the Liberal Democrats and former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, want another referendum before the UK leaves the EU, which is due to happen in March 2019. And last week former UKIP leader Nigel Faragesaid a second vote might be neededto end the ""whinging and whining"" of anti-Brexit campaigners. This video can not be played UKIP MEP Nigel Farage talking on The Wright Stuff chat show Mr Corbyn was asked about this issue on ITV's Peston on Sunday. ""We are not supporting or calling for a second referendum,"" he said. ""What we have called for is a meaningful vote in Parliament."" When it was put to Mr Corbyn that he was not saying he would never support another referendum, the Labour leader said: ""We are not calling for one either"". On the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Ms Thornbery was asked about demands for a second nationwide vote. ""If 90% of the population was now saying we must stay in the European Union and we must not leave then that would be a challenge that would be there for all of us who are democrats,"" she said. ""But, at the moment, and as things currently stand, we proceed in good faith, we do as we are instructed and we are leaving the European Union."" While the result of the referendum means the UK must leave, she added that ""we have to look after the economy which, in my view, means that we don't go very far"". This video can not be played Bamboozled by Brexit? Get back to basics with the issues behind the talks Conservative deputy chairman James Cleverly said the two Labour politicians had ""failed to rule out a second referendum"". ""Every step of the way Labour are trying to frustrate the Brexit process rather than make a success of it,"" he said. Mr Corbyn is facing calls from within Labour - as well as other opposition parties - to commit to keeping Labour in the EU single market and customs union after Brexit. This is the goal of an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill being backed by the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Greens which returns to the Commons this week. Labour has said it wants the ""closest possible ties"" with EU markets after Brexit. Emily Thornberry said Labour would ""proceed in good faith"" on Brexit Mr Corbyn said the UK would ""obviously"" have to be in ""a customs union"" with the EU after Brexit, but suggested the existing arrangements needed improvements. But he expressed reservations about the EU single market, which allows for goods to be traded freely between EU members. ""There are aspects of the single market one wants to think about such as the restrictions on state aid to industry, which is something that I would wish to challenge,"" he said. He also called for changes to the EU customs union, which sets common external tariffs for countries outside the EU, suggesting it was ""in come cases protectionist against developing countries"". In his ITV interview, Mr Corbyn also criticised Donald Trump, accusing him of making ""endless offensive remarks"" about women, minorities and different faiths. Labour has been strongly critical of the US president and the decision to invite him on a state visit to the UK. Asked whether the UK's relationship with the US was the most important relationship it had with another country, the Labour leader replied: ""No. I think there are many important relationships. ""The US one is obviously culturally and economically significant and important. ""Also the trading relationships we have around the world with obviously the EU, but also with India and China and the rest of the world are very important. ""Also our relationship with international institutions such as the United Nations is very important."" Last week Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson accused Mr Corbyn and London mayor Sadiq Khan of putting the UK-US relationship ""at risk"" with their criticism of Mr Trump.

"Linda George's petition is called ""Leave the Historic Name of Bell End Alone"" Thousands of people have backed a counter-petition to save a street called Bell End after calls for the ""rude"" road name to be changed. Linda George said she was ""just amazed"" to see her fight to save the Black Country road name had ""gone global"", featuring in newspapers around world. Her petition, backed by nearly 5,000 supporters, said the ""historic"" name was believed to be after a local mine. Sandwell Council will ""consider the matter"" after receiving both petitions. Midlands Live: Two dead in light aircraft crash; Cyclist seriously hurt in hit-and-run after police chase Some residents say the name Bell End is causing amusement The original petition said some Rowley Regis residents believed the ""offensive word"" made them a ""laughing stock""and children were being bullied and teased because of it. The petition, backed by about 100 supporters, told the Labour-run council it was ""time for a change"", even to a similar name, such as Bell Road. But Mrs George, a local historian who runs the Facebook page ""I Remember Blackheath and Rowley Regis"", said residents she knew did not want this ""pointless change"", finding the idea ""deeply offensive"". The petition adds: ""If children are being bullied because of the name of their road, the problem is the bullying children, who need educating."" Following the death of Albert Harrold (pictured), his wife Sarah Jane and then one of their daughters ran a shop at Bell End Mrs George's great uncle, Albert Harrold, lived in Bell End and after he was killed during World War One, his widow Sarah Jane and their children ran a shop there until about 1960. Mrs George has fond memories of the area and still regularly visits, including recently helping pupils with a ceramic poppy project.

"Britain is still not a ""foodie nation"", Michelin-starred chef Angela Hartnett has said. She told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs that, while there is talk of the country now having a ""food culture, I genuinely don't think we do"". Hartnett said: ""We've lost home economics in a lot of schools. People aren't taught to shop."" She added that food culture in Britain ""is about money"". Hartnett, who learnt her skills making bread and pasta with her Italian grandmother, trained under Gordon Ramsay and opened her own London restaurant, Murano, in 2008. She told Desert Island Discs it would have been unimaginable at the start of her career to think that people would one day be ""fighting"" to become part of the UK's restaurant industry. But she said at home Britons were different from the Italians or the Spanish, ""where everyone... will go and buy a chicken and everyone can afford that chicken"". She said: ""Our food culture is about money. People who have money can afford good food in this country. ""When you haven't got any money [and] you're living on a low income, to patronise and sit there and say, 'You've got to have an organic chicken' is wrong. ""People don't have the time to shop and the time to cook. Everyone says we're a more unhealthy nation than ever and yet we're not doing anything about it."" Hartnett in 2003 after she took charge at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant at The Connaught hotel Hartnett recalled her grandmother never threw food away, adding people were now a ""bit lazy"" about that. The 49-year-old also told presenter Kirsty Young that by ""working and working and working"" in pursuit of her career as a chef, TV presenter and cookery writer, she had left it too late to have children. ""That's one regret unfortunately, but other than that I'm very happy with what's gone on,"" she said. Hartnett also said the one person she cannot cook alongside is her soon-to-be husband, Neil Borthwick, a chef she met when she headed the Gordon Ramsay-owned restaurant at The Connaught hotel. She said: ""He's a brilliant cook and he's got a great palate but he's messy and it drives me insane at home.""

"Carillion worked on the Battersea Power Station revamp The troubled government contractor Carillion has held talks with its creditor banks this weekend and further meetings are planned for Monday, the BBC understands. The construction firm owes Â£900m to RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Santander. The banks may be able to show Carillion more leniency if the government is able to do its part, according to sources. The firm's future is also being discussed by government officials. Carillion is involved in major public projects such as the HS2 high-speed rail line, as well as managing schools and prisons. Simon Jack: Carillion's uncertain future Where did it go wrong for Carillion? How exactly the banks want the government to intervene is unclear. They could want the government to offer some guarantees in case Carillion cannot pay back its debts. Or they may want the government to take some of Carillion's key projects back into the public sector. The TUC has called on the government to ""step in"" to ""guarantee jobs and services"". Deputy general secretary Paul Nowak said: ""Tens of thousands of jobs are now at risk, along with vital public services and major infrastructure projects across the country."" New Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis told the BBC the government was keeping ""a very close eye on this"". Mr Lewis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the government was ""making sure all plans and contingency plans are in place"". But he refused to be drawn on whether the government would bail Carillion out. ""It's a very commercially sensitive situation so I wouldn't comment further than to say I would hope to see that the working capital that they need will be there working with their partners,"" he said. Labour peer Lord Adonis,who last month quit a head of the National Infrastructure Commisson,tweeted that the government has ""got questions to answer about propping up Carillion with contracts long after its problems clear. Looks like another Grayling bailout!"" Last summer Transport Secretary Chris Grayling awarded Carillion part of the contract to build HS2, a week after the company had issued a profits warning and its chief executive had departed. Carillion's banks are owed about Â£900m, in the form of overdrafts as well as credit card facilities and other loans. The banks will likely show forbearance for a few weeks if a sustainable solution to this debt can be found. But they would also like the government to get involved when it comes to managing its key public contracts. This could mean that they would need taxpayers to act as guarantor on future payments from Carillion or that the important contracts to maintain schools and hospitals be taken back in house by Whitehall officials. The government is in a bind. Let Carillion fail and risk thousands of job losses, or bail it out and risk propping up a private company with public money - only a few months after it paid out dividends to its shareholders. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has urged the government not to agree to a taxpayer-funded bailout for Carillion. Alastair Stewart, a construction and property analyst at Stockdale Securities, said none of the solutions involving the government were ""particularly palatable"". ""The biggest intervention they could make is actually take a stake in the company as part of raising a large amount of capital, but they'll look back and look at the background of Lloyds and RBS,"" he said. Carillion has debts of Â£1.5bn, including a Â£587m pension shortfall. The UK's second-largest construction company employs 43,000 people worldwide, with about 20,000 of them in the UK. It specialises in construction, as well as facilities management and ongoing maintenance. As recently as 2016 it had sales of Â£5.2bn and until July 2017 its market capitalisation was close to Â£1bn. Since then, its share price has plummeted and it is now worth just Â£61m. Its problems stem in part from a string of risky contracts which have proved unprofitable. It also faced payment delays in the Middle East that hit its accounts. It has worked on high-profile projects, including the Battersea Power station redevelopment and the Anfield Stadium expansion. It is also the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail and maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence, manages nearly 900 schools and manages roads and prisons. The concern is that if it were to collapse these key public sector services could suffer a lot of disruption. Where did it go wrong for Carillion?

"This video can not be played Footage said to be filmed on Sunday 14 January showed huge plumes of smoke An oil tanker burning in the East China Sea for more than a week has finally sunk, Chinese media say. The Sanchi and a cargo ship collided 260km (160 miles) off Shanghai on 6 January, with the tanker then drifting south-east towards Japan. Iranian officials now say all 32 crew members - 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis - on the tanker are dead. The tanker was carrying 136,000 tonnes of ultra-light crude but Chinese officials say there is no major slick. China Central Television said that the Sanchi had gone down after ""suddenly igniting"" around noon (04:00 GMT). This video can not be played Bodies were airlifted off the tanker on Saturday Some 13 vessels and an Iranian commando unit had been taking part in the salvage operation, amid bad weather. A spokesman for the Iranian team, Mohammad Rastad, said there was no hope of finding any survivors. On Saturday, salvage workers had boarded the vessel and found the bodies of two crew members in a lifeboat. Only one other body had been found during the week of salvage operations. The rescue workers retrieved the ship's black box but had to leave quickly because of the toxic smoke and high temperatures. A map showing the initial collision point and approximate location a week later The Panama-flagged Sanchi was bringing the condensate from Iran to South Koreawhen the collision with the Hong Kong-registered freighter CF Crystal, carrying grain from the US, happened in the East China Sea. The crewmen of the Crystal were all rescued. The cause of the collision is still not known. After the collision the Sanchi drifted at about 2.2km/h (1.4mph), south-eastwards towards the Japanese island of Amami Oshima. Condensate is very different from the black crude that is often seen in oil spills. It is toxic, low in density and considerably more explosive than regular crude. Condensate creates products such as jet fuel, petrol, diesel and heating fuel. Oil tanker still burning as it sank.

"This video can not be played People were warned to take shelter Residents and visitors in Hawaii have been recalling the shock of a false missile alarm, with many saying they thought they were going to die. The alert of an incoming ballistic missile was sent wrongly on Saturday morning by an emergency system worker. Victims of the ordeal spoke of hysteria and panicked evacuations. The false alarm sparked recriminations, with state officials apologising and President Donald Trump's response called into question. How Hawaii reacted to false missile alert North Korea's missile programme How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? It was a mistake by an employee at Hawaii's Emergency Management Agency (EMA) who ""pushed the wrong button"" during procedures that occur during the handover of a shift. The message was reportedly sent despite an onscreen prompt requesting confirmation. Mobile phone users received the message at 08:07 (18:07 GMT): ""Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill."" The alert was corrected by email 18 minutes later,externalbut there was no follow-up mobile text for 38 minutes, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The alert system is in place because of the potential proximity of Hawaii to North Korean missiles. For some it was panic, a dash to a protective bathtub or hiding under manholes, contemplating what could be their last moments. For others, a resigned acceptance, thinking that staring at the beauty of Hawaii was not a bad way to go. Hassan Deen, a student at Hawaii Pacific University, told the BBC the alert sparked a frenzy and he was locked for 47 minutes with 29 other students in a room with rubbish bins. This video can not be played One man told US broadcaster CBS that he started running when the alarm sounded Emma Hine, who is visiting Hawaii from the UK, told the BBC: ""It was one of the worst experiences because I actually thought we were going to die. I've got a daughter - Chloe - back home in the UK and I thought 'I'm not going to get a chance to say goodbye'. Everyone was genuinely terrified."" Her son, Lewis, a disability campaigner, suffered a seizure due to stress. Marathon runner Lucja Leonard said she had heard of children being ""pushed into drainpipes to get them protected"". ""We all just huddled together and just thought - well, you know - if this is going to be the end I guess we're in a beautiful place, doing something we love but - God - it was pretty scary.""

The false alarm also threw golfers at the PGA Tour's Sony Open at the Waialae Country Club into panic.

Hawaii state officials were profusely apologetic. Governor David Ige said: ""I am sorry for the pain and confusion it caused. I, too, am extremely upset about this."" A federal investigation has started in the state and officials said they would work to ensure such a false alarm never happened again. Vern Miyagi, administrator of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, also apologised for the ""inadvertent mistake"" but said the threat was still there. Allow Twitter content?

Democratic House Representative Tulsi Gabbard said: ""Everyone in America needs to understand that if you had to go through this, you would be as angry as I am."" Brigette Namata, a television reporter in Honolulu, said it was ""mind-boggling that we have officials here, we have state workers that are in charge of our public safety and a huge, egregious, mistake like this happened"". One of the problems was that the alert system did not allow for a correction to be sent quickly to mobiles. State officials saida ""cancellation template"" would be created to address the problem, the New York Times reported,external. Two people are also now required to sign off the issuing of an alert, it said. State lawmakers are going to hold a hearing next Friday.

North Korea's missile and nuclear programme is seen as a growing threat to America. Hawaii is one of the US states closest to North Korea. In September Pyongyang carried out its sixth nuclear test. Last month, the Star-Advertiser reported that a missile launched from North Korea could strike Hawaii within 20 minutes of launch. So Hawaii has reintroduced Cold War-era warning sirens.

"Nicola Sturgeon said she would make a decision when the relationship between the UK and EU was clearer Nicola Sturgeon has said she will be able to make a judgment on whether to back a second referendum on Scottish independence by the end of this year. The first minister said her decision would be made when the shape of a deal between Britain and the European Union became clear in the autumn. Her comments come ahead of the publication of a Scottish government assessment on the impact of Brexit. The UK government has accused the SNP of trying to undermine the Brexit vote. The SNP delayed plans for a new vote on independence following the loss of 21 MPs in last year's general election. Speaking on theBBC's Andrew Marr Programme, the first minister said that people wanted to see clarity on the future relationship between the UK and Europe. Study suggests Brexit pessimism increasing Brexit: All you need to know SNP calls on Labour to keep UK in single market Sturgeon puts referdendum bill on hold She added: ""At that point, what I've said is that we will look at that and determine at that stage if Scotland should then have the right to choose between whatever that new relationship with the UK is going to be or choosing to be an independent country."" When asked if the timetable would be between October and the end of 2018, Ms Sturgeon responded: ""That's when I will be able to look at that and make a judgement about what the next appropriate steps are for Scotland, and I will then report that to the Scottish Parliament and to the people of Scotland."" She was challenged to acknowledge that a decision to hold a second referendum then would not leave enough time for the independence vote before the UK's planned withdrawal from the EU in March 2019. Ms Sturgeon said: ""We'll make decisions on timing when we get to that point and look at that."" This video can not be played The SNP leader says Labour MPs must get their ""act together"" and try to keep the UK in the single market Her comments on independence prompted criticism from her political opponents. Conservative MP John Lamont said: ""Yet again, Nicola Sturgeon would rather focus on indyref2 than deal with the crises she has created in both health and education. ""Nicola Sturgeon has no interest in securing a successful Brexit deal, all she cares about is a second independence referendum."" Ms Sturgeon was speaking as the Scottish government prepares to publish their assessment of the impact of Brexit on the Scottish economy. The first minister is adamant that Scotland should remain in the European Union single market and customs union after Brexit. She said she believed that a majority in the House of Commons wanted to stay in the single market, including those in the Labour Party, who needed to ""get their act together"". The paper will detail the potential impact on Scotland's GDP, trade and its potential to attract talent from out with the country. However, the UK government has already ruled out remaining part of the market. The customs union is the European Union's tariff-free trading area, which imposes the same taxes on imports from certain countries outside the EU. The single market also includes the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. The Scottish government's paper, titled Scotland's Place in Europe: People, Jobs and Investment, also details what it believes to be the benefits of the continued freedom of movement for workers from the European Union. The Scottish Conservatives have urged Ms Sturgeon to back UK-wide rules on trade and immigration rather than seeking any separate deal for Scotland. It follows the results of a UK-wide survey headed up by Sir John Curtice that suggested 59% of voters in Scotland backed an end to freedom of movement. The UK government called on the Scottish government to work with it for the benefit of the whole of the UK. A spokesman said: ""We are seeking a deal that works for the whole of the UK, that delivers on the result of the EU referendum. ""Rather than trying to undermine the result of a democratic referendum, we urge the Scottish government to work with us to ensure, as we leave the EU, we protect the UK's vital internal market. ""Scotland trades four times as much with the rest of the UK as it does with the EU, so it is vital that we ensure that market continues unimpeded."" Meanwhile, Labour has been urged to join a cross-party bid to keep the UK in the single market and customs union. The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Greens have joined forces to back an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill when it returns to the Commons this week. If passed, the move would stop ministers being able to use so-called Henry VIII powers to take Britain out of the single market and customs union. The move follows aBrexit summit by the leaders of the four parties which Labour refused to attend.

Speaking on theBBC's Andrew Marr Programme, the first minister said that people wanted to see clarity on the future relationship between the UK and Europe. Study suggests Brexit pessimism increasing Brexit: All you need to know SNP calls on Labour to keep UK in single market Sturgeon puts referdendum bill on hold She added: ""At that point, what I've said is that we will look at that and determine at that stage if Scotland should then have the right to choose between whatever that new relationship with the UK is going to be or choosing to be an independent country."" When asked if the timetable would be between October and the end of 2018, Ms Sturgeon responded: ""That's when I will be able to look at that and make a judgement about what the next appropriate steps are for Scotland, and I will then report that to the Scottish Parliament and to the people of Scotland."" She was challenged to acknowledge that a decision to hold a second referendum then would not leave enough time for the independence vote before the UK's planned withdrawal from the EU in March 2019. Ms Sturgeon said: ""We'll make decisions on timing when we get to that point and look at that."" This video can not be played The SNP leader says Labour MPs must get their ""act together"" and try to keep the UK in the single market Her comments on independence prompted criticism from her political opponents. Conservative MP John Lamont said: ""Yet again, Nicola Sturgeon would rather focus on indyref2 than deal with the crises she has created in both health and education. ""Nicola Sturgeon has no interest in securing a successful Brexit deal, all she cares about is a second independence referendum."" Ms Sturgeon was speaking as the Scottish government prepares to publish their assessment of the impact of Brexit on the Scottish economy. The first minister is adamant that Scotland should remain in the European Union single market and customs union after Brexit. She said she believed that a majority in the House of Commons wanted to stay in the single market, including those in the Labour Party, who needed to ""get their act together"". The paper will detail the potential impact on Scotland's GDP, trade and its potential to attract talent from out with the country. However, the UK government has already ruled out remaining part of the market. The customs union is the European Union's tariff-free trading area, which imposes the same taxes on imports from certain countries outside the EU. The single market also includes the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. The Scottish government's paper, titled Scotland's Place in Europe: People, Jobs and Investment, also details what it believes to be the benefits of the continued freedom of movement for workers from the European Union. The Scottish Conservatives have urged Ms Sturgeon to back UK-wide rules on trade and immigration rather than seeking any separate deal for Scotland. It follows the results of a UK-wide survey headed up by Sir John Curtice that suggested 59% of voters in Scotland backed an end to freedom of movement. The UK government called on the Scottish government to work with it for the benefit of the whole of the UK. A spokesman said: ""We are seeking a deal that works for the whole of the UK, that delivers on the result of the EU referendum. ""Rather than trying to undermine the result of a democratic referendum, we urge the Scottish government to work with us to ensure, as we leave the EU, we protect the UK's vital internal market. ""Scotland trades four times as much with the rest of the UK as it does with the EU, so it is vital that we ensure that market continues unimpeded."" Meanwhile, Labour has been urged to join a cross-party bid to keep the UK in the single market and customs union. The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Greens have joined forces to back an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill when it returns to the Commons this week. If passed, the move would stop ministers being able to use so-called Henry VIII powers to take Britain out of the single market and customs union. The move follows aBrexit summit by the leaders of the four parties which Labour refused to attend.

"Mark Wahlberg was paid $1.5m to do a reshoot of All The Money in the World, but his co-star was paid $80 a day Actor Mark Wahlberg has donated $1.5m (Â£1m) to the Time's Up legal defence fund. The move comes after it emerged that he was paid the sum to reshoot scenes for the film All The Money in the World. Wahlberg's co-star Michelle Williams was reportedly paid only $80 a day in expenses for the extra work. Scenes had to be reshot after Kevin Spacey was removed from the completed film following the allegations of predatory sexual behaviour. The Time's Up campaign is a movement against sexual harassment that was founded at the start of January in response to recent allegations in the media, film and broadcasting. Its legal fund will offer support to people who have experienced sexual harassment, abuse or assault in the workplace. This video can not be played Michelle Williams: 'I couldn't bear the thought of being in a movie that glorified somebody who had hurt people' ""Over the last few days, my reshoot fee for All the Money in the World has become an important topic of conversation,"" Wahlberg said in a statement. ""I 100% support the fight for fair pay and I'm donating the $1.5m to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund in Michelle Williams' name."" Hollywood agency William Morris Endeavor, which represents both stars, said it would also donate $500,000 to Time's Up. It had already pledged to give $1m earlier this month. Williams thanked those involved in the gesture, saying: ""Today isn't about me. My fellow actresses stood by me and stood up for me, my activist friends taught me to use my voice, and the most powerful men in charge, they listened and they acted. If we truly envision an equal world, it takes equal effort and sacrifice. ""Today is one of the most indelible days of my life because of Mark Wahlberg, WME and a community of women and men who share in this accomplishment."" Williams also paid tribute tothe actor who first came forward with allegations against Spacey. ""Anthony Rapp, for all the shoulders you stood on,"" she said, ""now we stand on yours."" The issue of sexual harassment and abuse has risen in prominenceafter allegations were made against a series of major figures in 2017, including Mr Spacey and producer Harvey Weinstein. Stars wore black to the Golden Globes awards in solidarity with campaigners against sexual harassment The #MeToo hashtag led to women and men from all walks of life opening up on social media about their experiences. In December 2017Time magazine named the ""Silence Breakers"" as its ""Person of the Year"". The existence of a ""gender pay gap"" has become a prominent issue across many sectors in recent months. Last week, the BBC's China Editor, Carrie Gracie, resigned from her postsaying she felt that she wasn't being paid the same amount as similarly prominent correspondents who are male. The BBC said in a statement that there was ""no systemic discrimination against women"" at the corporation.

"The recall was issued in December and French retailers have been threatened with legal action if they sell it More than 12 million boxes of powdered baby milk have now been recalled in 83 countries in a salmonella scandal involving French company Lactalis. The dairy firm's CEO, Emmanuel Besnier, confirmed the extent of the contamination risk to French media. The products have been subject to a recall since December, after salmonella bacteria was discovered at a factory. Lawsuits have been filed by parents who say their children became unwell after drinking the formula. A spokesman told the BBC that all the countries affected had been informed, in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa. The UK, US and Australia were not affected, he added. The Lactalis group is one of the world's largest producers of dairy products, with annual sales of â¬17bn ($21bn; Â£15bn), It has 246 production sites in 47 countries and employs 15,000 people in France alone. Recalls have now been issued by the firm three times, and cover its Picot, Milumel and Taranis brands. The Lactalis group employs 75,000 people around the world, according to its website Salmonella can cause severe diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting, and severe dehydration. It can be life-threatening, especially in young children. So far 35 cases have been reported in France and another one has been confirmed in Spain. Another possible case is being investigated in Greece, French authorities said on Friday. In an exclusive interview in French newspaper Journal du Dimanche,,externalthe Lactalis chief executive denied the firm had attempted to hide the outbreak at the plant. ""There are complaints and there will be an investigation with which we will fully collaborate,"" said Mr  Besnier. He also promised the company would compensate any families affected. French media reported that state inspectors cleared the site as safe during an inspection in September The company has said they believe the contamination was caused by renovation work at their Celia factory in Craon, in north-west France. France's agriculture minister said products from the factory will be banned indefinitely whilst the investigation is still ongoing. The French government has warned the company it must expect penalties over its handling of the affair. They also threatened to impose sanctions against retailers on Thursday, after it emerged thatseveral major supermarket chains had continued to sell products that could have been contaminated.

"Photographers Mario Testino and Bruce Weber have been suspended from working with fashion magazines including Vogue, amid allegations they sexually exploited male models and assistants. A series of claims,externalwere made against the pair in a New York Times article. Weber denies the claims, while lawyers for Testino said his accusers ""cannot be considered reliable sources"". Vogue publisher Conde Nast said it would not work with the men ""for the foreseeable future"". Artistic director Anna Wintour, who is also Vogue's editor-in-chief,external, said in a statement that the claims had ""been hard to hear and heartbreaking to confront"". In a separate statement,external, Wintour and Conde Naste chief Bob Sauerberg also said they were ""deeply disturbed"" by the accusations. Other Conde Nast titles include GQ and Vanity Fair. Anna Wintour, artistic director of Conde Nast, said the allegations had been ""hard to hear"" In a statement to the New York Times from his lawyer, Weber said he was ""shocked and saddened by the outrageous claims being made against me, which I absolutely deny"". Testino, whose past subjects include Kate Moss, Madonna, Michelle Obama and members of the Royal Family, was accused by 13 male assistants and models of subjecting them to sexual advances. The paper reported that the legal firm representing Testino, 63, said those complaining of harassment could not be considered reliable, and that his lawyers had spoken to several former employees who were ""shocked by the allegations"" and ""could not confirm any of the claims"". The allegations against Testino date back to the mid-1990s and include groping and masturbation, the paper reported. Ryan Locke, a model who worked with Testino on Gucci campaigns, described him as a ""sexual predator"". Hugo Tillman, a photographic assistant, said Testino pinned him down on a bed before being removed by another person. Another assistant, Roman Barrett, said sexual harassment was a ""constant reality"". He claims the photographer masturbated in front of him. In 2014, the Peruvian photographer wasmade an honorary OBEfor his services to photography and charity. Testino has also long had ties to the Royal Family, photographing Diana, Princess of Wales, and more recently the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeon their engagementand later, for the christening of Princess Charlotte.

"This video can not be played Footage said to be filmed on Sunday 14 January showed huge plumes of smoke An oil tanker burning in the East China Sea for more than a week has finally sunk, Chinese media say. The Sanchi and a cargo ship collided 260km (160 miles) off Shanghai on 6 January, with the tanker then drifting south-east towards Japan. Iranian officials now say all 32 crew members - 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis - on the tanker are dead. The tanker was carrying 136,000 tonnes of ultra-light crude but Chinese officials say there is no major slick. China Central Television said that the Sanchi had gone down after ""suddenly igniting"" around noon (04:00 GMT). This video can not be played Bodies were airlifted off the tanker on Saturday Some 13 vessels and an Iranian commando unit had been taking part in the salvage operation, amid bad weather. A spokesman for the Iranian team, Mohammad Rastad, said there was no hope of finding any survivors. On Saturday, salvage workers had boarded the vessel and found the bodies of two crew members in a lifeboat. Only one other body had been found during the week of salvage operations. The rescue workers retrieved the ship's black box but had to leave quickly because of the toxic smoke and high temperatures. A map showing the initial collision point and approximate location a week later The Panama-flagged Sanchi was bringing the condensate from Iran to South Koreawhen the collision with the Hong Kong-registered freighter CF Crystal, carrying grain from the US, happened in the East China Sea. The crewmen of the Crystal were all rescued. The cause of the collision is still not known. After the collision the Sanchi drifted at about 2.2km/h (1.4mph), south-eastwards towards the Japanese island of Amami Oshima. Condensate is very different from the black crude that is often seen in oil spills. It is toxic, low in density and considerably more explosive than regular crude. Condensate creates products such as jet fuel, petrol, diesel and heating fuel. Oil tanker still burning as it sank.

"Britain is still not a ""foodie nation"", Michelin-starred chef Angela Hartnett has said. She told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs that, while there is talk of the country now having a ""food culture, I genuinely don't think we do"". Hartnett said: ""We've lost home economics in a lot of schools. People aren't taught to shop."" She added that food culture in Britain ""is about money"". Hartnett, who learnt her skills making bread and pasta with her Italian grandmother, trained under Gordon Ramsay and opened her own London restaurant, Murano, in 2008. She told Desert Island Discs it would have been unimaginable at the start of her career to think that people would one day be ""fighting"" to become part of the UK's restaurant industry. But she said at home Britons were different from the Italians or the Spanish, ""where everyone... will go and buy a chicken and everyone can afford that chicken"". She said: ""Our food culture is about money. People who have money can afford good food in this country. ""When you haven't got any money [and] you're living on a low income, to patronise and sit there and say, 'You've got to have an organic chicken' is wrong. ""People don't have the time to shop and the time to cook. Everyone says we're a more unhealthy nation than ever and yet we're not doing anything about it."" Hartnett in 2003 after she took charge at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant at The Connaught hotel Hartnett recalled her grandmother never threw food away, adding people were now a ""bit lazy"" about that. The 49-year-old also told presenter Kirsty Young that by ""working and working and working"" in pursuit of her career as a chef, TV presenter and cookery writer, she had left it too late to have children. ""That's one regret unfortunately, but other than that I'm very happy with what's gone on,"" she said. Hartnett also said the one person she cannot cook alongside is her soon-to-be husband, Neil Borthwick, a chef she met when she headed the Gordon Ramsay-owned restaurant at The Connaught hotel. She said: ""He's a brilliant cook and he's got a great palate but he's messy and it drives me insane at home.""

The Time's Up campaign is a movement against sexual harassment that was founded at the start of January in response to recent allegations in the media, film and broadcasting. Its legal fund will offer support to people who have experienced sexual harassment, abuse or assault in the workplace. This video can not be played Michelle Williams: 'I couldn't bear the thought of being in a movie that glorified somebody who had hurt people' ""Over the last few days, my reshoot fee for All the Money in the World has become an important topic of conversation,"" Wahlberg said in a statement. ""I 100% support the fight for fair pay and I'm donating the $1.5m to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund in Michelle Williams' name."" Hollywood agency William Morris Endeavor, which represents both stars, said it would also donate $500,000 to Time's Up. It had already pledged to give $1m earlier this month. Williams thanked those involved in the gesture, saying: ""Today isn't about me. My fellow actresses stood by me and stood up for me, my activist friends taught me to use my voice, and the most powerful men in charge, they listened and they acted. If we truly envision an equal world, it takes equal effort and sacrifice. ""Today is one of the most indelible days of my life because of Mark Wahlberg, WME and a community of women and men who share in this accomplishment."" Williams also paid tribute tothe actor who first came forward with allegations against Spacey. ""Anthony Rapp, for all the shoulders you stood on,"" she said, ""now we stand on yours."" The issue of sexual harassment and abuse has risen in prominenceafter allegations were made against a series of major figures in 2017, including Mr Spacey and producer Harvey Weinstein. Stars wore black to the Golden Globes awards in solidarity with campaigners against sexual harassment The #MeToo hashtag led to women and men from all walks of life opening up on social media about their experiences. In December 2017Time magazine named the ""Silence Breakers"" as its ""Person of the Year"". The existence of a ""gender pay gap"" has become a prominent issue across many sectors in recent months. Last week, the BBC's China Editor, Carrie Gracie, resigned from her postsaying she felt that she wasn't being paid the same amount as similarly prominent correspondents who are male. The BBC said in a statement that there was ""no systemic discrimination against women"" at the corporation.

"Brandon Lewis became party chairman in last week's reshuffle Conservative candidates will be suspended if they insult rivals, the new party chairman says. Brandon Lewis said a new code of conduct would require people standing for Parliament to ""behave responsibly and show respect"" to others. Mr Lewis urged Labour to sign up to the same guidelines as he vowed to improve the Tories' digital campaigning operation. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said respect should be ""the norm in public life"". Asked about previous remarks by his shadow chancellor John McDonnell, Mr Corbyn said: ""I would rather stick to where I disagree with somebody on their policies."" MPs tell of death threats and abuse The 'sinister' election abuse received by MPs In 2015 Mr McDonnell described Conservative Esther McVey, who was last week made the new work and pensions secretary, as a ""stain of inhumanity"", and he has also been criticised for quoting someone talking about ""lynching"" her during a meeting in 2014. This video can not be played John McDonnell was quoting one of Ms McVey's constituents during a comedy night in 2014 This was used by Mr Lewis to claim there was a ""rot"" at the top of the Labour Party. But Mr Corbyn told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""It's a basic in the Labour Party that you treat people with respect. I don't do personal abuse, I don't expect candidates to do so."" Mr Lewis - who was made Tory chairman in last week's reshuffle - also set out his plans to improve the Tories' online campaigning.

Mr Lewistold the Sunday Telegraph,externalyoung Tory activists would be given a digital ""toolkit"" of graphics, Gifs and videos to help them. The Great Yarmouth MP said the party needed to be ""very positive and proactive about outlining what we're doing in government... so we can enthuse them about being Conservative and... not just vote for us but get involved"". The Conservatives are trying to boost their social media campaigning strategy Mr Lewis said his focus would be on getting the party ""battle ready"" for the next general election and prepared for some ""really difficult local elections"" in May. He added: ""It's not just young people, older people are accessing their information through the digital world as well... It's important that we've got to engage through that medium."" Appearing on the Andrew Marr Show, Mr Lewis also defended a Tory social media campaign that promoted a new ban on credit card surcharges.

Mr Lewis said that while the UK remained in the EU, Conservative MEPs were ""fully represented and part of the process of making those decisions"". Mr Lewis also defended the Tories' failure to provide figures for the total number of party members they have. According to some estimates, their numbers have fallen behind Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats. Asked how it compared with Labour's membership, which has surged beyond 500,000, Mr Lewis said he was ""not going to play a numbers game"", and that he planned to obtain an overall figure which was not currently available.

Mobile phone users received a message saying: ""Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill."" State Governor David Ige apologised and said it was caused by an employee pressing the wrong button. The US government announced there would be a full investigation.

It was corrected by email 18 minutes later,externalbut there was no follow-up mobile text for 38 minutes, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports.

"Manning had her sentence commuted by Barack Obama in his final days of office Chelsea Manning, the former US intelligence analyst who was jailed for leaking classified documents, is seeking the Democratic Party nomination to run for the US senate in Maryland. In 2013 Manning was sentenced to 35 years after being found guilty of 20 charges, including espionage. But former US President Barack Obama commuted her sentence. The 30-year-old, previously known as Bradley Manning, will challenge Democratic Senator Ben Cardin for the nomination. The former US soldier moved to Maryland after being released from prison in May 2017. Manning was arrested in Iraq in 2010 for sharing more than 700,000 confidential documents, videos and diplomatic cables with anti-secrecy website Wikileaks. Chelsea Manning: Wikileaks source and her turbulent life Manning said she shared the documents to spark public debate about US foreign policy, but US officials said the release of material put lives at risk. The case and Manning herself continue to be politically divisive in the United States. Former President Obama said the sentence she was given was ""disproportionate"", but President Donald Trump has labelled her an ""ungrateful traitor"" who ""should never have been released from prison"". Manning has remained in the public eye since her release, writing for publications like The Guardian Since her release Manning has remained active on social media, and has continued to discuss issues such as government transparency, free speech and transgender rights. Speaking to Vogue in August, she refused to discount running for political office in the future,external. ""My goal is to use these next six months to figure out where I want to go,"" she told the magazine. Manning will be challenging 74-year-old incumbent Senator Cardin for the Democratic nomination. Mr Cardin has held the Maryland seat since 2007, and is favourite to retain the seat for a third term in the heavily-Democratic state.

"This video can not be played The government is seeking to calm days of unrest The Tunisian government has announced a wave of social reforms, reacting to days of demonstrations by anti-austerity protesters. There were fresh protests on Sunday, the seventh anniversary of the ousting of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. Emergency government meetings have been held in response to the protests, which have seen more than 800 arrests. President Beji Caid Essebsi visited a district of Tunis on Sunday, saying he understood the people's suffering. Protesters have taken to the streets again following calls from opposition parties. They argue conditions have not improved since Ben Ali was deposed as president at the start of the so-called Arab Spring uprisings. Demonstrations began on 7 January after the government raised value-added tax and social contributions, and increased some prices on goods in its 2018 budget. Rallies have taken place in at least 10 different areas. Tunisia: The revolution that didn't deliver for women On Sunday, hundreds of people poured into one of the flashpoints of the 2011 uprising, Habib Bourguiba Avenue in Tunis. This video can not be played Some anti-austerity protests have turned violent in recent days Demonstrators also rallied outside the offices of the UGTT union, demanding the budget be abandoned and venting anger at price rises. Last week saw a wave of protests, some of which turned violent after dark. The government accused demonstrators of setting fire to police cars and attacking officials. Some people tried to take over shopping malls and stores, while others blocked roads. In the town of Thala, near the Algerian border, the army was called in on Wednesday after protesters burned down the national security offices and police were forced to retreat. Interior ministry spokesman Khlifa Chibani said on Saturday that 803 people had been arrested so far on suspicion of violence, theft and looting. He said 97 members of the security forces had been injured, but did not say how many protesters had been hurt. Demonstrators accused police of a violent crackdown. The announcement came after two hours of crisis talks at the presidential palace that included President Essebsi, political parties and trade unionists. Political parties, unions and employers met on Saturday for crisis talks amid protests Officials said plans had been submitted to parliament to reform medical care, housing and increase aid to the poor. Social affairs minister Mohammed Trabelsi said the government proposed increasing welfare payments to those in need by 170m dinars ($70m; Â£50m). ""This will affect about 250,000 families. It will help the poor and middle class,"" he said. Mr Trabelsi also alluded to plans for guaranteed medical care and housing reform. He visited the marginalised Tunis district of Ettdhamon, opening a youth centre there. In a short and informal speech, he promised to address youth unemployment and highlighted the government's move to help poorer families, saying: ""We feel for you, these are our families."" But he also said: ""Be modest, your country does not have a lot of means."" Tunisia has been struggling economically since Ben Ali was ousted after more than 20 years in power. That revolution was sparked by high unemployment and worries about corruption. Seven years on, some of the same problems remain. Youth unemployment stands at more than 35%, the UN's International Labour Organisation says. Terror attacks that hit the country's vital tourism industry have helped knock its currency down 60% since 2011. Inflation is at a three-and-a-half-year high, with the price of meat and other foods rising by more than 10% annually. In December 2017, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) told Tunisia it needed to take ""urgent action"" and ""decisive measures"" to reduce its deficit. The IMF gave the country a $2.9bn (Â£2.2bn) loan in 2015. Ben Ali, who lives in exile in Saudi Arabia, was convicted in absentia by a Tunisian court in 2011 of embezzlement and misuse of public funds and sentenced to 35 years.

"Nicola Sturgeon said she would make a decision when the relationship between the UK and EU was clearer Nicola Sturgeon has said she will be able to make a judgment on whether to back a second referendum on Scottish independence by the end of this year. The first minister said her decision would be made when the shape of a deal between Britain and the European Union became clear in the autumn. Her comments come ahead of the publication of a Scottish government assessment on the impact of Brexit. The UK government has accused the SNP of trying to undermine the Brexit vote. The SNP delayed plans for a new vote on independence following the loss of 21 MPs in last year's general election. Speaking on theBBC's Andrew Marr Programme, the first minister said that people wanted to see clarity on the future relationship between the UK and Europe. Study suggests Brexit pessimism increasing Brexit: All you need to know SNP calls on Labour to keep UK in single market Sturgeon puts referdendum bill on hold She added: ""At that point, what I've said is that we will look at that and determine at that stage if Scotland should then have the right to choose between whatever that new relationship with the UK is going to be or choosing to be an independent country."" When asked if the timetable would be between October and the end of 2018, Ms Sturgeon responded: ""That's when I will be able to look at that and make a judgement about what the next appropriate steps are for Scotland, and I will then report that to the Scottish Parliament and to the people of Scotland."" She was challenged to acknowledge that a decision to hold a second referendum then would not leave enough time for the independence vote before the UK's planned withdrawal from the EU in March 2019. Ms Sturgeon said: ""We'll make decisions on timing when we get to that point and look at that."" This video can not be played The SNP leader says Labour MPs must get their ""act together"" and try to keep the UK in the single market Her comments on independence prompted criticism from her political opponents. Conservative MP John Lamont said: ""Yet again, Nicola Sturgeon would rather focus on indyref2 than deal with the crises she has created in both health and education. ""Nicola Sturgeon has no interest in securing a successful Brexit deal, all she cares about is a second independence referendum."" Ms Sturgeon was speaking as the Scottish government prepares to publish their assessment of the impact of Brexit on the Scottish economy. The first minister is adamant that Scotland should remain in the European Union single market and customs union after Brexit. She said she believed that a majority in the House of Commons wanted to stay in the single market, including those in the Labour Party, who needed to ""get their act together"". The paper will detail the potential impact on Scotland's GDP, trade and its potential to attract talent from out with the country. However, the UK government has already ruled out remaining part of the market. The customs union is the European Union's tariff-free trading area, which imposes the same taxes on imports from certain countries outside the EU. The single market also includes the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. The Scottish government's paper, titled Scotland's Place in Europe: People, Jobs and Investment, also details what it believes to be the benefits of the continued freedom of movement for workers from the European Union. The Scottish Conservatives have urged Ms Sturgeon to back UK-wide rules on trade and immigration rather than seeking any separate deal for Scotland. It follows the results of a UK-wide survey headed up by Sir John Curtice that suggested 59% of voters in Scotland backed an end to freedom of movement. The UK government called on the Scottish government to work with it for the benefit of the whole of the UK. A spokesman said: ""We are seeking a deal that works for the whole of the UK, that delivers on the result of the EU referendum. ""Rather than trying to undermine the result of a democratic referendum, we urge the Scottish government to work with us to ensure, as we leave the EU, we protect the UK's vital internal market. ""Scotland trades four times as much with the rest of the UK as it does with the EU, so it is vital that we ensure that market continues unimpeded."" Meanwhile, Labour has been urged to join a cross-party bid to keep the UK in the single market and customs union. The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Greens have joined forces to back an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill when it returns to the Commons this week. If passed, the move would stop ministers being able to use so-called Henry VIII powers to take Britain out of the single market and customs union. The move follows aBrexit summit by the leaders of the four parties which Labour refused to attend.

"This video can not be played ""You can't look down"" while wearing a royal crown, the Queen tells royal commentator Alastair Bruce A sacred oil made from orange flowers and jasmine was used to anoint the Queen during her coronation, a new BBC documentary will reveal. The oil, which dates back to the 17th century, is held in great secrecy by the Dean of Westminster at the Abbey. In the hour-long programme - The Coronation - the Queen talks to royal commentator Alastair Bruce about the ceremony in 1953. The Queen also discusses her childhood memories of her father's coronation. As an 11-year-old, the then princess wrote that the arches of Westminster Abbey were covered in ""a sort of haze of wonder"" when King George VI was crowned in 1937. ""I remember my father making me write down what I remembered about his coronation. It was very valuable,"" the Queen tells the presenter.

On 2 June 1953, live cameras filming the ceremony turned away during this symbolic moment. During the programme, Dr John Hall, Dean of Westminster, says the oil from 1953 is kept safe in a flask in deanery. While the exact recipe of the oil is not known, Dr Hall said: ""The composition of the oil was founded upon that used in the 17th century. ""Then you see what it consists of sesame seed and olive oil, perfume with roses, orange flowers, jasmine, musk, civet and ambergris."" For the ceremony, the oil is kept in a solid gold flask called an ampulla, shaped like an eagle. Queen Elizabeth II walks and the Archbishop of Canterbury during her coronation The documentary gives an insight into the scale of preparations required for the coronation ceremony ""For six months, they closed the abbey,"" Dr Hall said. ""They laid a railway track down the centre of the abbey, bringing in tonnes and tonnes of wood and iron."" Some 8,000 people fitted into the abbey for the occasion in 1953. On Sunday, the Queen will also feature in a special Songs of Praise episode marking 150 years of Christian charity, the Scripture Union. The pre-recorded event is hosted by singer Katherine Jenkins and airs on BBC One on 14 January at 16:30 GMT. The Coronation will be screened on BBC One on Sunday 14 January at 20:00.

"The future of troubled engineering company Carillion is being discussed at high-level government meetings this weekend, the BBC understands. The firm is a key government contractor for projects including the HS2 high-speed rail scheme, schools and prisons. Sources say the firm has a ""matter of days"" as it teeters on the edge of collapse, with Â£1.5bn of debt including a pension shortfall of Â£587m. Carillion is trying to reach an agreement with creditors. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the government must not bail out the struggling construction company, the second largest in the UK. Sir Vince, a former business secretary, told BBC Breakfast: ""They've got to force the shareholders and indeed the creditors, the big banks, to take losses, and then the government can take responsibility for taking the contracts forward and making sure they are delivered."" Simon Jack: Carillion's uncertain future Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Jon Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, called on the government to take contracts back into public control, describing its relationship with the Carillion as a ""failing ideological project"". ""It has been clear for months that Carillion has been in difficulty but the government has continued to hand over contracts to the company,"" he said. In 2016 the Wolverhampton-based company, which employs 43,000 people globally, had sales of Â£5.2bn and until July boasted a market capitalisation of almost Â£1bn. But since then its share price has plummeted and it is now valued at about Â£61m. Officials from the justice, transport and business departments will gather this weekend for a meeting chaired by the Cabinet Office. The consultancy EY has been put on notice in case the company falls into administration. On Friday, reports that creditors had rejected a potential rescue plan sent Carillion's shares down by more than 28%. By BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam A decade ago the government bailed out the banks because - being central to the workings of the entire economy - they were ""too big to fail"". Now the same issue of moral hazard arises for the engineering giant Carillion. If it collapses, what happens to politically sensitive work that it does, such as building hospitals and running schools, jails or Ministry of Defence facilities? Pausing that work until new contracts are tendered, bid for and awarded would take years. But bailing out a private company like Carillion, which paid out dividends to its shareholders last year, won't play well with taxpayers. So Carillion will either have to restructure its debts within days with its now impatient banks or file for administration and hope that EY can find a solution which is quick, clever and doesn't cost jobs. This video can not be played Bailing out Carillion 'would send the wrong message', Vince Cable says. But in Friday's statement, Carillion said: ""Suggestions that Carillion's business plan has been rejected by stakeholders are incorrect."" It said the firm remained in constructive dialogue about short-term financing while ""longer term discussions are continuing"". The government has said it is ""monitoring the situation closely"". A government spokeswoman said: ""Carillion is a major supplier to the government with a number of long-term contracts. We are committed to maintaining a healthy supplier market and work closely with our key suppliers."" The BBC understands that the Ministry of Justice has drawn up plans to bring Â£200m of prison contracts run by Carillion back into public control. Carillion, which was founded in the late 1990s as a spin-off from building giant Tarmac, also operates in Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean. It has worked on key projects overseas including the Suez Canal road tunnel and Toronto's Union Station. It is also the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail. The general secretary of the RMT rail union, Mick Cash, said the government should give Carillion's workers ""clear-cut assurances"", as thousands of jobs were ""hanging by a thread"". It also wants an assurance that operations would be directly transferred over to Network Rail if Carillion goes bust. Where did it go wrong for Carillion?

"This video can not be played The government is seeking to calm days of unrest The Tunisian government has announced a wave of social reforms, reacting to days of demonstrations by anti-austerity protesters. There were fresh protests on Sunday, the seventh anniversary of the ousting of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. Emergency government meetings have been held in response to the protests, which have seen more than 800 arrests. President Beji Caid Essebsi visited a district of Tunis on Sunday, saying he understood the people's suffering. Protesters have taken to the streets again following calls from opposition parties. They argue conditions have not improved since Ben Ali was deposed as president at the start of the so-called Arab Spring uprisings. Demonstrations began on 7 January after the government raised value-added tax and social contributions, and increased some prices on goods in its 2018 budget. Rallies have taken place in at least 10 different areas. Tunisia: The revolution that didn't deliver for women On Sunday, hundreds of people poured into one of the flashpoints of the 2011 uprising, Habib Bourguiba Avenue in Tunis. This video can not be played Some anti-austerity protests have turned violent in recent days Demonstrators also rallied outside the offices of the UGTT union, demanding the budget be abandoned and venting anger at price rises. Last week saw a wave of protests, some of which turned violent after dark. The government accused demonstrators of setting fire to police cars and attacking officials. Some people tried to take over shopping malls and stores, while others blocked roads. In the town of Thala, near the Algerian border, the army was called in on Wednesday after protesters burned down the national security offices and police were forced to retreat. Interior ministry spokesman Khlifa Chibani said on Saturday that 803 people had been arrested so far on suspicion of violence, theft and looting. He said 97 members of the security forces had been injured, but did not say how many protesters had been hurt. Demonstrators accused police of a violent crackdown. The announcement came after two hours of crisis talks at the presidential palace that included President Essebsi, political parties and trade unionists. Political parties, unions and employers met on Saturday for crisis talks amid protests Officials said plans had been submitted to parliament to reform medical care, housing and increase aid to the poor. Social affairs minister Mohammed Trabelsi said the government proposed increasing welfare payments to those in need by 170m dinars ($70m; Â£50m). ""This will affect about 250,000 families. It will help the poor and middle class,"" he said. Mr Trabelsi also alluded to plans for guaranteed medical care and housing reform. He visited the marginalised Tunis district of Ettdhamon, opening a youth centre there. In a short and informal speech, he promised to address youth unemployment and highlighted the government's move to help poorer families, saying: ""We feel for you, these are our families."" But he also said: ""Be modest, your country does not have a lot of means."" Tunisia has been struggling economically since Ben Ali was ousted after more than 20 years in power. That revolution was sparked by high unemployment and worries about corruption. Seven years on, some of the same problems remain. Youth unemployment stands at more than 35%, the UN's International Labour Organisation says. Terror attacks that hit the country's vital tourism industry have helped knock its currency down 60% since 2011. Inflation is at a three-and-a-half-year high, with the price of meat and other foods rising by more than 10% annually. In December 2017, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) told Tunisia it needed to take ""urgent action"" and ""decisive measures"" to reduce its deficit. The IMF gave the country a $2.9bn (Â£2.2bn) loan in 2015. Ben Ali, who lives in exile in Saudi Arabia, was convicted in absentia by a Tunisian court in 2011 of embezzlement and misuse of public funds and sentenced to 35 years.

"Angiosperms produce flowers and fruits, which contain their seeds. Scientists think they have the answer to a puzzle that baffled even Charles Darwin: How flowers evolved and spread to become the dominant plants on Earth. Flowering plants, or angiosperms, make up about 90% of all living plant species, including most food crops. In the distant past, they outpaced plants such as conifers and ferns, which predate them, but how they did this has has been a mystery. New research suggests it is down to genome size - and small is better. ""It really comes down to a question of cell size and how you can build a small cell and still retain all the attributes that are necessary for life,"" says Kevin Simonin from San Francisco State University in California, US. Hundreds of millions of years ago, the Earth was dominated by ferns and conifers. Then, about 150 million years ago, the first flowering plants appeared on the scene. They quickly spread to all parts of the world, changing the landscape from muted green to a riot of vibrant colour. Angiosperms are the most diverse group of land plants, with hundreds of thousands of known species The reasons behind the incredible success and diversity of flowering plants have been debated for centuries. Charles Darwin himself called it an ""abominable mystery"", fearing this apparent sudden leap might challenge his theory of evolution. Simonin and co-researcher Adam Roddy, of Yale University, wondered if the size of the plant's genetic material - or genome - might be important. The biologists analysed data held by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, on the genome size of hundreds of plants, including flowering plants, gymnosperms (a group of plants, which include conifers and Ginkgo) and ferns. They then compared genome size with anatomical features such as the abundance of pores on leaves. This provides ""strong evidence"", they say, that the success and rapid spread of flowering plants around the world is down to ""genome downsizing"". By shrinking the size of the genome, which is contained within the nucleus of the cell, plants can build smaller cells. In turn, this allows greater carbon dioxide uptake and carbon gain from photosynthesis, the process by which plants use light energy to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Angiosperms can pack more veins and pores into their leaves, maximising their productivity. The researchers say genome-downsizing happened only in the angiosperms, and this was ''a necessary prerequisite for rapid growth rates among land plants''. ""The flowering plants are the most important group of plants on Earth and now we finally know why they have been so successful,"" they say. The research published in the journal PLOS Biology,externalraises more questions about plants. For instance, why were flowering plants able to shrink their genomes more than others? And why do ferns and conifers still exist, despite their large genomes and cells? Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

What we learned at the Brits nominations Brit Awards 2018: The nominations Dua Lipa interview: 'Chris Martin made me feel really calm' Jack Whitehall to host 2018 Brit Awards One notable absence from this year's shortlist was Sam Smith. His album, The Thrill Of It All, was the third biggest seller of 2017 but received no nominations. However, its November release date means it will be eligible again next year - and Smith will perform at this year' ceremony, at London's O2 Arena on 21 February, along with Rag'n'Bone Man, Foo Fighters and Ed Sheeran. Liam Payne's Strip That Down has been the most successful solo single by a former One Direction member The fan-voted best video category sees a fight between three former members of One Direction. Harry Styles' Sign of the Times will go up against Zayn and Taylor Swift's I Don't Wanna Live Forever and Liam Payne's Strip That Down. ""That's fantastic,"" Payne told BBC News. ""The fact that we've just come out of our band and everyone's already up for these things, it's fantastic. ""I'm not going to put a bet on myself,"" he added. ""There was some fantastic music out last year. I'm just happy to be part of that."" The star also revealed the last time he had been to the Brits, he and his partner Cheryl Tweedy ""were still in hiding with our relationship"". ""We snuck out of the Brits together, and we bumped into every single newspaper person we could possibly bump into - which I thought was really hilarious!"" Dua Lipa, 22, was raised in the UK but at the age of 13 she moved with her parents to their former home of Kosovo. Two years later, she returned to London alone to pursue music, while scraping a living in bars and pubs. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

After a series of increasingly popular singles, she found success with last summer's female empowerment anthem New Rules, in which the star writes a four-step plan for avoiding her ex. She ended the year as the UK's most-streamed female artist on Spotify, while her eye-catching New Rules video has been watched more than 892 million times on YouTube. Her competition in the best female category comes from Jessie Ware, Kate Tempest and former winners Laura Marling and Paloma Faith. It is Faith's fifth nomination, much to the star's astonishment. Paloma Faith performed at the nominations show ""I keep pinching myself because I feel like it's a very fickle industry,"" she said. ""There's so many people over the years that I've been on this particular carpet with that I don't see any more."" Other returning nominees include Gorillaz and Wolf Alice, up for best British group, while Liam Gallagher gets his first nomination as a solo artist in the best British male category. East London MC J Hus picked up three nominations for his debut album Common Sense, a border-hopping brew of the music that inspired him - from G-funk to bashment via afrobeat, UK garage and R&B. ""Three nominations. I at least have to take home one,"" the 21-year-old said. Last year's Brit Awards were hailed for the diversity of their nominees - but in the end, no black British artists took home an award. Brits 2017: The real winners and losers Brit Awards 2017: David Bowie dominates J Hus, whose real name is Momodou Jallow, said he hoped the situation would be corrected in 2018. He said: ""100% we can turn it around this year. But even if I don't take anything away, I'm happy to be amongst so many big artists. It's just crazy."" J Hus said he was ""honoured"" to be nominated The nominations were revealed in a live programme on ITV1, featuring performances from Paloma Faith, J Hus, Liam Payne and Clean Bandit. Soul singer Jorja Smith also performed her new single Let Me Down alongside best British male nominee Stormzy. Walsall-born Smith, who featured on Drake's More Life mixtape last year, was also presented with the Brits Critics' Choice Award, which singles out an artist to watch in the coming year. The prize, which has previously gone to the likes of Adele and Florence and the Machine, is one of two awards to be announced in advance. The other - best producer - has gone to Little Mix and Liam Payne collaborator Steve Mac. This year's winners will receive a specially designed statue by Anish Kapoor Despite Dua's domination of the shortlist, it seems probable that Sheeran's massive commercial success will be recognised on the night. As well as being the favourite for best album and best male, he is likely to receive the Global Success award, which goes to the artist who makes the most impact overseas.

"This video can not be played ""You can't look down"" while wearing a royal crown, the Queen tells royal commentator Alastair Bruce A sacred oil made from orange flowers and jasmine was used to anoint the Queen during her coronation, a new BBC documentary will reveal. The oil, which dates back to the 17th century, is held in great secrecy by the Dean of Westminster at the Abbey. In the hour-long programme - The Coronation - the Queen talks to royal commentator Alastair Bruce about the ceremony in 1953. The Queen also discusses her childhood memories of her father's coronation. As an 11-year-old, the then princess wrote that the arches of Westminster Abbey were covered in ""a sort of haze of wonder"" when King George VI was crowned in 1937. ""I remember my father making me write down what I remembered about his coronation. It was very valuable,"" the Queen tells the presenter. Diana and Dodi statue to leave Harrods Queen's bra fitter loses royal warrant Harry and Meghan visit youth radio station During a coronation, the new monarch is anointed under a canopy. On 2 June 1953, live cameras filming the ceremony turned away during this symbolic moment. During the programme, Dr John Hall, Dean of Westminster, says the oil from 1953 is kept safe in a flask in deanery. While the exact recipe of the oil is not known, Dr Hall said: ""The composition of the oil was founded upon that used in the 17th century. ""Then you see what it consists of sesame seed and olive oil, perfume with roses, orange flowers, jasmine, musk, civet and ambergris."" For the ceremony, the oil is kept in a solid gold flask called an ampulla, shaped like an eagle. Queen Elizabeth II walks and the Archbishop of Canterbury during her coronation The documentary gives an insight into the scale of preparations required for the coronation ceremony ""For six months, they closed the abbey,"" Dr Hall said. ""They laid a railway track down the centre of the abbey, bringing in tonnes and tonnes of wood and iron."" Some 8,000 people fitted into the abbey for the occasion in 1953. On Sunday, the Queen will also feature in a special Songs of Praise episode marking 150 years of Christian charity, the Scripture Union. The pre-recorded event is hosted by singer Katherine Jenkins and airs on BBC One on 14 January at 16:30 GMT. The Coronation will be screened on BBC One on Sunday 14 January at 20:00.

"Plastic waste is ""one of the great environmental scourges of our time"". These are the words of Prime Minister Theresa May, who has pledged to ban all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042. About 6.3bn tonnes of plastic waste had been generated globally by 2015, with almost 80% of it going to landfills or the natural environment. And despite extending the 5p charge on single-use plastic bags, major retailers in England stillsold 2.1 billion,externalin the last financial year. In a bid to tackle the problem, the PM has called on supermarkets to introduce ""plastic-free"" aisles and consider taxes and charges on single-use plastic items like food containers. But organisations like Greenpeace UK are sceptical about the plan, citing Mrs May's ""vague aspirations"" and calling for ""concrete action"", such as a bottle deposit return scheme or a ""latte levy"" on disposable coffee cups. So what are Britain's 10 biggest supermarkets doing to combat the ""scourge"" of plastic? By 2025, Tesco wantsall its packaging to be recyclable or compostable,externaland its total packaging weight to be halved compared to 2007. It has removedall polystyrene from its fish packaging,external, and claims that more than 78% of its packaging is recyclable, though this depends on the type of material accepted by local authorities. Replacing two layer plastic trays with single layer plastic has also helped them toremove 92 tonnes of plastic,external. Sainsbury's has set a target toreduce packaging by a half by 2020,external, compared to 2005. It has also committed to remove all plastic cotton buds, a major source of ocean plastic pollution. The supermarket recycles carrier bags, and has achieved a33% reduction,externalin its own brand-packaging since 2006. Between 2015 and 2016, it also redesigned its two-pint milk bottles, saving580 tonnes of plastic a year,external. Asda has reduced the weight of its packagingby 27% since 2007,external, partly by introducing ""skin"" packaging on some of its meat products. It also saved82 tonnes of plastic,externalby making its two-litre own-brand water bottles lighter. Theresa May defends 'long-term' plastic waste plan Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Morrisons recycles its carrier bags and uses""returnable bins"",externalfor fish products to reduce the use of poly boxes. The company says it keeps95% of its store waste,externalout of direct landfill. It has also banned microbeads and plastic cotton buds in its own-brand cosmetic products, and plans to phase out drinking straws in its cafes. In September, ittrialled removing single-use carrier bags,externalentirely in six of its stores. Aldi wants tosource all its pulp-based packaging from certified forests,externalby 2020 and has seen arelative 11% reduction,externalin packaging of 11% between 2012 to 2015. It has not sent any waste directly to landfill since 2014, andrecycles 100%,externalof its cardboard and plastic. Co-Op aims for 80% of its products to have""easily recyclable"" packaging by 2020,external. It hasreplaced polystyrene pizza discs with cardboard,external, saving 200 tonnes of plastic from landfill, and uses single-plastic packaging for meat, poultry and fish products. It has alsosupported the idea,externalof a deposit return scheme for bottles. Waitrose has thinned its prepared salad bags and reduced smoked salmon packaging by 50%. It charges 30p or 40p for its food to be delivered or collected in plastic bags. Despite plastic bag charging, Waitrose says itsupplied 63 million,externalbags in England from April 2016 to April 2017. Byswitching to biodegradable cotton buds,external, Waitrose estimates it has saved 21 tonnes of plastic. Last July, the supermarketintroduced a new sandwich wrapper,external, the plastic and cardboard of which can be more easily separated for recycling than other packaging. It also trialled anon-plastic punnet,externalmade from tomato leaf and cardboard pulp in October, and does not sell any productscontaining microbeads,external. It plans to make its own-label packaging widely recyclable, reusable or home compostable by 2025. Lidl says it is in the process of setting targets for plastic waste. It removed microbeads from all its cosmetic and household products last year, and has also committed to switching to biodegradable cotton buds. For the last 24 years it has charged for plastic carrier bags, and it stopped selling single-use bags last year. Iceland announced plans in January 2018 toeliminate or drastically reduce plastic packagingof all its own-label products by the end of 2023.  It had previouslysupported the idea,externalof a deposit return scheme for bottles. Plastic bag charge: Where does the money go? M&S to stop selling 'cauliflower steak' Marks & Spencer says thatmore than 90%,externalof all its UK packaging is recyclable, and less than 1% (by weight) of all its packaging can be traced back to polystyrene. It hastrialled new materials,externalto replace its blackCPET (a type of plastic) packaging,external, and the foils in packaging for biscuits and crisps. Between 2007 and 2012 itreduced its total packaging by 25%,external, and between 2012 and 2014, its food packaging usage per itemdecreased by 10%,external. It is also looking at using plastics made from plant-based oils. Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said that while initiatives like these were good, ""more radical and comprehensive policies"" were needed to tackle the plastic waste crisis. ""We need to see supermarkets making firm commitments to move away from using disposable plastic packaging altogether, starting with going plastic free in their own brands."" Businesses should be using ""reusable containers wherever possible"", she said, and investment in research and development was ""vital"" to finding less problematic packaging materials. Supermarkets also needed to avoid solving one problem by causing another, such as reducing the weight of packaging by replacing glass with plastic, she said. But the most important step for retailers was to make an open commitment to reducing the use of resources and carbon emissions. ""None of these processes will be reliable without significantly increased transparency,"" she added. Greenpeace UK suggests retailers should: Eliminate all non-recyclable plastics from own brand products Remove single-use plastic packaging for own brand products Trial dispensers and refillable containers for own brand items like shampoos, house cleaning products, beverages Push national brand suppliers to eliminate non-recyclable plastics and to stop using single use plastic packaging Install free water fountains in-store and water re-fill stations Support deposit return schemes in-store Trial reusable packaging and product refills via home deliveries A spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was committed to stemming the damage caused by plastic waste and had made great progress in boosting recycling rates. ""We are encouraged by industry action to reduce plastic and packaging waste and look forward to seeing others following its lead,"" it said. Written and researched by Becca Meier.

"Protesters carried posters reading ""don't let Nazis govern"" Protests have taken place in the Austrian capital of Vienna over the inclusion of the far-right Freedom Party in the new coalition government. Police said at least 20,000 people attended the rally, although organisers put the number at double that. Families with children walked alongside marchers chanting ""Nazis out!"", a BBC correspondent there reported. The Freedom Party's interior minister caused outrage earlier this week with his comments over asylum seekers. Herbert Kickl suggested that asylum seekers should be kept concentrated in one place, using a term associated with Nazi prisoners and death camps. The Freedom Party joined a coalition with the conservative People's Partyafter October's election failed to yield a concrete result. The People's Party's Sebastian Kurz is the world's youngest head of government; the Freedom Party has secured several key ministries, including the interior ministry. Saturday's march to Heroes Square in central Vienna was noisy but peaceful, reports the BBC's Bethany Bell. The crowd was made of students, left-wing organisations, families with small children and one group calling itself Grannies against the Right, she observed. A smaller protest took place last month when the coalition government was sworn in. Austria country profile Kurz and charisma: What propels young leaders to power?

"Angiosperms produce flowers and fruits, which contain their seeds. Scientists think they have the answer to a puzzle that baffled even Charles Darwin: How flowers evolved and spread to become the dominant plants on Earth. Flowering plants, or angiosperms, make up about 90% of all living plant species, including most food crops. In the distant past, they outpaced plants such as conifers and ferns, which predate them, but how they did this has has been a mystery. New research suggests it is down to genome size - and small is better. ""It really comes down to a question of cell size and how you can build a small cell and still retain all the attributes that are necessary for life,"" says Kevin Simonin from San Francisco State University in California, US. Hundreds of millions of years ago, the Earth was dominated by ferns and conifers. Then, about 150 million years ago, the first flowering plants appeared on the scene. They quickly spread to all parts of the world, changing the landscape from muted green to a riot of vibrant colour. Angiosperms are the most diverse group of land plants, with hundreds of thousands of known species The reasons behind the incredible success and diversity of flowering plants have been debated for centuries. Charles Darwin himself called it an ""abominable mystery"", fearing this apparent sudden leap might challenge his theory of evolution. Simonin and co-researcher Adam Roddy, of Yale University, wondered if the size of the plant's genetic material - or genome - might be important. The biologists analysed data held by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, on the genome size of hundreds of plants, including flowering plants, gymnosperms (a group of plants, which include conifers and Ginkgo) and ferns. They then compared genome size with anatomical features such as the abundance of pores on leaves. This provides ""strong evidence"", they say, that the success and rapid spread of flowering plants around the world is down to ""genome downsizing"". By shrinking the size of the genome, which is contained within the nucleus of the cell, plants can build smaller cells. In turn, this allows greater carbon dioxide uptake and carbon gain from photosynthesis, the process by which plants use light energy to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Angiosperms can pack more veins and pores into their leaves, maximising their productivity. The researchers say genome-downsizing happened only in the angiosperms, and this was ''a necessary prerequisite for rapid growth rates among land plants''. ""The flowering plants are the most important group of plants on Earth and now we finally know why they have been so successful,"" they say. The research published in the journal PLOS Biology,externalraises more questions about plants. For instance, why were flowering plants able to shrink their genomes more than others? And why do ferns and conifers still exist, despite their large genomes and cells? Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

What we learned at the Brits nominations Brit Awards 2018: The nominations Dua Lipa interview: 'Chris Martin made me feel really calm' Jack Whitehall to host 2018 Brit Awards One notable absence from this year's shortlist was Sam Smith. His album, The Thrill Of It All, was the third biggest seller of 2017 but received no nominations. However, its November release date means it will be eligible again next year - and Smith will perform at this year' ceremony, at London's O2 Arena on 21 February, along with Rag'n'Bone Man, Foo Fighters and Ed Sheeran. Liam Payne's Strip That Down has been the most successful solo single by a former One Direction member The fan-voted best video category sees a fight between three former members of One Direction. Harry Styles' Sign of the Times will go up against Zayn and Taylor Swift's I Don't Wanna Live Forever and Liam Payne's Strip That Down. ""That's fantastic,"" Payne told BBC News. ""The fact that we've just come out of our band and everyone's already up for these things, it's fantastic. ""I'm not going to put a bet on myself,"" he added. ""There was some fantastic music out last year. I'm just happy to be part of that."" The star also revealed the last time he had been to the Brits, he and his partner Cheryl Tweedy ""were still in hiding with our relationship"". ""We snuck out of the Brits together, and we bumped into every single newspaper person we could possibly bump into - which I thought was really hilarious!"" Dua Lipa, 22, was raised in the UK but at the age of 13 she moved with her parents to their former home of Kosovo.

After a series of increasingly popular singles, she found success with last summer's female empowerment anthem New Rules, in which the star writes a four-step plan for avoiding her ex. She ended the year as the UK's most-streamed female artist on Spotify, while her eye-catching New Rules video has been watched more than 892 million times on YouTube. Her competition in the best female category comes from Jessie Ware, Kate Tempest and former winners Laura Marling and Paloma Faith. It is Faith's fifth nomination, much to the star's astonishment. Paloma Faith performed at the nominations show ""I keep pinching myself because I feel like it's a very fickle industry,"" she said. ""There's so many people over the years that I've been on this particular carpet with that I don't see any more."" Other returning nominees include Gorillaz and Wolf Alice, up for best British group, while Liam Gallagher gets his first nomination as a solo artist in the best British male category. East London MC J Hus picked up three nominations for his debut album Common Sense, a border-hopping brew of the music that inspired him - from G-funk to bashment via afrobeat, UK garage and R&B. ""Three nominations. I at least have to take home one,"" the 21-year-old said. Last year's Brit Awards were hailed for the diversity of their nominees - but in the end, no black British artists took home an award. Brits 2017: The real winners and losers Brit Awards 2017: David Bowie dominates J Hus, whose real name is Momodou Jallow, said he hoped the situation would be corrected in 2018. He said: ""100% we can turn it around this year. But even if I don't take anything away, I'm happy to be amongst so many big artists. It's just crazy."" J Hus said he was ""honoured"" to be nominated The nominations were revealed in a live programme on ITV1, featuring performances from Paloma Faith, J Hus, Liam Payne and Clean Bandit. Soul singer Jorja Smith also performed her new single Let Me Down alongside best British male nominee Stormzy. Walsall-born Smith, who featured on Drake's More Life mixtape last year, was also presented with the Brits Critics' Choice Award, which singles out an artist to watch in the coming year. The prize, which has previously gone to the likes of Adele and Florence and the Machine, is one of two awards to be announced in advance. The other - best producer - has gone to Little Mix and Liam Payne collaborator Steve Mac. This year's winners will receive a specially designed statue by Anish Kapoor Despite Dua's domination of the shortlist, it seems probable that Sheeran's massive commercial success will be recognised on the night. As well as being the favourite for best album and best male, he is likely to receive the Global Success award, which goes to the artist who makes the most impact overseas.

"Worboys asked passengers to help him celebrate a big lottery win and gave them drug-laced champagne The government is doing ""everything we can"" to make sure rapist John Worboys stays in prison, Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis has said. The Parole Board has said ex-black cab driver Worboys, jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women, can be released. But the government is considering challenging that decision in court. Mr Lewis said it was crucial victims were ""properly protected"", while a lawyer for victims said releasing Worboys would ""put many women at risk"". Justice Secretary David Gauke is looking into the possibility of applying for judicial review, but will only proceed if there is a good chance of success. If a judge finds the Parole Board did not follow the correct process or reached its decision on the wrong basis, that decision would be quashed and Worboys would have to make a fresh application for parole. The Parole Board said it was ""confident correct procedures were followed"" in the case. 'No plans' for CPS to review Worboys cases Worboys victims 'terrified' by release Cabbie who preyed on young women Mr Lewis, who was appointed in the prime minister's recent reshuffle,  told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show he understood the public outrage at the decision to release Worboys. ""Every victim out there, every friend and family of victims, everybody who has read about this case will want to know that we are doing everything we can to make sure that the victims are properly protected,"" he said. He added: ""The Secretary of State for Justice will be doing everything he can to make sure this man stays behind bars."" This video can not be played Government trying to keep Worboys ""behind bars"" Victims' groups and representatives were outraged by news of Worboys's imminent release earlier this month, saying many victims were not informed before it was made public. Lawyer Richard Scorer, from the firm Slater and Gordon which represented some of the victims, said his clients' ""fears and concerns are finally being recognised"". He said the victims hope the government will be able to take action on the parole decision, adding: ""We believe this manipulative, dangerous serial sex offender is still a danger to the public and releasing him now would put many women at risk."" Sarah Green, from the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said the justice secretary's efforts were ""very welcome"". ""Women have been singularly failed throughout this case, from initial investigations all the way through to the parole board decision,"" she said. This video can not be played Solicitor: My client is ""absolutely horrified"" at the news that Worboys will be released She added that swift action was needed to review the risk Worboys poses to women's safety and to ""restore public confidence in the system's ability to do justice and to protect"". At his trial,Croydon Crown Court heard,external60-year-old Worboys gave his lone victims drug-laced champagne, saying he was celebrating a big lottery or casino win, before attacking them in his London taxi. By Alex Forsyth, BBC political correspondent There was a huge backlash to the Parole Board's decision to release John Worboys - from those who thought it was the wrong decision and from those who were critical about the way victims had been informed about it. At this stage, David Gauke's actions are just a scoping exercise, he won't proceed unless he feels there are grounds to do so. Nonetheless, this is significant. It is highly unusual for a justice secretary to intervene in the decisions of the Parole Board in this way, and that's because the Parole Board is very deliberately independent of government. It's understood that Mr Gauke, who is new to the job of justice secretary, takes that independence very seriously and wants to maintain it, which is why at this stage he is just collecting information about the possibility of judicial review. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Mr Gauke commissioned, mid-last week, advice on the plausibility of a judicial review and the prospect of success of any judicial review. ""The secretary of state is minded to move forward only if there was a reasonable prospect of success."" It came asThe Sunday Times,externalreported four cabinet ministers had warned Worboys's release might be unlawful because victims were not consulted. The handling ofWorboys's release has already triggered a government reviewto look at how the Parole Board reaches its decisions. Labour's London MayorSadiq Khan said in a tweet,externalthat he was ""astonished"" by its decision, saying ""it must listen to Worboys's victims"". ""He should not be allowed to set foot in London,"" he added. Parole Board chairman Nick Hardwick has said hearing the decision must have been ""horrible"" for the women, but the board was ""confident"" Worboys would not reoffend. He said the fact some victims were not informed was a fault with the parole system, but the decision itself would have been carefully considered.

"Carillion is the UK's second largest construction firm and employs 43,000 people globally Troubled construction firm Carillion has denied reports lenders rejected a proposed rescue plan for the business. The firm, which is a key government contractor for projects including schools and prisons, said crunch talks with stakeholders were still ongoing. The firm is struggling under Â£1.5bn of debt, including a pension shortfall of Â£587m, raising fears about its future. Ministers are drawing up plans to take over prisons contracts worth Â£200m from Carillion,the BBC understands. Reports that creditors had turned down a potential rescue plan sent the firm's shares down by more than 28% on Friday. Administrator firms PwC and EY were also reported to have been put on standby as talks about the firm's future carry on. In a statement, Carillion said: ""Suggestions that Carillion's business plan has been rejected by stakeholders are incorrect."" It said the firm remained in constructive dialogue about short term financing while ""longer term discussions are continuing"". Carillion also said turnaround proposals on the table were likely to cost shareholders. Simon Jack: Carillion's uncertain future Where did it go wrong for Carillion? The government, the Pensions Regulator and representatives from the firm held crunch talks to discuss the firm's options on Friday. The company is the UK's second-largest construction company and a key government contractor. It employs 43,000 people globally. But it is perhaps best known for being one the largest suppliers of services to the public sector. Notably, it holds a contract to build part of the forthcoming HS2 high speed railway line and is the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail. It also maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence, manages nearly 900 schools and manages highways and prisons. A government spokeswoman said it has been monitoring the situation to ensure its ""contingency plans are robust"". The general secretary of the RMT rail union, Mick Cash, said Carillion's workers were ""not responsible for the crisis"". He added that workers ""should have protection and guarantees from the government, including an assurance that operations will be directly transferred over to Network Rail with all jobs, pensions and rights safeguarded if Carillion goes bust"". Carillion scrambles to stay afloat HS2 contractor's shares hit by profit alert Where did Carillion's problems come from? In addition to its rail operations, Carillion also manages nearly 900 schools, provides services to the NHS and works with National Grid. The assistant general secretary of the Unite union, Gail Cartmail, said: ""The government must consider all options while the future of Carillion hangs in the balance, including bringing contracts back in-house."" The company held talks with its lenders and advisers in London on Wednesday. However, no announcement has been made on a business plan to secure its future.

"The future of troubled engineering company Carillion is being discussed at high-level government meetings this weekend, the BBC understands. The firm is a key government contractor for projects including the HS2 high-speed rail scheme, schools and prisons. Sources say the firm has a ""matter of days"" as it teeters on the edge of collapse, with Â£1.5bn of debt including a pension shortfall of Â£587m. Carillion is trying to reach an agreement with creditors. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the government must not bail out the struggling construction company, the second largest in the UK. Sir Vince, a former business secretary, told BBC Breakfast: ""They've got to force the shareholders and indeed the creditors, the big banks, to take losses, and then the government can take responsibility for taking the contracts forward and making sure they are delivered."" Simon Jack: Carillion's uncertain future Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Jon Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, called on the government to take contracts back into public control, describing its relationship with the Carillion as a ""failing ideological project"". ""It has been clear for months that Carillion has been in difficulty but the government has continued to hand over contracts to the company,"" he said. In 2016 the Wolverhampton-based company, which employs 43,000 people globally, had sales of Â£5.2bn and until July boasted a market capitalisation of almost Â£1bn. But since then its share price has plummeted and it is now valued at about Â£61m. Officials from the justice, transport and business departments will gather this weekend for a meeting chaired by the Cabinet Office. The consultancy EY has been put on notice in case the company falls into administration. On Friday, reports that creditors had rejected a potential rescue plan sent Carillion's shares down by more than 28%. By BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam A decade ago the government bailed out the banks because - being central to the workings of the entire economy - they were ""too big to fail"". Now the same issue of moral hazard arises for the engineering giant Carillion. If it collapses, what happens to politically sensitive work that it does, such as building hospitals and running schools, jails or Ministry of Defence facilities? Pausing that work until new contracts are tendered, bid for and awarded would take years. But bailing out a private company like Carillion, which paid out dividends to its shareholders last year, won't play well with taxpayers. So Carillion will either have to restructure its debts within days with its now impatient banks or file for administration and hope that EY can find a solution which is quick, clever and doesn't cost jobs. This video can not be played Bailing out Carillion 'would send the wrong message', Vince Cable says. But in Friday's statement, Carillion said: ""Suggestions that Carillion's business plan has been rejected by stakeholders are incorrect."" It said the firm remained in constructive dialogue about short-term financing while ""longer term discussions are continuing"". The government has said it is ""monitoring the situation closely"". A government spokeswoman said: ""Carillion is a major supplier to the government with a number of long-term contracts. We are committed to maintaining a healthy supplier market and work closely with our key suppliers."" The BBC understands that the Ministry of Justice has drawn up plans to bring Â£200m of prison contracts run by Carillion back into public control. Carillion, which was founded in the late 1990s as a spin-off from building giant Tarmac, also operates in Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean. It has worked on key projects overseas including the Suez Canal road tunnel and Toronto's Union Station. It is also the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail. The general secretary of the RMT rail union, Mick Cash, said the government should give Carillion's workers ""clear-cut assurances"", as thousands of jobs were ""hanging by a thread"". It also wants an assurance that operations would be directly transferred over to Network Rail if Carillion goes bust. Where did it go wrong for Carillion?

"Milos Zeman remains popular in rural areas The Czech presidential election will go to a run-off after incumbent Milos Zeman led the first round but did not secure enough votes to win outright. With nearly all results in, Mr Zeman had 39% ahead of his nearest rival Jiri Drahos on 26.3%. Turnout was 61%. Mr Zeman, 73, is seeking a second five-year term but has stoked controversy with his outspoken views and pro-Russian stance. The second round is scheduled for 26-27 January. The BBC's Rob Cameron in Prague says Mr Zeman appears to have done worse than expected in rural areas, where his forthright views on immigrants and political correctness have traditionally struck a chord. To avoid a run-off, he needed to secure more than half the vote. Mr Drahos knows he has a good chance of unseating Mr Zeman when the two men go head to head in two weeks' time, he adds. Many voters who chose one of the other seven candidates are likely to switch their allegiance to Mr Drahos in the second round. The politically incorrect president dividing a nation President Zeman has become one of the EU's most outspoken opponents of sanctions against Moscow and has also made improving relations with China a priority. Turnout for the first round was 61% Mr Drahos, a pro-European academic, has been forthright in his opposition to the president, saying: ""We say in Czech that 'the fish stinks from the head' and that perfectly sums up Mr Zeman's term."" The first round of voting, which took place over two days, passed uneventfully apart from a semi-naked protester who tried to disrupt Mr Zeman casting his vote in Prague on Friday and accused him of being in the pocket of Russian President Vladimir Putin. She was bundled away and Mr Zeman then cast his ballot, but was visibly shaken by the incident. Joined the Communist Party in 1968 during the ""Prague Spring"" but was expelled in 1970 for opposing Soviet intervention that crushed moves towards liberal reforms After communism fell he joined the left-leaning Social Democratic party and became leader in 1993 In 2013 he became the third president of the Czech Republic since it split from Slovakia in 1993 In his outspoken remarks on immigration he once said that Muslims were ""impossible to integrate"" into Europe Studied chemistry and technology and was president of the Czech Academy of Sciences from 2009 to 2017 He is a supporter of EU and Nato membership buts opposes the EU's quota system for distributing migrants, as do all other presidential contenders He considers himself a centrist politician who can unite the country His main support comes from pro-European voters and people living in cities The politically incorrect president dividing a nation EU to sue member states over refugees The Czech town trying to bury its Jewish past Billionaire candidate wins Czech election Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?
