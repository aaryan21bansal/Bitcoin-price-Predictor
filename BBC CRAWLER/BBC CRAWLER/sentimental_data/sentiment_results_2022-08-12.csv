"An official drought has been declared as low-water levels and tinder-dry conditions continue across the UK. Eight parts of England, including Devon, Kent, East Anglia and Lincolnshire are affected. The move is expected to trigger stricter controls on water use and five water companies have already announced restrictions, including hosepipe bans. Millions are expected to be impacted but the Environment Agency said essential water supplies were safe. John Curtin, director of operations, said the drought would go on for ""a long time"" and warned of possible restrictions on crop growing and further hosepipe bans. It comes as the prolonged dry weather - combined with the current heatwave and July's record-breaking temperatures - have depleted rivers, reservoirs and aquifers. Large swathes of England are bone-dry, with scenes of parched earth and grass turned yellow. The conditions have prompted the Environment Agency to move eight of its 14 areas into drought status: Devon and Cornwall Solent and South Downs Kent and South London Hertfordshire and North London East Anglia Thames Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire East Midlands Yorkshire and the West Midlands are also expected to move into a drought later in August. The decision to declare a drought was taken after a meeting of the National Drought Group - made up of government and agency officials, water firms and groups including the National Farmers' Union. Announcing a drought means government and water companies will put into action their plans to deal with it, with measures including hosepipe bans and taking more water than usual from rivers. Members of the public and businesses in drought-affected areas are also being urged to use water wisely followingthe driest first seven months of the year since 1976. Elsewhere, Wales Drought Liaison group is also looking at the effect of the dry weather. LIVE UPDATES: Drought to be declared Will there be a hosepipe ban in my area? Flames faster than you can run - firefighters on wildfires The science of drought explained in pictures Five water companies - Welsh Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, South East Water and, most recently Yorkshire Water - have all announced hosepipe bans, whileYorkshire Water said on Friday that a banwould start on 26 August. The latter firm, which has more than five million customers, says parts of the region have seen the lowest rainfall since records began more than 130 years ago. It also said rivers and reservoirs in the region were running at 20% lower than expected for the time of year. South East Water, whose ban came into force on Friday, is now asking people to observe restrictions on using hosepipes to water plants, wash the car and fill paddling pools - with rule-breakers facing fines of up to Â£1,000. What are water companies doing to tackle leaks? How the heatwave is changing landscapes The driest start to a year since 1976 Dominic Gardener, a farmer in West Sussex, said the dry weather was posing huge challenges for farmers. ""Everything is starting to struggle a bit - our grass is not growing at all - and livestock, we're having to feed them extra food,"" he said, adding crop yields had also been reduced by the dryness. Farmers in parts of Fife are beingtemporarily banned from using waterfrom the River Eden on their fields. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency says the measure will come into effect from midnight on Saturday to tackle critical water shortages. Afour-day amber warning for extreme heatfrom the Met Office is in place for many parts of England and Wales until Sunday. Temperatures are forecast to be lower early next week, however, and the Met Office has issued yellow warnings for thunderstorms on Monday, covering most of England, Wales and Scotland. And its fire severity index - which assesses how severe a blaze could become - is currently ""very high"" for most of England and Wales. The situation facing firefighters across the UK has been described as ""unprecedented"",with increasing numbers of wildfires. Fires have broken out across the nation, including in Leytonstone, east London, Studland Bay, Dorset,Creswell, in Derbyshire,The Dower House in Bristol, and Overton, near Basingstoke in Hampshire. Police have evacuated about 50 homes in Creswell after a major incident was declared due to a field fire. Fire crews are also tackling a large blaze whichbroke out at a Leicestershire recycling centre. Meanwhile, homeless peoplestruggling with the extreme heat in Bristolsaid it was ""making us sick,"" and even sitting in the shade was ""tiring and sweaty and uncomfortable"". Bristol Street Outreach Team, operated by charity St Mungo's, has been carrying out additional shifts and giving out water, advice and sun protection to those in need. This video can not be played Watch latest UK weather forecast: Amber heat warning in force UK temperatures have been rising day-on-day through the week. According to the Met Office, on Friday the highest temperatures were recorded in: Wiggonholt, West Sussex, at 34.5C Northolt, west London, and Hermonceux West End, East Sussex, at 34.2C Heathrow, west London, at 33.9C Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, at 33.8C Chivenor, Devon, at 33.7C. Over the weekend temperatures could peak at 36C. Met Office chief meteorologist Andy Page said there would be ""increasingly warm nights"" with temperatures not expected to drop below the low 20s in some places in the south. Sir Keir Starmer has accused the government of failing to fully prepare the UK for drought, and also out at the response of water companies. Water firms have been criticised over leaks, with about three billion litres of water lost each day in the UK - between 20% and 24% of the total water supply. The Labour leader said the drought was ""predictable"" but ""as usual we had no plan from the government"". Environment Secretary George Eustice said there was ""no reason for people to be alarmed"". He told BBC News that the UK's water supply ""remains resilient"" and that ""we're in a stronger position than ever"" to withstand droughts, with progress made on leaks and infrastructure to move water between reservoirs. Heatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. Research institute UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) said it would require ""exceptional"" rainfall over the next one to three months to bring river, reservoir and groundwater levels back up to normal. It said analysis showed exceptionally low levels would probably continue until October in southern England and Wales. But scientists have warned bouts of heavy rain after a prolonged period of hot weather can cause flash flooding. Robert Thompson, a professor of Meteorology at the University of Reading, said ""the ground has effectively become like urban concrete"" and will not absorb water quickly enough to cope with longer showers. The situation in the UK is being mirrored across Europe. Much of the continent is baking in record heat, exposing riverbeds and triggering restrictions on water use in many areas. A drought has also hitGermany's Rhine River, where the water is already too low to allow some larger vessels through. Restrictions on usage during hosepipe bans can vary between water providers but generally people are not allowed to use hosepipes or anything that connects to a hosepipe or an outside tap.During a ban, people cannot use a hosepipe to: water a garden or plants fill a paddling or swimming pool clean a car fill a pond clean walls or windows But you can use other water sources, like using your mains water supply but with buckets or watering cans instead of hosepipes, or using stored rainwater from a water butt and there are some exceptions when a hosepipe can be used. Anyone breaking the rules could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. Read morehere. Have you been affected by the hot weather and restrictions?

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Energy bill support is not enough Boris Johnson has admitted the current help for people struggling with energy bills is not enough, and said he expects more money to follow. Mr Johnson will step down as PM in September, but said he was ""making sure there is extra cash"" for his successor to provide additional support. He also said people were starting to receive the money which the government announced earlier in the year. The topic of rising bills has come to dominate the Tory leadership contest. The two candidates to replace Mr Johnson have set out differing strategies on how they would respond to the cost of living crisis. Liz Truss has argued that cutting taxes is the best way to help struggling households. Rishi Sunak has proposed spending billions of pounds on further payments to pensioners and people on low incomes, contending tax cuts will not help them enough. Energy profits are not evil, says Liz Truss How high will my energy bill go? How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? Elsewhere Labourhas set out its own proposalsincluding a plan to ensure pre-pay energy customers are charged the same as those paying by direct debit - a move they say would benefit four million people. Speaking in Edinburgh, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""outrageous and immoral"" that the poorest people on pre-payment meters paid more for their energy bills. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also called for the government to raise money by backdating the windfall tax on energy companies. Speaking at a hustings in Cheltenham, Ms Truss said she ""absolutely"" did not support windfall taxes, arguing it was ""all about bashing business"". Mr Johnson has made it clear that he thinks further support will be needed from whoever succeeds him at the start of September. But he isn't going to make that decision himself and several government figures have made it clear the big decisions can not be taken by the outgoing regime. The lack of immediate action infuriates people like Martin Lewis, the money saving expert, and angers some opposition politicians too, who say the scale of the energy crisis is such that the government can't wait a month to decide what it's going to do. But whatever options are suggested by the opposition or left on the table by the current government, it looks increasingly clear that concrete decisions are going to have to wait. Not least because the two people who could be making them - Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss - sharply disagree. Conservative members are weighing up which they prefer. But while they decide, decisions over help with the cost of living look like they are going to have to wait. Read more from Nick here. Last weekforecasts suggestedthat energy bills could rise to more than Â£4,000 per year next year for typical households. Earlier this year the government announced a Â£15bn package including a Â£400 energy bill discount for every household. Asked by reporters if this was enough, Mr Johnson said: ""No"", adding: ""What we're doing... is trying to make sure that by October, by January, there is further support"". ""I'm not going to pretend that things are easy for people right now, but there's more money coming anyway as a result of the decisions we've taken. ""I think over the medium term, the future's very bright."" He also argued that the price of energy would be brought down in the longer term by the government's investment in nuclear power and renewables. Earlier Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said new cost of living policies would be ""ready to go"" when either Mr Sunak or Ms Truss took office on 6 September. Speaking on a visit to the Airbus factory in Broughton in north Wales, Mr Zahawi told broadcasters: ""We're looking at all the options of what additional help we need to bring in later on in the winter months."" The BBC has been told one option could include expanding the windfall tax on energy companies. The current windfall tax - also called the energy profits levy - applies only to oil and gas firms, but there has been speculation that it could be extended to electricity generators. Energy profits are not evil, says Liz Truss How much are energy bills going up? What is the windfall tax on oil and gas firms?

"The UK economy shrank between April and June as experts forecast a gloomy outlook with recession on the horizon. The economy contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter of the year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. This was partly due to Covid schemes like Test and Trace ending, retail sales falling and the Queen's Platinum Jubilee bank holiday in June, it said. The Bank of England has forecast the UK will fall into recession towards the end of the year as energy costs soar. Despite shrinking between April and June, the UK economy avoided recession because gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.8% in the first three months of this year. What is GDP and how does it affect me? A recession is defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods. Up until now most economists - and the Bank of England - did not expect a recession to begin until the final three months of 2022. Many expected a small rebound in economic growth between July and September. But the latest figures from the ONS have prompted some experts to warn that recession could come sooner than they had initially thought. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said it expected the UK economy to continue falling over the next three quarters. Capital Economics said there was now a greater risk that the economy will shrink by 0.2% between July and September before worsening. But investment bank Goldman Sachs still predicted growth of 0.4% in the third quarter of 2022. A spokesperson said: ""We had previously assumed a sharp bounce back in July but now expect a more muted rebound."" HSBC's forecast was more positive, it said: ""If the UK is going into recession, then we don't think this is the start of it."" ""We still expect a bounce back in July - the reversal of the bank holiday effect - to set the UK up for a positive Q3, as does the Bank of England,"" it added. Kingdom Thenga says it already feels like the UK is in recession Kingdom Thenga, who owns a number of local bars and restaurants in Chester, says for him, it already feels like the UK is in a recession. ""I think we are not too far away from it because of the consistent blows we're getting from energy bills, from people not going out, to the cost of living, it just seems that's where we're heading,"" he said. He says his business is currently ""in survival mode"". ""It's not about making money, it's not about trying to expand or trying to grow our business, it's just about stabilising the business especially after the pandemic over the last two years,"" he told the BBC. Mr Thenga says the biggest issue he's facing is rising costs - with everything from poultry to vegetable oil soaring in price - while the amount of money his customers have in their pockets is going down. ""Energy bills are ridiculous, the cost of fuel is ridiculous and I appreciate people don't necessarily have the money or can't spend what they used to, because everyone is so worried about what the bills are going to be,"" he says. What is a recession and what could mean for me? The UK is facing the worst rate of price rises - or inflation - in 40 years as energy costs continue to soar. Commenting on the 0.1% contraction between April and June, the ONS said that the biggest contributor was from ""human health and social work activities"" as Covid test and trace and vaccination programmes were wound down. There was also a fall in retail sales volumes. However, it said areas such as tourism, bars and entertainment showed strong growth. ""Health was the biggest reason the economy contracted as both the test and trace and vaccine programmes were wound down, while many retailers also had a tough quarter,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""These were partially offset by growth in hotels, bars, hairdressers and outdoor events across the quarter, partly as a result of people celebrating the Platinum Jubilee."" This included rises in mobile food stands and takeaway food shops. The ONS said that in June alone the economy shrank by 0.6% in June due to the extra bank holiday to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. However, that figure was much better than the 1.3% fall predicted by economists. The ONS said that while the bank holiday impacted on monthly GDP, it had ""little impact"" on the quarterly figure. The Chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, told the BBC that these are ""challenging times"". ""What the numbers show today is that the contraction is partly because of some of the Covid activities reducing but also real resilience in the private sector which actually in many ways bodes well... But nevertheless these are challenging times,"" he said. But Labour accused the Conservatives of ""losing control of the economy"". Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""With the Bank of England forecasting a recession lasting the whole of next year, the Conservative leadership contenders need to stop playing to the gallery and start coming up with a serious plan to get Britain's economy back on track."" A big part of the drop in Gross Domestic Product in June was because of the Platinum Jubilee - which meant two fewer working days of producing goods and services, in contrast to May, which had one additional working day. It was always expected that that would magnify the downswing from May to June and economists expected a sharper drop in activity. The 0.1% drop over the three months from April to June was only half as bad as some economists thought. Nevertheless, given the backdrop of the global squeeze on incomes due to soaring energy prices, no-one can say this drop in activity is just a blip. The squeeze on the hard-pressed consumer is tightening its grip, with activity in consumer-facing services down by 4.9% compared to before the pandemic. And with France, Italy and Canada seeing growth, no-one can say this is a stellar economic performance. All in all, it's not yet the recession the Bank of England has forecast: more a precursor. How fast is the UK's economy growing? Fuel, milk and eggs push inflation to 40-year high What is a recession and how could one affect me?

"A federal judge has unsealed the warrant that authorised the FBI to search ex-US President Donald Trump's home in Florida FBI agents who searched Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach on Monday found documents marked top secret The warrant indicates investigators had probable cause to believe Trump violated the Espionage Act FBI agents took a cache of files, including information about the ""President of France"" In a statement, Trump says the documents seized by agents at his club were ""all declassified"" Attorney General Merrick Garland had applied for the warrant's release, citing ""substantial public interest in this matter"" Edited by Jude Sheerin President Biden's Democrats have just passed a key plank of their climate-and-healthcare agenda in Congress, but it's Trump who's dominating the news cycle. Here's a reminder of what happened on this momentous day:  This live coverage was brought to you by Brajesh Upadhyay, Matt Murphy, Max Matza and Holly Honderich. Gary O'DonoghueWashington Correspondent An egret stands near Mar-a-Lago Itâs been a week for the obliteration of precedents. First the revelation that a former presidentâs home had been searched by the FBI, made public  by Donald Trump himself. That brought three days of him and his supporters shaping that ostensibly bad news narrative into familiar themes â namely that the âpolitical witch-huntâ was continuing and that the state was still out to get him. Then, on Thursday the Department of Justice decided it had had enough of being traduced â doing something they do not do and requesting the  details of what they were looking for and what they found be published. And here we are with the most top secret of  classified documents being hauled away from a private, beachfront golf club and the FBI citing potential crimes involving the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice. You might think this would put anyone on the back foot, but for the former president and his backers these are as much opportunities as they are jeopardies. They burnish his self-described position as an outsider and reinvigorate his supporters' desire for a second Trump term in which a âthird world countryâ - to quote President Trump - can be made great again. This isnât over by a long chalk. Lawn signs Defenders of Trump have been making comparisons to his old political foe, Hillary Clinton, who was found to have herself mismanaged sensitive government documents during her time as US secretary of state. She, too, was investigated under the Espionage Act for her use of a private email server. Problems first emerged for Clinton in 2014 after the state department said it was unable to transfer her emails to a congressional committee because it didn't have them. Instead of being kept on government servers, as is required under the same laws now being cited to investigate Trump, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate used a personal email that had servers at her New York home. Her lawyers transferred around 30,000 work-related emails to the state department, and deleted roughly the same number that she maintained were not work-related. Clinton claimed that none of the emails turned over were classified, but that was proven wrong by an FBI investigation. Announcing the results of the investigation in 2016, FBI Director James Comey said that 113 emails were classified, but that some had vague markings which did not make clear the sensitive nature of the documents. The FBI probe concluded in 2016 that classified information had been improperly transferred, but that it was not done deliberately. Trump capitalised politically on the controversy, leading chants at rallies of ""lock her up"". In recent days, Clinton has been having a laugh at her old adversary's expense...

power to declassify anything, so what he took with him from the White House
was declassified. Legal experts agree that a sitting president has the power to declassify any information, but they must follow a procedure. Tom Dupree, former principal deputy assistant US attorney general, told the BBC the process includes filling out forms and giving
certain authorisations. Also, a
president can declassify documents, but a former president cannot. ""That begs the question whether President Trump when he was
still President Trump actually declassified these documents,â said Dupree. He said the justice department will have to pore through each
document to ascertain whether these were
in fact declassified, and could there be any possible justification for Trump retaining those documents. ""Once they've completed that review, then they've got to
decide do they need to do further investigation? Do they need to go back? Do
they need to look in other places? Do they need to interview witnesses? ""And once
that process is complete, they'll make a decision as to whether or not to
charge anyone with a federal crime."" Brajesh UpadhyayBBC News, Washington Much of the analysis in the wake of the search has focused on one obscure criminal law mentioned in the unsealed warrant: Section 2071 of Title 18 of the United States Code. Crucially, it states anyone convicted under that law shall ""be disqualified from holding"" federal office. This is why some are suggesting a conviction could all but end Trump's rumoured hopes of returning to the White House. ""That's a real law, and if Donald Trump violated that lawâ¦ that has real penalties, including the fact that he may never be able to serve in federal office ever again,"" presidential historian Michael Beschloss told MSNBC. Some legal experts, however, insisted that the law was unlikely to apply or survive any kind of appeal, as the only constitutional restrictions on presidential eligibility are citizenship, residence and age. Read more: Could Trump investigation stop him running in 2024? In a statement on Truth Social, his online platform, Trump earlier on Friday suggested FBI agents could have planted information during their search of Mar-a-Lago. Trump's insinuation came a day after Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray publicly defended the integrity of federal agents. Trump also denied a report in the Washington Post that agents had been seeking classified documents related to nuclear weapons. ""Nuclear weapons issue is a Hoax... two Impeachments were a Hoax, the Mueller investigation was a Hoax, and much more,"" wrote Trump, adding: ""Same sleazy people involved."" ""Why wouldnât the FBI allow the inspection of areas at Mar-a-Lago with our lawyerâs, or others, present. Made them wait outside in the heat, wouldnât let them get even close - said 'ABSOLUTELY NOT.' Planting information anyone?"" he added. Trump was in New York at the time of the search. His Florida-based lawyers were present, but the FBI barred them from entering the areas being searched. Agents also reportedly asked that CCTV cameras at Mar-a-Lago be switched off during the morning raid, but the Trump Organization refused to comply. A lawyer for Trump said on Thursday they may disclose video and photos of the search. The Trump Organization former CFO appeared in court on Friday Trump suffered another legal setback on Friday when a New York judge ruled that a criminal case against his company - the Trump Organization - and its longtime chief financial officer can proceed. Former CFO Allen Weisselberg appeared in court to hear the judge's response to his February request to dismiss all 15 charges against the company and himself. Prosecutors allege that the defendants are guilty of criminal fraud and tax evasion. They say the alleged scheme allowed Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes of some $1.8m (Â£1.5m) in off-the-books income. Jury selection is set for 24 October. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar Reaction from Democratic members of Congress has been muted so far as they've just been voting a major bill through the House. But some have been piling on via social media. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota tweeted: ""Nothing to see here folks, just a former President of the United States being investigated for the violation of the Espionage Act."" Eric Swalwell of California urged Trump supporters to break from the former president, telling them that he ""stole Top Secret documents"" and ""put a target on the backs of cops"". ""If youâve been aboard the Trump Train the last 7 years, youâve been given an unexpected stop. Time to get off. Wherever you think this is going, itâs not,"" he added. Swalwell, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, has in the past faced national security scrutiny after federal agents reportedly warned him he was being targeted by a woman who was allegedly a Chinese spy. It was the National Archives and Records Administration (Nara) that sounded the alarm about classified files at Mar-a-Lago, triggering the chain of events that led to Monday's FBI search of the club. In recent days Trump has been saying that his predecessor, Barack Obama, took 33m pages of documents, ""much of them classified"", to Chicago at the end of his presidency. Not so, says the National Archives. In a statement on Friday, the National Archives said that it had obtained âexclusive legal and physical custodyâ of Obamaâs records when he left office in 2017. It said that about 30 million pages of unclassified records were transferred to a National Archives facility in the Chicago area and that they continue to be maintained âexclusively"" by the National Archives. Katty KayUS special correspondent More questions than answers right now on what this means for Trump's future. First of all, why was he keeping classified documents, including one set marked top secret and only meant to be viewed in a secure government facility? What did he want to do with them? Trump claims they were all declassified. Clearly the Department of Justice disagrees. On the politics: the fact Trump is being investigated under the Espionage Act sounds dramatic, but will it cause any of his supporters to think twice about his fitness for office? Seems unlikely. Millions of Americans are now convinced the federal government is unfairly targeting Trump. On the law: legal scholars are in uncharted waters and will have to examine the implications of this. The big question being, if found guilty, would it make Trump ineligible for a re-election bid? Early reaction to this week's drama suggests a clear split between those who are galvanised to support the president and those who are reminded how exhausted they were during the Trump presidency. As we've been reporting, among the files seized by FBI agents during their raid on Mar-a-Lago were items cryptically marked ""Info re: President of France"". It is unclear what the files may refer to and French President Emmanuel Macron has yet to comment on the seizure. But officials at the ÃlysÃ©e Palace told CBS News they ""have no comment on a judicial American procedure"". Joshua NevettBBC Politics An anti-Trump protester outside Trump Tower He has been out of office for more than a year-and-a-half, but legal issues stemming from his time in office still pose some risk for Trump. The FBI raid on his Florida home on Monday has focused attention on his handling of official papers while president. Two criminal investigations are ongoing: one into possible election interference; another into potential financial crimes. A US congressional inquiry may recommend criminal charges over Trump's activities surrounding the riot at the Capitol in Washington last year. As he contemplates a 2024 presidential run, read more about the legal cases that could threaten everything. How big are Donald Trump's legal problems? Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee slammed the FBI on Friday At a news conference in Washington earlier on Friday, Trump's Republican allies slammed the DoJ inquiry and raised concerns about the tactics employed by federal agents. âBecause many other options were available to them, we are very concerned about the method that was used in raiding Mar-a-Lago and the nine hours that transpired while they were in the presidentâs home,"" said ranking House of Representatives Intelligence Committee member Mike Turner of Ohio. New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, said the Republicans plan to investigate the president ""and his administrationâs weaponisation of the Department of Justice and FBI against Joe Bidenâs political opponents"". To launch such a committee-level inquiry, Republicans would need to win control of the House in November's mid-term elections. ""President Trump has been targeted from day one of his presidency by the FBI,"" added congressman Markwayne Mullin, of Oklahoma. There are three levels of classification in the US government. The lowest -""confidential"" - is reserved for information that could damage US national security. This is followed by the ""secret"" classification, which could cause ""serious"" damage if revealed. The third classification level, ""top secret"", is reserved for information that could cause ""exceptionally grave"" damage to US security. Apart from these three classifications,  there are additional control measures for the most highly sensitive documents - Special Access Programmes (SAP) and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). The SCI designation is listed in the warrant inventory, but it's not clear if any files were recovered from Mar-a-Lago under the SAP level of classification. Sources close to the inquiry told the New York Times that investigators had been looking for SAP material, which the newspaper describes as ""a designation that is typically reserved for extremely sensitive operations carried out by the United States abroad or for closely held technologies and capabilities"". On Thursday night, the Washington Post reported that federal agents had been searching for material ""relating to nuclear weapons"", but did not say that such files had been recovered from the Florida estate. Now that the documents have been officially unsealed, we can take a closer look at what they say. Beyond the standard forms, the warrant authorises agents to search Trump's huge Mar-a-Lago estate - but specifically any areas used by FPOTUS (Former President of the United States) and not those of other guests. The next page, however, lists exactly what agents were sent to look for: ""evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed"". It cites three United States laws: Also unsealed was a receipt of what the agents took. Among more than two dozen entries, it lists items including classified and top secret documents, a grant of clemency forTrump's former adviser Roger Stone, and unknown information about the President of France. Trump waves to New Yorkers as he heads to his deposition This wasn't the only legal headache for Trump this week. On Wednesday, he had to answer questions from New York prosecutors investigating whether he illegally inflated the value of his assets in order to get favorable loans and tax breaks. He had unsuccessfully sued to block the interview, which is known in the US as a deposition. The former president refused to answer questions for the entire morning and most of the afternoon, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. In the past, Trump has attacked other public officials who have mishandled government documents, most notably his 2016 presidential opponent Hillary Clinton after it was revealed she kept her government emails on a private server. Trump has also repeatedly criticised any suspect who invokes the Fifth Amendment right, calling it âdisgracefulâ. See this clip:  This video can not be played Donald Trump on people pleading the Fifth Amendment: 'Disgraceful' The court document lays out that Trump is being investigated for violating a federal law known as the Espionage Act. The warrant says agents are authorised to seize evidence that uncovers efforts by Trump to unlawfully retain sensitive information that could aid US adversaries or destroy or conceal US government documents. Hereâs what the warrant says FBI agents were looking for:  A spokesman for Donald Trump has told the BBC's US partner CBS News that ""the Biden administration is in obvious damage control after their botched raid"". ""They seized the Presidentâs picture books, a 'handwritten note,' and declassified documents,"" said Taylor Budowich. ""This raid of President Trumpâs home was not just unprecedented, but unnecessary - and now they are leaking lies and innuendos to try to explain away the weaponization of government against their dominant political opponent. This is outrageous.""  A receipt for the items seized by FBI agents in the warrant is three pages long. The inventory includes the clemency letter granting legal amnesty to Trump ally Roger Stone, a leatherbound box of documents and one document titled ""info re: President of France"". Also listed are documents labeled Top Secret (TP) and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). Some items on the list include ""miscellaneous secret documents"". The warrant is signed at the bottom by Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, who was present at Mar-a-Lago for the raid. A US Secret Service agent outside Mar-a-Lago one day after the raid The warrant says that agents are to search the ""45 Office"" - which refers to Trump being America's 45th president - as well as ""all storage rooms"" and all rooms used by Trump and his staff in which boxes could be stored. The warrant specifically excludes certain areas from being searched, including private guest suites or other facilities being rented or occupied by golf club members or guests.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"NHS workers in Scotland are prepared to strike over pay, union leaders have warned. Healthcare staff from five unions will be balloted on industrial action after rejecting a 5% offer from the Scottish government. Unite, Unison, GMB, Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy condemned the deal. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said he was disappointed and would look to reopen talks with the unions. The Scottish government has described the 5% pay deal as thelargest single-year increase since devolution,external. However inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - is standing at 9.4%, with the Bank of England warning it could hit 13%. Unite said the offer was a ""real-terms pay cut"" and thousands of staff were ready to take industrial action. ""Workers have indicated that they are prepared to take action in order to strike a better deal from the Scottish government,"" general secretary Sharon Graham said. ""Unite will now move to an industrial action ballot, and our members will have the full support of their union in the fight to secure better jobs, pay and conditions."" Scotland's NHS workers balloted over 5% pay offer Union disappointed by 5% pay offer to NHS staff Unison confirmed it would ballot its 50,000 NHS members from 3 October. A preliminary consultative ballot found 83% of its members would vote to take industrial action. Wilma Brown, who chairs of the union's Scotland health committee said the views of the membership were clear. ""They worked flat out during the pandemic and were promised so much by politicians and yet when it comes to the crunch our domestics, caterers, porters and other low paid members are only worth an extra Â£900 per year,"" she said. ""Our members in nursing were offered less than Â£1,500 whilst senior managers are offered more than Â£5,000 in the same pay deal.  So much for all staff being valued equally."" The union has called on First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to intervene in a bid to avoid strikes. GMB Scotland organiser Karen Leonard said healthcare workers were concerned about making ends meet as costs continue to rise. ""More of our members are affected by debt, fuel poverty and hunger, while soaring inflation and energy bills means the real-terms value of this pay cut will get bigger with each passing month - there's no doubt this crisis is turning into a catastrophe for many frontline staff and their families,"" she said. ""If the minister wants to recruit and retain the people desperately needed to help our NHS recover from the peril it is in, then he must value these key workers better and particularly those in the lowest pay grades, who do not receive the biggest cash increases under this offer. ""However, if these hard truths are not recognised and confronted then industrial action affecting NHS services looks inevitable in the months ahead."" The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said it would also launch a formal ballot on industrial action in the next few weeks. But its members would not take any action which would put women or babies at risk, they added. Jaki Lambert, RCM's director for Scotland said: ""Midwives and maternity support workers are feeling undervalued and frankly they have had enough. ""The Scottish government's sub-par pay offer will be the final straw for many members already looking for the door."" Meanwhile the RCN's Scottish members will join colleagues in England and Wales in being asked to vote in a statutory strike ballot which opens on 15 September. Julie Lamberth, chair of the RCN Scotland board, said they were ""angry and frustrated"" that the Scottish government had failed to address a workforce crisis and proposed ""yet another real terms pay cut"". ""Enough is enough. In all my years in nursing I have never known such strength of determination amongst nursing staff,"" she added. And Alex MacKenzie, who chairs the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy said members were angry about the pay offer. ""It barely meets half the current rate of inflation, let alone addressing the predicted rate which is set to rise even higher in the coming months,"" she added. Mr Yousaf, the health secretary, said: ""While we respect the mandate given to trade unions, I am disappointed they have voted to reject the record 5% pay deal for NHS Scotland Agenda for Change staff, and are now holding ballots for industrial action. ""We will consider the next steps and look to re-engage with trade unions as soon as we can, and hope to reach a satisfactory outcome.""

"Louis Thorold pictured with his mother Rachael just hours before the crash in January 2021 A driver has been found not guilty by reason of insanity of causing the death by careless driving of a baby boy in a pram. Five-month-old Louis Thorold was hit on the pavement of the A10 near Cambridge, on 22 January 2021. His mother Rachael was seriously injured. Lawyers for Shelagh Robertson, 75, said she had undiagnosed dementia at the time of the crash in Waterbeach. Jurors at Cambridge Crown Court found her condition had affected her driving. Mrs Robertson, of Stables Yard in Waterbeach, was driving home from the supermarket when she turned into the path of an oncoming van, forcing it on to the pavement where it hit the mum and baby, the trial heard. Shelagh Robertson's defence team said she had undiagnosed Alzheimer's disease at the time of the crash Louis was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. Mrs Thorold spent 10 days in a coma and 118 days in hospital, with her husband Chris describing her survival as""miraculous"". Mrs Robertson denied causing the infant's death by careless driving. Louis Thorold was born at the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge in August 2020 During the trial, James Leonard, defending, said Mrs Robertson was ""ill-equipped to negotiate"" the junction due to her dementia, while prosecutor David Matthew said that while there was ""strong evidence"" she had dementia, there was the question of ""where on the slope of dementia Shelagh Robertson was in January 2021"". Adam Zeman, professor of cognitive behavioural neurology at the University of Exeter, compiled a report on Mrs Robertson for the defence. He told the court she had ""dementia caused most probably by Alzheimer's disease in a slightly atypical presentation"". He said this would have put Mrs Robertson at ""high risk of becoming confused at that junction and one possible outcome of the confusion would be to look the wrong way"". The judge, Mark Bishop, told jurors that if they were satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defendant had dementia at the time, and either did not know what she was doing or did not know that what she was doing was wrong, they could return a special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. The boy's parents Rachael and Chris Thorold were in court to hear the verdict As jurors returned their majority verdict, the boy's parents, Chris and Rachael Thorold, who sat in the public gallery, looked down at the floor, with Mr Thorold shaking his head. In a statement released after the verdict, Mr Thorold said: ""Louis Steven James Thorold was the sweetest happiest, joyful and most beautiful baby. He was perfectly ours. He was our lives. He still is. ""Louis knew only love and cuddles before he was killed. A life sentence for us, his family, our community and everyone who hears this story."" The judge adjourned the case for a further hearing on 19 August. Speaking after the trial, Det Sgt Mark Dollard, from the road policing unit for Cambridgeshire, said: ""Regardless of the verdict nothing will ever bring Louis back and his family will have to live with that for the rest of their lives. ""It is however, a stark reminder of how important it is for anyone who gets behind the wheel of a vehicle to be competent and capable of driving safely. ""I would urge anyone who is concerned about a family member or friend and their ability to drive to speak up, discuss your concerns with your loved one or alternatively speak to your GP who can submit their concerns to the DVLA."" Following the crash, Louis' family had set up theLouis Thorold Foundation,externalin their son's memory, with the aim of preventing infant pedestrian deaths. Mr Thorold said: ""We must now look forward. Louis wouldn't want us to be sad or give up. Louis will live on. His legacy - that one day no-one will have to deal with a death of a child on Britain's roads."" Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

"Amateur detective Becky Harrington says she wants to study criminology and law after the experience A woman who turned detective to find her father's stolen car said she has been inundated with requests to find other missing vehicles. Becky Harrington, from Bournemouth, got frustrated after police failed to make progress finding the Â£12,000 Jaguar which was stolen in July. She managed to find the car four miles away after using social media and scouring CCTV. Dorset Police said inquiries to identify the offenders were continuing. The Jaguar XF was stolen from the Bournemouth home of Ms Harrington's father Ms Harrington, 32, said her father woke to find his car missing on Sunday 24 July and contacted police. ""But I just wasn't happy with how they dealt with it. I'm pretty savvy with social media so I put it in 45 odd groups and before I knew it was being shared all over the place, it just went everywhere,"" she said. ""I thought nobody is gonna walk down the street and not know about this car. If we were still waiting for the police, my dad would have no car."" Ms Harrington eventually found the abandoned 2020 Jaguar after going through CCTV from petrol stations and local shops. The car was found with rubbish in the footwell behind a block of flats about four miles from where it was stolen The experience has inspired the mother-of-two to study criminology and law at Open University. ""I've been approached by somebody asking me to help find their son's stolen BMW and other people have contacted me asking for help,"" she added. But she said she was ""less than impressed"" about how the police had dealt with the investigation and was convinced a gang was responsible for the theft. ""Twenty-four hours after I'd told them it had been found I got a call from the police and the woman said it was still marked as stolen,"" she said. Dorset Police said: ""Local officers made a number of attempts to visit the victim and consequently made contact with the victim's daughter, who then updated the police that the vehicle had been recovered. ""As part of the ongoing investigation, officers carried out house-to-house enquiries in the vicinity of where the vehicle was located and have successfully obtained significant evidence.""

"Ryan Giggs' trial is expected to last two weeks The ex-girlfriend of Ryan Giggs ""screamed in pain"" during a 999 call after he allegedly headbutted her in the face, a jury has heard. The ex-Manchester United and Wales star denies assaulting Kate Greville, causing her actual bodily harm, at his home in Manchester in November 2020. He is also said to have assaulted his ex's younger sister, Emma, 26, by elbowing her in the jaw in the same incident. Mr Giggs denies all charges. The trial at Manchester Crown Court heard that Kate Greville, 38, had returned to Mr Giggs' home in Worsley, Greater Manchester, in a taxi following a row after dinner with the former Wales football manager at his Stock Exchange hotel in Manchester city centre.

"If you love Welsh cakes, you're now free to use the name on your candles They say all is fair in love and war, but one company has dropped its plans to trademark the Welsh word for love after a backlash.

It stopped anyone making similar products using those terms, but the IPO has confirmed the firm has voluntarily given up the rights to the trademarks.

"A federal judge has unsealed the warrant that authorised the FBI to search ex-US President Donald Trump's home in Florida FBI agents who searched Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach on Monday found documents marked top secret The warrant indicates investigators had probable cause to believe Trump violated the Espionage Act FBI agents took a cache of files, including information about the ""President of France"" In a statement, Trump says the documents seized by agents at his club were ""all declassified"" Attorney General Merrick Garland had applied for the warrant's release, citing ""substantial public interest in this matter"" Edited by Jude Sheerin President Biden's Democrats have just passed a key plank of their climate-and-healthcare agenda in Congress, but it's Trump who's dominating the news cycle. Here's a reminder of what happened on this momentous day:  This live coverage was brought to you by Brajesh Upadhyay, Matt Murphy, Max Matza and Holly Honderich. Gary O'DonoghueWashington Correspondent An egret stands near Mar-a-Lago Itâs been a week for the obliteration of precedents. First the revelation that a former presidentâs home had been searched by the FBI, made public  by Donald Trump himself. That brought three days of him and his supporters shaping that ostensibly bad news narrative into familiar themes â namely that the âpolitical witch-huntâ was continuing and that the state was still out to get him. Then, on Thursday the Department of Justice decided it had had enough of being traduced â doing something they do not do and requesting the  details of what they were looking for and what they found be published. And here we are with the most top secret of  classified documents being hauled away from a private, beachfront golf club and the FBI citing potential crimes involving the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice. You might think this would put anyone on the back foot, but for the former president and his backers these are as much opportunities as they are jeopardies. They burnish his self-described position as an outsider and reinvigorate his supporters' desire for a second Trump term in which a âthird world countryâ - to quote President Trump - can be made great again. This isnât over by a long chalk. Lawn signs Defenders of Trump have been making comparisons to his old political foe, Hillary Clinton, who was found to have herself mismanaged sensitive government documents during her time as US secretary of state. She, too, was investigated under the Espionage Act for her use of a private email server. Problems first emerged for Clinton in 2014 after the state department said it was unable to transfer her emails to a congressional committee because it didn't have them. Instead of being kept on government servers, as is required under the same laws now being cited to investigate Trump, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate used a personal email that had servers at her New York home. Her lawyers transferred around 30,000 work-related emails to the state department, and deleted roughly the same number that she maintained were not work-related. Clinton claimed that none of the emails turned over were classified, but that was proven wrong by an FBI investigation. Announcing the results of the investigation in 2016, FBI Director James Comey said that 113 emails were classified, but that some had vague markings which did not make clear the sensitive nature of the documents. The FBI probe concluded in 2016 that classified information had been improperly transferred, but that it was not done deliberately. Trump capitalised politically on the controversy, leading chants at rallies of ""lock her up"". In recent days, Clinton has been having a laugh at her old adversary's expense...

power to declassify anything, so what he took with him from the White House
was declassified. Legal experts agree that a sitting president has the power to declassify any information, but they must follow a procedure. Tom Dupree, former principal deputy assistant US attorney general, told the BBC the process includes filling out forms and giving
certain authorisations. Also, a
president can declassify documents, but a former president cannot. ""That begs the question whether President Trump when he was
still President Trump actually declassified these documents,â said Dupree. He said the justice department will have to pore through each
document to ascertain whether these were
in fact declassified, and could there be any possible justification for Trump retaining those documents. ""Once they've completed that review, then they've got to
decide do they need to do further investigation? Do they need to go back? Do
they need to look in other places? Do they need to interview witnesses? ""And once
that process is complete, they'll make a decision as to whether or not to
charge anyone with a federal crime."" Brajesh UpadhyayBBC News, Washington Much of the analysis in the wake of the search has focused on one obscure criminal law mentioned in the unsealed warrant: Section 2071 of Title 18 of the United States Code. Crucially, it states anyone convicted under that law shall ""be disqualified from holding"" federal office. This is why some are suggesting a conviction could all but end Trump's rumoured hopes of returning to the White House. ""That's a real law, and if Donald Trump violated that lawâ¦ that has real penalties, including the fact that he may never be able to serve in federal office ever again,"" presidential historian Michael Beschloss told MSNBC. Some legal experts, however, insisted that the law was unlikely to apply or survive any kind of appeal, as the only constitutional restrictions on presidential eligibility are citizenship, residence and age. Read more: Could Trump investigation stop him running in 2024? In a statement on Truth Social, his online platform, Trump earlier on Friday suggested FBI agents could have planted information during their search of Mar-a-Lago. Trump's insinuation came a day after Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray publicly defended the integrity of federal agents. Trump also denied a report in the Washington Post that agents had been seeking classified documents related to nuclear weapons. ""Nuclear weapons issue is a Hoax... two Impeachments were a Hoax, the Mueller investigation was a Hoax, and much more,"" wrote Trump, adding: ""Same sleazy people involved."" ""Why wouldnât the FBI allow the inspection of areas at Mar-a-Lago with our lawyerâs, or others, present. Made them wait outside in the heat, wouldnât let them get even close - said 'ABSOLUTELY NOT.' Planting information anyone?"" he added. Trump was in New York at the time of the search. His Florida-based lawyers were present, but the FBI barred them from entering the areas being searched. Agents also reportedly asked that CCTV cameras at Mar-a-Lago be switched off during the morning raid, but the Trump Organization refused to comply. A lawyer for Trump said on Thursday they may disclose video and photos of the search. The Trump Organization former CFO appeared in court on Friday Trump suffered another legal setback on Friday when a New York judge ruled that a criminal case against his company - the Trump Organization - and its longtime chief financial officer can proceed. Former CFO Allen Weisselberg appeared in court to hear the judge's response to his February request to dismiss all 15 charges against the company and himself. Prosecutors allege that the defendants are guilty of criminal fraud and tax evasion. They say the alleged scheme allowed Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes of some $1.8m (Â£1.5m) in off-the-books income. Jury selection is set for 24 October. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar Reaction from Democratic members of Congress has been muted so far as they've just been voting a major bill through the House. But some have been piling on via social media. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota tweeted: ""Nothing to see here folks, just a former President of the United States being investigated for the violation of the Espionage Act."" Eric Swalwell of California urged Trump supporters to break from the former president, telling them that he ""stole Top Secret documents"" and ""put a target on the backs of cops"". ""If youâve been aboard the Trump Train the last 7 years, youâve been given an unexpected stop. Time to get off. Wherever you think this is going, itâs not,"" he added. Swalwell, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, has in the past faced national security scrutiny after federal agents reportedly warned him he was being targeted by a woman who was allegedly a Chinese spy. It was the National Archives and Records Administration (Nara) that sounded the alarm about classified files at Mar-a-Lago, triggering the chain of events that led to Monday's FBI search of the club. In recent days Trump has been saying that his predecessor, Barack Obama, took 33m pages of documents, ""much of them classified"", to Chicago at the end of his presidency. Not so, says the National Archives. In a statement on Friday, the National Archives said that it had obtained âexclusive legal and physical custodyâ of Obamaâs records when he left office in 2017. It said that about 30 million pages of unclassified records were transferred to a National Archives facility in the Chicago area and that they continue to be maintained âexclusively"" by the National Archives. Katty KayUS special correspondent More questions than answers right now on what this means for Trump's future. First of all, why was he keeping classified documents, including one set marked top secret and only meant to be viewed in a secure government facility? What did he want to do with them? Trump claims they were all declassified. Clearly the Department of Justice disagrees. On the politics: the fact Trump is being investigated under the Espionage Act sounds dramatic, but will it cause any of his supporters to think twice about his fitness for office? Seems unlikely. Millions of Americans are now convinced the federal government is unfairly targeting Trump. On the law: legal scholars are in uncharted waters and will have to examine the implications of this. The big question being, if found guilty, would it make Trump ineligible for a re-election bid? Early reaction to this week's drama suggests a clear split between those who are galvanised to support the president and those who are reminded how exhausted they were during the Trump presidency. As we've been reporting, among the files seized by FBI agents during their raid on Mar-a-Lago were items cryptically marked ""Info re: President of France"". It is unclear what the files may refer to and French President Emmanuel Macron has yet to comment on the seizure. But officials at the ÃlysÃ©e Palace told CBS News they ""have no comment on a judicial American procedure"". Joshua NevettBBC Politics An anti-Trump protester outside Trump Tower He has been out of office for more than a year-and-a-half, but legal issues stemming from his time in office still pose some risk for Trump. The FBI raid on his Florida home on Monday has focused attention on his handling of official papers while president. Two criminal investigations are ongoing: one into possible election interference; another into potential financial crimes. A US congressional inquiry may recommend criminal charges over Trump's activities surrounding the riot at the Capitol in Washington last year. As he contemplates a 2024 presidential run, read more about the legal cases that could threaten everything. How big are Donald Trump's legal problems? Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee slammed the FBI on Friday At a news conference in Washington earlier on Friday, Trump's Republican allies slammed the DoJ inquiry and raised concerns about the tactics employed by federal agents. âBecause many other options were available to them, we are very concerned about the method that was used in raiding Mar-a-Lago and the nine hours that transpired while they were in the presidentâs home,"" said ranking House of Representatives Intelligence Committee member Mike Turner of Ohio. New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, said the Republicans plan to investigate the president ""and his administrationâs weaponisation of the Department of Justice and FBI against Joe Bidenâs political opponents"". To launch such a committee-level inquiry, Republicans would need to win control of the House in November's mid-term elections. ""President Trump has been targeted from day one of his presidency by the FBI,"" added congressman Markwayne Mullin, of Oklahoma. There are three levels of classification in the US government. The lowest -""confidential"" - is reserved for information that could damage US national security. This is followed by the ""secret"" classification, which could cause ""serious"" damage if revealed. The third classification level, ""top secret"", is reserved for information that could cause ""exceptionally grave"" damage to US security. Apart from these three classifications,  there are additional control measures for the most highly sensitive documents - Special Access Programmes (SAP) and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). The SCI designation is listed in the warrant inventory, but it's not clear if any files were recovered from Mar-a-Lago under the SAP level of classification. Sources close to the inquiry told the New York Times that investigators had been looking for SAP material, which the newspaper describes as ""a designation that is typically reserved for extremely sensitive operations carried out by the United States abroad or for closely held technologies and capabilities"". On Thursday night, the Washington Post reported that federal agents had been searching for material ""relating to nuclear weapons"", but did not say that such files had been recovered from the Florida estate. Now that the documents have been officially unsealed, we can take a closer look at what they say. Beyond the standard forms, the warrant authorises agents to search Trump's huge Mar-a-Lago estate - but specifically any areas used by FPOTUS (Former President of the United States) and not those of other guests. The next page, however, lists exactly what agents were sent to look for: ""evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed"". It cites three United States laws: Also unsealed was a receipt of what the agents took. Among more than two dozen entries, it lists items including classified and top secret documents, a grant of clemency forTrump's former adviser Roger Stone, and unknown information about the President of France. Trump waves to New Yorkers as he heads to his deposition This wasn't the only legal headache for Trump this week. On Wednesday, he had to answer questions from New York prosecutors investigating whether he illegally inflated the value of his assets in order to get favorable loans and tax breaks. He had unsuccessfully sued to block the interview, which is known in the US as a deposition. The former president refused to answer questions for the entire morning and most of the afternoon, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. In the past, Trump has attacked other public officials who have mishandled government documents, most notably his 2016 presidential opponent Hillary Clinton after it was revealed she kept her government emails on a private server. Trump has also repeatedly criticised any suspect who invokes the Fifth Amendment right, calling it âdisgracefulâ. See this clip:  This video can not be played Donald Trump on people pleading the Fifth Amendment: 'Disgraceful' The court document lays out that Trump is being investigated for violating a federal law known as the Espionage Act. The warrant says agents are authorised to seize evidence that uncovers efforts by Trump to unlawfully retain sensitive information that could aid US adversaries or destroy or conceal US government documents. Hereâs what the warrant says FBI agents were looking for:  A spokesman for Donald Trump has told the BBC's US partner CBS News that ""the Biden administration is in obvious damage control after their botched raid"". ""They seized the Presidentâs picture books, a 'handwritten note,' and declassified documents,"" said Taylor Budowich. ""This raid of President Trumpâs home was not just unprecedented, but unnecessary - and now they are leaking lies and innuendos to try to explain away the weaponization of government against their dominant political opponent. This is outrageous.""  A receipt for the items seized by FBI agents in the warrant is three pages long. The inventory includes the clemency letter granting legal amnesty to Trump ally Roger Stone, a leatherbound box of documents and one document titled ""info re: President of France"". Also listed are documents labeled Top Secret (TP) and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). Some items on the list include ""miscellaneous secret documents"". The warrant is signed at the bottom by Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, who was present at Mar-a-Lago for the raid. A US Secret Service agent outside Mar-a-Lago one day after the raid The warrant says that agents are to search the ""45 Office"" - which refers to Trump being America's 45th president - as well as ""all storage rooms"" and all rooms used by Trump and his staff in which boxes could be stored. The warrant specifically excludes certain areas from being searched, including private guest suites or other facilities being rented or occupied by golf club members or guests.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"An official drought has been declared as low-water levels and tinder-dry conditions continue across the UK. Eight parts of England, including Devon, Kent, East Anglia and Lincolnshire are affected. The move is expected to trigger stricter controls on water use and five water companies have already announced restrictions, including hosepipe bans. Millions are expected to be impacted but the Environment Agency said essential water supplies were safe. John Curtin, director of operations, said the drought would go on for ""a long time"" and warned of possible restrictions on crop growing and further hosepipe bans. It comes as the prolonged dry weather - combined with the current heatwave and July's record-breaking temperatures - have depleted rivers, reservoirs and aquifers. Large swathes of England are bone-dry, with scenes of parched earth and grass turned yellow. The conditions have prompted the Environment Agency to move eight of its 14 areas into drought status: Devon and Cornwall Solent and South Downs Kent and South London Hertfordshire and North London East Anglia Thames Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire East Midlands Yorkshire and the West Midlands are also expected to move into a drought later in August. The decision to declare a drought was taken after a meeting of the National Drought Group - made up of government and agency officials, water firms and groups including the National Farmers' Union. Announcing a drought means government and water companies will put into action their plans to deal with it, with measures including hosepipe bans and taking more water than usual from rivers. Members of the public and businesses in drought-affected areas are also being urged to use water wisely followingthe driest first seven months of the year since 1976. Elsewhere, Wales Drought Liaison group is also looking at the effect of the dry weather. LIVE UPDATES: Drought to be declared Will there be a hosepipe ban in my area? Flames faster than you can run - firefighters on wildfires The science of drought explained in pictures Five water companies - Welsh Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, South East Water and, most recently Yorkshire Water - have all announced hosepipe bans, whileYorkshire Water said on Friday that a banwould start on 26 August. The latter firm, which has more than five million customers, says parts of the region have seen the lowest rainfall since records began more than 130 years ago. It also said rivers and reservoirs in the region were running at 20% lower than expected for the time of year. South East Water, whose ban came into force on Friday, is now asking people to observe restrictions on using hosepipes to water plants, wash the car and fill paddling pools - with rule-breakers facing fines of up to Â£1,000. What are water companies doing to tackle leaks? How the heatwave is changing landscapes The driest start to a year since 1976 Dominic Gardener, a farmer in West Sussex, said the dry weather was posing huge challenges for farmers. ""Everything is starting to struggle a bit - our grass is not growing at all - and livestock, we're having to feed them extra food,"" he said, adding crop yields had also been reduced by the dryness. Farmers in parts of Fife are beingtemporarily banned from using waterfrom the River Eden on their fields. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency says the measure will come into effect from midnight on Saturday to tackle critical water shortages. Afour-day amber warning for extreme heatfrom the Met Office is in place for many parts of England and Wales until Sunday. Temperatures are forecast to be lower early next week, however, and the Met Office has issued yellow warnings for thunderstorms on Monday, covering most of England, Wales and Scotland. And its fire severity index - which assesses how severe a blaze could become - is currently ""very high"" for most of England and Wales. The situation facing firefighters across the UK has been described as ""unprecedented"",with increasing numbers of wildfires. Fires have broken out across the nation, including in Leytonstone, east London, Studland Bay, Dorset,Creswell, in Derbyshire,The Dower House in Bristol, and Overton, near Basingstoke in Hampshire. Police have evacuated about 50 homes in Creswell after a major incident was declared due to a field fire. Fire crews are also tackling a large blaze whichbroke out at a Leicestershire recycling centre. Meanwhile, homeless peoplestruggling with the extreme heat in Bristolsaid it was ""making us sick,"" and even sitting in the shade was ""tiring and sweaty and uncomfortable"". Bristol Street Outreach Team, operated by charity St Mungo's, has been carrying out additional shifts and giving out water, advice and sun protection to those in need. This video can not be played Watch latest UK weather forecast: Amber heat warning in force UK temperatures have been rising day-on-day through the week. According to the Met Office, on Friday the highest temperatures were recorded in: Wiggonholt, West Sussex, at 34.5C Northolt, west London, and Hermonceux West End, East Sussex, at 34.2C Heathrow, west London, at 33.9C Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, at 33.8C Chivenor, Devon, at 33.7C. Over the weekend temperatures could peak at 36C. Met Office chief meteorologist Andy Page said there would be ""increasingly warm nights"" with temperatures not expected to drop below the low 20s in some places in the south. Sir Keir Starmer has accused the government of failing to fully prepare the UK for drought, and also out at the response of water companies. Water firms have been criticised over leaks, with about three billion litres of water lost each day in the UK - between 20% and 24% of the total water supply. The Labour leader said the drought was ""predictable"" but ""as usual we had no plan from the government"". Environment Secretary George Eustice said there was ""no reason for people to be alarmed"". He told BBC News that the UK's water supply ""remains resilient"" and that ""we're in a stronger position than ever"" to withstand droughts, with progress made on leaks and infrastructure to move water between reservoirs. Heatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. Research institute UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) said it would require ""exceptional"" rainfall over the next one to three months to bring river, reservoir and groundwater levels back up to normal. It said analysis showed exceptionally low levels would probably continue until October in southern England and Wales. But scientists have warned bouts of heavy rain after a prolonged period of hot weather can cause flash flooding. Robert Thompson, a professor of Meteorology at the University of Reading, said ""the ground has effectively become like urban concrete"" and will not absorb water quickly enough to cope with longer showers. The situation in the UK is being mirrored across Europe. Much of the continent is baking in record heat, exposing riverbeds and triggering restrictions on water use in many areas. A drought has also hitGermany's Rhine River, where the water is already too low to allow some larger vessels through. Restrictions on usage during hosepipe bans can vary between water providers but generally people are not allowed to use hosepipes or anything that connects to a hosepipe or an outside tap.During a ban, people cannot use a hosepipe to: water a garden or plants fill a paddling or swimming pool clean a car fill a pond clean walls or windows But you can use other water sources, like using your mains water supply but with buckets or watering cans instead of hosepipes, or using stored rainwater from a water butt and there are some exceptions when a hosepipe can be used. Anyone breaking the rules could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. Read morehere. Have you been affected by the hot weather and restrictions?

"This video can not be played Itâs been one of the driest years for a century in years More action is needed in Wales to adapt to extreme heat caused by climate change, an expert has said. Prof Andrew Flynn, of Cardiff University, said the country could face regular repeats of this summer's prolonged heatwaves and dry conditions. Farmers have warned of a ""perfect storm"" as crops wither at a time of soaring production costs. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said it was monitoring the situation very closely. An expert panel, including NRW,have reconvened to monitor the impact of the heatwave on water levelsand discuss whether to declare an official drought. How much water goes from Wales to England? Climate change in Wales in charts As well as seeing record-breaking temperatures, it has been one of the driest years for a century in Wales - which saw just 61% of average rainfall from March to July. A Met Office amber warning for extreme heat is in place for large parts of Wales until Sunday, in addition to a warning of a ""very high"" risk of wildfires. Communities in Pembrokeshire and parts of Carmarthenshire face a hosepipe ban from 19 August. At Clearwell Farm on the outskirts of Cardiff, it has been ""a very worrying time"" for farmer David Phillips. A cold, dry spring has been made worse by difficulties getting fertiliser because of the Ukraine crisis, and now the hot and dry spells, says farmer David Phillips Standing in a field of barley, he said the stalks which are barely reaching his knees should be well over his waist. He said a cold, dry spring had been exacerbated by difficulties getting fertiliser because of the Ukraine crisis. ""Then once the crops started growing they've had searing heat on them which has effectively burnt them off rather than ripening them - it's the perfect storm,"" said Mr Phillips. His yield would be down by a third and the grain could only be good enough for animal feed rather than being sold for malting, he said. David Phillips says he had to sink a borehole at Clearwell Farm as the water supply from a ground level spring was becoming erratic The farm also grows a range of specialist crops - pumpkins for Halloween, Christmas trees and a sunflower and maize attraction - all of which are suffering due to the challenging conditions. Mr Phillips said he had started taking climate change seriously many years ago because ""we live and work in it, we could see what was happening"". The family sunk a borehole as the water supply from a ground level spring had become erratic, and they now operate their own wind turbine and solar panels to generate green energy. Why climate change worries Wales' 'wettest town' Young people 'feel hopeless' about climate change But the next generation would need to build irrigation ponds to preserve water, Mr Phillips predicted. ""The water situation is changing dramatically. When we do have storms they tend to be heavier and the water runs off instead of sinking into the ground. The ground conditions lower down are drier too - even during the winter,"" he explained. Rhodri Davies says this year's poor crop will have a huge financial burden for his farming business Wales' potato farmers have also been badly affected. ""Even if we did have rain next week the plants are now starting to die off, they wouldn't bulk up any more so we're losing nigh on 50% of the crop,"" said Rhodri Davies, of Rosedew farm in Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan. ""There is a financial burden to that because we haven't got the volume of potatoes per acre to sell."" ""We've been doing this now for 10 years and this has been the worst year since we started,"" he said. However for some growers, the warmer weather means bigger, better quality yields. Llanerch Vineyard Hotel normally produces around 12,000 tonnes of grapes a year Llanerch Vineyard Hotel in Pontyclun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, normally harvests around 12,000 tonnes of grapes every year which in turn produces 12,000 bottles of wine. This year's warmer weather means they expect to produce 18,000 tonnes of grapes and will able to extend their range of wines. Managing director Ryan Davies said: ""This year is going to be another fantastic year for us. ""It's quite similar weather to 2018 where we've had periods of nice, dry weather which has allowed our vines to ripen quite well. ""They've got quite deep roots. They say a vine doesn't like having wet feet so this weather works really well for the vines and it means we're going to have a really good harvest. ""We'll have more grapes of a better quality because they'll ripen better and we're less likely to have diseases as well."" Vineyard managing director Ryan Davies says the warmer weather will produce more, better quality grapes For his business, the prospect of warmer, dryer weather is a positive. ""We're in a lucky situation,"" he said. ""Our business thrives in this warm sunny weather. We also run a hospitality business and during the warmer climate more people come out, they dine, we do the vineyard tours and tastings so it works really well for us."" Wales is getting hotter, with a clear trend for increasing sunshine hours too,according to a major assessment of climate risks in 2021,external. Summer rainfall is expected to decrease by approximately 15% by the 2050s and by between 18% to 26% by the 2080s, with experts warning periods of water scarcity may become more prevalent. ""The weather we're experiencing this summer can be directly linked to humanly induced climate change, the greenhouse gases we've pumped into the atmosphere,"" explained Prof Flynn. Prof Andrew Flynn says extreme heat will affect all areas of our lives He specialises in researching ways of adapting to climate change, an area that has traditionally received ""less attention"" than efforts to cut emissions, he claimed. ""But now we're beginning to experience climate change in our communities we recognise that we need to do much more to think about how we adapt,"" Prof Flynn explained. BBC Wales 'hasn't made enough progress on diversity' More people needed to work with Hollywood stars He is currently running a project alongside the Welsh government, NRW, Public Health Wales and the Future Generations Commissioner's office with communities in Rhyl and Swansea to try to better understand future challenges. When it comes to exceptionally hot or dry weather, it is an area that's seen even less focus because ""we typically think of ourselves as a rather wet, green country"", he said. ""But the nature of climate change is it's going to increase the variability of the ways in which we experience our environments,"" he added. Challenges include how to keep homes and workplaces cool, ensuring transport systems could keep running as well as managing water. Some of Wales' rivers have reached their lowest levels on record during the recent dry spell, with campaigners warning of devastating impacts for fish stocks. Independent consultant on freshwater fisheries Richard Garner Williams said anglers should now put a stop to all fishing if they had not done so already. It's been one of the driest years for a century in Wales - this photo was taken of the dry conditions at Cliff Top Park in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan ""The real danger we're facing now is that these oxygen-deprived waters will become barren of all but the most primitive life forms,"" he said. Catrin Hornung, of NRW, said it was monitoring the ""significant"" situation ""very closely"", working with partners ""to decide on a course of action and what restrictions if any we need to put in place"". Currently, Wales is officially in a state of ""prolonged dry weather"", she said, and it was ""difficult to tell"" at this stage whether a drought would be declared in some areas. ""We have a set of indicators or triggers we follow such as river flows, water quality and environmental impacts and we monitor every river against those indicators,"" she explained. ""We're keeping a very close eye on all parts of Wales and we would encourage people to listen to the advice of water companies and use water wisely.""

"A teaching union says the proposed pay rise is too low Members of a teaching union have warned of a potential vote on strike action after its members in Wales rejected a below-inflation pay rise. It wasannounced last month that teachers' salaries will rise by 5% in September. NASUWT surveyed its members in Wales and said 78% believe the pay award was ""inadequate"". Inflation, the rate at which prices are rising, currently stands at 9.4% and is predicted to reach 13% in October. There are 26,600 teachers in Wales with the average pay at Â£39,009. In July, Education Minister Jeremy Miles accepted the recommendations of an independent pay review body that salaries should rise by 5%. How does public sector pay get sorted in Wales? School absences more than double since Covid Family quit Wales as girl faces racism at school That will put starting salaries for new teachers at Â£28,866, with those of more experienced classroom teachers rising to Â£44,450. But NASUWT, a TUC-affiliated trade union representing teachers and headteachers in the UK, called for 12% in 2022/23 and has threatened to ballot for strike action in the autumn unless there is a further increase. Of the nearly 700 teachers who responded to its survey, the union also said 70% disagreed with or were angry with the Welsh government's offer. Starting salaries for teachers will be Â£28,866 under the proposals ""The Welsh Government's pay offer falls way short of what teachers are demanding, following a decade of real terms pay cuts and the current cost of living crisis,"" said Neil Butler, NASUWT's official in Wales. ""This pay offer takes the teacher pay gap since 2010 to 22.4%. ""NASUWT members have again told us that they reject the imposition of a below-inflation pay award."" Salaries could go up by 3.5% in the second year, subject to a review. Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT general secretary, added: ""Ministers have refused to respond to our calls for proper negotiations and, once again, we are calling on ministers to get around the table to find a solution. ""However, in the event that there is no improvement, the union remains committed to balloting its members in the autumn term for industrial action."" Mr Miles previously said he was limited in how far he could go in raising pay and criticised the UK government's funding settlement for Wales. A similar pay - 5% for most teachers - has been offered in England. In a previous response to Welsh government criticism, the UK government said the Welsh government has had more funding than at any time since devolution began.

"A federal judge has unsealed the warrant that authorised the FBI to search ex-US President Donald Trump's home in Florida FBI agents who searched Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach on Monday found documents marked top secret The warrant indicates investigators had probable cause to believe Trump violated the Espionage Act FBI agents took a cache of files, including information about the ""President of France"" In a statement, Trump says the documents seized by agents at his club were ""all declassified"" Attorney General Merrick Garland had applied for the warrant's release, citing ""substantial public interest in this matter"" Edited by Jude Sheerin President Biden's Democrats have just passed a key plank of their climate-and-healthcare agenda in Congress, but it's Trump who's dominating the news cycle. Here's a reminder of what happened on this momentous day:  This live coverage was brought to you by Brajesh Upadhyay, Matt Murphy, Max Matza and Holly Honderich. Gary O'DonoghueWashington Correspondent An egret stands near Mar-a-Lago Itâs been a week for the obliteration of precedents. First the revelation that a former presidentâs home had been searched by the FBI, made public  by Donald Trump himself. That brought three days of him and his supporters shaping that ostensibly bad news narrative into familiar themes â namely that the âpolitical witch-huntâ was continuing and that the state was still out to get him. Then, on Thursday the Department of Justice decided it had had enough of being traduced â doing something they do not do and requesting the  details of what they were looking for and what they found be published. And here we are with the most top secret of  classified documents being hauled away from a private, beachfront golf club and the FBI citing potential crimes involving the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice. You might think this would put anyone on the back foot, but for the former president and his backers these are as much opportunities as they are jeopardies. They burnish his self-described position as an outsider and reinvigorate his supporters' desire for a second Trump term in which a âthird world countryâ - to quote President Trump - can be made great again. This isnât over by a long chalk. Lawn signs Defenders of Trump have been making comparisons to his old political foe, Hillary Clinton, who was found to have herself mismanaged sensitive government documents during her time as US secretary of state. She, too, was investigated under the Espionage Act for her use of a private email server. Problems first emerged for Clinton in 2014 after the state department said it was unable to transfer her emails to a congressional committee because it didn't have them. Instead of being kept on government servers, as is required under the same laws now being cited to investigate Trump, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate used a personal email that had servers at her New York home. Her lawyers transferred around 30,000 work-related emails to the state department, and deleted roughly the same number that she maintained were not work-related. Clinton claimed that none of the emails turned over were classified, but that was proven wrong by an FBI investigation. Announcing the results of the investigation in 2016, FBI Director James Comey said that 113 emails were classified, but that some had vague markings which did not make clear the sensitive nature of the documents. The FBI probe concluded in 2016 that classified information had been improperly transferred, but that it was not done deliberately. Trump capitalised politically on the controversy, leading chants at rallies of ""lock her up"". In recent days, Clinton has been having a laugh at her old adversary's expense...

power to declassify anything, so what he took with him from the White House
was declassified. Legal experts agree that a sitting president has the power to declassify any information, but they must follow a procedure. Tom Dupree, former principal deputy assistant US attorney general, told the BBC the process includes filling out forms and giving
certain authorisations. Also, a
president can declassify documents, but a former president cannot. ""That begs the question whether President Trump when he was
still President Trump actually declassified these documents,â said Dupree. He said the justice department will have to pore through each
document to ascertain whether these were
in fact declassified, and could there be any possible justification for Trump retaining those documents. ""Once they've completed that review, then they've got to
decide do they need to do further investigation? Do they need to go back? Do
they need to look in other places? Do they need to interview witnesses? ""And once
that process is complete, they'll make a decision as to whether or not to
charge anyone with a federal crime."" Brajesh UpadhyayBBC News, Washington Much of the analysis in the wake of the search has focused on one obscure criminal law mentioned in the unsealed warrant: Section 2071 of Title 18 of the United States Code. Crucially, it states anyone convicted under that law shall ""be disqualified from holding"" federal office. This is why some are suggesting a conviction could all but end Trump's rumoured hopes of returning to the White House. ""That's a real law, and if Donald Trump violated that lawâ¦ that has real penalties, including the fact that he may never be able to serve in federal office ever again,"" presidential historian Michael Beschloss told MSNBC. Some legal experts, however, insisted that the law was unlikely to apply or survive any kind of appeal, as the only constitutional restrictions on presidential eligibility are citizenship, residence and age. Read more: Could Trump investigation stop him running in 2024? In a statement on Truth Social, his online platform, Trump earlier on Friday suggested FBI agents could have planted information during their search of Mar-a-Lago. Trump's insinuation came a day after Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray publicly defended the integrity of federal agents. Trump also denied a report in the Washington Post that agents had been seeking classified documents related to nuclear weapons. ""Nuclear weapons issue is a Hoax... two Impeachments were a Hoax, the Mueller investigation was a Hoax, and much more,"" wrote Trump, adding: ""Same sleazy people involved."" ""Why wouldnât the FBI allow the inspection of areas at Mar-a-Lago with our lawyerâs, or others, present. Made them wait outside in the heat, wouldnât let them get even close - said 'ABSOLUTELY NOT.' Planting information anyone?"" he added. Trump was in New York at the time of the search. His Florida-based lawyers were present, but the FBI barred them from entering the areas being searched. Agents also reportedly asked that CCTV cameras at Mar-a-Lago be switched off during the morning raid, but the Trump Organization refused to comply. A lawyer for Trump said on Thursday they may disclose video and photos of the search. The Trump Organization former CFO appeared in court on Friday Trump suffered another legal setback on Friday when a New York judge ruled that a criminal case against his company - the Trump Organization - and its longtime chief financial officer can proceed. Former CFO Allen Weisselberg appeared in court to hear the judge's response to his February request to dismiss all 15 charges against the company and himself. Prosecutors allege that the defendants are guilty of criminal fraud and tax evasion. They say the alleged scheme allowed Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes of some $1.8m (Â£1.5m) in off-the-books income. Jury selection is set for 24 October. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar Reaction from Democratic members of Congress has been muted so far as they've just been voting a major bill through the House. But some have been piling on via social media. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota tweeted: ""Nothing to see here folks, just a former President of the United States being investigated for the violation of the Espionage Act."" Eric Swalwell of California urged Trump supporters to break from the former president, telling them that he ""stole Top Secret documents"" and ""put a target on the backs of cops"". ""If youâve been aboard the Trump Train the last 7 years, youâve been given an unexpected stop. Time to get off. Wherever you think this is going, itâs not,"" he added. Swalwell, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, has in the past faced national security scrutiny after federal agents reportedly warned him he was being targeted by a woman who was allegedly a Chinese spy. It was the National Archives and Records Administration (Nara) that sounded the alarm about classified files at Mar-a-Lago, triggering the chain of events that led to Monday's FBI search of the club. In recent days Trump has been saying that his predecessor, Barack Obama, took 33m pages of documents, ""much of them classified"", to Chicago at the end of his presidency. Not so, says the National Archives. In a statement on Friday, the National Archives said that it had obtained âexclusive legal and physical custodyâ of Obamaâs records when he left office in 2017. It said that about 30 million pages of unclassified records were transferred to a National Archives facility in the Chicago area and that they continue to be maintained âexclusively"" by the National Archives. Katty KayUS special correspondent More questions than answers right now on what this means for Trump's future. First of all, why was he keeping classified documents, including one set marked top secret and only meant to be viewed in a secure government facility? What did he want to do with them? Trump claims they were all declassified. Clearly the Department of Justice disagrees. On the politics: the fact Trump is being investigated under the Espionage Act sounds dramatic, but will it cause any of his supporters to think twice about his fitness for office? Seems unlikely. Millions of Americans are now convinced the federal government is unfairly targeting Trump. On the law: legal scholars are in uncharted waters and will have to examine the implications of this. The big question being, if found guilty, would it make Trump ineligible for a re-election bid? Early reaction to this week's drama suggests a clear split between those who are galvanised to support the president and those who are reminded how exhausted they were during the Trump presidency. As we've been reporting, among the files seized by FBI agents during their raid on Mar-a-Lago were items cryptically marked ""Info re: President of France"". It is unclear what the files may refer to and French President Emmanuel Macron has yet to comment on the seizure. But officials at the ÃlysÃ©e Palace told CBS News they ""have no comment on a judicial American procedure"". Joshua NevettBBC Politics An anti-Trump protester outside Trump Tower He has been out of office for more than a year-and-a-half, but legal issues stemming from his time in office still pose some risk for Trump. The FBI raid on his Florida home on Monday has focused attention on his handling of official papers while president. Two criminal investigations are ongoing: one into possible election interference; another into potential financial crimes. A US congressional inquiry may recommend criminal charges over Trump's activities surrounding the riot at the Capitol in Washington last year. As he contemplates a 2024 presidential run, read more about the legal cases that could threaten everything. How big are Donald Trump's legal problems? Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee slammed the FBI on Friday At a news conference in Washington earlier on Friday, Trump's Republican allies slammed the DoJ inquiry and raised concerns about the tactics employed by federal agents. âBecause many other options were available to them, we are very concerned about the method that was used in raiding Mar-a-Lago and the nine hours that transpired while they were in the presidentâs home,"" said ranking House of Representatives Intelligence Committee member Mike Turner of Ohio. New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, said the Republicans plan to investigate the president ""and his administrationâs weaponisation of the Department of Justice and FBI against Joe Bidenâs political opponents"". To launch such a committee-level inquiry, Republicans would need to win control of the House in November's mid-term elections. ""President Trump has been targeted from day one of his presidency by the FBI,"" added congressman Markwayne Mullin, of Oklahoma. There are three levels of classification in the US government. The lowest -""confidential"" - is reserved for information that could damage US national security. This is followed by the ""secret"" classification, which could cause ""serious"" damage if revealed. The third classification level, ""top secret"", is reserved for information that could cause ""exceptionally grave"" damage to US security. Apart from these three classifications,  there are additional control measures for the most highly sensitive documents - Special Access Programmes (SAP) and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). The SCI designation is listed in the warrant inventory, but it's not clear if any files were recovered from Mar-a-Lago under the SAP level of classification. Sources close to the inquiry told the New York Times that investigators had been looking for SAP material, which the newspaper describes as ""a designation that is typically reserved for extremely sensitive operations carried out by the United States abroad or for closely held technologies and capabilities"". On Thursday night, the Washington Post reported that federal agents had been searching for material ""relating to nuclear weapons"", but did not say that such files had been recovered from the Florida estate. Now that the documents have been officially unsealed, we can take a closer look at what they say. Beyond the standard forms, the warrant authorises agents to search Trump's huge Mar-a-Lago estate - but specifically any areas used by FPOTUS (Former President of the United States) and not those of other guests. The next page, however, lists exactly what agents were sent to look for: ""evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed"". It cites three United States laws: Also unsealed was a receipt of what the agents took. Among more than two dozen entries, it lists items including classified and top secret documents, a grant of clemency forTrump's former adviser Roger Stone, and unknown information about the President of France. Trump waves to New Yorkers as he heads to his deposition This wasn't the only legal headache for Trump this week. On Wednesday, he had to answer questions from New York prosecutors investigating whether he illegally inflated the value of his assets in order to get favorable loans and tax breaks. He had unsuccessfully sued to block the interview, which is known in the US as a deposition. The former president refused to answer questions for the entire morning and most of the afternoon, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. In the past, Trump has attacked other public officials who have mishandled government documents, most notably his 2016 presidential opponent Hillary Clinton after it was revealed she kept her government emails on a private server. Trump has also repeatedly criticised any suspect who invokes the Fifth Amendment right, calling it âdisgracefulâ. See this clip:  This video can not be played Donald Trump on people pleading the Fifth Amendment: 'Disgraceful' The court document lays out that Trump is being investigated for violating a federal law known as the Espionage Act. The warrant says agents are authorised to seize evidence that uncovers efforts by Trump to unlawfully retain sensitive information that could aid US adversaries or destroy or conceal US government documents. Hereâs what the warrant says FBI agents were looking for:  A spokesman for Donald Trump has told the BBC's US partner CBS News that ""the Biden administration is in obvious damage control after their botched raid"". ""They seized the Presidentâs picture books, a 'handwritten note,' and declassified documents,"" said Taylor Budowich. ""This raid of President Trumpâs home was not just unprecedented, but unnecessary - and now they are leaking lies and innuendos to try to explain away the weaponization of government against their dominant political opponent. This is outrageous.""  A receipt for the items seized by FBI agents in the warrant is three pages long. The inventory includes the clemency letter granting legal amnesty to Trump ally Roger Stone, a leatherbound box of documents and one document titled ""info re: President of France"". Also listed are documents labeled Top Secret (TP) and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). Some items on the list include ""miscellaneous secret documents"". The warrant is signed at the bottom by Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, who was present at Mar-a-Lago for the raid. A US Secret Service agent outside Mar-a-Lago one day after the raid The warrant says that agents are to search the ""45 Office"" - which refers to Trump being America's 45th president - as well as ""all storage rooms"" and all rooms used by Trump and his staff in which boxes could be stored. The warrant specifically excludes certain areas from being searched, including private guest suites or other facilities being rented or occupied by golf club members or guests.  Â© 2025 BBC.

In a statement on Truth Social, his online platform, Trump earlier on Friday suggested FBI agents could have planted information during their search of Mar-a-Lago. Trump's insinuation came a day after Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray publicly defended the integrity of federal agents. Trump also denied a report in the Washington Post that agents had been seeking classified documents related to nuclear weapons. ""Nuclear weapons issue is a Hoax... two Impeachments were a Hoax, the Mueller investigation was a Hoax, and much more,"" wrote Trump, adding: ""Same sleazy people involved."" ""Why wouldnât the FBI allow the inspection of areas at Mar-a-Lago with our lawyerâs, or others, present. Made them wait outside in the heat, wouldnât let them get even close - said 'ABSOLUTELY NOT.' Planting information anyone?"" he added. Trump was in New York at the time of the search. His Florida-based lawyers were present, but the FBI barred them from entering the areas being searched. Agents also reportedly asked that CCTV cameras at Mar-a-Lago be switched off during the morning raid, but the Trump Organization refused to comply. A lawyer for Trump said on Thursday they may disclose video and photos of the search. The Trump Organization former CFO appeared in court on Friday Trump suffered another legal setback on Friday when a New York judge ruled that a criminal case against his company - the Trump Organization - and its longtime chief financial officer can proceed. Former CFO Allen Weisselberg appeared in court to hear the judge's response to his February request to dismiss all 15 charges against the company and himself. Prosecutors allege that the defendants are guilty of criminal fraud and tax evasion. They say the alleged scheme allowed Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes of some $1.8m (Â£1.5m) in off-the-books income. Jury selection is set for 24 October. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar Reaction from Democratic members of Congress has been muted so far as they've just been voting a major bill through the House. But some have been piling on via social media. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota tweeted: ""Nothing to see here folks, just a former President of the United States being investigated for the violation of the Espionage Act."" Eric Swalwell of California urged Trump supporters to break from the former president, telling them that he ""stole Top Secret documents"" and ""put a target on the backs of cops"". ""If youâve been aboard the Trump Train the last 7 years, youâve been given an unexpected stop. Time to get off. Wherever you think this is going, itâs not,"" he added. Swalwell, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, has in the past faced national security scrutiny after federal agents reportedly warned him he was being targeted by a woman who was allegedly a Chinese spy. It was the National Archives and Records Administration (Nara) that sounded the alarm about classified files at Mar-a-Lago, triggering the chain of events that led to Monday's FBI search of the club. In recent days Trump has been saying that his predecessor, Barack Obama, took 33m pages of documents, ""much of them classified"", to Chicago at the end of his presidency. Not so, says the National Archives. In a statement on Friday, the National Archives said that it had obtained âexclusive legal and physical custodyâ of Obamaâs records when he left office in 2017. It said that about 30 million pages of unclassified records were transferred to a National Archives facility in the Chicago area and that they continue to be maintained âexclusively"" by the National Archives. Katty KayUS special correspondent More questions than answers right now on what this means for Trump's future. First of all, why was he keeping classified documents, including one set marked top secret and only meant to be viewed in a secure government facility? What did he want to do with them? Trump claims they were all declassified. Clearly the Department of Justice disagrees. On the politics: the fact Trump is being investigated under the Espionage Act sounds dramatic, but will it cause any of his supporters to think twice about his fitness for office? Seems unlikely. Millions of Americans are now convinced the federal government is unfairly targeting Trump. On the law: legal scholars are in uncharted waters and will have to examine the implications of this. The big question being, if found guilty, would it make Trump ineligible for a re-election bid? Early reaction to this week's drama suggests a clear split between those who are galvanised to support the president and those who are reminded how exhausted they were during the Trump presidency. As we've been reporting, among the files seized by FBI agents during their raid on Mar-a-Lago were items cryptically marked ""Info re: President of France"". It is unclear what the files may refer to and French President Emmanuel Macron has yet to comment on the seizure. But officials at the ÃlysÃ©e Palace told CBS News they ""have no comment on a judicial American procedure"". Joshua NevettBBC Politics An anti-Trump protester outside Trump Tower He has been out of office for more than a year-and-a-half, but legal issues stemming from his time in office still pose some risk for Trump. The FBI raid on his Florida home on Monday has focused attention on his handling of official papers while president. Two criminal investigations are ongoing: one into possible election interference; another into potential financial crimes. A US congressional inquiry may recommend criminal charges over Trump's activities surrounding the riot at the Capitol in Washington last year. As he contemplates a 2024 presidential run, read more about the legal cases that could threaten everything. How big are Donald Trump's legal problems? Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee slammed the FBI on Friday At a news conference in Washington earlier on Friday, Trump's Republican allies slammed the DoJ inquiry and raised concerns about the tactics employed by federal agents. âBecause many other options were available to them, we are very concerned about the method that was used in raiding Mar-a-Lago and the nine hours that transpired while they were in the presidentâs home,"" said ranking House of Representatives Intelligence Committee member Mike Turner of Ohio. New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, said the Republicans plan to investigate the president ""and his administrationâs weaponisation of the Department of Justice and FBI against Joe Bidenâs political opponents"". To launch such a committee-level inquiry, Republicans would need to win control of the House in November's mid-term elections. ""President Trump has been targeted from day one of his presidency by the FBI,"" added congressman Markwayne Mullin, of Oklahoma. There are three levels of classification in the US government. The lowest -""confidential"" - is reserved for information that could damage US national security. This is followed by the ""secret"" classification, which could cause ""serious"" damage if revealed. The third classification level, ""top secret"", is reserved for information that could cause ""exceptionally grave"" damage to US security. Apart from these three classifications,  there are additional control measures for the most highly sensitive documents - Special Access Programmes (SAP) and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). The SCI designation is listed in the warrant inventory, but it's not clear if any files were recovered from Mar-a-Lago under the SAP level of classification. Sources close to the inquiry told the New York Times that investigators had been looking for SAP material, which the newspaper describes as ""a designation that is typically reserved for extremely sensitive operations carried out by the United States abroad or for closely held technologies and capabilities"". On Thursday night, the Washington Post reported that federal agents had been searching for material ""relating to nuclear weapons"", but did not say that such files had been recovered from the Florida estate. Now that the documents have been officially unsealed, we can take a closer look at what they say. Beyond the standard forms, the warrant authorises agents to search Trump's huge Mar-a-Lago estate - but specifically any areas used by FPOTUS (Former President of the United States) and not those of other guests. The next page, however, lists exactly what agents were sent to look for: ""evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed"". It cites three United States laws: Also unsealed was a receipt of what the agents took. Among more than two dozen entries, it lists items including classified and top secret documents, a grant of clemency forTrump's former adviser Roger Stone, and unknown information about the President of France. Trump waves to New Yorkers as he heads to his deposition This wasn't the only legal headache for Trump this week. On Wednesday, he had to answer questions from New York prosecutors investigating whether he illegally inflated the value of his assets in order to get favorable loans and tax breaks. He had unsuccessfully sued to block the interview, which is known in the US as a deposition. The former president refused to answer questions for the entire morning and most of the afternoon, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. In the past, Trump has attacked other public officials who have mishandled government documents, most notably his 2016 presidential opponent Hillary Clinton after it was revealed she kept her government emails on a private server. Trump has also repeatedly criticised any suspect who invokes the Fifth Amendment right, calling it âdisgracefulâ. See this clip:  This video can not be played Donald Trump on people pleading the Fifth Amendment: 'Disgraceful' The court document lays out that Trump is being investigated for violating a federal law known as the Espionage Act. The warrant says agents are authorised to seize evidence that uncovers efforts by Trump to unlawfully retain sensitive information that could aid US adversaries or destroy or conceal US government documents. Hereâs what the warrant says FBI agents were looking for:  A spokesman for Donald Trump has told the BBC's US partner CBS News that ""the Biden administration is in obvious damage control after their botched raid"". ""They seized the Presidentâs picture books, a 'handwritten note,' and declassified documents,"" said Taylor Budowich. ""This raid of President Trumpâs home was not just unprecedented, but unnecessary - and now they are leaking lies and innuendos to try to explain away the weaponization of government against their dominant political opponent. This is outrageous.""  A receipt for the items seized by FBI agents in the warrant is three pages long. The inventory includes the clemency letter granting legal amnesty to Trump ally Roger Stone, a leatherbound box of documents and one document titled ""info re: President of France"". Also listed are documents labeled Top Secret (TP) and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). Some items on the list include ""miscellaneous secret documents"". The warrant is signed at the bottom by Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, who was present at Mar-a-Lago for the raid. A US Secret Service agent outside Mar-a-Lago one day after the raid The warrant says that agents are to search the ""45 Office"" - which refers to Trump being America's 45th president - as well as ""all storage rooms"" and all rooms used by Trump and his staff in which boxes could be stored. The warrant specifically excludes certain areas from being searched, including private guest suites or other facilities being rented or occupied by golf club members or guests.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Amateur detective Becky Harrington says she wants to study criminology and law after the experience A woman who turned detective to find her father's stolen car said she has been inundated with requests to find other missing vehicles. Becky Harrington, from Bournemouth, got frustrated after police failed to make progress finding the Â£12,000 Jaguar which was stolen in July. She managed to find the car four miles away after using social media and scouring CCTV. Dorset Police said inquiries to identify the offenders were continuing. The Jaguar XF was stolen from the Bournemouth home of Ms Harrington's father Ms Harrington, 32, said her father woke to find his car missing on Sunday 24 July and contacted police. ""But I just wasn't happy with how they dealt with it. I'm pretty savvy with social media so I put it in 45 odd groups and before I knew it was being shared all over the place, it just went everywhere,"" she said. ""I thought nobody is gonna walk down the street and not know about this car. If we were still waiting for the police, my dad would have no car."" Ms Harrington eventually found the abandoned 2020 Jaguar after going through CCTV from petrol stations and local shops. The car was found with rubbish in the footwell behind a block of flats about four miles from where it was stolen The experience has inspired the mother-of-two to study criminology and law at Open University. ""I've been approached by somebody asking me to help find their son's stolen BMW and other people have contacted me asking for help,"" she added. But she said she was ""less than impressed"" about how the police had dealt with the investigation and was convinced a gang was responsible for the theft. ""Twenty-four hours after I'd told them it had been found I got a call from the police and the woman said it was still marked as stolen,"" she said. Dorset Police said: ""Local officers made a number of attempts to visit the victim and consequently made contact with the victim's daughter, who then updated the police that the vehicle had been recovered. ""As part of the ongoing investigation, officers carried out house-to-house enquiries in the vicinity of where the vehicle was located and have successfully obtained significant evidence.""

"The UK's Sam Ryder came second in this year's contest behind the Ukrainian winners The shortlist of UK cities that could host next year's Eurovision Song Contest has been revealed, with seven locations in the running. Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield will vie to stage the event in May. Twenty cities expressed an interest, the BBC said, and those not making the shortlist include London and Belfast. The UK was chosen to host the contest after organisers decided it could not be staged by Ukraine, the 2022 winners. UK singer Sam Ryder finished second at this year's contest in Turin, Italy. Turin's advice to UK 2023 Eurovision host city Eurovision 2023 will force other shows to make way The decision to relocate it from Ukraine because of the ongoing war has led to a hotly-contested selection process between UK cities that want to attract thousands of visitors and the attention of around 160 million TV viewers around the world. The BBC said the seven-strong shortlist was based on the cities' ability to show they have ""the capacity, capability and experience to host an event of this scale and complexity"". Cap: Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra won this year's contest with overwhelming support from the public vote A statement added that the process was ""heavily weighted towards demonstrating past experience in hosting major international events, as well as being able to demonstrate their credentials in hosting a celebration of contemporary music"". London would have met those criteria but didn't make the cut, at a time when both the BBC and government are seeking to move events and opportunities outside the capital. Others to miss out include Aberdeen, Brighton, Bristol and Darlington. As it is, five of the shortlisted cities are in the north of England, with Glasgow representing Scotland and none further south than Birmingham. No Welsh cities bid, and Belfast was the only potential contender from Northern Ireland. The seven remaining cities will be scored on a set of criteria, the BBC said, including: ""Having a suitable venue and sufficient space to deliver the requirements of the Song Contest ""The commitment that can be made by a city or region to hosting the event, including the financial contribution ""The strength of the cultural offer which includes off screen local and regional activity as well as showcasing Ukrainian culture and music ""And alignment with the BBC's strategic priorities as a public service broadcaster, such as providing value to all audiences and supporting the creative economy in the UK"" The successful city will be chosen by the BBC and Eurovision organisers, and will be announced in the autumn. Glasgow and Birmingham have been named as the bookmakers' favourites, while Glasgow and Manchester have proved the most popular in polls on Eurovision fan sites. Eurovision organisers say the host venue should accommodate about 10,000 spectators, be within easy reach of an international airport and have enough hotel accommodation for at least 2,000 delegates, journalists and spectators. A venue would be needed for preparations for six to eight weeks ahead of the song contest, meaning all potential locations would need to move concerts and events that are already in their schedules. Former Ukrainian Eurovision winner Jamala said next year's contest would be the ""greatest Eurovision"" yet. Jamala won Eurovision in 2016 with her song 1944 and said the UK is the ""best place in the world"" to host the competition, despite initially hoping Ukraine would be able to host. ""For me, [the UK] is the best place in the world in music,"" she told the PA news agency. ""That's why Eurovision in your country is the best place for me - you are about music, you are full of different kinds of styles and genres."" Ozzy Osbourne performed at last week's Commonwealth Games closing ceremony, declaring: ""Birmingham forever!"" This was the last place to host Eurovision in the UK, in 1998, and has just successfully hosted a major international event in the form of the Commonwealth Games. Its venue would be the Resorts World Arena, which has a capacity of 15,685, is next to Birmingham airport, a train station and motorways, and is part of a complex including an exhibition centre and hotels.

The seven remaining cities will be scored on a set of criteria, the BBC said, including: ""Having a suitable venue and sufficient space to deliver the requirements of the Song Contest ""The commitment that can be made by a city or region to hosting the event, including the financial contribution ""The strength of the cultural offer which includes off screen local and regional activity as well as showcasing Ukrainian culture and music ""And alignment with the BBC's strategic priorities as a public service broadcaster, such as providing value to all audiences and supporting the creative economy in the UK"" The successful city will be chosen by the BBC and Eurovision organisers, and will be announced in the autumn. Glasgow and Birmingham have been named as the bookmakers' favourites, while Glasgow and Manchester have proved the most popular in polls on Eurovision fan sites. Eurovision organisers say the host venue should accommodate about 10,000 spectators, be within easy reach of an international airport and have enough hotel accommodation for at least 2,000 delegates, journalists and spectators. A venue would be needed for preparations for six to eight weeks ahead of the song contest, meaning all potential locations would need to move concerts and events that are already in their schedules. Former Ukrainian Eurovision winner Jamala said next year's contest would be the ""greatest Eurovision"" yet. Jamala won Eurovision in 2016 with her song 1944 and said the UK is the ""best place in the world"" to host the competition, despite initially hoping Ukraine would be able to host. ""For me, [the UK] is the best place in the world in music,"" she told the PA news agency. ""That's why Eurovision in your country is the best place for me - you are about music, you are full of different kinds of styles and genres."" Ozzy Osbourne performed at last week's Commonwealth Games closing ceremony, declaring: ""Birmingham forever!"" This was the last place to host Eurovision in the UK, in 1998, and has just successfully hosted a major international event in the form of the Commonwealth Games. Its venue would be the Resorts World Arena, which has a capacity of 15,685, is next to Birmingham airport, a train station and motorways, and is part of a complex including an exhibition centre and hotels. It hosted the star-studdedConcert For Ukrainein March. Ukrainian band back Birmingham for Eurovision Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Louis Thorold pictured with his mother Rachael just hours before the crash in January 2021 A driver has been found not guilty by reason of insanity of causing the death by careless driving of a baby boy in a pram. Five-month-old Louis Thorold was hit on the pavement of the A10 near Cambridge, on 22 January 2021. His mother Rachael was seriously injured. Lawyers for Shelagh Robertson, 75, said she had undiagnosed dementia at the time of the crash in Waterbeach. Jurors at Cambridge Crown Court found her condition had affected her driving. Mrs Robertson, of Stables Yard in Waterbeach, was driving home from the supermarket when she turned into the path of an oncoming van, forcing it on to the pavement where it hit the mum and baby, the trial heard. Shelagh Robertson's defence team said she had undiagnosed Alzheimer's disease at the time of the crash Louis was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. Mrs Thorold spent 10 days in a coma and 118 days in hospital, with her husband Chris describing her survival as""miraculous"". Mrs Robertson denied causing the infant's death by careless driving. Louis Thorold was born at the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge in August 2020 During the trial, James Leonard, defending, said Mrs Robertson was ""ill-equipped to negotiate"" the junction due to her dementia, while prosecutor David Matthew said that while there was ""strong evidence"" she had dementia, there was the question of ""where on the slope of dementia Shelagh Robertson was in January 2021"". Adam Zeman, professor of cognitive behavioural neurology at the University of Exeter, compiled a report on Mrs Robertson for the defence. He told the court she had ""dementia caused most probably by Alzheimer's disease in a slightly atypical presentation"". He said this would have put Mrs Robertson at ""high risk of becoming confused at that junction and one possible outcome of the confusion would be to look the wrong way"". The judge, Mark Bishop, told jurors that if they were satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defendant had dementia at the time, and either did not know what she was doing or did not know that what she was doing was wrong, they could return a special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. The boy's parents Rachael and Chris Thorold were in court to hear the verdict As jurors returned their majority verdict, the boy's parents, Chris and Rachael Thorold, who sat in the public gallery, looked down at the floor, with Mr Thorold shaking his head. In a statement released after the verdict, Mr Thorold said: ""Louis Steven James Thorold was the sweetest happiest, joyful and most beautiful baby. He was perfectly ours. He was our lives. He still is. ""Louis knew only love and cuddles before he was killed. A life sentence for us, his family, our community and everyone who hears this story."" The judge adjourned the case for a further hearing on 19 August. Speaking after the trial, Det Sgt Mark Dollard, from the road policing unit for Cambridgeshire, said: ""Regardless of the verdict nothing will ever bring Louis back and his family will have to live with that for the rest of their lives. ""It is however, a stark reminder of how important it is for anyone who gets behind the wheel of a vehicle to be competent and capable of driving safely. ""I would urge anyone who is concerned about a family member or friend and their ability to drive to speak up, discuss your concerns with your loved one or alternatively speak to your GP who can submit their concerns to the DVLA."" Following the crash, Louis' family had set up theLouis Thorold Foundation,externalin their son's memory, with the aim of preventing infant pedestrian deaths. Mr Thorold said: ""We must now look forward. Louis wouldn't want us to be sad or give up. Louis will live on. His legacy - that one day no-one will have to deal with a death of a child on Britain's roads."" Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

"Farmers have been banned from taking water from the River Eden in Fife after it fell to a ""critical"" level, the second-lowest ever recorded. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said the majority of water abstraction licences would be suspended from midnight on Saturday. A significant scarcity warning was also issued for the River Tweed in the Borders - where a ban could follow. The National Farmers Union said it was ""devastating"" for vegetable growers. Sepa said the suspensions would be lifted as soon as possible. Significant water scarcity warning issued for Fife Water shortages to become more frequent, says Sepa David Harley, Sepa's chief officer circular economy, said: ""Having to impose suspensions on water abstractions underlines the severity of the conditions being experienced in the east of Scotland this summer. ""It is not a step we take lightly, but the evidence is clear, and it is one we can no longer avoid."" Abstraction is the process of taking water from a river, loch or other natural source. Sepa said the main stem of the River Eden had only been lower in 1989. Flows in Kemback in Fife have not been as low for this long since 2003 and Strathmiglo is also experiencing its most prolonged low flow period on record. The River Tweed Commission fears current water scarcity plans are not adequate to protect stocks The environment agency said the combination of low flows and high temperatures endangers fish, plants and other life. Sepa said it would issue water abstraction suspension notices to farmers and officers would visit premises to ensure compliance. Why is a wet country like Scotland facing water scarcity? Extreme weather: What is it and how is it connected to climate change? The move is part of Scotland's national water scarcity plan - designed to protect the environment while allowing human and economic activity to continue during prolonged dry periods. Last month Sepa warned that water shortages could become more serious and frequent due to climate change. It said above average rainfall had only been recorded in four of the last 12 months. The east of Scotland also experienced the driest January in more than 80 years. The River Ythan in Aberdeenshire has been affected by water scarcity this year Scotland's natural water levels are categorised by Sepa into five grades - with necessary advice for businesses at each alert level. Normal- Water can be taken from sources as usual. Early warning- Industries should consider how they can use water more efficiently. Alert- Industries irrigating land should check equipment, not overspray and irrigate at night to avoid evaporation. Moderate scarcity- Industries should reduce the amount of water they take, stagger use with others nearby or switch to other supplies. Significant scarcity- Water resources are becoming scarce. Industries should switch supplies or stop taking water altogether. A Significant Scarcity warning has also been issued in the Borders. Mouthbridge at Blackadder Water dropped to its lowest flow since records began in 1974. Sepa said farmers were being contacted and any licence suspensions in this area would take effect early next week. Earlier this week theRiver Tweed Commission (RTC) warnedcurrent water scarcity plans were inadequate to protect its fish stocks. The National Farmers Union (NFU) Scotland said the decision to suspend licences could lead crop failures, job losses and even put the viability of some farms at risk. Horticulture committee chair Iain Brown said: ""The suspension of licences in North Fife will be a devastating blow for vegetable growers. Without water crops will fail."" Mr Brown asked for irrigation to be permitted for high risk crops such as broccoli, cauliflower and lettuce He added: ""Without water these crops growers will now have complete crop failure, which will cost our members millions of pounds of lost revenue and threaten the viability of their businesses.""

"This video can not be played ""I'm sticking it out"" - last resident of housing estate earmarked for demolition The last resident of a housing estate due to be demolished has said the council will need to double its offer to get him to leave. Nick Wisniewski has had no neighbours in his block on the Gowkthrapple housing estate in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, since December. The 66-year-old wants at least Â£80,000 so he can afford to buy a new flat. But North Lanarkshire Council said they could not pay Mr Wisniewski more than the property was worth. The retired bank worker bought the flat in Stanhope Place several years ago under the Right to Buy scheme, which helped council tenants buy their homes at discounted rates. The schemehas since been closed in Scotland. The block on the Gowkthrapple estate in Wishaw is due to be demolished as part of a redevelopment ""I've been here for 21 years and I'm settled,"" Mr Wisniewski told BBC Scotland. ""I've looked at prices of houses round about. For a two-bedroom flat you're talking anything between Â£80,000 to Â£100,000. ""I finished up with the bank, I took my redundancy. But I'm not prepared to make myself skint because of North Lanarkshire Council."" Mr Wisniewski said the council had offered him Â£35,000 for his flat, along with two years' of free rent at a new council property. The authority isplanning to redevelop the whole Gowkthrapple estate,external, replacing ""ageing"" housing and creating an ""attractive and well-connected new neighbourhood"". Work on other parts of the estate has already begun. Mr Wisniewski told BBC Scotland he was not willing to move into a new rented council property, but wanted to buy a new place. Mr Wisniewski told the BBC he was prepared to stick it out ""as long as it takes"" ""I'm too old for this,"" he said. ""I don't want a lot of hassle in my life, I just want to take it easy."" ""That's why I would prefer to just move out and into somewhere I could buy."" He said he had not heard from North Lanarkshire Council since last November and had been waiting to hear from the authority with an improved offer. ""If they gave me Â£35,000, I could easily put Â£20,000 to it which is not nearly enough. So really they need to double their offer for me to get something decent,"" he said. ""A lot of people would say I'd be better to go - but I'm sticking it out because I have in my mind what I'm looking for. I'm looking for something better and I'm not going to get that only having Â£35,000 from the council."" North Lanarkshire Council is planning to pursue a compulsory purchase order on the property but said its door ""remains open"" to Mr Wisniewski for further talks. A council spokesperson said: ""We have been in dialogue with the owner for several years about this issue and although we understand that there is a personal connection to the property, we simply cannot pay more for the property than it is worth. ""If the owner feels that the value he has been offered doesn't reflect the market value then there are ways for a valuation to be negotiated on his behalf. ""We are keen to resolve this matter to ensure that he receives a fair deal and to support him to find alternative accommodation. We have discussed the option of other suitable places for him to stay, but he has refused each of them."" Mr Wisniewski said he was open to further discussions, but planned to stick it out in his flat ""as long as it takes"". ""I reckon the council is going to make a lot of money out of it [the development] at the end of the day, so why not give me more?"" he added.

"Refuse workers are due to strike with dates due to be announced for school staff action Scottish council leaders have made a new pay offer to staff in a bid to avoid planned strikes. Cosla has put a 3.5% deal on the table aftera 2% increase was rejected, and will raise the Scottish local government living wage to Â£10.50 an hour. Unions said the offer was not enough. Local government minister Shona Robison said it was ""extremely disappointing"" that Cosla had not come up with 5%. The Scottish government has said it expected local authorities to matchthe Â£140m extra pledged by the Scottish governmentfor pay rises. Councils to get extra Â£140m towards workers' pay Bin collectors to strike during Edinburgh festival Ms Robison said: ""Cosla recognised this was not an issue for the Scottish government to solve in its entirety - it has got to be a partnership. ""Which means local authorities must look at every possible area of finance to come to a fair and affordable pay offer for staff which avoids damaging industrial action."" Earlier, GMB Scotland and Unison announced that local authority employees across the country would strike in two four-day stoppages over the next month in the ongoing pay dispute. Waste and recycling workers will walk out between August 26 and 29 as well as between September 7 and 10. Refuse workers in Glasgow last took strike action in November 2021 GMB members will strike in Aberdeen, Angus, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Lothian, Falkirk, Glasgow, Inverclyde, Highland, Midlothian, Orkney, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, West Lothian, Perth and Kinross, and North Lanarkshire. Unison members in Aberdeenshire, Clackmannanshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Inverclyde, North Lanarkshire, Stirling and South Lanarkshire have also said they will walk out. Following a special meeting of council leaders on Friday, Cosla spokeswoman Katie Hagmann said she had been mandated to make a fresh offer. She said council leaders had reaffirmed their desire to make an offer of more than 2% but that fears had been expressed that public services and jobs would be affected as a result. Significantly improved pay offer needed, says union No alternative to ""all-out"" council strike - Unite Ms Hagmann said: ""Following the confirmation that the additional monies provided by the Scottish government will be recurring, leaders have now mandated me today to move forward with our trade union partners on the basis of an offer that raises the Scottish local government living wage to Â£10.50. ""Leaders note the risk that public services will not recover, jobs will be affected and communities will see services reduced as local government budgets are unable to sustain the long-term pressures they have been under. ""Leaders continue to call on Scottish government to provide funding and flexibilities to enable an offer beyond the monies provided to date. ""As such, we will be seeking to make an improved offer via the appropriate negotiating mechanisms as soon as possible."" The Scottish government's finance secretary John Swinney had earlier urged councils to improve their offer to staff and unions. Mr Swinney told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programmehe wanted to avoid industrial action. He said some councils had already budgeted on a higher pay offer than the one on the table. ""Some have budgeted on 3% and have offered 2%. I have put Â£140m on table which puts the offer even higher,"" he said. No council leader believes staff only deserve a 3.5% pay rise. The problem is what they can each afford. Council pay is consistent across all 32 of Scotland's local authorities. The rise has to be affordable to all of them. The Scottish government is giving councils an extra Â£140m To help with pay. This was enough to raise the pay offer from 2% to 3.5% but the Scottish government was clear that councils had to use more of their own money too. Some councils, including Glasgow, were prepared to do this. Glasgow had argued for a 5% pay rise. Some others argued they could not afford any more so would need even more cash from the Scottish government. Mr Swinney said that according to the Scottish Fiscal Commission, theScottish government's overall budget was cut in real termsby the UK government and that within that budget, councils were given a ""strong financial settlement"". The UK government says Scotland has been granted record funding levels. Leader of East Renfrewshire Council, Owen O'Donnell, told BBC Scotland it would be difficult to avert strikes unless Mr Swinney offered more cash to councils to pay for salary rises. He said: ""He needs to double the amount he previously offered at least. ""Councils are under a huge amount of pressure. We have been squeezed for the past 15 years and we have got nothing else to give."" It comes a day after the Scottish government announced an emergency budget review for Scotland in response to the growing cost of living crisis. Johanna Baxter, Unison Scotland's head of local government said: ""Unison are shocked and disappointed that Cosla leaders have yet again failed to come up with a decent pay offer for these vital workers. ""An offer of 3.5% is likely to be totally unacceptable to our reps and is some way off matching the offer made to council workers south of the border. ""Whilst our local government committee will meet next week to take a view on this there will be no suspension to our strike action at this stage."" GMB Scotland senior organiser Keir Greenaway said: ""This is a dire response to the cost of living crisis facing our members. ""The blame game between Cosla and the government will no doubt continue, but six months on from the overwhelming rejection of the initial pay offer, this is a damning indictment of how our council workers are valued by Scotland's political leaders.""

"Amateur detective Becky Harrington says she wants to study criminology and law after the experience A woman who turned detective to find her father's stolen car said she has been inundated with requests to find other missing vehicles. Becky Harrington, from Bournemouth, got frustrated after police failed to make progress finding the Â£12,000 Jaguar which was stolen in July.

""I thought nobody is gonna walk down the street and not know about this car. If we were still waiting for the police, my dad would have no car."" Ms Harrington eventually found the abandoned 2020 Jaguar after going through CCTV from petrol stations and local shops. The car was found with rubbish in the footwell behind a block of flats about four miles from where it was stolen The experience has inspired the mother-of-two to study criminology and law at Open University. ""I've been approached by somebody asking me to help find their son's stolen BMW and other people have contacted me asking for help,"" she added. But she said she was ""less than impressed"" about how the police had dealt with the investigation and was convinced a gang was responsible for the theft. ""Twenty-four hours after I'd told them it had been found I got a call from the police and the woman said it was still marked as stolen,"" she said. Dorset Police said: ""Local officers made a number of attempts to visit the victim and consequently made contact with the victim's daughter, who then updated the police that the vehicle had been recovered. ""As part of the ongoing investigation, officers carried out house-to-house enquiries in the vicinity of where the vehicle was located and have successfully obtained significant evidence.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Energy bill support is not enough Boris Johnson has admitted the current help for people struggling with energy bills is not enough, and said he expects more money to follow. Mr Johnson will step down as PM in September, but said he was ""making sure there is extra cash"" for his successor to provide additional support. He also said people were starting to receive the money which the government announced earlier in the year. The topic of rising bills has come to dominate the Tory leadership contest. The two candidates to replace Mr Johnson have set out differing strategies on how they would respond to the cost of living crisis. Liz Truss has argued that cutting taxes is the best way to help struggling households. Rishi Sunak has proposed spending billions of pounds on further payments to pensioners and people on low incomes, contending tax cuts will not help them enough. Energy profits are not evil, says Liz Truss How high will my energy bill go? How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? Elsewhere Labourhas set out its own proposalsincluding a plan to ensure pre-pay energy customers are charged the same as those paying by direct debit - a move they say would benefit four million people. Speaking in Edinburgh, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""outrageous and immoral"" that the poorest people on pre-payment meters paid more for their energy bills. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also called for the government to raise money by backdating the windfall tax on energy companies. Speaking at a hustings in Cheltenham, Ms Truss said she ""absolutely"" did not support windfall taxes, arguing it was ""all about bashing business"". Mr Johnson has made it clear that he thinks further support will be needed from whoever succeeds him at the start of September. But he isn't going to make that decision himself and several government figures have made it clear the big decisions can not be taken by the outgoing regime. The lack of immediate action infuriates people like Martin Lewis, the money saving expert, and angers some opposition politicians too, who say the scale of the energy crisis is such that the government can't wait a month to decide what it's going to do. But whatever options are suggested by the opposition or left on the table by the current government, it looks increasingly clear that concrete decisions are going to have to wait. Not least because the two people who could be making them - Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss - sharply disagree. Conservative members are weighing up which they prefer. But while they decide, decisions over help with the cost of living look like they are going to have to wait. Read more from Nick here. Last weekforecasts suggestedthat energy bills could rise to more than Â£4,000 per year next year for typical households. Earlier this year the government announced a Â£15bn package including a Â£400 energy bill discount for every household. Asked by reporters if this was enough, Mr Johnson said: ""No"", adding: ""What we're doing... is trying to make sure that by October, by January, there is further support"". ""I'm not going to pretend that things are easy for people right now, but there's more money coming anyway as a result of the decisions we've taken. ""I think over the medium term, the future's very bright."" He also argued that the price of energy would be brought down in the longer term by the government's investment in nuclear power and renewables. Earlier Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said new cost of living policies would be ""ready to go"" when either Mr Sunak or Ms Truss took office on 6 September. Speaking on a visit to the Airbus factory in Broughton in north Wales, Mr Zahawi told broadcasters: ""We're looking at all the options of what additional help we need to bring in later on in the winter months."" The BBC has been told one option could include expanding the windfall tax on energy companies. The current windfall tax - also called the energy profits levy - applies only to oil and gas firms, but there has been speculation that it could be extended to electricity generators. Energy profits are not evil, says Liz Truss How much are energy bills going up? What is the windfall tax on oil and gas firms?

Earlier, the government declared that large parts of England were in drought, including Devon and Cornwall, Kent, London and the East Midlands. An extreme heat amber warning is in place for parts of England and Wales, with temperatures forecast to hit 37C (99F) in the next couple of days. There is also a warning of an ""exceptional"" risk of fires. Today's writers were Malu Cursino, Laura Gozzi, James FitzGerald and Emily McGarvey. The page was edited by Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ©.  If news of drought, scorched earth and soaring temperatures has given you climate anxiety, rest assured - you are not alone. But there are some things you can do to alleviate the sense of doom. Scientists who have been working on climate change for years recommend being proactive and channelling your fears into something useful, as well as finding a community of like-minded worriers. Read more advicehere. This video shows a wildfire near Crawley, Sussex, that destroyed 40 acres of grassland on Thursday. This video can not be played Grassland destroyed as fires rage through Sussex fields (Credit: Lisa Roberts) Rising summer temperatures are causing longer and more frequent heatwaves across the United Kingdom. BBC analysis estimates thatsix million people live in places at risk of higher heatduring the summer months. Using satellite data from 4 Earth Intelligence, the BBC mapped how vulnerable postcode areas were to extreme heat in England, Wales and Scotland during periods of hot weather over the past three summers - shown with a heat hazard score. Check here to see if your postcode is vulnerable to extreme heat. The price of potatoes, carrots and other vegetables could increase in the winter as a result of poor growing conditions in the dry weather, according to a Conservative former government minister. ""The situation is very difficult,"" explains Robert Goodwill, who chairs the Commons environment, food and rural affairs select committee. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, he calls on the government to ""concentrate more on food production"" and offer more help to farmers. Goodwill, who himself runs an arable farm in North Yorkshire, says 2022 has probably been the driest year in his agricultural career. Following July's record-breaking heatwave, Londonâs fire commissioner called for a total national ban on disposable barbecues after they were blamed for starting wildfires in England. This was not imposed, but local authorities and event organisers are taking steps to limit the use of disposable barbecues. Boardmasters Festival, which takes place in Cornwall this weekend, has banned them, as have city councils like Nottingham and Birmingham. In Guernsey, where no official ban is in place, the chief fire officer has urged people to take part in a ""voluntary BBQ and bonfire ban"" in the outdoors to cut the number of wildfires. On Thursday, Sainsbury's and Tesco announced they were joining other supermarket chains in removing disposable barbecues from their shop shelves during the current heatwave. Coop followed suit today. Marks and Spencer's, Aldi and Waitrose have already halted sales.  You might be relishing the prospect of showers, which are forecast in some parts of the UK at the start of next week, and it's likely they will be accompanied by a certain scent you might be familiar with. Rain can actually smell appealing after a long period of dry weather - and there's some chemistry involved in the phenomenon. Surprisingly, a fragrance released by bacteria in wet soil can play a significant role. As can the scent of plants and the freshening of air that happens with lightning strikes. Known aspetrichor, the scent has long been chased by scientists and even perfumers for its enduring appeal. Read more about petrichor here. Simon KingBBC weather presenter and meteorologist Rain is in the forecast next week, but it'll be the ""wrong"" kind and could lead to some localised flash flooding and not really alleviate
drought conditions. With low pressure moving in, we'll get showers and
thunderstorms scattered across the UK. The ground however is parched, and
this makes a difference to what happens when the rain hits it. In a
normal summer when the ground is green and moist, water can easily soak into
it. When it is parched and hard, rainfall - especially heavy rain with
thunderstorms - tends to hit the ground and run off. With rainfall running off the surface - in the same way it
does with concrete - it is more likely to produce a flash flood. It also
means that the rainfall is transported quickly into streams and rivers rather
than filtering into the ground where it landed. So rather than scattered heavy showers, the ""right"" kind of
rain we need is from the more persistent and steady type. This gives the
parched ground more time to soak up the rainfall before it disappears into the
nearest drain or river. To go further and alleviate drought conditions we'll need
weeks of rainfall to bring the reservoirs and river levels back up to
normal. This is not in the forecast, however - so there are concerns that
drought issues may persist well into the autumn in some locations. Farmers in Wales say the summer's dry weather has affected crop yields - and even the size of potatoes. This video can not be played Worried farmers say their crop yields are down massively Labour leader Keir Starmer has accused the government of failing to fully prepare the UK for drought, and hit out at the response of water companies. ""Thereâs a familiar pattern here, which is weâve got a government with no strategy,"" Starmer says, in response to the Environment Agency movingeight of its 14 areas in England into drought status. ""This drought, this hot period, was predictable. But, as usual, we had no plan from the government and this is the pattern, this is the character of this government."" He said water companies aren't doing enough to deal with leakages and other water supply issues. ""We saw the sewage going into rivers and I think that some of the regulations should have been better used,"" Starmer told reporters during a visit to Edinburgh. ""I would have liked to have seen much greater fines against those companies that arenât doing what is necessary."" You've been sending us pictures of the drought where you are. Here is a small selection. Parched, dry grass in Swanley Park, Kent Low water levels at Grafham Water in Cambridgeshire - Britainâs third largest reservoir and a site of special scientific interest The pond at Rosebery Park in Epsom, Surrey: ""I have lived in this area all my life, and I've never seen it this dried up,â says photographer Anthony Etches Dried pond at Godstone Green, Surrey John Curtin, executive director for local operations at the Environment Agency, has told the BBC that this has been the South East's driest July since records began in 1891. There was also a drought after the hot summer of 1976, although we are better placed to deal with it today thanks to a modern water infrastructure and a slightly-wetter-than-average winter, he says. Curtin also said the drought announcement showed that ""this is not a normal summer"" and that everyone should be thinking about using water wisely as it ""will probably be an issue for months ahead depending how the winter goes"". ""It will take weeks of rain to stop the drought which is currently affecting parts of England,"" he adds. But how long will the drought last? Curtin said: ""It all depends on the weather, I'm afraid. There will be heavy showers probably Monday, Tuesday next week. But, please, don't think that will stop the drought because... we've lost a week's worth of rain and it'll take weeks of rain. ""We'll need probably average or slightly above average rainfall this autumn into this winter for us to not be a drought next year.""  A comparison of satellite images taken last August and three days ago clearly shows how the area surrounding Cambridge is significantly parched this year: Malu CursinoBBC News Live Reporter As the heatwave continues to sweep England and Wales, we asked dermatologist Dr Adeline Kikam about how extreme heat can impact our skin. She says several skin conditions can develop, or worsen, during persistently high temperatures. Some of those conditions are:  Why? Heat rashes, tiny bumps or blisters in the skin, happen when there is an obstruction in the sweat ducts and inflammation. It's more common during the summer because it's triggered by heat and humidity. Dr Kikam says high temperatures can worsen or aggravateeczema. High temperatures lead to increased sweating, which in turn can make the skin even drier and the salt residue from the sweat can cause inflammation in the skin. This combination leads to redness, and general discomfort. Increased spots and breakoutsare common during high temperatures because there's an excess secretion of oil from our sebaceous glands. This combined with sweating and products like make-up can clog your pores and trap dirt in the skin. Sunburnsare the result of long exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. If you have darker skin, and therefore more melanin, your body has a base protective layer to UV radiation and it might take longer to notice the symptoms of sunburn (redness and blisters). ""Damage to the skin is just not as visible, but you're still getting the damage,"" Dr Kikam says. What should you do? For those suffering fromheat rashes, Dr Kikam says patients should remove themselves from hot and humid environments when possible and ensure they have access to good ventilation, by using fans and air conditioner - and keep the affected area of the skin dry. The same goes forchafing:wearing loose clothing, ensuring your skin is dry and avoiding friction are the best ways to avoid it. However, for those suffering from aggravatedeczema, it is important to keep your skin moisturised with neutral lotions. Forsunburns, Dr Kikam says everyone should ensure they're wearing sunscreen to protect themselves from exposure to UV radiation and protecting themselves from direct sun exposure for long periods of time. Regularly cleansing your skin ensures you can minimise your risk of havingbreakouts, as you are avoiding product build up and keeping your pores unclogged. Listen tothe latest episode of Newscast, which features an interview with the head of Environment Agency, Sir James Bevan, about the impact of the recent dry
weather and soaring temperatures - plus BBC experts discuss how the
hot conditions will affect crops and agriculture, and when we can expect some
rain. Justin RowlattBBC Climate editor Farmers are demanding ministers ensure water supplies for
farmers are given the same priority as those for the environment. Supporting food production is not part of the remit of the
Environment Agency, which determines where much of the countryâs water supplies
go, warns Tom Bradshaw, the deputy president of the National Farmers Union
(NFU). ""That has to change to protect food supplies,"" he says
and suggests government ministers may need to bring in new rules. ""Farmers recognise the importance of protecting the
environment but food production needs to be given equal status,"" he told
the BBC. The demand comes as farms in England and parts of Wales face
serious water shortages. Testimony from the NFU formed a key part of the
evidence which persuaded the government to put much of England in drought. Half the countryâs potato crop cannot be irrigated so is very vulnerable
to drought, the meeting of the National Drought Group, which met this morning,
was told. The NFU warned ""irrigation options are diminishing with
reservoirs being emptied fast"". It said farmers are expecting losses of
between 10% and 50% for crops including carrots, onions, sugar beet, apples and
hops. Farmers would normally be planting their rapeseed crop at this
time of year. But, says Bradshaw, conditions are so bad at the moment very few
farmers are likely to plant the crop. If you're at a Coldplay gig during the heatwave, you'll want to avoid getting a Rush of Blood to the Head.

In response to much of Britain being declared under drought conditions, Ami
McCarthy, climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, says the drought across Europe, the extreme heatwaves and the cost of living crisis ""are all the result of our climate-destroying reliance on fossil fuels"". She also accuses governments across the world of ""handing out billions to fossil fuel giants, subsidising their reckless profiteering, including in the UK where our government continues to offer lucrative 'investment incentives'"": We urgently need to turn away from fossil fuels and towards the clean, green energy of the future, which is the only way to bring down global temperatures and tackle the cost of living crisis.  Renewables are now at least four times cheaper than fossil fuels so a shift toward green energy is not only good for the climate but an economic necessity. Governments need to decide whose side they're on."" Ami McCarthy Researchers at the University of Reading have been investigating how long it will take water to get through parched soil - which has baked dry due to the high temperatures and low rainfall. Although we are currently in the middle of a four-day heatwave, theMet Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms,externalfor much of the UK, beginning in Scotland and Northern Ireland from Sunday afternoon. As the hot weather subsides in the north, the change brings with it the risk of some intense thundery downpours and the chance of some surface water flooding. Allow Twitter content?

rain. Justin RowlattBBC Climate editor Farmers are demanding ministers ensure water supplies for
farmers are given the same priority as those for the environment. Supporting food production is not part of the remit of the
Environment Agency, which determines where much of the countryâs water supplies
go, warns Tom Bradshaw, the deputy president of the National Farmers Union
(NFU). ""That has to change to protect food supplies,"" he says
and suggests government ministers may need to bring in new rules. ""Farmers recognise the importance of protecting the
environment but food production needs to be given equal status,"" he told
the BBC. The demand comes as farms in England and parts of Wales face
serious water shortages. Testimony from the NFU formed a key part of the
evidence which persuaded the government to put much of England in drought. Half the countryâs potato crop cannot be irrigated so is very vulnerable
to drought, the meeting of the National Drought Group, which met this morning,
was told. The NFU warned ""irrigation options are diminishing with
reservoirs being emptied fast"". It said farmers are expecting losses of
between 10% and 50% for crops including carrots, onions, sugar beet, apples and
hops. Farmers would normally be planting their rapeseed crop at this
time of year. But, says Bradshaw, conditions are so bad at the moment very few
farmers are likely to plant the crop. If you're at a Coldplay gig during the heatwave, you'll want to avoid getting a Rush of Blood to the Head.

In response to much of Britain being declared under drought conditions, Ami
McCarthy, climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, says the drought across Europe, the extreme heatwaves and the cost of living crisis ""are all the result of our climate-destroying reliance on fossil fuels"". She also accuses governments across the world of ""handing out billions to fossil fuel giants, subsidising their reckless profiteering, including in the UK where our government continues to offer lucrative 'investment incentives'"": We urgently need to turn away from fossil fuels and towards the clean, green energy of the future, which is the only way to bring down global temperatures and tackle the cost of living crisis.  Renewables are now at least four times cheaper than fossil fuels so a shift toward green energy is not only good for the climate but an economic necessity. Governments need to decide whose side they're on."" Ami McCarthy Researchers at the University of Reading have been investigating how long it will take water to get through parched soil - which has baked dry due to the high temperatures and low rainfall. Although we are currently in the middle of a four-day heatwave, theMet Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms,externalfor much of the UK, beginning in Scotland and Northern Ireland from Sunday afternoon. As the hot weather subsides in the north, the change brings with it the risk of some intense thundery downpours and the chance of some surface water flooding. Allow Twitter content?

The World Meteorological Organization called the experimentâclear and compellingâ.,external Buses and cars were left stranded when roads across London flooded in July 2021 The mayor of London Sadiq Khan has said he is âseriously concernedâ that London may experience severe flash flooding following the extended period of dry weather, with the capital âunpreparedâ for the heavy rain that may yet come. All of London has been officially declared in drought by the National Drought Group, after almost a month without rain in some areas. While rain is forecast in London next week, dry ground absorbs water more slowly leading to fears that the capital may face flash floods. Khan said he was worried that London could see a repeat of the flash flooding that damaged thousand of homes and the city's transport network in July 2021. âWe are coordinating with councils what weâd do if that [flooding] was to happen, but letâs be frank, a city like London is not ready for the consequences of climate change and weâve got to get ready,"" he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.

"Louis Thorold pictured with his mother Rachael just hours before the crash in January 2021 A driver has been found not guilty by reason of insanity of causing the death by careless driving of a baby boy in a pram. Five-month-old Louis Thorold was hit on the pavement of the A10 near Cambridge, on 22 January 2021. His mother Rachael was seriously injured. Lawyers for Shelagh Robertson, 75, said she had undiagnosed dementia at the time of the crash in Waterbeach. Jurors at Cambridge Crown Court found her condition had affected her driving. Mrs Robertson, of Stables Yard in Waterbeach, was driving home from the supermarket when she turned into the path of an oncoming van, forcing it on to the pavement where it hit the mum and baby, the trial heard. Shelagh Robertson's defence team said she had undiagnosed Alzheimer's disease at the time of the crash Louis was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. Mrs Thorold spent 10 days in a coma and 118 days in hospital, with her husband Chris describing her survival as""miraculous"". Mrs Robertson denied causing the infant's death by careless driving. Louis Thorold was born at the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge in August 2020 During the trial, James Leonard, defending, said Mrs Robertson was ""ill-equipped to negotiate"" the junction due to her dementia, while prosecutor David Matthew said that while there was ""strong evidence"" she had dementia, there was the question of ""where on the slope of dementia Shelagh Robertson was in January 2021"". Adam Zeman, professor of cognitive behavioural neurology at the University of Exeter, compiled a report on Mrs Robertson for the defence. He told the court she had ""dementia caused most probably by Alzheimer's disease in a slightly atypical presentation"". He said this would have put Mrs Robertson at ""high risk of becoming confused at that junction and one possible outcome of the confusion would be to look the wrong way"". The judge, Mark Bishop, told jurors that if they were satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defendant had dementia at the time, and either did not know what she was doing or did not know that what she was doing was wrong, they could return a special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. The boy's parents Rachael and Chris Thorold were in court to hear the verdict As jurors returned their majority verdict, the boy's parents, Chris and Rachael Thorold, who sat in the public gallery, looked down at the floor, with Mr Thorold shaking his head. In a statement released after the verdict, Mr Thorold said: ""Louis Steven James Thorold was the sweetest happiest, joyful and most beautiful baby. He was perfectly ours. He was our lives. He still is. ""Louis knew only love and cuddles before he was killed. A life sentence for us, his family, our community and everyone who hears this story."" The judge adjourned the case for a further hearing on 19 August. Speaking after the trial, Det Sgt Mark Dollard, from the road policing unit for Cambridgeshire, said: ""Regardless of the verdict nothing will ever bring Louis back and his family will have to live with that for the rest of their lives. ""It is however, a stark reminder of how important it is for anyone who gets behind the wheel of a vehicle to be competent and capable of driving safely. ""I would urge anyone who is concerned about a family member or friend and their ability to drive to speak up, discuss your concerns with your loved one or alternatively speak to your GP who can submit their concerns to the DVLA."" Following the crash, Louis' family had set up theLouis Thorold Foundation,externalin their son's memory, with the aim of preventing infant pedestrian deaths. Mr Thorold said: ""We must now look forward. Louis wouldn't want us to be sad or give up. Louis will live on.

"An official drought has been declared as low-water levels and tinder-dry conditions continue across the UK. Eight parts of England, including Devon, Kent, East Anglia and Lincolnshire are affected. The move is expected to trigger stricter controls on water use and five water companies have already announced restrictions, including hosepipe bans. Millions are expected to be impacted but the Environment Agency said essential water supplies were safe. John Curtin, director of operations, said the drought would go on for ""a long time"" and warned of possible restrictions on crop growing and further hosepipe bans. It comes as the prolonged dry weather - combined with the current heatwave and July's record-breaking temperatures - have depleted rivers, reservoirs and aquifers. Large swathes of England are bone-dry, with scenes of parched earth and grass turned yellow. The conditions have prompted the Environment Agency to move eight of its 14 areas into drought status: Devon and Cornwall Solent and South Downs Kent and South London Hertfordshire and North London East Anglia Thames Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire East Midlands Yorkshire and the West Midlands are also expected to move into a drought later in August. The decision to declare a drought was taken after a meeting of the National Drought Group - made up of government and agency officials, water firms and groups including the National Farmers' Union. Announcing a drought means government and water companies will put into action their plans to deal with it, with measures including hosepipe bans and taking more water than usual from rivers. Members of the public and businesses in drought-affected areas are also being urged to use water wisely followingthe driest first seven months of the year since 1976. Elsewhere, Wales Drought Liaison group is also looking at the effect of the dry weather. LIVE UPDATES: Drought to be declared Will there be a hosepipe ban in my area? Flames faster than you can run - firefighters on wildfires The science of drought explained in pictures Five water companies - Welsh Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, South East Water and, most recently Yorkshire Water - have all announced hosepipe bans, whileYorkshire Water said on Friday that a banwould start on 26 August. The latter firm, which has more than five million customers, says parts of the region have seen the lowest rainfall since records began more than 130 years ago. It also said rivers and reservoirs in the region were running at 20% lower than expected for the time of year. South East Water, whose ban came into force on Friday, is now asking people to observe restrictions on using hosepipes to water plants, wash the car and fill paddling pools - with rule-breakers facing fines of up to Â£1,000. What are water companies doing to tackle leaks? How the heatwave is changing landscapes The driest start to a year since 1976 Dominic Gardener, a farmer in West Sussex, said the dry weather was posing huge challenges for farmers. ""Everything is starting to struggle a bit - our grass is not growing at all - and livestock, we're having to feed them extra food,"" he said, adding crop yields had also been reduced by the dryness. Farmers in parts of Fife are beingtemporarily banned from using waterfrom the River Eden on their fields. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency says the measure will come into effect from midnight on Saturday to tackle critical water shortages. Afour-day amber warning for extreme heatfrom the Met Office is in place for many parts of England and Wales until Sunday. Temperatures are forecast to be lower early next week, however, and the Met Office has issued yellow warnings for thunderstorms on Monday, covering most of England, Wales and Scotland. And its fire severity index - which assesses how severe a blaze could become - is currently ""very high"" for most of England and Wales. The situation facing firefighters across the UK has been described as ""unprecedented"",with increasing numbers of wildfires. Fires have broken out across the nation, including in Leytonstone, east London, Studland Bay, Dorset,Creswell, in Derbyshire,The Dower House in Bristol, and Overton, near Basingstoke in Hampshire. Police have evacuated about 50 homes in Creswell after a major incident was declared due to a field fire. Fire crews are also tackling a large blaze whichbroke out at a Leicestershire recycling centre. Meanwhile, homeless peoplestruggling with the extreme heat in Bristolsaid it was ""making us sick,"" and even sitting in the shade was ""tiring and sweaty and uncomfortable"". Bristol Street Outreach Team, operated by charity St Mungo's, has been carrying out additional shifts and giving out water, advice and sun protection to those in need. This video can not be played Watch latest UK weather forecast: Amber heat warning in force UK temperatures have been rising day-on-day through the week. According to the Met Office, on Friday the highest temperatures were recorded in: Wiggonholt, West Sussex, at 34.5C Northolt, west London, and Hermonceux West End, East Sussex, at 34.2C Heathrow, west London, at 33.9C Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, at 33.8C Chivenor, Devon, at 33.7C. Over the weekend temperatures could peak at 36C. Met Office chief meteorologist Andy Page said there would be ""increasingly warm nights"" with temperatures not expected to drop below the low 20s in some places in the south. Sir Keir Starmer has accused the government of failing to fully prepare the UK for drought, and also out at the response of water companies. Water firms have been criticised over leaks, with about three billion litres of water lost each day in the UK - between 20% and 24% of the total water supply. The Labour leader said the drought was ""predictable"" but ""as usual we had no plan from the government"". Environment Secretary George Eustice said there was ""no reason for people to be alarmed"". He told BBC News that the UK's water supply ""remains resilient"" and that ""we're in a stronger position than ever"" to withstand droughts, with progress made on leaks and infrastructure to move water between reservoirs. Heatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. Research institute UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) said it would require ""exceptional"" rainfall over the next one to three months to bring river, reservoir and groundwater levels back up to normal. It said analysis showed exceptionally low levels would probably continue until October in southern England and Wales. But scientists have warned bouts of heavy rain after a prolonged period of hot weather can cause flash flooding. Robert Thompson, a professor of Meteorology at the University of Reading, said ""the ground has effectively become like urban concrete"" and will not absorb water quickly enough to cope with longer showers. The situation in the UK is being mirrored across Europe. Much of the continent is baking in record heat, exposing riverbeds and triggering restrictions on water use in many areas. A drought has also hitGermany's Rhine River, where the water is already too low to allow some larger vessels through. Restrictions on usage during hosepipe bans can vary between water providers but generally people are not allowed to use hosepipes or anything that connects to a hosepipe or an outside tap.During a ban, people cannot use a hosepipe to: water a garden or plants fill a paddling or swimming pool clean a car fill a pond clean walls or windows But you can use other water sources, like using your mains water supply but with buckets or watering cans instead of hosepipes, or using stored rainwater from a water butt and there are some exceptions when a hosepipe can be used. Anyone breaking the rules could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. Read morehere. Have you been affected by the hot weather and restrictions?

"Water companies have announced hosepipe bans in some areas after temperatures climbed to 30C this week. People in affected areas cannot use hosepipes to water gardens, clean their cars or fill paddling pools. South East Water has introduced ahosepipe and sprinkler ban in Kent and Sussex,external. The water company imposed the ban aftersupply issues left around 4,000 customers without water. Others were experiencing low water pressure, in areas including Wadhurst, Mayfield, Biddenden and Staplehurst. It is understood the ban can only be enforced after 10 days of consultation. That means rule-breakers could face a Â£1,000 fine from 26 June. There is also a banacross Cornwalland inparts of Devon, including the Colliford and Roadford areas,according to South West Water's website.,external Elsewhere, water companies are monitoring water levels closely, although no hosepipe bans are currently planned in other parts of England. There are no bans in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Environment Agency said bans have been put in place because hot weather affects how quickly water storage reservoirs can be refilled. It said there is no threat of a drought in the UK at present. Water UK: Find your water supplier,external Why drought can lead to dangerous flooding BothSouth East Water,externalandSouth West Water,externalhave said people living in certain areas are not allowed to use a hosepipe to: water the garden water plants wash the car, patio or a boat fill a swimming or paddling pool fill or maintain a domestic pond Anyone breaking the rules could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. But there are some exceptions: for business use (for example, watering commercial crops or running a car wash business) to fill pools needed for medical treatment to water a new lawn within 28 days of it being laid to fill a fountain used for religious practices to top up a fishpond when the welfare of the fish depends on it Gardener Leigh Johnstone from Southampton, who shares tips on TikTok, says plants are hardier than most people think. Mr Johnstone suggests using a water butt to collect any rain water, as well as using ""grey water"" from baths and cooking pots. However, he cautions soapy water should not be used on edible crops. Plants can also be ""mulched"" to stop moisture escaping, by adding material such as wood chippings to the top of the soil. Leigh Johnstone, known as the Beardy Gardener on TikTok, says there are lots of ways to save water He also suggests planting drought-resistant plants such as lavender, Euphorbia and wildflowers. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) recommends using watering cans rather than hosepipes because they direct water more accurately to the roots of plants. Watering in the morning or evening can also help reduce evaporation. In addition, the RHS suggests allowing the grass on lawns to grow taller, so that it develops deeper roots which can draw water from further underground. It also recommends installing water troughs, putting saucers under plant pots to reduce waste, and using homemade compost. Can your allotment survive a hosepipe ban? Water UK, which represents the UK's water industry, says hosepipe bans normally reduce water usage by about 10%. It suggests further water-saving measures, such as reusing paddling pool water, washing dogs outside instead of in the bath and filling ponds with rainwater. However, each day, three billion litres of water is lost through leakage, according to a National Audit Office (NAO) report. In 2018, daily demand for water in England and Wales was 14 billion litres. The Environment Agency has said ""government expects water companies to act to reduce leakage and fix leaking pipes as quickly as possible"". What are water companies doing to tackle leaks?

Earlier, the government declared that large parts of England were in drought, including Devon and Cornwall, Kent, London and the East Midlands. An extreme heat amber warning is in place for parts of England and Wales, with temperatures forecast to hit 37C (99F) in the next couple of days. There is also a warning of an ""exceptional"" risk of fires. Today's writers were Malu Cursino, Laura Gozzi, James FitzGerald and Emily McGarvey. The page was edited by Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ©.  If news of drought, scorched earth and soaring temperatures has given you climate anxiety, rest assured - you are not alone. But there are some things you can do to alleviate the sense of doom. Scientists who have been working on climate change for years recommend being proactive and channelling your fears into something useful, as well as finding a community of like-minded worriers.

BBC analysis estimates thatsix million people live in places at risk of higher heatduring the summer months. Using satellite data from 4 Earth Intelligence, the BBC mapped how vulnerable postcode areas were to extreme heat in England, Wales and Scotland during periods of hot weather over the past three summers - shown with a heat hazard score. Check here to see if your postcode is vulnerable to extreme heat. The price of potatoes, carrots and other vegetables could increase in the winter as a result of poor growing conditions in the dry weather, according to a Conservative former government minister. ""The situation is very difficult,"" explains Robert Goodwill, who chairs the Commons environment, food and rural affairs select committee. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, he calls on the government to ""concentrate more on food production"" and offer more help to farmers. Goodwill, who himself runs an arable farm in North Yorkshire, says 2022 has probably been the driest year in his agricultural career. Following July's record-breaking heatwave, Londonâs fire commissioner called for a total national ban on disposable barbecues after they were blamed for starting wildfires in England. This was not imposed, but local authorities and event organisers are taking steps to limit the use of disposable barbecues. Boardmasters Festival, which takes place in Cornwall this weekend, has banned them, as have city councils like Nottingham and Birmingham. In Guernsey, where no official ban is in place, the chief fire officer has urged people to take part in a ""voluntary BBQ and bonfire ban"" in the outdoors to cut the number of wildfires. On Thursday, Sainsbury's and Tesco announced they were joining other supermarket chains in removing disposable barbecues from their shop shelves during the current heatwave. Coop followed suit today. Marks and Spencer's, Aldi and Waitrose have already halted sales.  You might be relishing the prospect of showers, which are forecast in some parts of the UK at the start of next week, and it's likely they will be accompanied by a certain scent you might be familiar with. Rain can actually smell appealing after a long period of dry weather - and there's some chemistry involved in the phenomenon. Surprisingly, a fragrance released by bacteria in wet soil can play a significant role. As can the scent of plants and the freshening of air that happens with lightning strikes. Known aspetrichor, the scent has long been chased by scientists and even perfumers for its enduring appeal. Read more about petrichor here. Simon KingBBC weather presenter and meteorologist Rain is in the forecast next week, but it'll be the ""wrong"" kind and could lead to some localised flash flooding and not really alleviate
drought conditions. With low pressure moving in, we'll get showers and
thunderstorms scattered across the UK. The ground however is parched, and
this makes a difference to what happens when the rain hits it. In a
normal summer when the ground is green and moist, water can easily soak into
it. When it is parched and hard, rainfall - especially heavy rain with
thunderstorms - tends to hit the ground and run off. With rainfall running off the surface - in the same way it
does with concrete - it is more likely to produce a flash flood. It also
means that the rainfall is transported quickly into streams and rivers rather
than filtering into the ground where it landed. So rather than scattered heavy showers, the ""right"" kind of
rain we need is from the more persistent and steady type. This gives the
parched ground more time to soak up the rainfall before it disappears into the
nearest drain or river. To go further and alleviate drought conditions we'll need
weeks of rainfall to bring the reservoirs and river levels back up to
normal. This is not in the forecast, however - so there are concerns that
drought issues may persist well into the autumn in some locations. Farmers in Wales say the summer's dry weather has affected crop yields - and even the size of potatoes. This video can not be played Worried farmers say their crop yields are down massively Labour leader Keir Starmer has accused the government of failing to fully prepare the UK for drought, and hit out at the response of water companies. ""Thereâs a familiar pattern here, which is weâve got a government with no strategy,"" Starmer says, in response to the Environment Agency movingeight of its 14 areas in England into drought status. ""This drought, this hot period, was predictable. But, as usual, we had no plan from the government and this is the pattern, this is the character of this government."" He said water companies aren't doing enough to deal with leakages and other water supply issues. ""We saw the sewage going into rivers and I think that some of the regulations should have been better used,"" Starmer told reporters during a visit to Edinburgh. ""I would have liked to have seen much greater fines against those companies that arenât doing what is necessary."" You've been sending us pictures of the drought where you are. Here is a small selection. Parched, dry grass in Swanley Park, Kent Low water levels at Grafham Water in Cambridgeshire - Britainâs third largest reservoir and a site of special scientific interest The pond at Rosebery Park in Epsom, Surrey: ""I have lived in this area all my life, and I've never seen it this dried up,â says photographer Anthony Etches Dried pond at Godstone Green, Surrey John Curtin, executive director for local operations at the Environment Agency, has told the BBC that this has been the South East's driest July since records began in 1891. There was also a drought after the hot summer of 1976, although we are better placed to deal with it today thanks to a modern water infrastructure and a slightly-wetter-than-average winter, he says. Curtin also said the drought announcement showed that ""this is not a normal summer"" and that everyone should be thinking about using water wisely as it ""will probably be an issue for months ahead depending how the winter goes"". ""It will take weeks of rain to stop the drought which is currently affecting parts of England,"" he adds. But how long will the drought last? Curtin said: ""It all depends on the weather, I'm afraid. There will be heavy showers probably Monday, Tuesday next week. But, please, don't think that will stop the drought because... we've lost a week's worth of rain and it'll take weeks of rain. ""We'll need probably average or slightly above average rainfall this autumn into this winter for us to not be a drought next year.""  A comparison of satellite images taken last August and three days ago clearly shows how the area surrounding Cambridge is significantly parched this year: Malu CursinoBBC News Live Reporter As the heatwave continues to sweep England and Wales, we asked dermatologist Dr Adeline Kikam about how extreme heat can impact our skin. She says several skin conditions can develop, or worsen, during persistently high temperatures. Some of those conditions are:  Why? Heat rashes, tiny bumps or blisters in the skin, happen when there is an obstruction in the sweat ducts and inflammation. It's more common during the summer because it's triggered by heat and humidity. Dr Kikam says high temperatures can worsen or aggravateeczema. High temperatures lead to increased sweating, which in turn can make the skin even drier and the salt residue from the sweat can cause inflammation in the skin. This combination leads to redness, and general discomfort. Increased spots and breakoutsare common during high temperatures because there's an excess secretion of oil from our sebaceous glands. This combined with sweating and products like make-up can clog your pores and trap dirt in the skin. Sunburnsare the result of long exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. If you have darker skin, and therefore more melanin, your body has a base protective layer to UV radiation and it might take longer to notice the symptoms of sunburn (redness and blisters). ""Damage to the skin is just not as visible, but you're still getting the damage,"" Dr Kikam says. What should you do? For those suffering fromheat rashes, Dr Kikam says patients should remove themselves from hot and humid environments when possible and ensure they have access to good ventilation, by using fans and air conditioner - and keep the affected area of the skin dry. The same goes forchafing:wearing loose clothing, ensuring your skin is dry and avoiding friction are the best ways to avoid it. However, for those suffering from aggravatedeczema, it is important to keep your skin moisturised with neutral lotions. Forsunburns, Dr Kikam says everyone should ensure they're wearing sunscreen to protect themselves from exposure to UV radiation and protecting themselves from direct sun exposure for long periods of time. Regularly cleansing your skin ensures you can minimise your risk of havingbreakouts, as you are avoiding product build up and keeping your pores unclogged. Listen tothe latest episode of Newscast, which features an interview with the head of Environment Agency, Sir James Bevan, about the impact of the recent dry
weather and soaring temperatures - plus BBC experts discuss how the
hot conditions will affect crops and agriculture, and when we can expect some
rain. Justin RowlattBBC Climate editor Farmers are demanding ministers ensure water supplies for
farmers are given the same priority as those for the environment. Supporting food production is not part of the remit of the
Environment Agency, which determines where much of the countryâs water supplies
go, warns Tom Bradshaw, the deputy president of the National Farmers Union
(NFU). ""That has to change to protect food supplies,"" he says
and suggests government ministers may need to bring in new rules. ""Farmers recognise the importance of protecting the
environment but food production needs to be given equal status,"" he told
the BBC. The demand comes as farms in England and parts of Wales face
serious water shortages. Testimony from the NFU formed a key part of the
evidence which persuaded the government to put much of England in drought. Half the countryâs potato crop cannot be irrigated so is very vulnerable
to drought, the meeting of the National Drought Group, which met this morning,
was told. The NFU warned ""irrigation options are diminishing with
reservoirs being emptied fast"". It said farmers are expecting losses of
between 10% and 50% for crops including carrots, onions, sugar beet, apples and
hops. Farmers would normally be planting their rapeseed crop at this
time of year. But, says Bradshaw, conditions are so bad at the moment very few
farmers are likely to plant the crop. If you're at a Coldplay gig during the heatwave, you'll want to avoid getting a Rush of Blood to the Head.

In response to much of Britain being declared under drought conditions, Ami
McCarthy, climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, says the drought across Europe, the extreme heatwaves and the cost of living crisis ""are all the result of our climate-destroying reliance on fossil fuels"". She also accuses governments across the world of ""handing out billions to fossil fuel giants, subsidising their reckless profiteering, including in the UK where our government continues to offer lucrative 'investment incentives'"": We urgently need to turn away from fossil fuels and towards the clean, green energy of the future, which is the only way to bring down global temperatures and tackle the cost of living crisis.  Renewables are now at least four times cheaper than fossil fuels so a shift toward green energy is not only good for the climate but an economic necessity. Governments need to decide whose side they're on."" Ami McCarthy Researchers at the University of Reading have been investigating how long it will take water to get through parched soil - which has baked dry due to the high temperatures and low rainfall. Although we are currently in the middle of a four-day heatwave, theMet Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms,externalfor much of the UK, beginning in Scotland and Northern Ireland from Sunday afternoon.

All of London has been officially declared in drought by the National Drought Group, after almost a month without rain in some areas. While rain is forecast in London next week, dry ground absorbs water more slowly leading to fears that the capital may face flash floods.

"This video can not be played Keir Starmer: Boris Johnson is a lame duck prime minister Labour's leader has robustly defended his response to rising energy bills, arguing his party has been ""leading"" on the worsening cost-of-living crisis. Sir Keir Starmer said Labour had already made proposals to lower costs, including taking VAT off energy bills. He called Boris Johnson a ""lame duck"" prime minister who was ""not prepared to do anything"" on soaring living costs. He said Labour would end energy prepayment meters premiums and more policies would follow next week. Some backbench Labour MPs have criticised Sir Keir for being on holiday as the crisis over skyrocketing energy bills - driven by global economic turmoil - deepened this week. When asked about discontent within his party over his response, Sir Keir said Labour had proposed policies such as a windfall tax on the excess profits of oil and gas companies and cutting VAT on energy bills months ago, long before they were on the government's radar. ""For the best part of 12 months, Labour has been absolutely leading on this issue,"" Sir Keir said. ""And I'm very proud of the work we've done."" Labour and other opposition parties have been urging the government to take immediate action on rising living costs, an issue which has dominated the Tory leadership contest. Earlier outgoing Prime Minister Mr Johnson admitted the current help for people struggling with energy bills was not enough, and he expected more money to follow. The government has said it would leave big spending decisions to Mr Johnson's successor - either Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss - when they take office in September. But Mr Johnson, who was forced to resign last month after a cabinet mutiny, said he was ""making sure there is extra cash"" for his successor to provide additional support. Current energy bills support not enough - Johnson How high will my energy bill go? Rishi Sunak vows more support for energy costs Energy bills could go up before October Speaking in Edinburgh, Scotland after retuning to work on Friday, Sir Keir talked about Labour's plan to scrap what he called ""outrageous and immoral"" energy prepayment premiums. Prepayment meters require customers to pay for their energy use in advance, often online, but also from credit bought in convenience stores. Labour says it would eliminate the ""premium"" that means people with prepayment meters, who are often on low incomes, are charged more than those on direct debits. Figures fromenergy regulator Ofgem,externalshow customers using prepayment meters will pay Â£46 more on average annually than those paying standard tariffs via direct debits. With energy bills forecast to soar this winter, the policy is designed to ease the financial burden on the estimated four million domestic customers who use the meters. Labour says its announcement is part of a wider package on the energy crisis that Sir Keir and other senior shadow ministers are planning to unveil in the coming days. ""On Monday, I'm going to be setting out a comprehensive set of proposals a plan for how we handle the upcoming costs in the autumn,"" Sir Keir said. Analysts predict average annual energy bills could rise to over Â£4,200 by January, while the Bank of England has forecast a recession in the UK later this year. But some backbench Labour MPs had expressed frustration at the party's recent response to rising living costs and the state of the economy. ""The scale of this crisis is absolutely huge, and I'm personally not seeing enough being done by my party,"" Zarah Sultana, the MP for Coventry South, told LBC. ""Of course I want the Labour Party to go further."" On Twitter Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary,shared a mocked-up wanted poster,externalwhich said ""missing during the cost of living crisis"" below an image of Sir Keir. Meanwhile, in Sir Keir's absence, cost of living and energy proposals put forward by former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown have been drawing attention. Last week Mr Brown called for an emergency budget before the UK hit a ""financial timebomb"" this autumn. Then,writing in the Guardian,external, he urged the Tory leadership candidates to make ""several urgently needed decisions"". They included cancelling the energy price cap before its expected increase later in August, and bringing energy companies into public ownership ""as a last resort"" if they can not meet certain conditions. Evoking the banking collapse of 2007-08, Mr Brown said the government could ""operate their essential services from the public sector until the crisis is over"". The BBC understands the announcement of Mr Brown's suite of proposals was not co-ordinated with the office of the Labour leader. When asked if Mr Brown's suggestion of nationalising energy companies was out of step with the party's policy, backbench Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ""No, I don't think so."" He said he was not a ""let's-nationalise-everything person"", but added: ""There will be considerable pressure if the energy companies don't act faster, in particular to help poorer customers."" He said commentary on a Labour leader's uptake of policy ideas can be ""a really stultifying process in British politics"". ""Gordon has come up with some good ideas,"" Mr Bryant said.

Goodwill, who himself runs an arable farm in North Yorkshire, says 2022 has probably been the driest year in his agricultural career. Following July's record-breaking heatwave, Londonâs fire commissioner called for a total national ban on disposable barbecues after they were blamed for starting wildfires in England. This was not imposed, but local authorities and event organisers are taking steps to limit the use of disposable barbecues. Boardmasters Festival, which takes place in Cornwall this weekend, has banned them, as have city councils like Nottingham and Birmingham. In Guernsey, where no official ban is in place, the chief fire officer has urged people to take part in a ""voluntary BBQ and bonfire ban"" in the outdoors to cut the number of wildfires. On Thursday, Sainsbury's and Tesco announced they were joining other supermarket chains in removing disposable barbecues from their shop shelves during the current heatwave. Coop followed suit today. Marks and Spencer's, Aldi and Waitrose have already halted sales.  You might be relishing the prospect of showers, which are forecast in some parts of the UK at the start of next week, and it's likely they will be accompanied by a certain scent you might be familiar with. Rain can actually smell appealing after a long period of dry weather - and there's some chemistry involved in the phenomenon. Surprisingly, a fragrance released by bacteria in wet soil can play a significant role. As can the scent of plants and the freshening of air that happens with lightning strikes. Known aspetrichor, the scent has long been chased by scientists and even perfumers for its enduring appeal. Read more about petrichor here. Simon KingBBC weather presenter and meteorologist Rain is in the forecast next week, but it'll be the ""wrong"" kind and could lead to some localised flash flooding and not really alleviate
drought conditions. With low pressure moving in, we'll get showers and
thunderstorms scattered across the UK. The ground however is parched, and
this makes a difference to what happens when the rain hits it. In a
normal summer when the ground is green and moist, water can easily soak into
it. When it is parched and hard, rainfall - especially heavy rain with
thunderstorms - tends to hit the ground and run off. With rainfall running off the surface - in the same way it
does with concrete - it is more likely to produce a flash flood. It also
means that the rainfall is transported quickly into streams and rivers rather
than filtering into the ground where it landed. So rather than scattered heavy showers, the ""right"" kind of
rain we need is from the more persistent and steady type. This gives the
parched ground more time to soak up the rainfall before it disappears into the
nearest drain or river. To go further and alleviate drought conditions we'll need
weeks of rainfall to bring the reservoirs and river levels back up to
normal. This is not in the forecast, however - so there are concerns that
drought issues may persist well into the autumn in some locations. Farmers in Wales say the summer's dry weather has affected crop yields - and even the size of potatoes. This video can not be played Worried farmers say their crop yields are down massively Labour leader Keir Starmer has accused the government of failing to fully prepare the UK for drought, and hit out at the response of water companies. ""Thereâs a familiar pattern here, which is weâve got a government with no strategy,"" Starmer says, in response to the Environment Agency movingeight of its 14 areas in England into drought status. ""This drought, this hot period, was predictable. But, as usual, we had no plan from the government and this is the pattern, this is the character of this government."" He said water companies aren't doing enough to deal with leakages and other water supply issues. ""We saw the sewage going into rivers and I think that some of the regulations should have been better used,"" Starmer told reporters during a visit to Edinburgh. ""I would have liked to have seen much greater fines against those companies that arenât doing what is necessary."" You've been sending us pictures of the drought where you are.

There was also a drought after the hot summer of 1976, although we are better placed to deal with it today thanks to a modern water infrastructure and a slightly-wetter-than-average winter, he says. Curtin also said the drought announcement showed that ""this is not a normal summer"" and that everyone should be thinking about using water wisely as it ""will probably be an issue for months ahead depending how the winter goes"". ""It will take weeks of rain to stop the drought which is currently affecting parts of England,"" he adds. But how long will the drought last? Curtin said: ""It all depends on the weather, I'm afraid. There will be heavy showers probably Monday, Tuesday next week. But, please, don't think that will stop the drought because... we've lost a week's worth of rain and it'll take weeks of rain.

A comparison of satellite images taken last August and three days ago clearly shows how the area surrounding Cambridge is significantly parched this year: Malu CursinoBBC News Live Reporter As the heatwave continues to sweep England and Wales, we asked dermatologist Dr Adeline Kikam about how extreme heat can impact our skin. She says several skin conditions can develop, or worsen, during persistently high temperatures. Some of those conditions are:  Why? Heat rashes, tiny bumps or blisters in the skin, happen when there is an obstruction in the sweat ducts and inflammation. It's more common during the summer because it's triggered by heat and humidity. Dr Kikam says high temperatures can worsen or aggravateeczema. High temperatures lead to increased sweating, which in turn can make the skin even drier and the salt residue from the sweat can cause inflammation in the skin. This combination leads to redness, and general discomfort. Increased spots and breakoutsare common during high temperatures because there's an excess secretion of oil from our sebaceous glands. This combined with sweating and products like make-up can clog your pores and trap dirt in the skin. Sunburnsare the result of long exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. If you have darker skin, and therefore more melanin, your body has a base protective layer to UV radiation and it might take longer to notice the symptoms of sunburn (redness and blisters). ""Damage to the skin is just not as visible, but you're still getting the damage,"" Dr Kikam says. What should you do? For those suffering fromheat rashes, Dr Kikam says patients should remove themselves from hot and humid environments when possible and ensure they have access to good ventilation, by using fans and air conditioner - and keep the affected area of the skin dry. The same goes forchafing:wearing loose clothing, ensuring your skin is dry and avoiding friction are the best ways to avoid it. However, for those suffering from aggravatedeczema, it is important to keep your skin moisturised with neutral lotions. Forsunburns, Dr Kikam says everyone should ensure they're wearing sunscreen to protect themselves from exposure to UV radiation and protecting themselves from direct sun exposure for long periods of time. Regularly cleansing your skin ensures you can minimise your risk of havingbreakouts, as you are avoiding product build up and keeping your pores unclogged. Listen tothe latest episode of Newscast, which features an interview with the head of Environment Agency, Sir James Bevan, about the impact of the recent dry
weather and soaring temperatures - plus BBC experts discuss how the
hot conditions will affect crops and agriculture, and when we can expect some

farmers are given the same priority as those for the environment. Supporting food production is not part of the remit of the
Environment Agency, which determines where much of the countryâs water supplies
go, warns Tom Bradshaw, the deputy president of the National Farmers Union
(NFU). ""That has to change to protect food supplies,"" he says
and suggests government ministers may need to bring in new rules. ""Farmers recognise the importance of protecting the
environment but food production needs to be given equal status,"" he told
the BBC. The demand comes as farms in England and parts of Wales face
serious water shortages. Testimony from the NFU formed a key part of the
evidence which persuaded the government to put much of England in drought. Half the countryâs potato crop cannot be irrigated so is very vulnerable
to drought, the meeting of the National Drought Group, which met this morning,
was told. The NFU warned ""irrigation options are diminishing with
reservoirs being emptied fast"". It said farmers are expecting losses of
between 10% and 50% for crops including carrots, onions, sugar beet, apples and
hops. Farmers would normally be planting their rapeseed crop at this
time of year. But, says Bradshaw, conditions are so bad at the moment very few
farmers are likely to plant the crop. If you're at a Coldplay gig during the heatwave, you'll want to avoid getting a Rush of Blood to the Head.

"Refuse workers are due to strike with dates due to be announced for school staff action Scottish council leaders have made a new pay offer to staff in a bid to avoid planned strikes. Cosla has put a 3.5% deal on the table aftera 2% increase was rejected, and will raise the Scottish local government living wage to Â£10.50 an hour. Unions said the offer was not enough. Local government minister Shona Robison said it was ""extremely disappointing"" that Cosla had not come up with 5%. The Scottish government has said it expected local authorities to matchthe Â£140m extra pledged by the Scottish governmentfor pay rises. Councils to get extra Â£140m towards workers' pay Bin collectors to strike during Edinburgh festival Ms Robison said: ""Cosla recognised this was not an issue for the Scottish government to solve in its entirety - it has got to be a partnership. ""Which means local authorities must look at every possible area of finance to come to a fair and affordable pay offer for staff which avoids damaging industrial action."" Earlier, GMB Scotland and Unison announced that local authority employees across the country would strike in two four-day stoppages over the next month in the ongoing pay dispute. Waste and recycling workers will walk out between August 26 and 29 as well as between September 7 and 10. Refuse workers in Glasgow last took strike action in November 2021 GMB members will strike in Aberdeen, Angus, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Lothian, Falkirk, Glasgow, Inverclyde, Highland, Midlothian, Orkney, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, West Lothian, Perth and Kinross, and North Lanarkshire. Unison members in Aberdeenshire, Clackmannanshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Inverclyde, North Lanarkshire, Stirling and South Lanarkshire have also said they will walk out. Following a special meeting of council leaders on Friday, Cosla spokeswoman Katie Hagmann said she had been mandated to make a fresh offer. She said council leaders had reaffirmed their desire to make an offer of more than 2% but that fears had been expressed that public services and jobs would be affected as a result. Significantly improved pay offer needed, says union No alternative to ""all-out"" council strike - Unite Ms Hagmann said: ""Following the confirmation that the additional monies provided by the Scottish government will be recurring, leaders have now mandated me today to move forward with our trade union partners on the basis of an offer that raises the Scottish local government living wage to Â£10.50. ""Leaders note the risk that public services will not recover, jobs will be affected and communities will see services reduced as local government budgets are unable to sustain the long-term pressures they have been under. ""Leaders continue to call on Scottish government to provide funding and flexibilities to enable an offer beyond the monies provided to date. ""As such, we will be seeking to make an improved offer via the appropriate negotiating mechanisms as soon as possible."" The Scottish government's finance secretary John Swinney had earlier urged councils to improve their offer to staff and unions. Mr Swinney told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programmehe wanted to avoid industrial action. He said some councils had already budgeted on a higher pay offer than the one on the table. ""Some have budgeted on 3% and have offered 2%. I have put Â£140m on table which puts the offer even higher,"" he said. No council leader believes staff only deserve a 3.5% pay rise. The problem is what they can each afford. Council pay is consistent across all 32 of Scotland's local authorities. The rise has to be affordable to all of them. The Scottish government is giving councils an extra Â£140m To help with pay. This was enough to raise the pay offer from 2% to 3.5% but the Scottish government was clear that councils had to use more of their own money too. Some councils, including Glasgow, were prepared to do this. Glasgow had argued for a 5% pay rise. Some others argued they could not afford any more so would need even more cash from the Scottish government. Mr Swinney said that according to the Scottish Fiscal Commission, theScottish government's overall budget was cut in real termsby the UK government and that within that budget, councils were given a ""strong financial settlement"". The UK government says Scotland has been granted record funding levels. Leader of East Renfrewshire Council, Owen O'Donnell, told BBC Scotland it would be difficult to avert strikes unless Mr Swinney offered more cash to councils to pay for salary rises. He said: ""He needs to double the amount he previously offered at least. ""Councils are under a huge amount of pressure. We have been squeezed for the past 15 years and we have got nothing else to give."" It comes a day after the Scottish government announced an emergency budget review for Scotland in response to the growing cost of living crisis. Johanna Baxter, Unison Scotland's head of local government said: ""Unison are shocked and disappointed that Cosla leaders have yet again failed to come up with a decent pay offer for these vital workers. ""An offer of 3.5% is likely to be totally unacceptable to our reps and is some way off matching the offer made to council workers south of the border. ""Whilst our local government committee will meet next week to take a view on this there will be no suspension to our strike action at this stage."" GMB Scotland senior organiser Keir Greenaway said: ""This is a dire response to the cost of living crisis facing our members. ""The blame game between Cosla and the government will no doubt continue, but six months on from the overwhelming rejection of the initial pay offer, this is a damning indictment of how our council workers are valued by Scotland's political leaders.""

The World Meteorological Organization called the experimentâclear and compellingâ.,external Buses and cars were left stranded when roads across London flooded in July 2021 The mayor of London Sadiq Khan has said he is âseriously concernedâ that London may experience severe flash flooding following the extended period of dry weather, with the capital âunpreparedâ for the heavy rain that may yet come. All of London has been officially declared in drought by the National Drought Group, after almost a month without rain in some areas. While rain is forecast in London next week, dry ground absorbs water more slowly leading to fears that the capital may face flash floods. Khan said he was worried that London could see a repeat of the flash flooding that damaged thousand of homes and the city's transport network in July 2021. âWe are coordinating with councils what weâd do if that [flooding] was to happen, but letâs be frank, a city like London is not ready for the consequences of climate change and weâve got to get ready,"" he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.

"Refuse workers are due to strike with dates due to be announced for school staff action Scottish council leaders have made a new pay offer to staff in a bid to avoid planned strikes. Cosla has put a 3.5% deal on the table aftera 2% increase was rejected, and will raise the Scottish local government living wage to Â£10.50 an hour. Unions said the offer was not enough. Local government minister Shona Robison said it was ""extremely disappointing"" that Cosla had not come up with 5%. The Scottish government has said it expected local authorities to matchthe Â£140m extra pledged by the Scottish governmentfor pay rises. Councils to get extra Â£140m towards workers' pay Bin collectors to strike during Edinburgh festival Ms Robison said: ""Cosla recognised this was not an issue for the Scottish government to solve in its entirety - it has got to be a partnership. ""Which means local authorities must look at every possible area of finance to come to a fair and affordable pay offer for staff which avoids damaging industrial action."" Earlier, GMB Scotland and Unison announced that local authority employees across the country would strike in two four-day stoppages over the next month in the ongoing pay dispute. Waste and recycling workers will walk out between August 26 and 29 as well as between September 7 and 10. Refuse workers in Glasgow last took strike action in November 2021 GMB members will strike in Aberdeen, Angus, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Lothian, Falkirk, Glasgow, Inverclyde, Highland, Midlothian, Orkney, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, West Lothian, Perth and Kinross, and North Lanarkshire. Unison members in Aberdeenshire, Clackmannanshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Inverclyde, North Lanarkshire, Stirling and South Lanarkshire have also said they will walk out. Following a special meeting of council leaders on Friday, Cosla spokeswoman Katie Hagmann said she had been mandated to make a fresh offer. She said council leaders had reaffirmed their desire to make an offer of more than 2% but that fears had been expressed that public services and jobs would be affected as a result. Significantly improved pay offer needed, says union No alternative to ""all-out"" council strike - Unite Ms Hagmann said: ""Following the confirmation that the additional monies provided by the Scottish government will be recurring, leaders have now mandated me today to move forward with our trade union partners on the basis of an offer that raises the Scottish local government living wage to Â£10.50. ""Leaders note the risk that public services will not recover, jobs will be affected and communities will see services reduced as local government budgets are unable to sustain the long-term pressures they have been under. ""Leaders continue to call on Scottish government to provide funding and flexibilities to enable an offer beyond the monies provided to date. ""As such, we will be seeking to make an improved offer via the appropriate negotiating mechanisms as soon as possible."" The Scottish government's finance secretary John Swinney had earlier urged councils to improve their offer to staff and unions. Mr Swinney told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programmehe wanted to avoid industrial action. He said some councils had already budgeted on a higher pay offer than the one on the table. ""Some have budgeted on 3% and have offered 2%. I have put Â£140m on table which puts the offer even higher,"" he said. No council leader believes staff only deserve a 3.5% pay rise. The problem is what they can each afford. Council pay is consistent across all 32 of Scotland's local authorities. The rise has to be affordable to all of them. The Scottish government is giving councils an extra Â£140m To help with pay. This was enough to raise the pay offer from 2% to 3.5% but the Scottish government was clear that councils had to use more of their own money too. Some councils, including Glasgow, were prepared to do this. Glasgow had argued for a 5% pay rise. Some others argued they could not afford any more so would need even more cash from the Scottish government. Mr Swinney said that according to the Scottish Fiscal Commission, theScottish government's overall budget was cut in real termsby the UK government and that within that budget, councils were given a ""strong financial settlement"". The UK government says Scotland has been granted record funding levels. Leader of East Renfrewshire Council, Owen O'Donnell, told BBC Scotland it would be difficult to avert strikes unless Mr Swinney offered more cash to councils to pay for salary rises. He said: ""He needs to double the amount he previously offered at least. ""Councils are under a huge amount of pressure. We have been squeezed for the past 15 years and we have got nothing else to give."" It comes a day after the Scottish government announced an emergency budget review for Scotland in response to the growing cost of living crisis. Johanna Baxter, Unison Scotland's head of local government said: ""Unison are shocked and disappointed that Cosla leaders have yet again failed to come up with a decent pay offer for these vital workers. ""An offer of 3.5% is likely to be totally unacceptable to our reps and is some way off matching the offer made to council workers south of the border. ""Whilst our local government committee will meet next week to take a view on this there will be no suspension to our strike action at this stage."" GMB Scotland senior organiser Keir Greenaway said: ""This is a dire response to the cost of living crisis facing our members. ""The blame game between Cosla and the government will no doubt continue, but six months on from the overwhelming rejection of the initial pay offer, this is a damning indictment of how our council workers are valued by Scotland's political leaders.""

"This video can not be played Keir Starmer: Boris Johnson is a lame duck prime minister Labour's leader has robustly defended his response to rising energy bills, arguing his party has been ""leading"" on the worsening cost-of-living crisis. Sir Keir Starmer said Labour had already made proposals to lower costs, including taking VAT off energy bills. He called Boris Johnson a ""lame duck"" prime minister who was ""not prepared to do anything"" on soaring living costs. He said Labour would end energy prepayment meters premiums and more policies would follow next week. Some backbench Labour MPs have criticised Sir Keir for being on holiday as the crisis over skyrocketing energy bills - driven by global economic turmoil - deepened this week. When asked about discontent within his party over his response, Sir Keir said Labour had proposed policies such as a windfall tax on the excess profits of oil and gas companies and cutting VAT on energy bills months ago, long before they were on the government's radar. ""For the best part of 12 months, Labour has been absolutely leading on this issue,"" Sir Keir said. ""And I'm very proud of the work we've done."" Labour and other opposition parties have been urging the government to take immediate action on rising living costs, an issue which has dominated the Tory leadership contest. Earlier outgoing Prime Minister Mr Johnson admitted the current help for people struggling with energy bills was not enough, and he expected more money to follow. The government has said it would leave big spending decisions to Mr Johnson's successor - either Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss - when they take office in September. But Mr Johnson, who was forced to resign last month after a cabinet mutiny, said he was ""making sure there is extra cash"" for his successor to provide additional support. Current energy bills support not enough - Johnson How high will my energy bill go? Rishi Sunak vows more support for energy costs Energy bills could go up before October Speaking in Edinburgh, Scotland after retuning to work on Friday, Sir Keir talked about Labour's plan to scrap what he called ""outrageous and immoral"" energy prepayment premiums. Prepayment meters require customers to pay for their energy use in advance, often online, but also from credit bought in convenience stores. Labour says it would eliminate the ""premium"" that means people with prepayment meters, who are often on low incomes, are charged more than those on direct debits. Figures fromenergy regulator Ofgem,externalshow customers using prepayment meters will pay Â£46 more on average annually than those paying standard tariffs via direct debits. With energy bills forecast to soar this winter, the policy is designed to ease the financial burden on the estimated four million domestic customers who use the meters. Labour says its announcement is part of a wider package on the energy crisis that Sir Keir and other senior shadow ministers are planning to unveil in the coming days. ""On Monday, I'm going to be setting out a comprehensive set of proposals a plan for how we handle the upcoming costs in the autumn,"" Sir Keir said. Analysts predict average annual energy bills could rise to over Â£4,200 by January, while the Bank of England has forecast a recession in the UK later this year. But some backbench Labour MPs had expressed frustration at the party's recent response to rising living costs and the state of the economy. ""The scale of this crisis is absolutely huge, and I'm personally not seeing enough being done by my party,"" Zarah Sultana, the MP for Coventry South, told LBC. ""Of course I want the Labour Party to go further."" On Twitter Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary,shared a mocked-up wanted poster,externalwhich said ""missing during the cost of living crisis"" below an image of Sir Keir. Meanwhile, in Sir Keir's absence, cost of living and energy proposals put forward by former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown have been drawing attention. Last week Mr Brown called for an emergency budget before the UK hit a ""financial timebomb"" this autumn. Then,writing in the Guardian,external, he urged the Tory leadership candidates to make ""several urgently needed decisions"". They included cancelling the energy price cap before its expected increase later in August, and bringing energy companies into public ownership ""as a last resort"" if they can not meet certain conditions. Evoking the banking collapse of 2007-08, Mr Brown said the government could ""operate their essential services from the public sector until the crisis is over"". The BBC understands the announcement of Mr Brown's suite of proposals was not co-ordinated with the office of the Labour leader. When asked if Mr Brown's suggestion of nationalising energy companies was out of step with the party's policy, backbench Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ""No, I don't think so."" He said he was not a ""let's-nationalise-everything person"", but added: ""There will be considerable pressure if the energy companies don't act faster, in particular to help poorer customers."" He said commentary on a Labour leader's uptake of policy ideas can be ""a really stultifying process in British politics"". ""Gordon has come up with some good ideas,"" Mr Bryant said.

"This video can not be played ""I'm sticking it out"" - last resident of housing estate earmarked for demolition The last resident of a housing estate due to be demolished has said the council will need to double its offer to get him to leave. Nick Wisniewski has had no neighbours in his block on the Gowkthrapple housing estate in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, since December. The 66-year-old wants at least Â£80,000 so he can afford to buy a new flat. But North Lanarkshire Council said they could not pay Mr Wisniewski more than the property was worth. The retired bank worker bought the flat in Stanhope Place several years ago under the Right to Buy scheme, which helped council tenants buy their homes at discounted rates. The schemehas since been closed in Scotland. The block on the Gowkthrapple estate in Wishaw is due to be demolished as part of a redevelopment ""I've been here for 21 years and I'm settled,"" Mr Wisniewski told BBC Scotland. ""I've looked at prices of houses round about. For a two-bedroom flat you're talking anything between Â£80,000 to Â£100,000. ""I finished up with the bank, I took my redundancy. But I'm not prepared to make myself skint because of North Lanarkshire Council."" Mr Wisniewski said the council had offered him Â£35,000 for his flat, along with two years' of free rent at a new council property. The authority isplanning to redevelop the whole Gowkthrapple estate,external, replacing ""ageing"" housing and creating an ""attractive and well-connected new neighbourhood"". Work on other parts of the estate has already begun. Mr Wisniewski told BBC Scotland he was not willing to move into a new rented council property, but wanted to buy a new place. Mr Wisniewski told the BBC he was prepared to stick it out ""as long as it takes"" ""I'm too old for this,"" he said. ""I don't want a lot of hassle in my life, I just want to take it easy."" ""That's why I would prefer to just move out and into somewhere I could buy."" He said he had not heard from North Lanarkshire Council since last November and had been waiting to hear from the authority with an improved offer. ""If they gave me Â£35,000, I could easily put Â£20,000 to it which is not nearly enough. So really they need to double their offer for me to get something decent,"" he said. ""A lot of people would say I'd be better to go - but I'm sticking it out because I have in my mind what I'm looking for. I'm looking for something better and I'm not going to get that only having Â£35,000 from the council."" North Lanarkshire Council is planning to pursue a compulsory purchase order on the property but said its door ""remains open"" to Mr Wisniewski for further talks. A council spokesperson said: ""We have been in dialogue with the owner for several years about this issue and although we understand that there is a personal connection to the property, we simply cannot pay more for the property than it is worth. ""If the owner feels that the value he has been offered doesn't reflect the market value then there are ways for a valuation to be negotiated on his behalf. ""We are keen to resolve this matter to ensure that he receives a fair deal and to support him to find alternative accommodation. We have discussed the option of other suitable places for him to stay, but he has refused each of them."" Mr Wisniewski said he was open to further discussions, but planned to stick it out in his flat ""as long as it takes"". ""I reckon the council is going to make a lot of money out of it [the development] at the end of the day, so why not give me more?"" he added.

Staff at schools, nurseries and waste and recycling centres have voted to strike afterrejecting a 2% pay offer.

"An official drought has been declared as low-water levels and tinder-dry conditions continue across the UK. Eight parts of England, including Devon, Kent, East Anglia and Lincolnshire are affected. The move is expected to trigger stricter controls on water use and five water companies have already announced restrictions, including hosepipe bans. Millions are expected to be impacted but the Environment Agency said essential water supplies were safe. John Curtin, director of operations, said the drought would go on for ""a long time"" and warned of possible restrictions on crop growing and further hosepipe bans. It comes as the prolonged dry weather - combined with the current heatwave and July's record-breaking temperatures - have depleted rivers, reservoirs and aquifers. Large swathes of England are bone-dry, with scenes of parched earth and grass turned yellow. The conditions have prompted the Environment Agency to move eight of its 14 areas into drought status: Devon and Cornwall Solent and South Downs Kent and South London Hertfordshire and North London East Anglia Thames Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire East Midlands Yorkshire and the West Midlands are also expected to move into a drought later in August. The decision to declare a drought was taken after a meeting of the National Drought Group - made up of government and agency officials, water firms and groups including the National Farmers' Union. Announcing a drought means government and water companies will put into action their plans to deal with it, with measures including hosepipe bans and taking more water than usual from rivers. Members of the public and businesses in drought-affected areas are also being urged to use water wisely followingthe driest first seven months of the year since 1976. Elsewhere, Wales Drought Liaison group is also looking at the effect of the dry weather. LIVE UPDATES: Drought to be declared Will there be a hosepipe ban in my area? Flames faster than you can run - firefighters on wildfires The science of drought explained in pictures Five water companies - Welsh Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, South East Water and, most recently Yorkshire Water - have all announced hosepipe bans, whileYorkshire Water said on Friday that a banwould start on 26 August. The latter firm, which has more than five million customers, says parts of the region have seen the lowest rainfall since records began more than 130 years ago. It also said rivers and reservoirs in the region were running at 20% lower than expected for the time of year. South East Water, whose ban came into force on Friday, is now asking people to observe restrictions on using hosepipes to water plants, wash the car and fill paddling pools - with rule-breakers facing fines of up to Â£1,000. What are water companies doing to tackle leaks? How the heatwave is changing landscapes The driest start to a year since 1976 Dominic Gardener, a farmer in West Sussex, said the dry weather was posing huge challenges for farmers. ""Everything is starting to struggle a bit - our grass is not growing at all - and livestock, we're having to feed them extra food,"" he said, adding crop yields had also been reduced by the dryness. Farmers in parts of Fife are beingtemporarily banned from using waterfrom the River Eden on their fields. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency says the measure will come into effect from midnight on Saturday to tackle critical water shortages. Afour-day amber warning for extreme heatfrom the Met Office is in place for many parts of England and Wales until Sunday. Temperatures are forecast to be lower early next week, however, and the Met Office has issued yellow warnings for thunderstorms on Monday, covering most of England, Wales and Scotland. And its fire severity index - which assesses how severe a blaze could become - is currently ""very high"" for most of England and Wales. The situation facing firefighters across the UK has been described as ""unprecedented"",with increasing numbers of wildfires. Fires have broken out across the nation, including in Leytonstone, east London, Studland Bay, Dorset,Creswell, in Derbyshire,The Dower House in Bristol, and Overton, near Basingstoke in Hampshire. Police have evacuated about 50 homes in Creswell after a major incident was declared due to a field fire. Fire crews are also tackling a large blaze whichbroke out at a Leicestershire recycling centre. Meanwhile, homeless peoplestruggling with the extreme heat in Bristolsaid it was ""making us sick,"" and even sitting in the shade was ""tiring and sweaty and uncomfortable"".

According to the Met Office, on Friday the highest temperatures were recorded in: Wiggonholt, West Sussex, at 34.5C Northolt, west London, and Hermonceux West End, East Sussex, at 34.2C Heathrow, west London, at 33.9C Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, at 33.8C Chivenor, Devon, at 33.7C. Over the weekend temperatures could peak at 36C. Met Office chief meteorologist Andy Page said there would be ""increasingly warm nights"" with temperatures not expected to drop below the low 20s in some places in the south. Sir Keir Starmer has accused the government of failing to fully prepare the UK for drought, and also out at the response of water companies. Water firms have been criticised over leaks, with about three billion litres of water lost each day in the UK - between 20% and 24% of the total water supply. The Labour leader said the drought was ""predictable"" but ""as usual we had no plan from the government"". Environment Secretary George Eustice said there was ""no reason for people to be alarmed"". He told BBC News that the UK's water supply ""remains resilient"" and that ""we're in a stronger position than ever"" to withstand droughts, with progress made on leaks and infrastructure to move water between reservoirs. Heatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. Research institute UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) said it would require ""exceptional"" rainfall over the next one to three months to bring river, reservoir and groundwater levels back up to normal. It said analysis showed exceptionally low levels would probably continue until October in southern England and Wales. But scientists have warned bouts of heavy rain after a prolonged period of hot weather can cause flash flooding. Robert Thompson, a professor of Meteorology at the University of Reading, said ""the ground has effectively become like urban concrete"" and will not absorb water quickly enough to cope with longer showers. The situation in the UK is being mirrored across Europe. Much of the continent is baking in record heat, exposing riverbeds and triggering restrictions on water use in many areas. A drought has also hitGermany's Rhine River, where the water is already too low to allow some larger vessels through. Restrictions on usage during hosepipe bans can vary between water providers but generally people are not allowed to use hosepipes or anything that connects to a hosepipe or an outside tap.During a ban, people cannot use a hosepipe to: water a garden or plants fill a paddling or swimming pool clean a car fill a pond clean walls or windows But you can use other water sources, like using your mains water supply but with buckets or watering cans instead of hosepipes, or using stored rainwater from a water butt and there are some exceptions when a hosepipe can be used. Anyone breaking the rules could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. Read morehere. Have you been affected by the hot weather and restrictions?

"This video can not be played Keir Starmer: Boris Johnson is a lame duck prime minister Labour's leader has robustly defended his response to rising energy bills, arguing his party has been ""leading"" on the worsening cost-of-living crisis. Sir Keir Starmer said Labour had already made proposals to lower costs, including taking VAT off energy bills. He called Boris Johnson a ""lame duck"" prime minister who was ""not prepared to do anything"" on soaring living costs. He said Labour would end energy prepayment meters premiums and more policies would follow next week. Some backbench Labour MPs have criticised Sir Keir for being on holiday as the crisis over skyrocketing energy bills - driven by global economic turmoil - deepened this week. When asked about discontent within his party over his response, Sir Keir said Labour had proposed policies such as a windfall tax on the excess profits of oil and gas companies and cutting VAT on energy bills months ago, long before they were on the government's radar. ""For the best part of 12 months, Labour has been absolutely leading on this issue,"" Sir Keir said. ""And I'm very proud of the work we've done."" Labour and other opposition parties have been urging the government to take immediate action on rising living costs, an issue which has dominated the Tory leadership contest. Earlier outgoing Prime Minister Mr Johnson admitted the current help for people struggling with energy bills was not enough, and he expected more money to follow. The government has said it would leave big spending decisions to Mr Johnson's successor - either Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss - when they take office in September. But Mr Johnson, who was forced to resign last month after a cabinet mutiny, said he was ""making sure there is extra cash"" for his successor to provide additional support. Current energy bills support not enough - Johnson How high will my energy bill go? Rishi Sunak vows more support for energy costs Energy bills could go up before October Speaking in Edinburgh, Scotland after retuning to work on Friday, Sir Keir talked about Labour's plan to scrap what he called ""outrageous and immoral"" energy prepayment premiums. Prepayment meters require customers to pay for their energy use in advance, often online, but also from credit bought in convenience stores. Labour says it would eliminate the ""premium"" that means people with prepayment meters, who are often on low incomes, are charged more than those on direct debits. Figures fromenergy regulator Ofgem,externalshow customers using prepayment meters will pay Â£46 more on average annually than those paying standard tariffs via direct debits. With energy bills forecast to soar this winter, the policy is designed to ease the financial burden on the estimated four million domestic customers who use the meters. Labour says its announcement is part of a wider package on the energy crisis that Sir Keir and other senior shadow ministers are planning to unveil in the coming days. ""On Monday, I'm going to be setting out a comprehensive set of proposals a plan for how we handle the upcoming costs in the autumn,"" Sir Keir said. Analysts predict average annual energy bills could rise to over Â£4,200 by January, while the Bank of England has forecast a recession in the UK later this year. But some backbench Labour MPs had expressed frustration at the party's recent response to rising living costs and the state of the economy. ""The scale of this crisis is absolutely huge, and I'm personally not seeing enough being done by my party,"" Zarah Sultana, the MP for Coventry South, told LBC. ""Of course I want the Labour Party to go further."" On Twitter Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary,shared a mocked-up wanted poster,externalwhich said ""missing during the cost of living crisis"" below an image of Sir Keir. Meanwhile, in Sir Keir's absence, cost of living and energy proposals put forward by former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown have been drawing attention. Last week Mr Brown called for an emergency budget before the UK hit a ""financial timebomb"" this autumn. Then,writing in the Guardian,external, he urged the Tory leadership candidates to make ""several urgently needed decisions"". They included cancelling the energy price cap before its expected increase later in August, and bringing energy companies into public ownership ""as a last resort"" if they can not meet certain conditions. Evoking the banking collapse of 2007-08, Mr Brown said the government could ""operate their essential services from the public sector until the crisis is over"". The BBC understands the announcement of Mr Brown's suite of proposals was not co-ordinated with the office of the Labour leader. When asked if Mr Brown's suggestion of nationalising energy companies was out of step with the party's policy, backbench Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ""No, I don't think so."" He said he was not a ""let's-nationalise-everything person"", but added: ""There will be considerable pressure if the energy companies don't act faster, in particular to help poorer customers."" He said commentary on a Labour leader's uptake of policy ideas can be ""a really stultifying process in British politics"". ""Gordon has come up with some good ideas,"" Mr Bryant said. ""It may not be exactly the same hymn that we're singing, but we're certainly signing from the same hymn book.""

"Liz Truss has defended earnings at energy companies amid soaring price rises, saying profits should not be considered ""dirty and evil"". The Tory leadership hopeful said windfall taxes on profits - urged by some to fund help for households - were about ""bashing business"". She said cutting taxes was the best way to help with living costs over winter. But rival Rishi Sunak said millions would be left at risk of destitution without more energy payments. He has proposed spending billions of pounds on further payments to pensioners and the low paid over winter, arguing tax cuts won't help them enough. Mr Sunak has alsowritten in The Times,externalto confirm he would be willing to borrow to fund these costs as a ""last resort"", if they could not be found through ""savings across Whitehall"" or cuts to government spending. Meanwhile Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said new cost-of-living policies will be ""ready to go"" when the new prime minister takes office on 5 September. Speaking on a visit to the Airbus factory in Broughton in north Wales, Mr Zahawi told broadcasters: ""We're looking at all the options of what additional help we need to bring in later on in the winter months."" The BBC has been told one option could include expanding the windfall tax on energy companies. The current windfall tax - also called the energy profits levy - applies only to oil and gas firms, but there has been speculation about extending it to electricity generators. How best to respond to surging energy prices has become a key battleground in the contest to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. Meet the overseas Tories picking the next PM How high will my energy bill go? Rishi Sunak vows more support for energy costs Energy has come to dominate the contest in recent days, after prices wereforecast to riseto more than Â£4,000 per year next year for typical households. Energy companies have posted bumper profits in recent months amid soaring gas and oil prices, prompting calls to tax them further to help with rising bills. Earlier this month, BP reported its biggest quarterly profit in 14 years - $8.45bn (Â£6.9bn) - while Shell posted a record profit of $11.5bn (Â£9bn). When he was chancellor, Mr Sunak introduced a 25% windfall tax to the profits of the oil and gas sector since the end of May. But speaking at a hustings in Cheltenham, Ms Truss said she ""absolutely"" did not support windfall taxes, calling it a ""Labour idea"". ""It's all about bashing business and it sends the wrong message to international investors and to the public,"" the foreign secretary added. A windfall tax is a one-off charge imposed by a government on a company, designed to target firms that have benefited from circumstances they were not responsible for. Asked about public perceptions of record profits, she added: ""I don't think profit is a dirty word, and the fact it's become a dirty word in our society is a massive problem. ""Now, of course, the energy giants, if they're in an oligopoly, should be held to account, and I would make sure they're rigorously held to account. ""But the way we bandy the word around 'profit' (as if) it's something that's dirty and evil, we shouldn't be doing that as Conservatives."" Labour has called for the windfall tax to be backdated a further three months to January, arguing it would raise an extra Â£1.9bn for energy support schemes. The party has suggested it could fund its plan for prepay energy customers to be charged the same as those paying by direct debit. It says thehigher price cap for prepaid gas and electricitycould mean 4.5m households paying Â£184 more than those who pay by direct debit between this October and next March. Labour has said it would align the caps for the two payment methods to stop those on prepayment meters paying ""over the odds"". The party has billed the announcement as the first stage of a winter energy plan it is expected to unveil in the coming days. The Liberal Democrats have also called for the windfall tax to be extended, to pay for their plan toscrap October's expected energy price cap rise. Rishi Sunak says more direct energy payments are needed over the winter Ms Truss's comments come amid increasingly bitter exchanges between the leadership rivals over their respective plans to help people over the winter. The foreign secretary has said her plan to reverse National Insurance rises and scrapping green energy bills will help families and boost the economy. But also speaking at the Cheltenham hustings, Mr Sunak said tax cuts would ""leave millions of incredibly vulnerable people at risk of destitution"". He added that pensioners ""don't have the ability to go out and work more hours"" and were ""already dipping into their savings in retirement"". ""If we don't provide direct support to millions of vulnerable pensioners, it will be a moral failure of this party and the country will never ever forgive us."" He has pledged to make extra payments to vulnerable groups this winter, on top of the Â£15bn package of payments he announced as chancellor in May. Mr Sunak has said he is prepared to borrow to fund his plan, but this can be kept to a minimum through ""efficiency savings"" across government. Writing in The Times, he said the cost looked to be in ""the low to middle billions"", adding: ""But I'm realistic. It could be more."" He said this may mean having make ""tough choices"" to ""stop or pause some things in government"", as supporting people in the coming months ""has to be the first priority"". Mr Sunak said: ""But I will also be honest. If it requires some limited and temporary, one-off borrowing as a last resort to get us through this winter, I'm prepared to do that."" Elsewhere in the debate: Liz Truss said she wanted to see more fracking where supported by local communities, and labelled solar panels on agricultural land ""depressing"" She also ruled out holding a general election before 2024, and said she would review how water regulators operate if she enters No 10 Rishi Sunak said he has messaged and called Boris Johnson since quitting his cabinet, but ""unsurprisingly he hasn't returned my calls"" He also said he was ""very nervous"" about his rival's plan to change the remit of the Bank of England BP sees biggest profit in 14 years as bills soar Shell profits nearly triple as oil prices surge What is the windfall tax on oil and gas firms?

"A drought is officially declared in eight areas of southern, central and eastern England - including Devon and Cornwall, Kent, London and the East Midlands It means water companies can begin announcing stricter measures to conserve supplies Yorkshire Water has announced its first hosepipe ban in 27 years and joins South East, Southern and Welsh Water in enforcing restrictions A four-day extreme heat amber warning is in place for parts of England and Wales, with temperatures forecast to hit 37C (99F) The Met Office is also warning there is an ""exceptional"" risk of fires spreading over the weekend, with some supermarkets removing disposable barbecues from shelves Meanwhile in France, firefighters continue to fight a huge wildfire in the south-west, while low water levels on the Rhine river in Germany are disrupting shipping Edited by Alexandra FouchÃ© We are now ending our live coverage of today's news about the drought in England. Earlier, the government declared that large parts of England were in drought, including Devon and Cornwall, Kent, London and the East Midlands. An extreme heat amber warning is in place for parts of England and Wales, with temperatures forecast to hit 37C (99F) in the next couple of days. There is also a warning of an ""exceptional"" risk of fires. Today's writers were Malu Cursino, Laura Gozzi, James FitzGerald and Emily McGarvey. The page was edited by Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ©.  If news of drought, scorched earth and soaring temperatures has given you climate anxiety, rest assured - you are not alone. But there are some things you can do to alleviate the sense of doom. Scientists who have been working on climate change for years recommend being proactive and channelling your fears into something useful, as well as finding a community of like-minded worriers.

BBC analysis estimates thatsix million people live in places at risk of higher heatduring the summer months. Using satellite data from 4 Earth Intelligence, the BBC mapped how vulnerable postcode areas were to extreme heat in England, Wales and Scotland during periods of hot weather over the past three summers - shown with a heat hazard score. Check here to see if your postcode is vulnerable to extreme heat. The price of potatoes, carrots and other vegetables could increase in the winter as a result of poor growing conditions in the dry weather, according to a Conservative former government minister. ""The situation is very difficult,"" explains Robert Goodwill, who chairs the Commons environment, food and rural affairs select committee. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, he calls on the government to ""concentrate more on food production"" and offer more help to farmers. Goodwill, who himself runs an arable farm in North Yorkshire, says 2022 has probably been the driest year in his agricultural career. Following July's record-breaking heatwave, Londonâs fire commissioner called for a total national ban on disposable barbecues after they were blamed for starting wildfires in England. This was not imposed, but local authorities and event organisers are taking steps to limit the use of disposable barbecues. Boardmasters Festival, which takes place in Cornwall this weekend, has banned them, as have city councils like Nottingham and Birmingham. In Guernsey, where no official ban is in place, the chief fire officer has urged people to take part in a ""voluntary BBQ and bonfire ban"" in the outdoors to cut the number of wildfires. On Thursday, Sainsbury's and Tesco announced they were joining other supermarket chains in removing disposable barbecues from their shop shelves during the current heatwave. Coop followed suit today. Marks and Spencer's, Aldi and Waitrose have already halted sales.  You might be relishing the prospect of showers, which are forecast in some parts of the UK at the start of next week, and it's likely they will be accompanied by a certain scent you might be familiar with. Rain can actually smell appealing after a long period of dry weather - and there's some chemistry involved in the phenomenon. Surprisingly, a fragrance released by bacteria in wet soil can play a significant role. As can the scent of plants and the freshening of air that happens with lightning strikes. Known aspetrichor, the scent has long been chased by scientists and even perfumers for its enduring appeal. Read more about petrichor here. Simon KingBBC weather presenter and meteorologist Rain is in the forecast next week, but it'll be the ""wrong"" kind and could lead to some localised flash flooding and not really alleviate
drought conditions. With low pressure moving in, we'll get showers and
thunderstorms scattered across the UK. The ground however is parched, and
this makes a difference to what happens when the rain hits it. In a
normal summer when the ground is green and moist, water can easily soak into
it. When it is parched and hard, rainfall - especially heavy rain with
thunderstorms - tends to hit the ground and run off. With rainfall running off the surface - in the same way it
does with concrete - it is more likely to produce a flash flood. It also
means that the rainfall is transported quickly into streams and rivers rather
than filtering into the ground where it landed. So rather than scattered heavy showers, the ""right"" kind of
rain we need is from the more persistent and steady type. This gives the
parched ground more time to soak up the rainfall before it disappears into the
nearest drain or river. To go further and alleviate drought conditions we'll need
weeks of rainfall to bring the reservoirs and river levels back up to
normal. This is not in the forecast, however - so there are concerns that
drought issues may persist well into the autumn in some locations. Farmers in Wales say the summer's dry weather has affected crop yields - and even the size of potatoes. This video can not be played Worried farmers say their crop yields are down massively Labour leader Keir Starmer has accused the government of failing to fully prepare the UK for drought, and hit out at the response of water companies. ""Thereâs a familiar pattern here, which is weâve got a government with no strategy,"" Starmer says, in response to the Environment Agency movingeight of its 14 areas in England into drought status. ""This drought, this hot period, was predictable. But, as usual, we had no plan from the government and this is the pattern, this is the character of this government."" He said water companies aren't doing enough to deal with leakages and other water supply issues. ""We saw the sewage going into rivers and I think that some of the regulations should have been better used,"" Starmer told reporters during a visit to Edinburgh. ""I would have liked to have seen much greater fines against those companies that arenât doing what is necessary."" You've been sending us pictures of the drought where you are. Here is a small selection. Parched, dry grass in Swanley Park, Kent Low water levels at Grafham Water in Cambridgeshire - Britainâs third largest reservoir and a site of special scientific interest The pond at Rosebery Park in Epsom, Surrey: ""I have lived in this area all my life, and I've never seen it this dried up,â says photographer Anthony Etches Dried pond at Godstone Green, Surrey John Curtin, executive director for local operations at the Environment Agency, has told the BBC that this has been the South East's driest July since records began in 1891. There was also a drought after the hot summer of 1976, although we are better placed to deal with it today thanks to a modern water infrastructure and a slightly-wetter-than-average winter, he says. Curtin also said the drought announcement showed that ""this is not a normal summer"" and that everyone should be thinking about using water wisely as it ""will probably be an issue for months ahead depending how the winter goes"". ""It will take weeks of rain to stop the drought which is currently affecting parts of England,"" he adds. But how long will the drought last? Curtin said: ""It all depends on the weather, I'm afraid. There will be heavy showers probably Monday, Tuesday next week. But, please, don't think that will stop the drought because... we've lost a week's worth of rain and it'll take weeks of rain. ""We'll need probably average or slightly above average rainfall this autumn into this winter for us to not be a drought next year.""  A comparison of satellite images taken last August and three days ago clearly shows how the area surrounding Cambridge is significantly parched this year: Malu CursinoBBC News Live Reporter As the heatwave continues to sweep England and Wales, we asked dermatologist Dr Adeline Kikam about how extreme heat can impact our skin. She says several skin conditions can develop, or worsen, during persistently high temperatures. Some of those conditions are:  Why? Heat rashes, tiny bumps or blisters in the skin, happen when there is an obstruction in the sweat ducts and inflammation. It's more common during the summer because it's triggered by heat and humidity. Dr Kikam says high temperatures can worsen or aggravateeczema. High temperatures lead to increased sweating, which in turn can make the skin even drier and the salt residue from the sweat can cause inflammation in the skin. This combination leads to redness, and general discomfort. Increased spots and breakoutsare common during high temperatures because there's an excess secretion of oil from our sebaceous glands. This combined with sweating and products like make-up can clog your pores and trap dirt in the skin. Sunburnsare the result of long exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. If you have darker skin, and therefore more melanin, your body has a base protective layer to UV radiation and it might take longer to notice the symptoms of sunburn (redness and blisters). ""Damage to the skin is just not as visible, but you're still getting the damage,"" Dr Kikam says. What should you do? For those suffering fromheat rashes, Dr Kikam says patients should remove themselves from hot and humid environments when possible and ensure they have access to good ventilation, by using fans and air conditioner - and keep the affected area of the skin dry. The same goes forchafing:wearing loose clothing, ensuring your skin is dry and avoiding friction are the best ways to avoid it. However, for those suffering from aggravatedeczema, it is important to keep your skin moisturised with neutral lotions. Forsunburns, Dr Kikam says everyone should ensure they're wearing sunscreen to protect themselves from exposure to UV radiation and protecting themselves from direct sun exposure for long periods of time. Regularly cleansing your skin ensures you can minimise your risk of havingbreakouts, as you are avoiding product build up and keeping your pores unclogged. Listen tothe latest episode of Newscast, which features an interview with the head of Environment Agency, Sir James Bevan, about the impact of the recent dry
weather and soaring temperatures - plus BBC experts discuss how the
hot conditions will affect crops and agriculture, and when we can expect some
rain. Justin RowlattBBC Climate editor Farmers are demanding ministers ensure water supplies for
farmers are given the same priority as those for the environment. Supporting food production is not part of the remit of the
Environment Agency, which determines where much of the countryâs water supplies
go, warns Tom Bradshaw, the deputy president of the National Farmers Union
(NFU). ""That has to change to protect food supplies,"" he says
and suggests government ministers may need to bring in new rules. ""Farmers recognise the importance of protecting the
environment but food production needs to be given equal status,"" he told
the BBC. The demand comes as farms in England and parts of Wales face
serious water shortages. Testimony from the NFU formed a key part of the
evidence which persuaded the government to put much of England in drought. Half the countryâs potato crop cannot be irrigated so is very vulnerable
to drought, the meeting of the National Drought Group, which met this morning,
was told. The NFU warned ""irrigation options are diminishing with
reservoirs being emptied fast"". It said farmers are expecting losses of
between 10% and 50% for crops including carrots, onions, sugar beet, apples and
hops. Farmers would normally be planting their rapeseed crop at this
time of year. But, says Bradshaw, conditions are so bad at the moment very few
farmers are likely to plant the crop. If you're at a Coldplay gig during the heatwave, you'll want to avoid getting a Rush of Blood to the Head.

She also accuses governments across the world of ""handing out billions to fossil fuel giants, subsidising their reckless profiteering, including in the UK where our government continues to offer lucrative 'investment incentives'"": We urgently need to turn away from fossil fuels and towards the clean, green energy of the future, which is the only way to bring down global temperatures and tackle the cost of living crisis.  Renewables are now at least four times cheaper than fossil fuels so a shift toward green energy is not only good for the climate but an economic necessity. Governments need to decide whose side they're on."" Ami McCarthy Researchers at the University of Reading have been investigating how long it will take water to get through parched soil - which has baked dry due to the high temperatures and low rainfall. Although we are currently in the middle of a four-day heatwave, theMet Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms,externalfor much of the UK, beginning in Scotland and Northern Ireland from Sunday afternoon. As the hot weather subsides in the north, the change brings with it the risk of some intense thundery downpours and the chance of some surface water flooding. Allow Twitter content?

"The UK economy shrank between April and June as experts forecast a gloomy outlook with recession on the horizon. The economy contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter of the year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. This was partly due to Covid schemes like Test and Trace ending, retail sales falling and the Queen's Platinum Jubilee bank holiday in June, it said. The Bank of England has forecast the UK will fall into recession towards the end of the year as energy costs soar. Despite shrinking between April and June, the UK economy avoided recession because gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.8% in the first three months of this year. What is GDP and how does it affect me? A recession is defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods. Up until now most economists - and the Bank of England - did not expect a recession to begin until the final three months of 2022. Many expected a small rebound in economic growth between July and September. But the latest figures from the ONS have prompted some experts to warn that recession could come sooner than they had initially thought. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said it expected the UK economy to continue falling over the next three quarters. Capital Economics said there was now a greater risk that the economy will shrink by 0.2% between July and September before worsening. But investment bank Goldman Sachs still predicted growth of 0.4% in the third quarter of 2022. A spokesperson said: ""We had previously assumed a sharp bounce back in July but now expect a more muted rebound."" HSBC's forecast was more positive, it said: ""If the UK is going into recession, then we don't think this is the start of it."" ""We still expect a bounce back in July - the reversal of the bank holiday effect - to set the UK up for a positive Q3, as does the Bank of England,"" it added. Kingdom Thenga says it already feels like the UK is in recession Kingdom Thenga, who owns a number of local bars and restaurants in Chester, says for him, it already feels like the UK is in a recession. ""I think we are not too far away from it because of the consistent blows we're getting from energy bills, from people not going out, to the cost of living, it just seems that's where we're heading,"" he said. He says his business is currently ""in survival mode"". ""It's not about making money, it's not about trying to expand or trying to grow our business, it's just about stabilising the business especially after the pandemic over the last two years,"" he told the BBC. Mr Thenga says the biggest issue he's facing is rising costs - with everything from poultry to vegetable oil soaring in price - while the amount of money his customers have in their pockets is going down. ""Energy bills are ridiculous, the cost of fuel is ridiculous and I appreciate people don't necessarily have the money or can't spend what they used to, because everyone is so worried about what the bills are going to be,"" he says. What is a recession and what could mean for me? The UK is facing the worst rate of price rises - or inflation - in 40 years as energy costs continue to soar. Commenting on the 0.1% contraction between April and June, the ONS said that the biggest contributor was from ""human health and social work activities"" as Covid test and trace and vaccination programmes were wound down. There was also a fall in retail sales volumes. However, it said areas such as tourism, bars and entertainment showed strong growth. ""Health was the biggest reason the economy contracted as both the test and trace and vaccine programmes were wound down, while many retailers also had a tough quarter,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""These were partially offset by growth in hotels, bars, hairdressers and outdoor events across the quarter, partly as a result of people celebrating the Platinum Jubilee."" This included rises in mobile food stands and takeaway food shops. The ONS said that in June alone the economy shrank by 0.6% in June due to the extra bank holiday to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. However, that figure was much better than the 1.3% fall predicted by economists. The ONS said that while the bank holiday impacted on monthly GDP, it had ""little impact"" on the quarterly figure. The Chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, told the BBC that these are ""challenging times"". ""What the numbers show today is that the contraction is partly because of some of the Covid activities reducing but also real resilience in the private sector which actually in many ways bodes well... But nevertheless these are challenging times,"" he said. But Labour accused the Conservatives of ""losing control of the economy"". Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""With the Bank of England forecasting a recession lasting the whole of next year, the Conservative leadership contenders need to stop playing to the gallery and start coming up with a serious plan to get Britain's economy back on track."" A big part of the drop in Gross Domestic Product in June was because of the Platinum Jubilee - which meant two fewer working days of producing goods and services, in contrast to May, which had one additional working day. It was always expected that that would magnify the downswing from May to June and economists expected a sharper drop in activity. The 0.1% drop over the three months from April to June was only half as bad as some economists thought. Nevertheless, given the backdrop of the global squeeze on incomes due to soaring energy prices, no-one can say this drop in activity is just a blip. The squeeze on the hard-pressed consumer is tightening its grip, with activity in consumer-facing services down by 4.9% compared to before the pandemic. And with France, Italy and Canada seeing growth, no-one can say this is a stellar economic performance. All in all, it's not yet the recession the Bank of England has forecast: more a precursor.

"Co-op is to temporarily stop selling disposable barbecues in all its stores because of the heatwave. It joins other supermarket chains, including Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco, which have dropped the product during the current dry weather. Fire brigades have warned of the risk of blazes in ""tinderbox conditions"". The Met Office's fire severity index, which assesses how severe a blaze could become, is currently ""very high"" for most of England and Wales. On Friday, parts of south-west, southern, central and eastern England were moved to drought status. Soaring temperatures prompt wildfire warnings Is your postcode area vulnerable to high heat? Flames faster than you can run - firefighters on wildfires Last year, Co-op removed disposable barbecues from its stores within one mile of national parks to help prevent wildfires. On Friday the supermarket said in a statement: ""As a precautionary measure due to the extreme hot weather, we've removed instant BBQs from sale in all Co-op stores until further notice."" Morrisons made a similar announcement earlier in the day, saying: ""In light of the long dry spell in the UK this summer we are temporarily removing disposable barbecues from all stores until further notice."" It comes after it said it would stop selling the items in its stores near national parks in March. Sainsbury's said its policy was a precautionary measure, but did not say how long it would continue. Tesco said the move was temporary and once weather conditions allow, disposable barbecues will be made available again. Last week, Marks and Spencer said it wanted to ""help protect open spaces and reduce the risk of fires""by removing the single use portable barbecues from sale, while Ocado also took the same step. Aldi and Waitrose had already stopped sales back in March, due to the burden on the environment more generally, including the impact of the single use plastic, metal and card. Co-op says it does not sell disposable barbecues close to UK national parks. The UK is in the middle of its second heatwave this summer. In July temperatures broke records, rising above 40C and are forecast to hit 37C (99F) again in some parts of the UK over the next four days. Fire services are warning of ""tinderbox conditions"" and have asked people not to use barbecues in high risk places, such as balconies and on dry grass, after a steep increase in the number of call-outs.

"Liz Truss has defended earnings at energy companies amid soaring price rises, saying profits should not be considered ""dirty and evil"". The Tory leadership hopeful said windfall taxes on profits - urged by some to fund help for households - were about ""bashing business"". She said cutting taxes was the best way to help with living costs over winter. But rival Rishi Sunak said millions would be left at risk of destitution without more energy payments. He has proposed spending billions of pounds on further payments to pensioners and the low paid over winter, arguing tax cuts won't help them enough. Mr Sunak has alsowritten in The Times,externalto confirm he would be willing to borrow to fund these costs as a ""last resort"", if they could not be found through ""savings across Whitehall"" or cuts to government spending. Meanwhile Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said new cost-of-living policies will be ""ready to go"" when the new prime minister takes office on 5 September. Speaking on a visit to the Airbus factory in Broughton in north Wales, Mr Zahawi told broadcasters: ""We're looking at all the options of what additional help we need to bring in later on in the winter months."" The BBC has been told one option could include expanding the windfall tax on energy companies. The current windfall tax - also called the energy profits levy - applies only to oil and gas firms, but there has been speculation about extending it to electricity generators. How best to respond to surging energy prices has become a key battleground in the contest to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. Meet the overseas Tories picking the next PM How high will my energy bill go? Rishi Sunak vows more support for energy costs Energy has come to dominate the contest in recent days, after prices wereforecast to riseto more than Â£4,000 per year next year for typical households. Energy companies have posted bumper profits in recent months amid soaring gas and oil prices, prompting calls to tax them further to help with rising bills. Earlier this month, BP reported its biggest quarterly profit in 14 years - $8.45bn (Â£6.9bn) - while Shell posted a record profit of $11.5bn (Â£9bn). When he was chancellor, Mr Sunak introduced a 25% windfall tax to the profits of the oil and gas sector since the end of May. But speaking at a hustings in Cheltenham, Ms Truss said she ""absolutely"" did not support windfall taxes, calling it a ""Labour idea"". ""It's all about bashing business and it sends the wrong message to international investors and to the public,"" the foreign secretary added. A windfall tax is a one-off charge imposed by a government on a company, designed to target firms that have benefited from circumstances they were not responsible for. Asked about public perceptions of record profits, she added: ""I don't think profit is a dirty word, and the fact it's become a dirty word in our society is a massive problem. ""Now, of course, the energy giants, if they're in an oligopoly, should be held to account, and I would make sure they're rigorously held to account. ""But the way we bandy the word around 'profit' (as if) it's something that's dirty and evil, we shouldn't be doing that as Conservatives."" Labour has called for the windfall tax to be backdated a further three months to January, arguing it would raise an extra Â£1.9bn for energy support schemes. The party has suggested it could fund its plan for prepay energy customers to be charged the same as those paying by direct debit. It says thehigher price cap for prepaid gas and electricitycould mean 4.5m households paying Â£184 more than those who pay by direct debit between this October and next March. Labour has said it would align the caps for the two payment methods to stop those on prepayment meters paying ""over the odds"". The party has billed the announcement as the first stage of a winter energy plan it is expected to unveil in the coming days. The Liberal Democrats have also called for the windfall tax to be extended, to pay for their plan toscrap October's expected energy price cap rise. Rishi Sunak says more direct energy payments are needed over the winter Ms Truss's comments come amid increasingly bitter exchanges between the leadership rivals over their respective plans to help people over the winter. The foreign secretary has said her plan to reverse National Insurance rises and scrapping green energy bills will help families and boost the economy. But also speaking at the Cheltenham hustings, Mr Sunak said tax cuts would ""leave millions of incredibly vulnerable people at risk of destitution"". He added that pensioners ""don't have the ability to go out and work more hours"" and were ""already dipping into their savings in retirement"". ""If we don't provide direct support to millions of vulnerable pensioners, it will be a moral failure of this party and the country will never ever forgive us."" He has pledged to make extra payments to vulnerable groups this winter, on top of the Â£15bn package of payments he announced as chancellor in May. Mr Sunak has said he is prepared to borrow to fund his plan, but this can be kept to a minimum through ""efficiency savings"" across government. Writing in The Times, he said the cost looked to be in ""the low to middle billions"", adding: ""But I'm realistic. It could be more."" He said this may mean having make ""tough choices"" to ""stop or pause some things in government"", as supporting people in the coming months ""has to be the first priority"". Mr Sunak said: ""But I will also be honest. If it requires some limited and temporary, one-off borrowing as a last resort to get us through this winter, I'm prepared to do that."" Elsewhere in the debate: Liz Truss said she wanted to see more fracking where supported by local communities, and labelled solar panels on agricultural land ""depressing"" She also ruled out holding a general election before 2024, and said she would review how water regulators operate if she enters No 10 Rishi Sunak said he has messaged and called Boris Johnson since quitting his cabinet, but ""unsurprisingly he hasn't returned my calls"" He also said he was ""very nervous"" about his rival's plan to change the remit of the Bank of England BP sees biggest profit in 14 years as bills soar Shell profits nearly triple as oil prices surge What is the windfall tax on oil and gas firms?

"This video can not be played ""I'm sticking it out"" - last resident of housing estate earmarked for demolition The last resident of a housing estate due to be demolished has said the council will need to double its offer to get him to leave. Nick Wisniewski has had no neighbours in his block on the Gowkthrapple housing estate in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, since December. The 66-year-old wants at least Â£80,000 so he can afford to buy a new flat. But North Lanarkshire Council said they could not pay Mr Wisniewski more than the property was worth. The retired bank worker bought the flat in Stanhope Place several years ago under the Right to Buy scheme, which helped council tenants buy their homes at discounted rates. The schemehas since been closed in Scotland. The block on the Gowkthrapple estate in Wishaw is due to be demolished as part of a redevelopment ""I've been here for 21 years and I'm settled,"" Mr Wisniewski told BBC Scotland. ""I've looked at prices of houses round about. For a two-bedroom flat you're talking anything between Â£80,000 to Â£100,000. ""I finished up with the bank, I took my redundancy. But I'm not prepared to make myself skint because of North Lanarkshire Council."" Mr Wisniewski said the council had offered him Â£35,000 for his flat, along with two years' of free rent at a new council property. The authority isplanning to redevelop the whole Gowkthrapple estate,external, replacing ""ageing"" housing and creating an ""attractive and well-connected new neighbourhood"". Work on other parts of the estate has already begun. Mr Wisniewski told BBC Scotland he was not willing to move into a new rented council property, but wanted to buy a new place. Mr Wisniewski told the BBC he was prepared to stick it out ""as long as it takes"" ""I'm too old for this,"" he said. ""I don't want a lot of hassle in my life, I just want to take it easy."" ""That's why I would prefer to just move out and into somewhere I could buy."" He said he had not heard from North Lanarkshire Council since last November and had been waiting to hear from the authority with an improved offer. ""If they gave me Â£35,000, I could easily put Â£20,000 to it which is not nearly enough. So really they need to double their offer for me to get something decent,"" he said. ""A lot of people would say I'd be better to go - but I'm sticking it out because I have in my mind what I'm looking for. I'm looking for something better and I'm not going to get that only having Â£35,000 from the council."" North Lanarkshire Council is planning to pursue a compulsory purchase order on the property but said its door ""remains open"" to Mr Wisniewski for further talks. A council spokesperson said: ""We have been in dialogue with the owner for several years about this issue and although we understand that there is a personal connection to the property, we simply cannot pay more for the property than it is worth. ""If the owner feels that the value he has been offered doesn't reflect the market value then there are ways for a valuation to be negotiated on his behalf. ""We are keen to resolve this matter to ensure that he receives a fair deal and to support him to find alternative accommodation. We have discussed the option of other suitable places for him to stay, but he has refused each of them."" Mr Wisniewski said he was open to further discussions, but planned to stick it out in his flat ""as long as it takes"". ""I reckon the council is going to make a lot of money out of it [the development] at the end of the day, so why not give me more?"" he added.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Energy bill support is not enough Boris Johnson has admitted the current help for people struggling with energy bills is not enough, and said he expects more money to follow. Mr Johnson will step down as PM in September, but said he was ""making sure there is extra cash"" for his successor to provide additional support. He also said people were starting to receive the money which the government announced earlier in the year. The topic of rising bills has come to dominate the Tory leadership contest. The two candidates to replace Mr Johnson have set out differing strategies on how they would respond to the cost of living crisis. Liz Truss has argued that cutting taxes is the best way to help struggling households. Rishi Sunak has proposed spending billions of pounds on further payments to pensioners and people on low incomes, contending tax cuts will not help them enough. Energy profits are not evil, says Liz Truss How high will my energy bill go? How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? Elsewhere Labourhas set out its own proposalsincluding a plan to ensure pre-pay energy customers are charged the same as those paying by direct debit - a move they say would benefit four million people. Speaking in Edinburgh, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""outrageous and immoral"" that the poorest people on pre-payment meters paid more for their energy bills. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also called for the government to raise money by backdating the windfall tax on energy companies. Speaking at a hustings in Cheltenham, Ms Truss said she ""absolutely"" did not support windfall taxes, arguing it was ""all about bashing business"". Mr Johnson has made it clear that he thinks further support will be needed from whoever succeeds him at the start of September. But he isn't going to make that decision himself and several government figures have made it clear the big decisions can not be taken by the outgoing regime. The lack of immediate action infuriates people like Martin Lewis, the money saving expert, and angers some opposition politicians too, who say the scale of the energy crisis is such that the government can't wait a month to decide what it's going to do. But whatever options are suggested by the opposition or left on the table by the current government, it looks increasingly clear that concrete decisions are going to have to wait. Not least because the two people who could be making them - Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss - sharply disagree. Conservative members are weighing up which they prefer. But while they decide, decisions over help with the cost of living look like they are going to have to wait. Read more from Nick here. Last weekforecasts suggestedthat energy bills could rise to more than Â£4,000 per year next year for typical households. Earlier this year the government announced a Â£15bn package including a Â£400 energy bill discount for every household. Asked by reporters if this was enough, Mr Johnson said: ""No"", adding: ""What we're doing... is trying to make sure that by October, by January, there is further support"". ""I'm not going to pretend that things are easy for people right now, but there's more money coming anyway as a result of the decisions we've taken. ""I think over the medium term, the future's very bright."" He also argued that the price of energy would be brought down in the longer term by the government's investment in nuclear power and renewables.

"Johnson & Johnson (J&J) will stop making and selling its talc-based baby powder around the world from next year. The announcement comes more than two years after the healthcare giant ended sales of the product in the US. J&J faces tens of thousands of lawsuits from women who allege its talcum powder contained asbestos and caused them to develop ovarian cancer. But the company reiterated its view that decades of independent research shows the product is safe to use. ""As part of a worldwide portfolio assessment, we have made the commercial decision to transition to an all cornstarch-based baby powder portfolio,""it said in a statement,external. The firm added that cornstarch-based baby powder is already sold in countries around the world. At the same time J&J reiterated its position that its baby powder is safe to use: ""Our position on the safety of our cosmetic talc remains unchanged."" ""We stand firmly behind the decades of independent scientific analysis by medical experts around the world that confirms talc-based Johnson's baby powder is safe, does not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer,"" it said. US court rejects J&J talc cancer case appeal J&J to sell baby powder in UK despite US stoppage Asbestos discovery triggers US baby powder recall In 2020, J&J said it would stop selling its talc baby powder in the US and Canadabecause demand had fallen in the wake of what it called ""misinformation"" about the product's safety amid a number of legal cases. At the time the firm said it would continue to sell its talc-based baby powder in the UK and the rest of the world. The company faces lawsuits from consumers and their survivors who claim J&J's talc products caused cancer due to contamination with asbestos. Talc is mined from the earth and is found in seams close to that of asbestos, which is a material known to cause cancer. A 2018 investigation by the Reuters news agency claimed that J&J knew for decades that asbestos was present in its talc products. Reuters said that internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence showed that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Energy bill support is not enough Boris Johnson has admitted the current help for people struggling with energy bills is not enough, and said he expects more money to follow. Mr Johnson will step down as PM in September, but said he was ""making sure there is extra cash"" for his successor to provide additional support. He also said people were starting to receive the money which the government announced earlier in the year. The topic of rising bills has come to dominate the Tory leadership contest. The two candidates to replace Mr Johnson have set out differing strategies on how they would respond to the cost of living crisis. Liz Truss has argued that cutting taxes is the best way to help struggling households.

Speaking in Edinburgh, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""outrageous and immoral"" that the poorest people on pre-payment meters paid more for their energy bills. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also called for the government to raise money by backdating the windfall tax on energy companies.

The lack of immediate action infuriates people like Martin Lewis, the money saving expert, and angers some opposition politicians too, who say the scale of the energy crisis is such that the government can't wait a month to decide what it's going to do. But whatever options are suggested by the opposition or left on the table by the current government, it looks increasingly clear that concrete decisions are going to have to wait. Not least because the two people who could be making them - Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss - sharply disagree. Conservative members are weighing up which they prefer.

"Johnson & Johnson (J&J) will stop making and selling its talc-based baby powder around the world from next year. The announcement comes more than two years after the healthcare giant ended sales of the product in the US. J&J faces tens of thousands of lawsuits from women who allege its talcum powder contained asbestos and caused them to develop ovarian cancer. But the company reiterated its view that decades of independent research shows the product is safe to use. ""As part of a worldwide portfolio assessment, we have made the commercial decision to transition to an all cornstarch-based baby powder portfolio,""it said in a statement,external. The firm added that cornstarch-based baby powder is already sold in countries around the world. At the same time J&J reiterated its position that its baby powder is safe to use: ""Our position on the safety of our cosmetic talc remains unchanged."" ""We stand firmly behind the decades of independent scientific analysis by medical experts around the world that confirms talc-based Johnson's baby powder is safe, does not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer,"" it said. US court rejects J&J talc cancer case appeal J&J to sell baby powder in UK despite US stoppage Asbestos discovery triggers US baby powder recall In 2020, J&J said it would stop selling its talc baby powder in the US and Canadabecause demand had fallen in the wake of what it called ""misinformation"" about the product's safety amid a number of legal cases. At the time the firm said it would continue to sell its talc-based baby powder in the UK and the rest of the world. The company faces lawsuits from consumers and their survivors who claim J&J's talc products caused cancer due to contamination with asbestos. Talc is mined from the earth and is found in seams close to that of asbestos, which is a material known to cause cancer. A 2018 investigation by the Reuters news agency claimed that J&J knew for decades that asbestos was present in its talc products. Reuters said that internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence showed that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. In response to evidence of asbestos contamination presented in court rooms, media reports and to US lawmakers, the firm has repeatedly denied the allegations. In October, J&J created a subsidiary, LTL Management, assigning its talc claims to it. It later placed it into bankruptcy, which paused the pending lawsuits.

"An official drought has been declared as low-water levels and tinder-dry conditions continue across the UK. Eight parts of England, including Devon, Kent, East Anglia and Lincolnshire are affected. The move is expected to trigger stricter controls on water use and five water companies have already announced restrictions, including hosepipe bans. Millions are expected to be impacted but the Environment Agency said essential water supplies were safe. John Curtin, director of operations, said the drought would go on for ""a long time"" and warned of possible restrictions on crop growing and further hosepipe bans. It comes as the prolonged dry weather - combined with the current heatwave and July's record-breaking temperatures - have depleted rivers, reservoirs and aquifers. Large swathes of England are bone-dry, with scenes of parched earth and grass turned yellow. The conditions have prompted the Environment Agency to move eight of its 14 areas into drought status: Devon and Cornwall Solent and South Downs Kent and South London Hertfordshire and North London East Anglia Thames Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire East Midlands Yorkshire and the West Midlands are also expected to move into a drought later in August. The decision to declare a drought was taken after a meeting of the National Drought Group - made up of government and agency officials, water firms and groups including the National Farmers' Union. Announcing a drought means government and water companies will put into action their plans to deal with it, with measures including hosepipe bans and taking more water than usual from rivers. Members of the public and businesses in drought-affected areas are also being urged to use water wisely followingthe driest first seven months of the year since 1976. Elsewhere, Wales Drought Liaison group is also looking at the effect of the dry weather. LIVE UPDATES: Drought to be declared Will there be a hosepipe ban in my area? Flames faster than you can run - firefighters on wildfires The science of drought explained in pictures Five water companies - Welsh Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, South East Water and, most recently Yorkshire Water - have all announced hosepipe bans, whileYorkshire Water said on Friday that a banwould start on 26 August. The latter firm, which has more than five million customers, says parts of the region have seen the lowest rainfall since records began more than 130 years ago. It also said rivers and reservoirs in the region were running at 20% lower than expected for the time of year. South East Water, whose ban came into force on Friday, is now asking people to observe restrictions on using hosepipes to water plants, wash the car and fill paddling pools - with rule-breakers facing fines of up to Â£1,000. What are water companies doing to tackle leaks? How the heatwave is changing landscapes The driest start to a year since 1976 Dominic Gardener, a farmer in West Sussex, said the dry weather was posing huge challenges for farmers. ""Everything is starting to struggle a bit - our grass is not growing at all - and livestock, we're having to feed them extra food,"" he said, adding crop yields had also been reduced by the dryness. Farmers in parts of Fife are beingtemporarily banned from using waterfrom the River Eden on their fields. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency says the measure will come into effect from midnight on Saturday to tackle critical water shortages. Afour-day amber warning for extreme heatfrom the Met Office is in place for many parts of England and Wales until Sunday. Temperatures are forecast to be lower early next week, however, and the Met Office has issued yellow warnings for thunderstorms on Monday, covering most of England, Wales and Scotland. And its fire severity index - which assesses how severe a blaze could become - is currently ""very high"" for most of England and Wales. The situation facing firefighters across the UK has been described as ""unprecedented"",with increasing numbers of wildfires. Fires have broken out across the nation, including in Leytonstone, east London, Studland Bay, Dorset,Creswell, in Derbyshire,The Dower House in Bristol, and Overton, near Basingstoke in Hampshire. Police have evacuated about 50 homes in Creswell after a major incident was declared due to a field fire. Fire crews are also tackling a large blaze whichbroke out at a Leicestershire recycling centre. Meanwhile, homeless peoplestruggling with the extreme heat in Bristolsaid it was ""making us sick,"" and even sitting in the shade was ""tiring and sweaty and uncomfortable"". Bristol Street Outreach Team, operated by charity St Mungo's, has been carrying out additional shifts and giving out water, advice and sun protection to those in need. This video can not be played Watch latest UK weather forecast: Amber heat warning in force UK temperatures have been rising day-on-day through the week. According to the Met Office, on Friday the highest temperatures were recorded in: Wiggonholt, West Sussex, at 34.5C Northolt, west London, and Hermonceux West End, East Sussex, at 34.2C Heathrow, west London, at 33.9C Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, at 33.8C Chivenor, Devon, at 33.7C. Over the weekend temperatures could peak at 36C. Met Office chief meteorologist Andy Page said there would be ""increasingly warm nights"" with temperatures not expected to drop below the low 20s in some places in the south. Sir Keir Starmer has accused the government of failing to fully prepare the UK for drought, and also out at the response of water companies. Water firms have been criticised over leaks, with about three billion litres of water lost each day in the UK - between 20% and 24% of the total water supply. The Labour leader said the drought was ""predictable"" but ""as usual we had no plan from the government"". Environment Secretary George Eustice said there was ""no reason for people to be alarmed"". He told BBC News that the UK's water supply ""remains resilient"" and that ""we're in a stronger position than ever"" to withstand droughts, with progress made on leaks and infrastructure to move water between reservoirs. Heatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. Research institute UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) said it would require ""exceptional"" rainfall over the next one to three months to bring river, reservoir and groundwater levels back up to normal. It said analysis showed exceptionally low levels would probably continue until October in southern England and Wales. But scientists have warned bouts of heavy rain after a prolonged period of hot weather can cause flash flooding. Robert Thompson, a professor of Meteorology at the University of Reading, said ""the ground has effectively become like urban concrete"" and will not absorb water quickly enough to cope with longer showers. The situation in the UK is being mirrored across Europe. Much of the continent is baking in record heat, exposing riverbeds and triggering restrictions on water use in many areas. A drought has also hitGermany's Rhine River, where the water is already too low to allow some larger vessels through. Restrictions on usage during hosepipe bans can vary between water providers but generally people are not allowed to use hosepipes or anything that connects to a hosepipe or an outside tap.During a ban, people cannot use a hosepipe to: water a garden or plants fill a paddling or swimming pool clean a car fill a pond clean walls or windows But you can use other water sources, like using your mains water supply but with buckets or watering cans instead of hosepipes, or using stored rainwater from a water butt and there are some exceptions when a hosepipe can be used. Anyone breaking the rules could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. Read morehere. Have you been affected by the hot weather and restrictions?

"The UK economy shrank between April and June as experts forecast a gloomy outlook with recession on the horizon. The economy contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter of the year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. This was partly due to Covid schemes like Test and Trace ending, retail sales falling and the Queen's Platinum Jubilee bank holiday in June, it said. The Bank of England has forecast the UK will fall into recession towards the end of the year as energy costs soar. Despite shrinking between April and June, the UK economy avoided recession because gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.8% in the first three months of this year. What is GDP and how does it affect me? A recession is defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods. Up until now most economists - and the Bank of England - did not expect a recession to begin until the final three months of 2022. Many expected a small rebound in economic growth between July and September. But the latest figures from the ONS have prompted some experts to warn that recession could come sooner than they had initially thought. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said it expected the UK economy to continue falling over the next three quarters. Capital Economics said there was now a greater risk that the economy will shrink by 0.2% between July and September before worsening. But investment bank Goldman Sachs still predicted growth of 0.4% in the third quarter of 2022. A spokesperson said: ""We had previously assumed a sharp bounce back in July but now expect a more muted rebound."" HSBC's forecast was more positive, it said: ""If the UK is going into recession, then we don't think this is the start of it."" ""We still expect a bounce back in July - the reversal of the bank holiday effect - to set the UK up for a positive Q3, as does the Bank of England,"" it added. Kingdom Thenga says it already feels like the UK is in recession Kingdom Thenga, who owns a number of local bars and restaurants in Chester, says for him, it already feels like the UK is in a recession. ""I think we are not too far away from it because of the consistent blows we're getting from energy bills, from people not going out, to the cost of living, it just seems that's where we're heading,"" he said. He says his business is currently ""in survival mode"". ""It's not about making money, it's not about trying to expand or trying to grow our business, it's just about stabilising the business especially after the pandemic over the last two years,"" he told the BBC. Mr Thenga says the biggest issue he's facing is rising costs - with everything from poultry to vegetable oil soaring in price - while the amount of money his customers have in their pockets is going down. ""Energy bills are ridiculous, the cost of fuel is ridiculous and I appreciate people don't necessarily have the money or can't spend what they used to, because everyone is so worried about what the bills are going to be,"" he says. What is a recession and what could mean for me? The UK is facing the worst rate of price rises - or inflation - in 40 years as energy costs continue to soar. Commenting on the 0.1% contraction between April and June, the ONS said that the biggest contributor was from ""human health and social work activities"" as Covid test and trace and vaccination programmes were wound down. There was also a fall in retail sales volumes. However, it said areas such as tourism, bars and entertainment showed strong growth. ""Health was the biggest reason the economy contracted as both the test and trace and vaccine programmes were wound down, while many retailers also had a tough quarter,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""These were partially offset by growth in hotels, bars, hairdressers and outdoor events across the quarter, partly as a result of people celebrating the Platinum Jubilee."" This included rises in mobile food stands and takeaway food shops. The ONS said that in June alone the economy shrank by 0.6% in June due to the extra bank holiday to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. However, that figure was much better than the 1.3% fall predicted by economists. The ONS said that while the bank holiday impacted on monthly GDP, it had ""little impact"" on the quarterly figure. The Chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, told the BBC that these are ""challenging times"". ""What the numbers show today is that the contraction is partly because of some of the Covid activities reducing but also real resilience in the private sector which actually in many ways bodes well... But nevertheless these are challenging times,"" he said. But Labour accused the Conservatives of ""losing control of the economy"". Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""With the Bank of England forecasting a recession lasting the whole of next year, the Conservative leadership contenders need to stop playing to the gallery and start coming up with a serious plan to get Britain's economy back on track."" A big part of the drop in Gross Domestic Product in June was because of the Platinum Jubilee - which meant two fewer working days of producing goods and services, in contrast to May, which had one additional working day. It was always expected that that would magnify the downswing from May to June and economists expected a sharper drop in activity. The 0.1% drop over the three months from April to June was only half as bad as some economists thought. Nevertheless, given the backdrop of the global squeeze on incomes due to soaring energy prices, no-one can say this drop in activity is just a blip. The squeeze on the hard-pressed consumer is tightening its grip, with activity in consumer-facing services down by 4.9% compared to before the pandemic. And with France, Italy and Canada seeing growth, no-one can say this is a stellar economic performance. All in all, it's not yet the recession the Bank of England has forecast: more a precursor.

""As part of a worldwide portfolio assessment, we have made the commercial decision to transition to an all cornstarch-based baby powder portfolio,""it said in a statement,external. The firm added that cornstarch-based baby powder is already sold in countries around the world. At the same time J&J reiterated its position that its baby powder is safe to use: ""Our position on the safety of our cosmetic talc remains unchanged."" ""We stand firmly behind the decades of independent scientific analysis by medical experts around the world that confirms talc-based Johnson's baby powder is safe, does not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer,"" it said. US court rejects J&J talc cancer case appeal J&J to sell baby powder in UK despite US stoppage Asbestos discovery triggers US baby powder recall In 2020, J&J said it would stop selling its talc baby powder in the US and Canadabecause demand had fallen in the wake of what it called ""misinformation"" about the product's safety amid a number of legal cases. At the time the firm said it would continue to sell its talc-based baby powder in the UK and the rest of the world. The company faces lawsuits from consumers and their survivors who claim J&J's talc products caused cancer due to contamination with asbestos. Talc is mined from the earth and is found in seams close to that of asbestos, which is a material known to cause cancer. A 2018 investigation by the Reuters news agency claimed that J&J knew for decades that asbestos was present in its talc products. Reuters said that internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence showed that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. In response to evidence of asbestos contamination presented in court rooms, media reports and to US lawmakers, the firm has repeatedly denied the allegations. In October, J&J created a subsidiary, LTL Management, assigning its talc claims to it. It later placed it into bankruptcy, which paused the pending lawsuits. Before the bankruptcy filing, the company faced costs from $3.5bn (Â£2.87bn) in verdicts and settlements, including one in which 22 women were awarded a judgement of more than $2bn. In April, a shareholder proposal calling for an end to global sales of the talc baby powder failed. Johnson's Baby Powder has been been sold for almost 130 years and became a symbol of the company's family-friendly image. Baby powder is used for preventing nappy rash and for cosmetic uses, including as a dry shampoo.

"The UK economy shrank between April and June as experts forecast a gloomy outlook with recession on the horizon. The economy contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter of the year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. This was partly due to Covid schemes like Test and Trace ending, retail sales falling and the Queen's Platinum Jubilee bank holiday in June, it said. The Bank of England has forecast the UK will fall into recession towards the end of the year as energy costs soar. Despite shrinking between April and June, the UK economy avoided recession because gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.8% in the first three months of this year. What is GDP and how does it affect me? A recession is defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods. Up until now most economists - and the Bank of England - did not expect a recession to begin until the final three months of 2022. Many expected a small rebound in economic growth between July and September. But the latest figures from the ONS have prompted some experts to warn that recession could come sooner than they had initially thought. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said it expected the UK economy to continue falling over the next three quarters. Capital Economics said there was now a greater risk that the economy will shrink by 0.2% between July and September before worsening. But investment bank Goldman Sachs still predicted growth of 0.4% in the third quarter of 2022. A spokesperson said: ""We had previously assumed a sharp bounce back in July but now expect a more muted rebound."" HSBC's forecast was more positive, it said: ""If the UK is going into recession, then we don't think this is the start of it."" ""We still expect a bounce back in July - the reversal of the bank holiday effect - to set the UK up for a positive Q3, as does the Bank of England,"" it added. Kingdom Thenga says it already feels like the UK is in recession Kingdom Thenga, who owns a number of local bars and restaurants in Chester, says for him, it already feels like the UK is in a recession. ""I think we are not too far away from it because of the consistent blows we're getting from energy bills, from people not going out, to the cost of living, it just seems that's where we're heading,"" he said. He says his business is currently ""in survival mode"". ""It's not about making money, it's not about trying to expand or trying to grow our business, it's just about stabilising the business especially after the pandemic over the last two years,"" he told the BBC. Mr Thenga says the biggest issue he's facing is rising costs - with everything from poultry to vegetable oil soaring in price - while the amount of money his customers have in their pockets is going down. ""Energy bills are ridiculous, the cost of fuel is ridiculous and I appreciate people don't necessarily have the money or can't spend what they used to, because everyone is so worried about what the bills are going to be,"" he says. What is a recession and what could mean for me? The UK is facing the worst rate of price rises - or inflation - in 40 years as energy costs continue to soar. Commenting on the 0.1% contraction between April and June, the ONS said that the biggest contributor was from ""human health and social work activities"" as Covid test and trace and vaccination programmes were wound down. There was also a fall in retail sales volumes. However, it said areas such as tourism, bars and entertainment showed strong growth. ""Health was the biggest reason the economy contracted as both the test and trace and vaccine programmes were wound down, while many retailers also had a tough quarter,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""These were partially offset by growth in hotels, bars, hairdressers and outdoor events across the quarter, partly as a result of people celebrating the Platinum Jubilee."" This included rises in mobile food stands and takeaway food shops. The ONS said that in June alone the economy shrank by 0.6% in June due to the extra bank holiday to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. However, that figure was much better than the 1.3% fall predicted by economists. The ONS said that while the bank holiday impacted on monthly GDP, it had ""little impact"" on the quarterly figure. The Chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, told the BBC that these are ""challenging times"". ""What the numbers show today is that the contraction is partly because of some of the Covid activities reducing but also real resilience in the private sector which actually in many ways bodes well... But nevertheless these are challenging times,"" he said. But Labour accused the Conservatives of ""losing control of the economy"". Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""With the Bank of England forecasting a recession lasting the whole of next year, the Conservative leadership contenders need to stop playing to the gallery and start coming up with a serious plan to get Britain's economy back on track."" A big part of the drop in Gross Domestic Product in June was because of the Platinum Jubilee - which meant two fewer working days of producing goods and services, in contrast to May, which had one additional working day. It was always expected that that would magnify the downswing from May to June and economists expected a sharper drop in activity. The 0.1% drop over the three months from April to June was only half as bad as some economists thought. Nevertheless, given the backdrop of the global squeeze on incomes due to soaring energy prices, no-one can say this drop in activity is just a blip. The squeeze on the hard-pressed consumer is tightening its grip, with activity in consumer-facing services down by 4.9% compared to before the pandemic. And with France, Italy and Canada seeing growth, no-one can say this is a stellar economic performance. All in all, it's not yet the recession the Bank of England has forecast: more a precursor.

"Water companies have announced hosepipe bans in some areas after temperatures climbed to 30C this week. People in affected areas cannot use hosepipes to water gardens, clean their cars or fill paddling pools. South East Water has introduced ahosepipe and sprinkler ban in Kent and Sussex,external. The water company imposed the ban aftersupply issues left around 4,000 customers without water. Others were experiencing low water pressure, in areas including Wadhurst, Mayfield, Biddenden and Staplehurst. It is understood the ban can only be enforced after 10 days of consultation. That means rule-breakers could face a Â£1,000 fine from 26 June. There is also a banacross Cornwalland inparts of Devon, including the Colliford and Roadford areas,according to South West Water's website.,external Elsewhere, water companies are monitoring water levels closely, although no hosepipe bans are currently planned in other parts of England. There are no bans in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Environment Agency said bans have been put in place because hot weather affects how quickly water storage reservoirs can be refilled. It said there is no threat of a drought in the UK at present. Water UK: Find your water supplier,external Why drought can lead to dangerous flooding BothSouth East Water,externalandSouth West Water,externalhave said people living in certain areas are not allowed to use a hosepipe to: water the garden water plants wash the car, patio or a boat fill a swimming or paddling pool fill or maintain a domestic pond Anyone breaking the rules could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. But there are some exceptions: for business use (for example, watering commercial crops or running a car wash business) to fill pools needed for medical treatment to water a new lawn within 28 days of it being laid to fill a fountain used for religious practices to top up a fishpond when the welfare of the fish depends on it Gardener Leigh Johnstone from Southampton, who shares tips on TikTok, says plants are hardier than most people think. Mr Johnstone suggests using a water butt to collect any rain water, as well as using ""grey water"" from baths and cooking pots. However, he cautions soapy water should not be used on edible crops. Plants can also be ""mulched"" to stop moisture escaping, by adding material such as wood chippings to the top of the soil. Leigh Johnstone, known as the Beardy Gardener on TikTok, says there are lots of ways to save water He also suggests planting drought-resistant plants such as lavender, Euphorbia and wildflowers. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) recommends using watering cans rather than hosepipes because they direct water more accurately to the roots of plants. Watering in the morning or evening can also help reduce evaporation. In addition, the RHS suggests allowing the grass on lawns to grow taller, so that it develops deeper roots which can draw water from further underground. It also recommends installing water troughs, putting saucers under plant pots to reduce waste, and using homemade compost. Can your allotment survive a hosepipe ban? Water UK, which represents the UK's water industry, says hosepipe bans normally reduce water usage by about 10%. It suggests further water-saving measures, such as reusing paddling pool water, washing dogs outside instead of in the bath and filling ponds with rainwater. However, each day, three billion litres of water is lost through leakage, according to a National Audit Office (NAO) report. In 2018, daily demand for water in England and Wales was 14 billion litres. The Environment Agency has said ""government expects water companies to act to reduce leakage and fix leaking pipes as quickly as possible"". What are water companies doing to tackle leaks?

"An official drought has been declared as low-water levels and tinder-dry conditions continue across the UK. Eight parts of England, including Devon, Kent, East Anglia and Lincolnshire are affected. The move is expected to trigger stricter controls on water use and five water companies have already announced restrictions, including hosepipe bans. Millions are expected to be impacted but the Environment Agency said essential water supplies were safe. John Curtin, director of operations, said the drought would go on for ""a long time"" and warned of possible restrictions on crop growing and further hosepipe bans. It comes as the prolonged dry weather - combined with the current heatwave and July's record-breaking temperatures - have depleted rivers, reservoirs and aquifers. Large swathes of England are bone-dry, with scenes of parched earth and grass turned yellow. The conditions have prompted the Environment Agency to move eight of its 14 areas into drought status: Devon and Cornwall Solent and South Downs Kent and South London Hertfordshire and North London East Anglia Thames Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire East Midlands Yorkshire and the West Midlands are also expected to move into a drought later in August. The decision to declare a drought was taken after a meeting of the National Drought Group - made up of government and agency officials, water firms and groups including the National Farmers' Union. Announcing a drought means government and water companies will put into action their plans to deal with it, with measures including hosepipe bans and taking more water than usual from rivers. Members of the public and businesses in drought-affected areas are also being urged to use water wisely followingthe driest first seven months of the year since 1976. Elsewhere, Wales Drought Liaison group is also looking at the effect of the dry weather. LIVE UPDATES: Drought to be declared Will there be a hosepipe ban in my area? Flames faster than you can run - firefighters on wildfires The science of drought explained in pictures Five water companies - Welsh Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, South East Water and, most recently Yorkshire Water - have all announced hosepipe bans, whileYorkshire Water said on Friday that a banwould start on 26 August. The latter firm, which has more than five million customers, says parts of the region have seen the lowest rainfall since records began more than 130 years ago. It also said rivers and reservoirs in the region were running at 20% lower than expected for the time of year. South East Water, whose ban came into force on Friday, is now asking people to observe restrictions on using hosepipes to water plants, wash the car and fill paddling pools - with rule-breakers facing fines of up to Â£1,000. What are water companies doing to tackle leaks? How the heatwave is changing landscapes The driest start to a year since 1976 Dominic Gardener, a farmer in West Sussex, said the dry weather was posing huge challenges for farmers. ""Everything is starting to struggle a bit - our grass is not growing at all - and livestock, we're having to feed them extra food,"" he said, adding crop yields had also been reduced by the dryness. Farmers in parts of Fife are beingtemporarily banned from using waterfrom the River Eden on their fields. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency says the measure will come into effect from midnight on Saturday to tackle critical water shortages. Afour-day amber warning for extreme heatfrom the Met Office is in place for many parts of England and Wales until Sunday. Temperatures are forecast to be lower early next week, however, and the Met Office has issued yellow warnings for thunderstorms on Monday, covering most of England, Wales and Scotland. And its fire severity index - which assesses how severe a blaze could become - is currently ""very high"" for most of England and Wales. The situation facing firefighters across the UK has been described as ""unprecedented"",with increasing numbers of wildfires. Fires have broken out across the nation, including in Leytonstone, east London, Studland Bay, Dorset,Creswell, in Derbyshire,The Dower House in Bristol, and Overton, near Basingstoke in Hampshire. Police have evacuated about 50 homes in Creswell after a major incident was declared due to a field fire. Fire crews are also tackling a large blaze whichbroke out at a Leicestershire recycling centre. Meanwhile, homeless peoplestruggling with the extreme heat in Bristolsaid it was ""making us sick,"" and even sitting in the shade was ""tiring and sweaty and uncomfortable"". Bristol Street Outreach Team, operated by charity St Mungo's, has been carrying out additional shifts and giving out water, advice and sun protection to those in need. This video can not be played Watch latest UK weather forecast: Amber heat warning in force UK temperatures have been rising day-on-day through the week. According to the Met Office, on Friday the highest temperatures were recorded in: Wiggonholt, West Sussex, at 34.5C Northolt, west London, and Hermonceux West End, East Sussex, at 34.2C Heathrow, west London, at 33.9C Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, at 33.8C Chivenor, Devon, at 33.7C. Over the weekend temperatures could peak at 36C. Met Office chief meteorologist Andy Page said there would be ""increasingly warm nights"" with temperatures not expected to drop below the low 20s in some places in the south. Sir Keir Starmer has accused the government of failing to fully prepare the UK for drought, and also out at the response of water companies. Water firms have been criticised over leaks, with about three billion litres of water lost each day in the UK - between 20% and 24% of the total water supply. The Labour leader said the drought was ""predictable"" but ""as usual we had no plan from the government"". Environment Secretary George Eustice said there was ""no reason for people to be alarmed"". He told BBC News that the UK's water supply ""remains resilient"" and that ""we're in a stronger position than ever"" to withstand droughts, with progress made on leaks and infrastructure to move water between reservoirs. Heatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. Research institute UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) said it would require ""exceptional"" rainfall over the next one to three months to bring river, reservoir and groundwater levels back up to normal. It said analysis showed exceptionally low levels would probably continue until October in southern England and Wales. But scientists have warned bouts of heavy rain after a prolonged period of hot weather can cause flash flooding. Robert Thompson, a professor of Meteorology at the University of Reading, said ""the ground has effectively become like urban concrete"" and will not absorb water quickly enough to cope with longer showers. The situation in the UK is being mirrored across Europe. Much of the continent is baking in record heat, exposing riverbeds and triggering restrictions on water use in many areas. A drought has also hitGermany's Rhine River, where the water is already too low to allow some larger vessels through. Restrictions on usage during hosepipe bans can vary between water providers but generally people are not allowed to use hosepipes or anything that connects to a hosepipe or an outside tap.During a ban, people cannot use a hosepipe to: water a garden or plants fill a paddling or swimming pool clean a car fill a pond clean walls or windows But you can use other water sources, like using your mains water supply but with buckets or watering cans instead of hosepipes, or using stored rainwater from a water butt and there are some exceptions when a hosepipe can be used. Anyone breaking the rules could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. Read morehere. Have you been affected by the hot weather and restrictions?
