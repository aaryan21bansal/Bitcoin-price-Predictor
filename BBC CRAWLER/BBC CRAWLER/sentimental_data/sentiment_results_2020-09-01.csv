"Dominic Raab and his top civil servant Philip Barton arrive at their new department The UK government remains committed to spending 0.7% of national income on foreign aid, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary dismissed as ""tittle tattle"" reports that the Â£15bn aid budget could be cut to pay for more defence and intelligence spending. Press reports suggest Chancellor Rishi Sunak will cut aid spending to help pay off rising debts in his Autumn budget. But Mr Raab said the 0.7% target was a manifesto commitment that was written into law. His promise came as the newly-merged Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office began work, with a pledge to protect ""the world's poorest"" from coronavirus and famine. International development and Foreign Office to merge What's behind the PM's aid department decision? UK aid budget to help boost trade agenda The new department is opening after No 10 decided tocombine the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with the Department for International Development (DfID). Asked if the 0.7% target would survive the merger, Mr Raab said: ""Oh, absolutely."" He added that the development expertise the UK has got will be ""the beating heart of this new department"". The government is carrying out a review of defence and security policy, that is due to report back in November, and is also gearing up for thecomprehensive spending review,external, which will set departmental budgets for the next few years. According to The Times,external, Rishi Sunak is arguing that the Ministry of Defence's plans for advanced cyber weaponry and AI-enabled drones must be paid for out of the aid budget. Mr Raab said: ""Well, there is loads of tittle tattle, rather colourful, in the media and I am not going to prejudice the comprehensive spending review."" He added that the government was committed to helping the poorest around the world and ""making sure we link up aid with our wider foreign policy goals"". The UK is one of the few countries to meet the UN's 0.7% aid target Mr Raab has announced a Â£119m fund to tackle coronavirus and famine to mark the launch of the new, merged department. The money will be targeted in Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Somalia, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Sudan and West Africa's Sahel region - all places where the outbreak has worsened conditions for people already struggling with extreme hunger, wars and/or climate change. The foreign secretary also confirmed he would be appointing Nick Dyer - a director general at DfID - as the UK's first special envoy for famine prevention and humanitarian affairs. The abolition of the Department for International Development may have been driven by political pressure from within the Conservative Party. But the government argues that its merger with the Foreign Office will mean better, more joined-up policy. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that by combining its diplomatic strength with its expertise in foreign aid, Britain could not only tackle global challenges, but also protect its interests. Critics fear the new Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office could mean the government weakens its commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on foreign aid. But Downing Street insisted there'd been no change to that policy. The two departments have a history of being merged and split up again, and the move to bring them together has long been mooted in Conservative circles. Tory MP Harriet Baldwin - who held joint roles across the FCO and DfID - said it was ""really important to combine them"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""[The move] will really increase the impact of our diplomatic clout, as well as our development expertise across the world."" But Labour MP Hilary Benn, who was the international development secretary under Tony Blair, said he thought the merger was a ""mistake"" and questioned Mr Johnson's understanding of the department. He told Today: ""The proof will be in how this new department develops and unfolds, but I think it will lead to less respect for what we are doing."" Boris Johnson announced the merger in June, telling MPs it would ensure aid spending better reflected UK aims and that it was a ""long overdue reform"". He said UK aid spending had ""been treated as some giant cashpoint in the sky that arrives without any reference to UK interests"". But the PM pledged DfID's budget - which at Â£15bn last year dwarfed the Â£2.4bn spent by the Foreign Office - would be maintained Mr Johnson's decision was criticised by three previous prime ministers - Conservative David Cameron, and Labour's Gordon Brown and Mr Blair. This video can not be played Boris Johnson announced the merger to the Commons in June Mr Cameron said it would mean ""less expertise, less voice for development at the top table and ultimately less respect for the UK overseas"". The Commons International Development Committee also called the move ""impulsive"", saying the world's poorest ""will pay the greatest price"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pledged to reinstate DfID if he were to win the next general election, saying the merger was ""the tactics of pure distraction"".

"Andy Murray won the first of his three Grand Slam titles at the 2012 US Open 2020 US Open Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:31 Aug-13 Sept Coverage:Selected live radio and text commentaries on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, BBC Sounds, the BBC Sport website and app. Andy Murray staged a stunning comeback against Yoshihito Nishioka in the US Open first round on his long-awaited return to Grand Slam singles tennis. The 33-year-old came from two sets and a break down against the Japanese to win 4-6 4-6 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-4) 6-4. The Briton, whose last major singles match was at the 2019 Australian Open before career-saving hip surgery, started flat and dispirited. But he found his fight and saved a match point to set up an epic win. The Scot, who eventually claimed victory in four hours 39 minutes, will face Canadian 15th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the second round. Re-live the action from day two of the US Open Comeback win was emotional - Murray Playing in an empty and quiet Arthur Ashe Stadium - a far cry from the noisy stage where Murray won his maiden Grand Slam title in 2012 - his early despondence was all the more noticeable. In his BBC radio commentary David Law said ""Andy Murray does not look like Andy Murray"", such was his manner, as he quietly trudged around with shoulders slumped as he was outplayed. During the first two sets Murray barely berated himself for his five double faults and 30 unforced errors, seeming almost resigned to his fate before his energy levels - and his voice - began to rise towards the end of the third set. And that was when Andy Murray began to look exactly like Andy Murray. A roar greeted the blistering forehand that gave him two set points in the third-set tie-break and then he let it all out with a trademark ""come on!"" when Nishioka netted a backhand on the second. The character that took him to three Grand Slam titles and the world number one ranking before his body so cruelly let him down shone through as he saved a match point with a crosscourt backhand at 6-5 in the fourth. It would be nearly an hour later until he himself carved out his own match point, needing to recover from a break down in the fifth game of the fifth - which he did with a sumptuous backhand lob in the very next game - to stay on track. When Nishioka sent a backhand out on match point, Murray completed his 10th career comeback from two sets down and answered any lingering questions about whether he could still be competitive on the biggest stage. On his last Grand Slam singles appearance in January 2019, Murray had broken down in tears when he said he feared he might have to retire because of a hip injury. But he went on to have surgery later that month and just five months later was back in action, playing doubles and winning the Queen's title with Feliciano Lopez. He played doubles and mixed doubles at Wimbledon that year and then made his singles return on the tour in August 2019. He skipped last year's US Open to focus on his singles return and was then ruled out of January's Australian Open with a pelvic injury. Further chances to return to the Grand Slam singles stage were then lost because of the coronavirus pandemic. He has been ticking off the 'since surgery' milestones ever since - a first singles title (October), a first win over a top-10 player (last week) and now he has crossed off three more. Not only his first Grand Slam singles match, but also a first win in one, and a first five-setter. ""I'm tired. My toes are the worst part I think,"" said Murray, who had treatment on his toes at the start of the fifth set. ""The big toes on both sides are pretty beat up. I did alright physically. ""At the beginning of the match I was apprehensive about playing a long match because I hadn't played one in a while. ""I was sort of pacing myself. Once I got two sets down I had to start putting the after-burners on and managed to get through."" He is the first player to return to singles after a hip re-surfacing operation, where the femur head is capped with metal and put into an artificial socket. He will now find out how his new body copes with the recovery from a five-set thriller at a Grand Slam. And he knows exactly what he needs. ""They have an ice bath in the locker room and they said it was for emergencies,"" Murray said. ""For me this is an emergency right now. I'll ask and see if they'll allow me to use the ice bath. If not I'll try to get back to the hotel as quickly as I can. ""That's by far the most tennis I've played since the Aussie Open in 2019."" Interestingly, there were echoes of that last Australian Open match in this one - then, he was on the wrong end of an almost identical scoreline when he lost 6-4 6-4 6-7 (5-7) 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 to Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut. British number ones Konta and Evans into second round Williams wins in straight sets BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Murray made a cagey start - pacing himself like a marathon runner, just in case the match went the distance. And when he then lost his way completely at the start of the second set, his Grand Slam return was in danger of turning rapidly flat. But with an audience made up entirely of star players, who were watching on from their suites in the Arthur Ashe Stadium, Murray gradually inched his way back into the match. His toes took a pounding, but his hip held up, and after an ice bath on site he could start to imagine doing it all again on Thursday.

"White farmer Dave Wakefield (pictured in 2019) lost his farm in 2001 and now leases land from a black owner Zimbabwe has offered to return land to foreign nationals whose farms were seized under a controversial government programme two decades ago. Thousands of white farmers were forced from their land, often violently, between 2000 and 2001. The seizures were meant to redress colonial-era land grabs but contributed to the country's economic decline and ruined relations with the West. A separate compensation scheme has been launched for local white farmers. They have not been offered land, but the government last month promised them $3.5bn (Â£2.6bn) for seized infrastructure. Reality Check: What happened to Zimbabwe's land reforms? Who will compensate Zimbabwe's white farmers? Mugabe admits land reform flaws The US has said compensating farmers is one of the requirements for it to lift decades of economic sanctions. Zimbabwe on Monday said foreign citizens who had their land seized could now apply to get it back. Hundreds of Europeans - mostly Dutch, British and German nationals - whose investments were protected under international agreements could benefit from the offer, reports the BBC's Shingai Nyoka from the capital, Harare. The farms were taken under a controversial land reform programme launched by former President Robert Mugabe. He argued that this was to redress colonial-era land grabs, when much of the country's best land was reserved for the white population and black farmers were forced onto marginal areas. Under the programme, most of the country's 4,000 white farmers - then the backbone of Zimbabwe's agricultural economy - were forced from their land, which was handed over to about a million black Zimbabweans. In a joint statement on Monday, the ministers of finance and agriculture said some black farmers who received land under the programme would now be moved. To allow the former owners ""to regain possession"" of their land, the government will revoke offers made to black farmers currently occupying the farms and ""offer them alternative land elsewhere"", the statement said. The offer marks an important step in repairing relations with Western nations and avoiding international judgements against Zimbabwe worth hundreds of millions of dollars, our reporter says.

"This video can not be played Travel expert ""very, very concerned"" about Zante to Cardiff coronavirus flight Travellers arriving to Wales from Zante are being asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there are six clusters of cases, amounting to 30 infections, linked to flights from the Greek island. Passengers arriving on a TUI flight from Zante to Cardiff on Tuesday night have been offered Covid tests. TUI is also stoppingtrips to the island's party resort of Laganasas social distancing is being ignored. It comes after at least 16 people tested positive following a TUI flight from Zante to Cardiff Airport last week, where some claimed passengerswere not following Covid-19 rules. Passengers on the 22:40 BST arrival from Zante on Tuesday, also operated by TUI, received a letter asking them to self-isolate before leaving the airport. They will also be offered two Covid tests - one in 48 hours and another in eight days The flight was already in the air when the Welsh Government made the announcement. Travellers from Wales who arrive from other UK airports from the island - for example, someone from Cardiff who arrives at Bristol Airport - on Tuesday and Wednesday are being asked to arrange tests when they arrive home, and again in eight days. They are being told to self-isolate as well. Vaughan Gething said people returning from Zante posed a public health risk Meanwhile the Scottish government has announced that all people arriving from Greece will be asked toquarantine themselves for 14 daysfrom Thursday. Tui calls for 'regional travel corridors' Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? In a statement, Mr Gething said there are currently ""six clusters amounting to over 30 cases in the last week from four flights, of which two of these flights landed in England"". He said there were several examples of Covid-19 positive travellers who had not self-isolated on return to Wales. Vaughan Gething said there were six clusters of infections from four flights Mr Gething called for an ""early meeting with the UK government and devolved nations"" to discuss changing the rules so travellers from Greece are required to self-isolate. His comments came just shortly after the Scottish government announced its decision. ""Public Health Wales have expressed direct concerns about the public health risk posed by passengers returning to Cardiff this evening from Zante/Zakynthos. I share that concern,"" he said. ""It is almost certain that travellers returning to Wales from areas of higher Covid-19 incidence will lead to further seeding of infections within Wales. Travel into Wales from mainland Europe drove the first wave of Covid-19."" Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI UK and Ireland, said holidays to Laganas - which attracts groups of young people - would no longer be available from Thursday. ""Recent cases shows that some customers are not following social distancing and Covid safety measures,"" he said. ""It is therefore the right thing to do to protect and reduce a now identified potential risk to others by no longer offering holidays to this specific resort. ""The recent cases in Wales have highlighted a demographic of customers that have recently returned from Zante and subsequently tested positive. The main strip of Laganas has bars and clubs attracting young groups of holidaymakers ""As the only airline that flies between Cardiff and Zante it has allowed us to understand trends that may also be seen in other areas of the UK."" Some passengers on the flight to Cardiff last Tuesday said they had decided to self-isolate before they even learned about the positive case after they claimed rules were being broken. Stephanie Whitfield said the man next to her had a ""mask around his neck"" and ""people were taking their masks off and wandering up and down the aisles to talk to others"". But Nigel Harris, from Barry, who was on the plane, told BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammed show the flight home was a ""pretty standard flight"" and he did not see people walking up and down the plane. ""I had my facemask on from the time I left the hotel to the time I left Cardiff Airport and, in my experience, that was what I saw on the plane as well,"" he said. Mr Harris said staff were enforcing the rules and a number of tannoy announcements were made reminding people. TUI said in response: ""Following an initial investigation with our cabin crew we are confident that multiple announcements via the PA and individual conversations with customers to try to reinforce protocols took place and other customers on the flight have confirmed these findings to be correct.""

They will be required to isolate for 14 days if they arrive in Scotland after 04:00 on Thursday. Ministers said they have taken the move due to a ""significant rise"" in cases of Covid-19 being brought into Scotland from people who have been to Greece. It has been linked to travellers returning from the Greek islands. As a result, the country has been been removed from the ""travel corridor"" exemption list on public health grounds. The prevalence of Covid-19 in Greece is currently about 20 per 100,000, but a number of cases of the virus in Scotland have been traced back to travel from Greece. They include apassenger who flew to Glasgow from Zanteon 23 August. The deputy first minister, John Swinney,told Good Morning Scotlandthat there had been ""an increased number of cases coming in from Greece as a consequence of international travel"". He said: ""We judge, based on the evidence available to us, there is a necessity to apply that quarantine restriction and that's to essentially protect us here in Scotland from a spread of the virus as a consequence of importation from other countries."" Asked why the restriction covered the whole of Greece when media reports suggested there was a particular problem with some islands, Mr Swinney said: ""The whole process of travel can generate some of the cases that are taking their course"". So he said it was ""proportionate"" and designed to ""give us as much protection as possible here domestically to avoid a rise in cases and that's what we're trying to avoid at all possible costs"". He added that it was important to take proportionate and targeted action where it was possible to do so. Travellers returning to the UK from the Greek island of Zante have tested positive for coronavirus Scotland's chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith said: ""There is a compelling public health risk around importation of the virus, especially given the number of imported cases linked to the Greek islands. ""The flow of travel between Scotland and Greece, and the behaviour we have seen from some of those travellers, means that on public health grounds there is a strong case - supported by public health directors - to remove Greece from the exemption list."" Greece's Tourism MinisterHarry Theoharis said the restrictions were ""a bit harsh"",external. He said every country had a right to protect its citizens, but that Greece was ""well below"" the 20 cases per 100,000 threshold that the UK nations use as a guide for imposing quarantine restrictions on returning travellers. Mr Theoharis added: ""We have put in place a comprehensive set of protocols and measures... We take targeted measures where we see concentration."" He added that Greece conducted the fifth most tests in Europe. ""We feel that we have taken every possible precaution"", he added. People travelling to Scotland from these countries are subjectquarantine restrictions,external. Holidaymakers have tested positive for coronavirus after flights to the UK from Zante Travellersarriving home to Walesfrom Zante are also being asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there were six clusters of cases, amounting to 30 infections, linked to flights from the Greek island. Meanwhile, ministers are considering re-imposing quarantine measuresfor those arriving in the UK from Portugalas coronavirus cases rise, sources have told the BBC. The UK considers imposing quarantine on travellers when a country's infection rate exceeds 20 cases per 100,000, over seven days. But each of the four nationsÂ can add or remove countries to their own list. Mike Tibbert, vice president of the Scottish Passenger Agents' Association, said he is ""extremely concerned"" about the workload being placed on its members by the changing quarantine rules. ""The removal of Greece in this ongoing hokey-cokey of countries which are 'in or out' means it's impossible for Scots to plan or reorganise a holiday which they have already paid for. And equally impossible for our members to run a business,"" he said. IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland? CASES:Where are the latest cases in Scotland?

"This video can not be played Llangennech train fire: Wreckage on the rail tracks A huge clear-up operation is continuing after a train crash spilled hundreds of tonnes of oil into a wildlife haven. Ten wagons, each containing 75 tonnes of diesel,derailed and spilled oilinto the Loughor Estuary, near Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, on Wednesday. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said oil has now spread as far as Crofty, Swansea, about 4.5 miles (7km) away. Cockle beds and shell fisheries have been closed after advice from the Food Standards Agency. The scene of devastation could be seen from above The water was dark heading into the estuary The Loughor Estuary is part of the Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries Special Area of Conservation, and local wildlife groups have already warnedit could have a ""devastating impact"" on the environment. People wereevacuated from their homes and a major incident was declaredafter a freight train carrying wagons of Puma Energy's diesel derailed and burst into flames, causing the fuel to spill into the estuary, which is a site of special scientific interest and home to wildfowl and wading birds. On Sunday the oil had been spotted as far away as Crofty, Natural Resources Wales said Natural Resources Wales said it was ""doing everything in our power to mitigate the impacts of this incident"" NRW was not able to investigate the damage of the spill until the fire was put out, which took firefighters 33 hours. On Saturday, NRW said the spill was ""no longer confined to the upper reaches of the estuary and has been observed at many locations as far as Crofty"". On Tuesday, cranes are due to be brought in to start removing the wreckage from the tracks, with it estimated two wagons could be removed a day. NRW said thousands of litres of fuel had already been pumped from the wagons and the surrounding area. Over the weekend, trenches were dug and booms and absorbent pads put in place to try and contain the diesel, while ""vacuuming and skimming operations"" are also taking place, NRW said. ""These techniques have proved to be working well and are removing a considerable quantity of diesel from the water courses,"" a spokesman said. Samples are being taken, and an environment group made up of representatives from Public Health Wales, the Food Standards Agency, local councils, government departments and wildlife bodies has been formed to respond to the incident. Diesel has been pumped from the wagons ahead of their removal Ben Wilson, NRW's incident manager, said: ""Our priority at this time is to work with our partners at the incident scene to contain the diesel spill and prevent it from polluting the Loughor Estuary any further. ""We also have monitoring teams out assessing the extent of the pollution. Their work will help the multi-agency Wales Environment Group to assess the wider environmental impact at sites such as the local fisheries and bathing water sites, and any effect on wildlife in the area."" The estuary is home to important shellfisheries and cockle beds, which have been closed as a ""precaution"" following advice from the Food Standards Agency, NRW said. The map showing the observed presence of diesel in the Loughor Estuary on 29 August While Public Health Wales (PHW) said it was unlikely that anyone exposed to diesel for a short period of time would have any adverse health effects, it is sensible to avoid contact with diesel or the water in contaminated areas. Andrew Kibble of PHW said: ""If anyone gets diesel on their skin, they should remove any affected clothing and wash using soap and water and if they feel unwell seek medical attention. ""We would also advise that all pets are kept out of contact with the diesel and that members of the public do not pick up any birds or other animals affected by diesel from the shoreline.""

"The trial of the alleged accomplices opens on Wednesday French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo has republished cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed that made them the target of a deadly terror attack in 2015. Republication comes a day before 14 people go on trial accused of helping the two Islamist attackers carry out their gun rampage on 7 January 2015. Twelve people were killed, including famous cartoonists. Five people died in a related attack in Paris days later. The attacks began a wave of jihadist strikes across France. 7-9 January 2015: Three days of terror in Paris Charlie Hebdo and its place in French journalism French terror attacks: Victim obituaries 'I am not Charlie' The front cover of the latest edition features the 12 original cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, which were published in a Danish newspaper before appearing in Charlie Hebdo. One of the cartoons shows the prophet wearing a bomb instead of a turban. The French headline reads ""Tout Ã§a pour Ã§a"" (""All of that for this""). In its editorial, the magazine says that it has often been asked to carry on printing caricatures of the prophet since the 2015 killings. ""We have always refused to do so, not because it is prohibited - the law allows us to do so - but because there was a need for a good reason to do it, a reason which has meaning and which brings something to the debate,"" it says. ""To reproduce these cartoons in the week the trial over the January 2015 terrorist attacks opens seemed essential to us."" Fourteen people are accused of obtaining weapons and providing logistical support for the attackers of Charlie Hebdo's Paris offices, and subsequent attacks on a Jewish supermarket and a police officer. The Hyper Cacher supermarket, where a gunman killed four people in January 2015 Three of the accused are being tried in absentia as they are believed to have fled to northern Syria and Iraq. There are believed to be some 200 plaintiffs in the trial and survivors of the attacks are expected to testify, France's RFI broadcaster reports. The trial had been due to start in March but was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. It is due to last until November. On 7 January, brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo, and opened fire killingthe editor StÃ©phane Charbonnier, known as Charb, four other cartoonists including Cabu, two columnists, a copy editor, a guest attending the meeting and the caretaker. The editor's bodyguard and a police officer were also killed. This video can not be played As the manhunt for the attackers continues, here's a tribute to those killed - in 60 seconds As police hunted down the two brothers - who were eventually killed - another siege began in the east of Paris. Amedy Coulibaly, who was an acquaintance of the Kouachi brothers, killed a policewoman before taking several people hostage at a Jewish supermarket. He killed four Jewish men on 9 January before being shot dead in a police standoff. In a video recording, Coulibaly said the attacks had been carried in the name of the Islamic State group. Charlie Hebdo's anti-establishment satire - poking fun at the far right, and aspects of Catholicism and Judaism as well as Islam - had long drawn controversy. But it was its portrayals of the Prophet Mohammed that led to death threats against the editorial team and a petrol bomb attack on its offices in 2011. Charb had strongly defended the cartoons as symbolic of freedom of speech. ""I don't blame Muslims for not laughing at our drawings,"" he told the Associated Press in 2012. ""I live under French law. I don't live under Koranic law."" Following the 2015 attack, thousands of people took to the streets in protest and the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie (I am Charlie) began trending around the world. Managing editor Gerard Biard told the BBC in 2016 that the magazine's emergence as an international symbol had brought with it fresh criticismof its provocative and controversial tone, with many people calling for it to have more respect for the views - and beliefs - of others.

"The return of pupils to schools in England this week will be a ""massive milestone"", says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. But he apologised to students for the ""stress and uncertainty"" of problems with A-level and GCSE results. Mr Williamson told MPs the u-turn on results became necessary when ""too many inconsistencies"" appeared in grades. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green accused him of a ""summer of chaos, incompetence and confusion"". This week many pupils in England and Wales are going back to school - after the long disruption caused by the pandemic outbreak, with almost all schools expected to be ready to teach pupils full time. Williamson says A-levels and GCSEs likely to be later next summer Labour calls for delays to next summer's exams Next year's exams will need to be slimmed down, say head teachers England's education secretary, speaking in the House of Commons, welcomed that pupils will be returning to a safe environment. But for students caught up in the exam fiasco he said he ""can only apologise to them"". Labour's Ms Green pressed him on how many students might still have missed out on a first choice at university as a result of the confusion. This video can not be played BBC Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what schools are doing to keep pupils safe A survey from YouGov also suggested there were still fears about safety in school - with 17% of parents ""seriously considering"" not sending back their children. The polling firm has recordedgrowing confidence in sending pupils back, but this latest survey, as schools prepare to reopen, suggests a hard core of unconvinced parents. Parents were more likely to back wearing masks in school, with 47% in favour and 36% against. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the first Cabinet meeting since the summer break, said there was likely to be more of ""this wretched Covid still to come"" but he was ""absolutely confident"" that ""we are going to be able to deal with those outbreaks"". The return to school has raised concerns about what will happen to next summer's A-levels and GCSEs, when so much teaching time has been lost. Mr Williamson told MPs that exams would go ahead next summer - and there were plans being made ""to ensure that this is done as smoothly as possible"". Schools Minister Nick Gibb said earlier there would soon be a decision on whether exams would start later next summer - as previously suggested. In June, Mr Williamson told MPs that he would consult with Ofqual, England's exam regulator, on ""how we can move those exams back, giving children extra time in order to be able to learn"". Ofqual has suggested that relatively few changes will need to be made to how much is taught for exams - but heads' leader Geoff Barton criticised this as ""little more than tinkering at the edges"". The ASCL head teachers' union has called for a reduction in the scale of the content of exam courses to take account of the amount of teaching time that has been lost. This video can not be played The PM says workers are going back to the office âin huge numbersâ. There have also been questions about what will happen if schools face local lockdowns - and whether there will have to be a back-up plan for teachers' predictions to be used again. West Sussex head teacher Jules White said a month's delay for exams would only be ""window dressing"". ""The idea that all students, especially those who are disadvantaged, will rapidly catch up on vast amounts of subject content is naively optimistic and politicians from all sides must call for urgent and meaningful modifications to exams,"" said Mr White, who has organised school funding campaigns. Labour has called for the exams, usually taken in May and June, to be pushed back to mid-summer to help cope with the impact of coronavirus. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? This year's exams were dogged by chaos and left teachers, parents and pupils calling for a major rethink of next summer's exams. Nearly 40% of A-level grades awarded to students using an algorithm were below teachers' assessments, with disadvantaged students particularly badly affected. Days after the results were announced, and following widespread criticism, the government performed a U-turn and decided tobase grades on teachers' recommendationsinstead. Conservative MP Tim Loughton said the exam problems had been a ""shambles"" and that after such a ""turbulent"" summer when ""things have not gone as well as they should have done"", the government needed to ""get control of the agenda again"". ""I think a lot of people will find it surprising that we seem to have had a few heads roll who are civil servants and in charge in quangos but so far there has been no ministerial accountability and I think that is raising a few questions. ""Ministers have lost their jobs for a lot less, including education ministers,"" said Mr Loughton.

"Erick Morillo, the internationally-recognised DJ best known for the track I Like To Move It, has been found dead in Miami, local police have said. His death comes less than a month after his arrest for sexually assaulting a female DJ after working a gig together. Police said the 49-year old was found dead in his Miami Beach home, but have released few details as the investigation begins. He released his 1994 hit I Like To Move It using the name Reel 2 Real. It became a retro hit again after a remix was featured in the 2005 animated film Madagascar. Morillo had denied the sexual assault charge, but turned himself in after a rape kit identified him as the suspect, according to WPLG-TV in Florida. He had been scheduled for a court hearing on Friday, the station reported.

"More than 100,000 pupils in Scotland are absent from school with attendance down to 84.5%, according to Scottish government figures. Data collected from local authorities shows that more than 15.5% pupils were off school last Friday. However, only 22,821 of the absences are recorded as ""Covid-19 related"". The Scottish government said it was common for other viral infections to circulate after a ""prolonged break"" away from school. Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, told BBC Scotland it believed many parents were ""erring on the side of caution"" and keeping children who had cold symptoms off school. Pupils in Scotlandbegan returning to school on 11 Augustafter being away since March. Provisional figures from 28 August show that 84.5% of pupils in Scottish schools were present, down from a confirmed 95.8% attendance on 17 August. Attendance remained above 90% until 21 August, before dropping to 89.2% on 24 August following the weekend. During the last decade, attendance levels over the whole school year have been between 93% and 94%. About 3% of pupils were absent last Friday for a Covid-related reason, with 12.3% absent for non-Covid reasons, including pupil exclusions. A Covid-related absence includes a ""positive test, showing symptoms, self-isolation, quarantining, and parents not sending their child to school against public health guidance"". The Scottish government reported on Tuesday that almost 40,000 pupils had been tested for coronavirus since term started, with 117 positive results. Absentee rates are higher than usual - but not dramatically higher. In the week before schools closed in March, there were reports that between a third and a half of pupils at some schools were off. The numbers provide reassurance most children are going to school but may also suggest that some parents are being cautious about sending them if they are slightly unwell - for instance suffering from a cold. Earlier this week the Scottish government's national clinical director Dr Jason Leitch wrote an open letter to parents. In the letter he offered advice on what parents should do if children are suffering from bugs and colds. He said that in many cases children would be well enough to attend. But he also stressed that those with potential Covid 19 symptoms should self-isolate and get tested. Speaking on Monday, Education Secretary John Swinney said it was common for ""colds and similar viral infections to circulate"" when pupils returned from a prolonged break. ""In many cases children will be well enough to attend school and continue their learning with little or no interruption to their education,"" he said. ""In other cases, for instance where they have quite a heavy cold with a runny nose, they may need to take a day or two off to recover."" He said any pupil with Covid-19 symptoms were required to self-isolate and seek a test. But he added: ""In order to ensure that your child does not miss out on their education it is important to be clear on how Covid-19 symptoms differ from those of other infections that we normally see circulating at this time of year."" National clinical director Jason Leitch has alsowritten to schools with guidance,externalon what to do about pupils who develop non-Covid symptoms. Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, said the union had received reports of ""higher than normal illness absences"" in schools across Scotland, with indications that cold viruses were circulating among pupils. He said significant numbers of pupils and staff were being affected in some areas. ""This may be the result of pupils and staff being isolated from others for a prolonged period, with the result that the virus is spreading more quickly now than schools have re-opened,"" he added. ""It is also likely to be the case that many parents will be erring on the side of caution in keeping their children off with cold symptoms at the present time.""

"Microsoft has developed a tool to spot deepfakes - computer-manipulated images in which one person's likeness has been used to replace that of another. Thesoftware analyses photos and videos,externalto give a confidence score about whether the material is likely to have been artificially created. The firm says it hopes the tech will help ""combat disinformation"". One expert has said it risks becoming quickly outdated because of the pace at which deepfake tech is advancing. To address this, Microsoft has also announced a separate system to help content producers add hidden code to their footage so any subsequent changes can be easily flagged. Deepfakes came to prominence in early 2018 after a developer adapted cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques to create software that swapped one person's face for another. The process worked by feeding a computer lots of still images of one person and video footage of another. Software then used this to generate a new video featuring the former's face in the place of the latter's, with matching expressions, lip-synch and other movements. Since then, the process has been simplified - opening it up to more users - and now requires fewer photos to work. Some apps exist that require only a single selfie to substitute a film star's face with that of the user within clips from Hollywood movies. But there are concerns the process can also be abused to create misleading clips, in which a prominent figure is made to say or act in a way that never happened, for political or other gain. Early this year, Facebook banned deepfakes that might mislead users intothinking a subject had said something they had not,external. Twitter and TikTok later followed with similar rules of their own. Microsoft's Video Authenticator tool works by trying to detect giveaway signs that an image has been artificially generated, which might be invisible to the human eye. The Video Authenticator tool gives a percentage-based confidence score as to how likely a clip is to be a deepfake These include subtle fading or greyscale pixels at the boundary of where the computer-created version of the target's face has been merged with that of the original subject's body. To build it, the firm applied its own machine-learning techniques to apublic dataset of about 1,000 deepfaked video sequences,externaland then tested the resulting model against an evenbigger face-swap database created by Facebook,external. One technology advisor noted that deepfake videos remain relatively rare for now, and that most manipulated clips involve cruder re-edits done by a human. Even so, she welcomed Microsoft's intervention. ""The only really widespread use we've seen so far is in non-consensual pornography against women,"" commented Nina Schick, author of the book Deep Fakes and the Infocalypse. ""But synthetic media is expected to become ubiquitous in about three to five years, so we need to develop these tools going forward. ""However, as detection capabilities get better, so too will the generation capability - it's never going to be the case that Microsoft can release one tool that can detect all kinds of video manipulation."" Microsoft has acknowledged this challenge. In the short term, it said it hoped its existing product might help identify deepfakes ahead of November's US election. Rather than release it to the public, however, it is only offering itvia a third-party organisation,external, which in turn will provide it to news publishers and political campaigns without charge. The reason for this is to prevent bad actors getting hold of the code and using it to teach their deepfake generators how to evade it. To tackle the longer-term challenge, Microsoft has teamed up with the BBC, among other media organisations, to support Project Origin, an initiative to ""mark"" online content in a way that makes it possible to spot automatically any manipulation of the material. The US tech firm will do this via a two-part process. Firstly, it has created an internet tool to add a digital fingerprint - in the form of certificates and ""hash"" values - to the media's metadata. Secondly, it has created a reader, to check for any evidence that the fingerprints have been affected by third-party changes to the content. Microsoft says people will then be able to use the reader in the form of a browser extension to verify a file is authentic and check who has produced it. Photo and video manipulation is crucial to the spread of often quite convincing disinformation on social media. But right now complex or deepfake technology isn't always necessary. Simple editing technology is more often than not the favoured option. That was the case with a recent manipulated video of US Presidential candidate Joe Biden, which has been viewed over two million times on social media. The clip shows a TV interview during which Biden appeared to be falling asleep. But it was fake - the clip of the host was from a different TV Interview and snoring effects had been added. Computer-generated photos of people's faces, on the other hand, have already become common hallmarks of sophisticated foreign interference campaigns, used to make fake accounts appear more authentic. One thing is for sure, more ways to spot media that has been manipulated or changed is not a bad thing in the fight against online disinformation.

"This video can not be played Travel expert ""very, very concerned"" about Zante to Cardiff coronavirus flight Travellers arriving to Wales from Zante are being asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there are six clusters of cases, amounting to 30 infections, linked to flights from the Greek island. Passengers arriving on a TUI flight from Zante to Cardiff on Tuesday night have been offered Covid tests. TUI is also stoppingtrips to the island's party resort of Laganasas social distancing is being ignored. It comes after at least 16 people tested positive following a TUI flight from Zante to Cardiff Airport last week, where some claimed passengerswere not following Covid-19 rules. Passengers on the 22:40 BST arrival from Zante on Tuesday, also operated by TUI, received a letter asking them to self-isolate before leaving the airport. They will also be offered two Covid tests - one in 48 hours and another in eight days The flight was already in the air when the Welsh Government made the announcement. Travellers from Wales who arrive from other UK airports from the island - for example, someone from Cardiff who arrives at Bristol Airport - on Tuesday and Wednesday are being asked to arrange tests when they arrive home, and again in eight days. They are being told to self-isolate as well. Vaughan Gething said people returning from Zante posed a public health risk Meanwhile the Scottish government has announced that all people arriving from Greece will be asked toquarantine themselves for 14 daysfrom Thursday. Tui calls for 'regional travel corridors' Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? In a statement, Mr Gething said there are currently ""six clusters amounting to over 30 cases in the last week from four flights, of which two of these flights landed in England"". He said there were several examples of Covid-19 positive travellers who had not self-isolated on return to Wales. Vaughan Gething said there were six clusters of infections from four flights Mr Gething called for an ""early meeting with the UK government and devolved nations"" to discuss changing the rules so travellers from Greece are required to self-isolate. His comments came just shortly after the Scottish government announced its decision. ""Public Health Wales have expressed direct concerns about the public health risk posed by passengers returning to Cardiff this evening from Zante/Zakynthos. I share that concern,"" he said. ""It is almost certain that travellers returning to Wales from areas of higher Covid-19 incidence will lead to further seeding of infections within Wales. Travel into Wales from mainland Europe drove the first wave of Covid-19."" Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI UK and Ireland, said holidays to Laganas - which attracts groups of young people - would no longer be available from Thursday. ""Recent cases shows that some customers are not following social distancing and Covid safety measures,"" he said. ""It is therefore the right thing to do to protect and reduce a now identified potential risk to others by no longer offering holidays to this specific resort. ""The recent cases in Wales have highlighted a demographic of customers that have recently returned from Zante and subsequently tested positive. The main strip of Laganas has bars and clubs attracting young groups of holidaymakers ""As the only airline that flies between Cardiff and Zante it has allowed us to understand trends that may also be seen in other areas of the UK."" Some passengers on the flight to Cardiff last Tuesday said they had decided to self-isolate before they even learned about the positive case after they claimed rules were being broken. Stephanie Whitfield said the man next to her had a ""mask around his neck"" and ""people were taking their masks off and wandering up and down the aisles to talk to others"". But Nigel Harris, from Barry, who was on the plane, told BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammed show the flight home was a ""pretty standard flight"" and he did not see people walking up and down the plane. ""I had my facemask on from the time I left the hotel to the time I left Cardiff Airport and, in my experience, that was what I saw on the plane as well,"" he said. Mr Harris said staff were enforcing the rules and a number of tannoy announcements were made reminding people. TUI said in response: ""Following an initial investigation with our cabin crew we are confident that multiple announcements via the PA and individual conversations with customers to try to reinforce protocols took place and other customers on the flight have confirmed these findings to be correct.""

"Bolton has had its highest seven-day rate since late May A Covid spike in Bolton and Trafford has prompted council bosses to ask for restrictions to remain in place, a day before they were due to be lifted. Tighter rules were introducedin July in Greater Manchester and parts of Yorkshire after concerns the virus was being spread between households. Bolton currently has one of the highest rates of new virus cases per 100,000 residents in England. Its council said it had made the decision ""with a heavy heart"". On Friday, the government said measures banning people from different households from meeting indoors or private gardens would be lifted in Bolton, Stockport, Trafford, Burnley, Hyndburn and parts of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees. But Bolton Council said the ""unforeseen spike"" in the local infection rate means restrictions should remain in place ""until further notice"". Bolton has recorded 170 new cases in the week to 29 August, up from 53 the week before, meaning it has one of the highest rates in England at 59 new cases per 100,000 residents. The rate in Trafford has risen from 19.4 to 35.4, with 84 new cases. Tighter Covid-19 rules were introduced in Greater Manchester in July The decision would also mean certain businesses, including those offering close-contact services, will not reopen as planned. Bolton council leader David Greenhalgh said: ""It is with a heavy heart that [we] have come to this decision and this will be incredibly disappointing for both residents and business owners. ""We urged the government to lift Bolton out of the additional restrictions at a time when infection rates were low. This was the right decision at the time. ""However, there has been a sudden and unforeseeable rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Bolton. ""We have always been led by the data, which means we have no choice but to act quickly to keep everyone safe."" The council said new cases in Bolton were spread across the borough and not limited to a single area, community or place of work. Infections between different households appear to be the main cause of the spike, with people aged 18-49 representing the overwhelming majority of new cases, it said. Meanwhile, Trafford recorded its highest seven-day infection rate since the end of July when the additional restrictions were imposed. Council leader Andrew Western had previously argued lifting restrictions there would be ""premature"" and the government had ignored the advice of local public health officials. In a letter to the health secretary, he accused the government of causing ""chaos and confusion"" over the easing of lockdown measures in the borough. He said Trafford has a ""significantly"" higher rate of cases than other Greater Manchester boroughs who are not due to see restrictions relaxed. Mr Western has called for an ""urgent update"", saying ""the people of Trafford deserve better"". Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA), which is made up of the 10 Greater Manchester councils and mayor Andy Burnham, has called on the government to agree on an exit strategy from the local restrictions on household gatherings. ""It is clear that more targeted, hyper-local door-to-door action is more effective than broad geographical restrictions,"" said a GMCA spokesperson. ""As soon as practically and safely possible, we want to see the whole of Greater Manchester coming back into line with the rest of country but with funding to provide enhanced local interventions where they are needed. ""However, before that is in place, it is accepted that the restrictions will need to continue in eight boroughs in the short term."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are working closely with leaders and local authorities across Greater Manchester and Lancashire in response to the changing situation and we keep all local restrictions under constant consideration.""

"Travellers re-entering the UK from Greece currently do not have to quarantine Quarantine restrictions will be imposed on people travelling from Greece to Scotland, the Scottish government has announced. They will be required to isolate for 14 days if they arrive in Scotland after 04:00 on Thursday. Ministers said they have taken the move due to a ""significant rise"" in cases of Covid-19 being brought into Scotland from people who have been to Greece. It has been linked to travellers returning from the Greek islands. As a result, the country has been been removed from the ""travel corridor"" exemption list on public health grounds. The prevalence of Covid-19 in Greece is currently about 20 per 100,000, but a number of cases of the virus in Scotland have been traced back to travel from Greece. They include apassenger who flew to Glasgow from Zanteon 23 August. The deputy first minister, John Swinney,told Good Morning Scotlandthat there had been ""an increased number of cases coming in from Greece as a consequence of international travel"". He said: ""We judge, based on the evidence available to us, there is a necessity to apply that quarantine restriction and that's to essentially protect us here in Scotland from a spread of the virus as a consequence of importation from other countries."" Asked why the restriction covered the whole of Greece when media reports suggested there was a particular problem with some islands, Mr Swinney said: ""The whole process of travel can generate some of the cases that are taking their course"". So he said it was ""proportionate"" and designed to ""give us as much protection as possible here domestically to avoid a rise in cases and that's what we're trying to avoid at all possible costs"". He added that it was important to take proportionate and targeted action where it was possible to do so. Travellers returning to the UK from the Greek island of Zante have tested positive for coronavirus Scotland's chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith said: ""There is a compelling public health risk around importation of the virus, especially given the number of imported cases linked to the Greek islands. ""The flow of travel between Scotland and Greece, and the behaviour we have seen from some of those travellers, means that on public health grounds there is a strong case - supported by public health directors - to remove Greece from the exemption list."" Greece's Tourism MinisterHarry Theoharis said the restrictions were ""a bit harsh"",external. He said every country had a right to protect its citizens, but that Greece was ""well below"" the 20 cases per 100,000 threshold that the UK nations use as a guide for imposing quarantine restrictions on returning travellers. Mr Theoharis added: ""We have put in place a comprehensive set of protocols and measures... We take targeted measures where we see concentration."" He added that Greece conducted the fifth most tests in Europe. ""We feel that we have taken every possible precaution"", he added. People travelling to Scotland from these countries are subjectquarantine restrictions,external. Holidaymakers have tested positive for coronavirus after flights to the UK from Zante Travellersarriving home to Walesfrom Zante are also being asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there were six clusters of cases, amounting to 30 infections, linked to flights from the Greek island. Meanwhile, ministers are considering re-imposing quarantine measuresfor those arriving in the UK from Portugalas coronavirus cases rise, sources have told the BBC. The UK considers imposing quarantine on travellers when a country's infection rate exceeds 20 cases per 100,000, over seven days. But each of the four nationsÂ can add or remove countries to their own list. Mike Tibbert, vice president of the Scottish Passenger Agents' Association, said he is ""extremely concerned"" about the workload being placed on its members by the changing quarantine rules. ""The removal of Greece in this ongoing hokey-cokey of countries which are 'in or out' means it's impossible for Scots to plan or reorganise a holiday which they have already paid for. And equally impossible for our members to run a business,"" he said. IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland? CASES:Where are the latest cases in Scotland?

"This video can not be played Trump on police: 'They choke sometimes' US President Donald Trump has visited Kenosha, Wisconsin, to back law enforcement after the police shooting of a black man sparked civil strife. The Republican president blamed ""domestic terror"" for the ""destruction"" in the Midwestern city. Kenosha saw days of violence after police shot Jacob Blake in the back and left him paralysed on 23 August. Mr Trump has been lagging behind Joe Biden in opinion polls, although some polls have tightened in recent weeks. The president is pushing a campaign message of ""law and order"" - however, Mr Biden has accused Mr Trump of stoking racial division. ""Fires are burning and we have a president who fans the flames rather than fighting the flames,"" the former US vice-president said ahead of Mr Trump's trip on Tuesday. A police officer shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back during an arrest as the 29-year-old tried to get into a car where his three children were seated. The president visited areas damaged in the protests, including a burnt-out furniture store and camera shop destroyed in the upheaval. ""These are not acts of peaceful protest, but really domestic terror,"" he later told local business leaders at a round table meeting in a high school gym. Mr Trump defended the actions of US police and accused the media of focusing only on ""bad"" incidents involving officers. ""You have people that choke,"" he said. ""They are under tremendous pressure. And they may be there for 15 years and have a spotless record and all of a sudden they're faced with a decision. They have a quarter of a second to make a decision. And if they make a wrong decision, one way or the other, they're either dead or they're in big trouble. ""And people have to understand that. They choke sometimes."" The president also expressed sympathy for those hurt in confrontations with police, saying he felt ""terribly for anybody who goes through that"". But he said he did not believe there was systemic racism in law enforcement. As part of his ""law and order"" messaging, Mr Trump said he sent the National Guard into Kenosha. However, in reality they were deployed by Wisconsin's governor and supported by 200 federal law enforcement officials ordered in by the president. Mr Trump also said his administration would provide nearly $4m (Â£3m) to help Kenosha businesses that had been damaged in the riots and $1m for city law enforcement. Demonstrators have accused outside agitators of violently hijacking their protests. Kenosha police said at the weekend that 105 out of 175 suspects arrested during the unrest came from outside the city. Jacob Blake's father said his son was ""holding on for dear life"" The president said he did not meet Jacob Blake's family because they had wanted lawyers present. Mr Trump instead said he was honoured to have the African-American co-pastors of Mr Blake's mother at the roundtable. Co-pastor Sharon Ward said: ""I think it's important to have black people at the table to help solve the problem."" Earlier inan interview with CNN,external, Mr Blake's father, Jacob Blake Snr, said his son's life was more important than a meeting with President Trump. This video can not be played Jacob Blake's sister: 'I have been watching police murder people that look like me for years' ""I'm not getting into politics. It's all about my son, man. It has nothing to do with a photo op,"" he said. Mr Blake Snr said his son was still paralysed from the waist down, ""holding on for dear life"". Jacob Blake shooting: What we know Two incidents, two different police responses Mr Trump's visit to Kenosha went ahead despite appeals from the Democratic mayor and governor to stay away. Over the weekend Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian said it was not a good time for Mr Trump to visit. ""Realistically, from our perspective, our preference would have been for him not to be coming at this point in time,"" he told National Public Radio. Wisconsin's Democratic Governor Tony Evers also warned against the visit, saying it would ""hinder our healing"". Mr Trump posed in front of a burned down camera shop with a man he wrongly claimed to be the business owner Congressman Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat who grew up in Kenosha, said on Twitter the president visited the city ""to spread hate"". Kenosha business owner Tom Gram, whose century-old camera shop was destroyed in the riots, said that he had refused a request from the White House to appear with Mr Trump when he toured the ruined buildings. ""I think everything he does turns into a circus and I just didn't want to be involved in it,""Mr Gram told WTMJ-TV,external. Mr Trump later appeared at the building with the property owner, who he wrongly told reporters was the business owner. Mr Gram said the footage shocked him, and that he disagreed with the message Mr Trump was sending. ""I think he needs to bring this country together rather than divide it,"" he said, adding: ""I think there's a lot of good people in this community and to say that only law enforcement is correct is not the message we need to hear right now."" President Trump flew straight into the latest hotspot in this incendiary summer of racial reckoning, even though the governor asked him not to come. Democrats have accused the president of fanning the flames of unrest. He has focused on the violence that's accompanied some protests rather than the grievances of the anti-racism demonstrators. Mr Trump told us he thought his message was helping to bridge racial divides because black and Hispanic Americans were also against crime and he was about ""law and order"". Almost certainly the president sees a political opportunity by visiting this Midwestern town in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin. Kenosha has emerged as the new epicentre of the debate over race and violence and how each presidential candidate will handle this explosive issue.

"Thousands more people in England with type 2 diabetes will be offered the chance to try a soup-and-shake diet weight-loss plan for free on the NHS. Studies show switching to the low-calorie liquid diet can put diabetes into remission. Experts say they want to help people to be as fit as possible, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are linked and both increase the risk of complications from Covid-19. Coronavirus: Diabetic people offered support Some NHS patientshave already benefitedfrom the year-long diet and exercise plan, which is why NHS England wants to expand the scheme to more people. People living with type 2 diabetes who are an unhealthy weight and have been diagnosed with the condition in the last six years will be considered for the scheme. After a few months on the shakes and soups, when some weight loss has been achieved, solid foods are reintroduced, with support to help the person maintain a nutritious diet and regular exercise. Results from one trial showedalmost half of those who went on the diet achieved remission of their type 2 diabetes after one year. It is a common condition that causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to become too high It is caused by problems with a chemical in the body (hormone) called insulin Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can include excessive thirst, needing to urinate a lot and tiredness It can increase the risk of getting serious problems with the eyes, heart and nerves Some cases are linked to being overweight Type 1 diabetes  is an autoimmune disease that is not linked to being overweight. Prof Jonathan Valabhji, NHS national clinical director for diabetes and obesity, said: ""This is the latest example of how the NHS, through our Long Term Plan, is rapidly adopting the latest evidence-based treatments to help people stay well, maintain a healthy weight and avoid major diseases. ""There has never been a more important time to lose weight and put their type 2 diabetes into remission, so it's good news for thousands of people across the country that practical, supportive measures like this are increasingly available on the NHS."" Bev, who was one of the first patients to benefit from the diet during trials, said: ""My goal for the first eight weeks of the low-calorie diet was to lose 5% of my body weight - which I achieved in six weeks - and in total I've lost over 10kg, my type 2 diabetes is now in remission and I no longer have to take any medication - I am over the moon. ""Since the low-calorie diet programme, my mindset has totally changed for the better and I look at food differently now - my shopping habits are far healthier and, when I eat out, I'll go for a healthier option. The programme has taught me moderation.""

"Bolton has had its highest seven-day rate since late May A Covid spike in Bolton and Trafford has prompted council bosses to ask for restrictions to remain in place, a day before they were due to be lifted. Tighter rules were introducedin July in Greater Manchester and parts of Yorkshire after concerns the virus was being spread between households. Bolton currently has one of the highest rates of new virus cases per 100,000 residents in England. Its council said it had made the decision ""with a heavy heart"". On Friday, the government said measures banning people from different households from meeting indoors or private gardens would be lifted in Bolton, Stockport, Trafford, Burnley, Hyndburn and parts of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees. But Bolton Council said the ""unforeseen spike"" in the local infection rate means restrictions should remain in place ""until further notice"". Bolton has recorded 170 new cases in the week to 29 August, up from 53 the week before, meaning it has one of the highest rates in England at 59 new cases per 100,000 residents. The rate in Trafford has risen from 19.4 to 35.4, with 84 new cases. Tighter Covid-19 rules were introduced in Greater Manchester in July The decision would also mean certain businesses, including those offering close-contact services, will not reopen as planned. Bolton council leader David Greenhalgh said: ""It is with a heavy heart that [we] have come to this decision and this will be incredibly disappointing for both residents and business owners. ""We urged the government to lift Bolton out of the additional restrictions at a time when infection rates were low. This was the right decision at the time. ""However, there has been a sudden and unforeseeable rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Bolton. ""We have always been led by the data, which means we have no choice but to act quickly to keep everyone safe."" The council said new cases in Bolton were spread across the borough and not limited to a single area, community or place of work. Infections between different households appear to be the main cause of the spike, with people aged 18-49 representing the overwhelming majority of new cases, it said. Meanwhile, Trafford recorded its highest seven-day infection rate since the end of July when the additional restrictions were imposed. Council leader Andrew Western had previously argued lifting restrictions there would be ""premature"" and the government had ignored the advice of local public health officials. In a letter to the health secretary, he accused the government of causing ""chaos and confusion"" over the easing of lockdown measures in the borough. He said Trafford has a ""significantly"" higher rate of cases than other Greater Manchester boroughs who are not due to see restrictions relaxed. Mr Western has called for an ""urgent update"", saying ""the people of Trafford deserve better"". Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA), which is made up of the 10 Greater Manchester councils and mayor Andy Burnham, has called on the government to agree on an exit strategy from the local restrictions on household gatherings. ""It is clear that more targeted, hyper-local door-to-door action is more effective than broad geographical restrictions,"" said a GMCA spokesperson. ""As soon as practically and safely possible, we want to see the whole of Greater Manchester coming back into line with the rest of country but with funding to provide enhanced local interventions where they are needed. ""However, before that is in place, it is accepted that the restrictions will need to continue in eight boroughs in the short term."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are working closely with leaders and local authorities across Greater Manchester and Lancashire in response to the changing situation and we keep all local restrictions under constant consideration.""

"Talks will be held to decide if action is needed to tackle the spread of coronavirus cases in the Glasgow area, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The first minister said 66 of the 154 new cases reported in Scotland had been in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area. She said this was ""causing us some concern"" and that further analysis was being carried out. Ms Sturgeon will chair a meeting of the Scottish government's resilience committee on Tuesday afternoon. The first minister said it would discuss whether ""further action"" is necessary to prevent the spread of the virus. The latest figurespublished by the Scottish government,externalshowed that 66 new cases were recorded by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHS GGC), while 27 were detected by NHS Lanarkshire. The rate of new positive cases over the first two weeks in August had averaged eight per day in NHS GGC. The overall figure represents 1.2% of those tested, and brings the total number of cases to 20,632. Contact tracing is continuing for identified clusters in Glasgow, Forth Valley and the Highlands. The first minister's concern stems from the soaring numbers of positive cases taking NHS GGC closer to the same point where local restrictions were introduced in Aberdeen. In a paper submitted to its 25 August board meeting, NHS GGC points out the local lockdown in Aberdeen was triggered at about 30 cases per day, the equivalent to a rate of 14 cases per 100,000 population. A similar incidence within NHS GGC would equate to 84 cases notified on a single day - 18 more than the latest number of daily cases reported on Tuesday. The health board, according to its 25 August board paper, was planning to ensure capacity in its test and protect team for an average of 40 daily cases with a daily variation capable of responding to a spike of up to 80 cases. Any fresh restrictions on the NHS GGC area are significant because it serves 1.14 million people, about 20% of Scotland's total population, and covering six local council areas - East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow City, Inverclyde, Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire. Lockdowns have also been introduced in places with similar populations to Greater Glasgow. In July, measures were put in place in Greater Manchester to stop separate households mixing. The types of restrictions varied from area to area and are now being lifteddespite concerns about recent spikes. The Greater Glasgow area has seen a number of localised clusters in recent weeks including ones in a pharmacy, schools and Low Moss prison.

"This video can not be played Trump on police: 'They choke sometimes' US President Donald Trump has visited Kenosha, Wisconsin, to back law enforcement after the police shooting of a black man sparked civil strife. The Republican president blamed ""domestic terror"" for the ""destruction"" in the Midwestern city. Kenosha saw days of violence after police shot Jacob Blake in the back and left him paralysed on 23 August. Mr Trump has been lagging behind Joe Biden in opinion polls, although some polls have tightened in recent weeks. The president is pushing a campaign message of ""law and order"" - however, Mr Biden has accused Mr Trump of stoking racial division. ""Fires are burning and we have a president who fans the flames rather than fighting the flames,"" the former US vice-president said ahead of Mr Trump's trip on Tuesday. A police officer shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back during an arrest as the 29-year-old tried to get into a car where his three children were seated. The president visited areas damaged in the protests, including a burnt-out furniture store and camera shop destroyed in the upheaval. ""These are not acts of peaceful protest, but really domestic terror,"" he later told local business leaders at a round table meeting in a high school gym. Mr Trump defended the actions of US police and accused the media of focusing only on ""bad"" incidents involving officers. ""You have people that choke,"" he said. ""They are under tremendous pressure. And they may be there for 15 years and have a spotless record and all of a sudden they're faced with a decision. They have a quarter of a second to make a decision. And if they make a wrong decision, one way or the other, they're either dead or they're in big trouble. ""And people have to understand that. They choke sometimes."" The president also expressed sympathy for those hurt in confrontations with police, saying he felt ""terribly for anybody who goes through that"". But he said he did not believe there was systemic racism in law enforcement. As part of his ""law and order"" messaging, Mr Trump said he sent the National Guard into Kenosha. However, in reality they were deployed by Wisconsin's governor and supported by 200 federal law enforcement officials ordered in by the president. Mr Trump also said his administration would provide nearly $4m (Â£3m) to help Kenosha businesses that had been damaged in the riots and $1m for city law enforcement. Demonstrators have accused outside agitators of violently hijacking their protests. Kenosha police said at the weekend that 105 out of 175 suspects arrested during the unrest came from outside the city. Jacob Blake's father said his son was ""holding on for dear life"" The president said he did not meet Jacob Blake's family because they had wanted lawyers present. Mr Trump instead said he was honoured to have the African-American co-pastors of Mr Blake's mother at the roundtable. Co-pastor Sharon Ward said: ""I think it's important to have black people at the table to help solve the problem."" Earlier inan interview with CNN,external, Mr Blake's father, Jacob Blake Snr, said his son's life was more important than a meeting with President Trump. This video can not be played Jacob Blake's sister: 'I have been watching police murder people that look like me for years' ""I'm not getting into politics. It's all about my son, man. It has nothing to do with a photo op,"" he said. Mr Blake Snr said his son was still paralysed from the waist down, ""holding on for dear life"". Jacob Blake shooting: What we know Two incidents, two different police responses Mr Trump's visit to Kenosha went ahead despite appeals from the Democratic mayor and governor to stay away. Over the weekend Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian said it was not a good time for Mr Trump to visit. ""Realistically, from our perspective, our preference would have been for him not to be coming at this point in time,"" he told National Public Radio. Wisconsin's Democratic Governor Tony Evers also warned against the visit, saying it would ""hinder our healing"". Mr Trump posed in front of a burned down camera shop with a man he wrongly claimed to be the business owner Congressman Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat who grew up in Kenosha, said on Twitter the president visited the city ""to spread hate"". Kenosha business owner Tom Gram, whose century-old camera shop was destroyed in the riots, said that he had refused a request from the White House to appear with Mr Trump when he toured the ruined buildings. ""I think everything he does turns into a circus and I just didn't want to be involved in it,""Mr Gram told WTMJ-TV,external. Mr Trump later appeared at the building with the property owner, who he wrongly told reporters was the business owner. Mr Gram said the footage shocked him, and that he disagreed with the message Mr Trump was sending. ""I think he needs to bring this country together rather than divide it,"" he said, adding: ""I think there's a lot of good people in this community and to say that only law enforcement is correct is not the message we need to hear right now."" President Trump flew straight into the latest hotspot in this incendiary summer of racial reckoning, even though the governor asked him not to come. Democrats have accused the president of fanning the flames of unrest. He has focused on the violence that's accompanied some protests rather than the grievances of the anti-racism demonstrators. Mr Trump told us he thought his message was helping to bridge racial divides because black and Hispanic Americans were also against crime and he was about ""law and order"". Almost certainly the president sees a political opportunity by visiting this Midwestern town in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin. Kenosha has emerged as the new epicentre of the debate over race and violence and how each presidential candidate will handle this explosive issue.

"Young people will be guaranteed a job, education or formal training under a new Scottish government scheme. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the ""youth guarantee"" was aimed at ensuring young people do not carry the ""economic scars"" of coronavirus into adulthood. The Â£60m initiative will be backed by additional money for apprenticeships. It was announced as Ms Sturgeonset out her government's plans,externalfor the next year. Under the proposals, everyone aged between 16 and 24 in Scotland will be guaranteed ""an opportunity at university or college, an apprenticeship programme, employment including work experience, or participating in a formal volunteering programme"". Live reaction to the programme for government Indyref2 plans to be published in draft bill Scotland to get dedicated Covid-19 tracing app Ms Sturgeon said further details of the scheme would be outlined on Wednesday. And she said the guarantee ""signals our absolute determination that youth unemployment will not be a legacy of this pandemic."" The number of people in work in Scotland has beenhit hard by the coronavirus lockdown, with a sharp rise in those claiming benefits andmore than 700,000 staff placed on furlough. Other measures outlined in the programme for government included: A new""proximity tracing app""to help combat the spread of Covid-19 ""Examining and setting out options"" for the creation of a National Care Service A Â£25m fund to provide retraining opportunities for 10,000 people who have lost their jobs or are at risk of doing so Details of how Â£1.6bn of the Â£2bn Green New Deal that was unveiled last year will be spent, including measures aimed at decarbonising the way homes are heated, reducing emissions, tackling fuel poverty and a Â£100m Green Jobs fund Providing an ""electronic device, unlimited data and two years of digital support and training"" to  50,000 people who ""would otherwise be without digital access"" Introducing legislation on domestic abuse protection orders and progressing legislation to improve forensic medical examinations for victims of sexual assault The first minister also announced that there would be a draft bill on a second independence referendum - as shedid in her programme for government in 2016,external. This will include the government's preferred question that would be asked, and ""the timescale in which we consider the referendum should be held"". Allow Twitter content?

It says that this timescale would ""take account of the current state of the Covid-19 pandemic at the time of publication of the draft bill."" However, there is no prospect of the bill being passed before the next Scottish Parliament election in May - with Ms Sturgeon instead saying that the SNP would seek to ""make the case"" for the plan in the election campaign. The government hasalready shelved a series of billswhich will not be taken forward because of the pandemic, including proposals for a tourist tax and reforms to the Gender Recognition Act. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government would publish a draft bill on a second independence referendum Ms Sturgeon stressed that suppressing the virus was her ""most immediate priority"" - and would continue to be so ""for some time"". She added: ""Put simply, if Covid runs rampant again, our economy will sustain even deeper, longer lasting damage. ""However, we will not simply hunker down and wait for the storm to pass. ""Even amidst the uncertainties of a global pandemic, this is a time to be ambitious and to use the disruption of Covid to rethink how we do things."" The first minister said the NHS Louisa Jordan hospital at the SEC in Glasgow will open through the winter. And eligibility for the flu vaccine will be extended to ""everyone over the age of 55, social care workers and those who live with shielded people. The Scottish Conservatives said the programme for government fails to meet the challenges facing people in the ""real world"", and said Ms Sturgeon should be doing more to protect small businesses from ""the damage of local lockdown and business rates revaluations"",. Party leader Douglas Ross said: ""This was the moment where the first minister could have put selfish, narrow interests to one side and united the country. ""Instead, we're told the solution is another Referendum Bill, only this time in the middle of a pandemic. ""The fundamental difference between our outlook is this: I know Scotland can succeed today, the first minister thinks we can't until the SNP get their way with separation."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard welcomed Ms Sturgeon's commitment to ""take the first step on the road to a National Care Service"", but warned that ""time is running out"" to support care homes. He also welcomed employment support plans, but said promises about new green jobs had been made before without resulting in any progress, saying: ""How do we know that this time we won't simply go back to how things were?"" Green MSP Alison Johnstone welcomed Ms Sturgeon's pledge to build a ""fairer and greener Scotland"", but said work must begin immediately. government should ""step up the urgency"", adding: ""Work to build a fairer and greener Scotland is welcome, but the work to do that must begin now."" And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the government had failed to deliver on past promises, calling for a faster rollout of free childcare hours and a ""recovery plan"" for child mental health services. This programme is first of all a response to the health and economic crises caused by Covid-19. A youth guarantee of education, training or employment for young people is the centre piece of action on jobs. A review of adult social care with the promise to create a National Care Service is an eye-catching commitment for older people, worst-hit by the pandemic. That reform would probably take years to fulfil - which highlights another key thing about today's programme. It is a pre-election package. With a Holyrood vote due in May 2021, the first minister is also indicating what she would do if returned to office. That includes pushing for another independence referendum, with a draft bill setting out the proposed timetable and question to be published soon.

"This video can not be played All you need to know about Wales' schools returning full-time Exams in Wales could be delayed in 2021, following the cancellation of this year's tests. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said discussions would be held with regulator Qualifications Wales. There have been calls for the examsto be cancelled again, but Ms Williams said she intended for them to go ahead. There could be changes to how the qualifications are taught, with exam board WJEC looking at making changes like reducing set texts. It follows controversy in August at the way A-level results were provided,before the system to judge pupils' grades was scrappedin favour of teacher assessments. Exams in England are likely to be delayedwhere a UK government minister has promised a decision ""very soon"". Children will head back to the classroom across Wales this week. Amid concerns about coronavirus, truancy fines will not be issued if pupils do not attend at the start of the school year, but this plan will be reviewed as the term develops. Students had called on the government to use teacher-predicted grades Speaking at a Welsh Government press conference, Ms Williams said: ""It is our intention at this time, to hold examinations next year. ""There are discussions about when those examinations may take place."" The minister said Qualifications Wales was speaking to other UK regulators ""as to whether it would be wise to move those examinations to a different point in the year, primarily to maximise teaching"". But she said any delay would have a ""knock-on effect"" on matters such as progression and results day. Childcare uncertainty 'could block parents' work return' Unions call for school facemasks to be compulsory WJEC had been ""working on amendments to specs that will be taught this term, to make them as manageable as possible for schools"", Ms Williams said. That could include reducing case studies or set texts for literature students, changes she said ""go further"" than those made in England. Details of a review of 2020's exams were announced last week - it will provide recommendations for how next year's qualifications are handled. TheUK Labour Partyhas called for next summer's GCSE and A-level exams to be pushed back in England. Delyth Jewell of Plaid Cymru said the final report of the independent review is not due until mid-December, ""which is too close for those sitting exams in January 2021"". ""The Welsh Government has an opportunity now to cancel exams, rather than waste valuable time delaying what many feel will be an inevitable decision,"" she said. Meanwhile, Ms Williams said new funding was being provided to give reopening schools extra teachers and support. The Â£29m fund is targeted at Years 11, 12 and 13 as well as disadvantaged and vulnerable learners. It will also be used to provide extra coaching support, personalised learning programmes and resources for exam year pupils. Children in Wales start returning to school this week Children will be expected to wear their uniform when they go back to school, Ms Williams told the press conference. She said she wanted to see ""as much normality should be resumed"" where possible and it would be ""helpful"" if uniforms could be washed regularly, rather than being dry-cleaned. The minister said it was important school children are tested if they have suspected coronavirus. ""All children who are exhibiting a new continuous cough, temperature, loss of taste and smell, will be required to take a test. ""I appreciate that as we enter into the winter months, other potential illnesses could well be confused but at this stage any child, or member of staff in school, are exhibiting any of these signs they will need to be tested"". Kirsty Williams said discussions were ongoing about when next year's exams would be held Speaking earlier on BBC Wales Breakfast, Ms Williams said that in the first few days of the catch-up sessions before the summer break, some parents had been ""reluctant"" to send their children back. ""When parents saw other children were returning to school, that it was being done as safely and securely as possible, and that the children were getting so much out of going to school, we saw confidence growing,"" she said. ""We want to have reassuring conversations with parents, rather than threatening them with fines."" She added: ""At this stage it is absolutely appropriate that we have those conversations to understand why parents may have concerns, why they don't want to send their children back, and to work with parents, school by school, on an individual basis, to reassure them."" But Ms Williams stated the situation in schools would be reviewed as the term progressed. The UK's chief medical adviser has saidchildren are more likely to be harmed by not returning to school than if they catch coronavirus. But Ms Williams said while everything was being done to make sure schools were as safe as possible, there were ""no risk-free options"".

"This video can not be played Travel expert ""very, very concerned"" about Zante to Cardiff coronavirus flight Travellers arriving to Wales from Zante are being asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there are six clusters of cases, amounting to 30 infections, linked to flights from the Greek island. Passengers arriving on a TUI flight from Zante to Cardiff on Tuesday night have been offered Covid tests. TUI is also stoppingtrips to the island's party resort of Laganasas social distancing is being ignored. It comes after at least 16 people tested positive following a TUI flight from Zante to Cardiff Airport last week, where some claimed passengerswere not following Covid-19 rules. Passengers on the 22:40 BST arrival from Zante on Tuesday, also operated by TUI, received a letter asking them to self-isolate before leaving the airport. They will also be offered two Covid tests - one in 48 hours and another in eight days The flight was already in the air when the Welsh Government made the announcement. Travellers from Wales who arrive from other UK airports from the island - for example, someone from Cardiff who arrives at Bristol Airport - on Tuesday and Wednesday are being asked to arrange tests when they arrive home, and again in eight days. They are being told to self-isolate as well. Vaughan Gething said people returning from Zante posed a public health risk Meanwhile the Scottish government has announced that all people arriving from Greece will be asked toquarantine themselves for 14 daysfrom Thursday. Tui calls for 'regional travel corridors' Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? In a statement, Mr Gething said there are currently ""six clusters amounting to over 30 cases in the last week from four flights, of which two of these flights landed in England"". He said there were several examples of Covid-19 positive travellers who had not self-isolated on return to Wales. Vaughan Gething said there were six clusters of infections from four flights Mr Gething called for an ""early meeting with the UK government and devolved nations"" to discuss changing the rules so travellers from Greece are required to self-isolate. His comments came just shortly after the Scottish government announced its decision. ""Public Health Wales have expressed direct concerns about the public health risk posed by passengers returning to Cardiff this evening from Zante/Zakynthos. I share that concern,"" he said. ""It is almost certain that travellers returning to Wales from areas of higher Covid-19 incidence will lead to further seeding of infections within Wales. Travel into Wales from mainland Europe drove the first wave of Covid-19."" Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI UK and Ireland, said holidays to Laganas - which attracts groups of young people - would no longer be available from Thursday. ""Recent cases shows that some customers are not following social distancing and Covid safety measures,"" he said. ""It is therefore the right thing to do to protect and reduce a now identified potential risk to others by no longer offering holidays to this specific resort. ""The recent cases in Wales have highlighted a demographic of customers that have recently returned from Zante and subsequently tested positive. The main strip of Laganas has bars and clubs attracting young groups of holidaymakers ""As the only airline that flies between Cardiff and Zante it has allowed us to understand trends that may also be seen in other areas of the UK."" Some passengers on the flight to Cardiff last Tuesday said they had decided to self-isolate before they even learned about the positive case after they claimed rules were being broken. Stephanie Whitfield said the man next to her had a ""mask around his neck"" and ""people were taking their masks off and wandering up and down the aisles to talk to others"". But Nigel Harris, from Barry, who was on the plane, told BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammed show the flight home was a ""pretty standard flight"" and he did not see people walking up and down the plane. ""I had my facemask on from the time I left the hotel to the time I left Cardiff Airport and, in my experience, that was what I saw on the plane as well,"" he said. Mr Harris said staff were enforcing the rules and a number of tannoy announcements were made reminding people. TUI said in response: ""Following an initial investigation with our cabin crew we are confident that multiple announcements via the PA and individual conversations with customers to try to reinforce protocols took place and other customers on the flight have confirmed these findings to be correct.""

"In a normal year, more than a million UK tourists visit Portugal's Algarve coast Ministers are considering reimposing quarantine measures for those arriving in the UK from Portugal as coronavirus cases rise, sources have told the BBC. The country has recorded more than 20 cases per 100,000 people in the past week. Normally when a country surpasses that mark the UK government imposes 14 days of self-isolation on returning travellers. Ministers are expected to reach a decision on the measures by Thursday. They will also have to decide whether the UK as a whole should follow Scotland, which has made a decision toadd Greece to its own quarantine list, effective from 04:00 BST on Thursday. It is the first of the four UK nations - each of which can add or remove countries to their own list - to make a decision on Greece, following several reports of people in the UK testing positive after holidaying on the island of Zante. Wales, which says at least 16 people tested positive following a flight from the Greek island last week, says it has told passengers arriving on a plane at Cardiff Airport on Tuesday evening toself-isolate for 14 days. Meanwhile, some travel industry leaders have suggested quarantine rules should only apply to people returning from specific regions where case numbers are high, such as resort islands - rather than having whole countries blacklisted. Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? How to fly during a global pandemic It has been less than two weeks since Portugal came off the quarantine list and was put back on the UK's safe travel list, following a sustained period of falling cases in the country that put it below the ""20 per 100,000"" mark that satisfied the UK. But now holidaymakers are scrambling to return from the country amid fears the country is again about to be taken off the list, based on the latest data. EasyJet has sold out all of its flights from Faro - which serves the Algarve - to airports in Britain for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. And British Airways is selling seats on a flight from Faro to Heathrow on Thursday for Â£554, while the same journey can be made seven days later for just Â£139. Thousands of people have travelled from the UK to Portugal since the country was added to the UK's quarantine exemption list on 22 August. This video can not be played Tui boss Andrew Flintham says the government should consider ""regional travel corridors"" Portugal has recorded 21.1 virus cases per 100,000 people in the past week. The UK considers imposing  quarantine on travellers when a country's infection rate exceeds 20 cases per 100,000, over seven days. Over the past month, so-calledtravel corridors,external- which allow people to travel without having to self-isolate on their return - have been scrapped between England and at least 18 countries and territories. Ministers have said this cautious approach prevents coronavirus cases being imported. Andrew Flintham, head of Tui UK, has said the government should consider ""regional travel corridors"" - meaning quarantine measures would apply to people returning from regions over whole countries. He said there were fewer cases in the popular Algarve, where most tourists are, than elsewhere in Portugal. Using the example of Leicester, the first area in the UK to be placed under local lockdown, Mr Flintham told the BBC: ""In the UK we have a slightly different policy in the fact that we don't lock down the whole UK when the Leicester rate goes up. ""Can we apply the same kind of principle to almost allow us to operate to those places where the rates are low or are within those thresholds? ""We don't want to put anybody in danger but clearly it is not the same everywhere in a country,"" he added. It is not the first time Tui has urged the government against slapping blanket quarantines on whole countries. Mr Flintham previously called for ""regionalised"" policyafter quarantine measures were imposed on Spain in July. The travel industry had hoped that the quarantine rules could be eased for the Balearic and Canary Islands, as data suggested there were lower rates of infection there than in mainland Spain. Elsewhere, the boss of British Airways' parent firm, Willie Walsh, has accused the government of using ""arbitrary statistics to effectively ban 160 countries and in the process destroying the economy"". The ""ever-changing"" quarantine requirements meant ""the UK has officially hung up the 'closed' sign"", he said,writing in the Times.,external Last week, Switzerland, Jamaica and the Czech Republic joined France, Spain and a number of others on the UK's quarantine list. UK tourists have spent thousands of pounds on new flights and ferries, and endured long drives in a race to get home before quarantine measures kick in. The government has not commented on whether requirements for arrivals from Portugal will change again. As soon as Portugal came off the quarantine list less than two weeks ago, John Cushing and his 12-year-old daughter Georgie headed straight out to the Algarve where he has a villa. Now the quarantine rules look set to change, he's facing a quandary. ""It's very precarious at the moment,"" says the 61-year-old company director. ""My daughter and I won't be able to leave the house when we get back to the UK on Saturday and there's a risk of being fined because I won't be able to send her back to school on Monday. ""She's in tears because she wants to go back to school but Ryanair is charging Â£1,000 to get back before the possible cut-off point. ""It's a very difficult decision to make [to pay for the early flight home] and I'm not really enjoying myself here now."" FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal, making up the largest number of overseas tourists to the country. Most head to the Algarve in the south, drawn by sunny Atlantic beaches, picturesque fishing villages and golf courses. Over May and June, the Portuguese government reopened its restaurants, coffee shops, museums and beaches. Hotels have mainly reopened, but nightclubs remain closed. The government has warned that stricter measures will be put in place in mid-September as pupils return to school and some workers return to offices. As of 31 August, the UK recorded 24 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the past fortnight while Portugal recorded 35.7,according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,external.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Household visit ban returning in Glasgow area Restrictions on visiting other households have been reintroduced in Glasgow and two neighbouring areas after a rise in coronavirus cases. The new rules affect more than 800,000 people in Glasgow city, West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire. They are being told not to host people from other households in their own homes or visit another person's home. Therestrictions,externalcame into effect from midnight. They will last for two weeks, but will be reviewed after a week. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that 135 of the 314 new cases in Scotland over the past two days had been in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area. She said Covid-19 continued to be a dangerous and potentially deadly virus. ""It is spreading again, particularly in these three local authority areas, and we believe that, in these areas, it is spreading primarily as a result of household gatherings,"" she said. The restrictions affect 633,120 people living in Glasgow, 95,530 in East Renfrewshire and 88,930 in West Dunbartonshire. People living in those areas should also not visit someone else's home, no matter where it is. The only exception is for those in extended households, who can continue to meet indoors. Only essential indoor visits will be allowed in hospitals and care homes. People from different households can continue to meet outdoors as long as they follow the guidance, and outdoor visits to care homes are still permitted. ""I think this should be a wake-up call, not just for people in Glasgow city, West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire,"" said the first minister. ""It should be a wake-up call for all of us to stick to the guidelines and stop this virus spreading any further or any faster."" Ms Sturgeon said the reopening of schools had not been responsible for what had happened. She said a ""very small number"" of school-age children had tested positive for the virus, and that this had mostly been driven by community transmission. ""Part of the reason that we have to take tough action, where necessary, to minimise community transmission is to stop that becoming a problem for schools,"" she said. She added that the preventative action was designed to keep schools open and businesses operating. Ms Sturgeon had raised concerns earlier in the day after thelatest daily figures,externalshowed that 66 of the 154 new cases recorded in Scotland had been in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area. That compared with an average of eight cases a day in the same area in the first two weeks of August. The daily incidence rate of Covid-19 is now almost 33 new cases per 100,000 people in West Dunbartonshire, 22 in Glasgow and almost 19 in East Renfrewshire. The rate for the rest of Scotland is just over 10. The local lockdown which was imposed in Aberdeen last month had been triggered by a rate of 14 cases per 100,000 population. Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, said the announcement was a bitter blow to care homes in the three affected local authority areas. He told BBC Scotland'sThe Nine: ""Unfortunately it is the selfish behaviour and attitude of a few, who have put themselves first, which have meant that some of our most vulnerable citizens have been prevented from meeting their families. ""I am extremely disappointed that there will be hundreds of families not able to visit each other indoors in the next week or so."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

"More than 50 countries had suspended routes to the UK because of the rapid spread of a new variant of Covid, but some of them have now lifted those restrictions. On 24 December, theUK banned travel from South Africaamid concerns over another new strain of the virus linked to that country. People who have transited through South Africa in the past 10 days will also be banned. However, UK and Irish nationals as well as the UK visa holders and permanent residents are exempt, but they will have to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival. It had already been pretty difficult to travel abroad - because of quarantine rules either at your destination or when returning to the UK. Here are some of the requirements currently in place. EU countries held discussions on Tuesday and decided to lift the compete travel ban, allowing national citizens, foreign residents and key workers to travel from the UK to their home country, if they have a negative Covid test. But EU countries are free to set their own rules on border controls, so the exact rules vary from country to country. France:French citizens, British nationals living in France and hauliers are among those able to travel again - if they have had a recent negative test. Rapid ""lateral flow"" tests  - which give results in about 30 minutes - will be accepted. Netherlands: Anyone arriving from the UK will need to have had a so-called PCR test to enter. These can take more than 24 hours to turn around, as they need to be processed in a lab. Belgium: Between 23 and 31 December, only those who are resident in Belgium, Belgian citizens and a limited number of strictly necessary journeys will be allowed from the UK. No prior test is necessary, but there will be strict controls on the Passenger Locator form and a quarantine of 7 days, followed by a compulsory PCR test. Spain: Flights from Britain have been stopped until further notice, except for those carrying Spanish citizens or people with Spanish residency. Travellers have to present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival. Italy: Only Italian citizens will be allowed to return from the UK, along with those who urgently need to enter the country. They will have to have a PCR test before departing and spend two weeks in quarantine in Italy. Germany:Flights and passenger transport by rail, bus and ship is banned until 6 January. From 1 January 2021, transport operators can apply to the German authorities for an exemption to transport people who are resident in Germany. People arriving from the UK will need to either present a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours, or be tested when entering the country. Even with a negative test, travellers will have to self-isolate for 10 days, with the possibility for a test and release after five days Ireland:Passengers arriving by plane or ferry from England, Wales and Scotland are banned until 31 December, regardless of nationality. Essential workers are exempt China:Direct flights to and from the UK have been suspended indefinitely Canada:Passenger flights from the UK were stopped for 72 hours from midnight on Sunday (Monday 05:00 GMT), but on Christmas Eve the measure was extended indefinitely India:All flights from the UK are suspended until 31 December US:New York City has introduced quarantine rules for international travellers, who must stay for 14 days at the address they provided on arrival. Arrivals from the UK will be checked on by sheriff's deputies This isnot a complete list of countries, as so many have taken measures. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office hasupdates on the latest advice for UK travellers,externalto other countries. Many restrictions in place to limit the spread of coronavirus mean travel options are limited. InEngland, people who live in a tier four ""stay at home"" area or a tier three ""very high alert"" area have been told to avoid travel, including overnight stays, unless it is necessary. InWales, people can only travel internationally for essential reasons. From December 28, Wales will go in to a lockdown, meaning people should only leave their area for essential reasons. InNorthern Ireland, people have been told to ""avoid all unnecessary travel"" from 26 December, when a six-week lockdown starts. InScotland, people living in higher risk level three or four areas should avoid unnecessary travel. Most people arriving in the UK from many destinations - including British nationals - must quarantine for 10 days. Exceptions are made for the Common Travel Area - the Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - or people coming from countries in travel corridors with the UK. It means there have been only a small number of destinations with no restrictions at either end. What are the Covid regulations where you live? There are hopes that the newcoronavirus vaccineswill make travel to more destinations possible in the coming months. People arriving in England can now cut their quarantine period by at least half if they pay for a private Covid test after five days and it comes back negative. But the government will only allow certain test providers to take part in the scheme, and they havestruggled under the weight of demand. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also suggested rapid testing - which can give a result in under an hour - could eventually""open the way"" for quarantine-free travel.

"This video can not be played ""You should feel free, if you want to ask for help, to ask for help"" - Rashford speaks to BBC Breakfast's Sally Nugent Footballer Marcus Rashford has formed a taskforce with some of the UK's biggest food brands to try to help reduce child food poverty. The 22-year-old Manchester United forward successfully campaignedto extend free school meals this summer. He has written to MPs, outlining the help he feels some families still need. They include expanding the numbers who are eligible for free school meals - and offer them free food and activities  during school holidays in England. Mr Rashford has spoken about his own experiences of using a food voucher scheme as a child and was praised for pressing the government into a U-turn on the issue. The group of supermarkets, businesses and charities - including Aldi, Asda, Co-op, Deliveroo, FareShare, Food Foundation, Iceland, Kellogg's, Lidl, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose - have formed a taskforce and backed proposals from the National Food Strategy, an independent review of UK food policy. The taskforce is calling for three policy recommendations by the National Food Strategy to be funded by the government as soon as possible: Expanding free school meals to every child from a household on Universal Credit or equivalent, reaching an additional 1.5m children aged seven to 16 Expanding an existing school holiday food and activities programme to support all children on free school meals in all areas of England. instead of the current 50,000 children that are helped Increasing the value of the Healthy Start vouchers - which help parents with children under the age of four and pregnant women buy some basic foods - from Â£3.10 to Â£4.25 per week, and expanding it to all those on Universal Credit or equivalent, reaching an additional 290,000 people The taskforce says implementing the three recommendations would mark a ""unifying step to identifying a long-term solution to child poverty in the UK"". 'We go hungry so we can feed our children' 'Bare cupboards' as food bank use rises in pandemic 'Emergency food' for families with nothing to eat Tara Brown, from Essex, is one of those who benefited from the extended voucher scheme Tara Brown, 50, receives Universal Credit and disability allowance for her nine-year-old son, who has autism. She says the voucher scheme has been ""brilliant"" because he eats what she calls a restrictive diet - so prefers consistent packed lunches to free cooked meals at his school in Essex. ""It's been nice to be able to get it so that I know it's not eating into my weekly food budget that I put aside for our evening meals,"" she says. She wants to see vouchers become a permanent option for parents. ""I think it should be down to parental choice as to whether the money goes direct to the school or if the money goes via a voucher [for packed lunches] to the parents,"" she adds. ""For people that are, financially, in a much worse situation, who have children with this sort of avoidance of foods, then the voucher scheme has probably been an absolute godsend to them."" Mr Rashford said he was ""confident"" the group could help change lives ""for the better"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said the move to extend free school meals over the summer had been a ""short-term solution"" to stopping children from going hungry, but it ""wasn't going to work in the long run"". ""We had to think about the best way to do it, to think about how these families can eat long term and not have any issues,"" he said. Mr Rashford is hoping that, with a bigger team of experts around him, he might be able to help more children. ""We wanted to do it the best way we could, introduce the best people into our group, and see if using them [we] can push it even more."" By Reality Check The Department of Health defines food poverty, also referred to as food insecurity, as the inability to afford, or have access to  food to make up a healthy diet. Last year, the government announced that it would start measuring food insecurity through itsFamily Resources Survey,externaland that data would be available from 2021. Earlier this year, a YouGov poll commissioned by the Food Foundation suggestedthat 2.4 million (17%) children are living in food-insecure households.,external. Poor nutrition is acknowledged to be a factor in children's performance at school and pupils whose parents receive certain benefits are eligible forFree School Meals.,external In England, around 1.3 million children claimed Free School Meals in 2019 - about 15% of state-educated pupils. In his letter to MPs, Mr Rashford says he hopes the chancellor will find the funds to do so in his Budget and spending review ""without delay"". Schools minister Nick Gibb said he would be delighted to meet Mr Rashford, saying the footballer was ""right to draw the nation's attention"" to the matter. He told BBC Breakfast the government shared Mr Rashford's objective to alleviate child food poverty and would look at the policy recommendations. The first report of the National Food Strategy,external, which was commissioned by the government in 2019, aims to help create a food system in the UK that is healthy, affordable and sustainable. Food entrepreneur Henry Dimbleby, who is leading the National Food Strategy review, has said school meals are a ""fantastic way"" to get children eating well at school. ""The alternative to a school lunch is a packed lunch and only 1% of packed lunches have the nutritional value of a school meal,"" he said. ""If you look at packed lunches as children get less affluent, those packed lunches have increasingly low nutritional value."" The footballer met some of the families who benefited from the extended children's food voucher scheme Speaking on Breakfast, he said nutrition was the basis of equality of opportunity - ""you can't level up if you are not getting enough nutrition into your most vulnerable children"". He added that the status of food, dining halls and particularly school cooks needed to be raised, saying they were ""as important as any teacher"". Members of the taskforce have also pledged to spend the next six weeks using their platforms to share stories of those affected by child food insecurity in the UK. Richard Walker, Iceland's managing director, said it was an issue they cared about deeply and wanted to support Mr Rashford to effect positive change. Came through the ranks at Manchester United, having grown up in the city and joined the club at the age of seven At the age of 18, he was named as a sub for a Europa League tie against Midtjylland, but was drafted into the starting line-up when Anthony Martial was injured in the warm-up He went on to score two goals in that match, breaking George Best's record as Manchester United's youngest ever scorer in European competition That immediate impact meant he made his Premier League debut against Arsenal three days later He has nowscored 67 goals in 214 matches for the club,external He scored three minutes into his England debut against Australia He played for England at both Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup, where he converted a penalty in the famous shoot-out win over Colombia At the age of 22, he now has 38 England caps (more than World Cup winners George Cohen, Jack Charlton, Roger Hunt and Nobby Stiles) and has scored 10 international goals Mr Rashford has stressed the importance of tackling the stigma around child food poverty, and changing attitudes about asking for help. He told the BBC: ""I feel like at times people think they are being looked down on if they ask for help, and I think in this generation... that is something that should change. ""You should feel free if you want to ask for help for anything,"" he said. ""Hold your head up high and if you need help go and get help."" The footballer has met some of the families who have benefitted from the extended children's food voucher scheme, which he said had been an ""unbelievable experience"". ""Just to see the smiles on their faces and to see how much it's helped them, you know, made me happy,"" he said. ""It was good to see the parents laughing and smiling."" During the coronavirus lockdown the government provided vouchers to families whose children qualify for free meals, but it had insisted this would not continue into the summer holidays. This prompted the England footballerto write an open letter to MPs, drawing on his own experiences of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up in Wythenshawe, Manchester. He called on the government to reverse its decision - which it did shortly after he spoke out. The U-turn enabled about 1.3m children in England to claim vouchers over the holidays, with the support working out as about Â£15 a week for each child.

"In a normal year, more than a million UK tourists visit Portugal's Algarve coast Ministers are considering reimposing quarantine measures for those arriving in the UK from Portugal as coronavirus cases rise, sources have told the BBC. The country has recorded more than 20 cases per 100,000 people in the past week. Normally when a country surpasses that mark the UK government imposes 14 days of self-isolation on returning travellers. Ministers are expected to reach a decision on the measures by Thursday. They will also have to decide whether the UK as a whole should follow Scotland, which has made a decision toadd Greece to its own quarantine list, effective from 04:00 BST on Thursday. It is the first of the four UK nations - each of which can add or remove countries to their own list - to make a decision on Greece, following several reports of people in the UK testing positive after holidaying on the island of Zante. Wales, which says at least 16 people tested positive following a flight from the Greek island last week, says it has told passengers arriving on a plane at Cardiff Airport on Tuesday evening toself-isolate for 14 days. Meanwhile, some travel industry leaders have suggested quarantine rules should only apply to people returning from specific regions where case numbers are high, such as resort islands - rather than having whole countries blacklisted. Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? How to fly during a global pandemic It has been less than two weeks since Portugal came off the quarantine list and was put back on the UK's safe travel list, following a sustained period of falling cases in the country that put it below the ""20 per 100,000"" mark that satisfied the UK. But now holidaymakers are scrambling to return from the country amid fears the country is again about to be taken off the list, based on the latest data. EasyJet has sold out all of its flights from Faro - which serves the Algarve - to airports in Britain for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. And British Airways is selling seats on a flight from Faro to Heathrow on Thursday for Â£554, while the same journey can be made seven days later for just Â£139. Thousands of people have travelled from the UK to Portugal since the country was added to the UK's quarantine exemption list on 22 August. This video can not be played Tui boss Andrew Flintham says the government should consider ""regional travel corridors"" Portugal has recorded 21.1 virus cases per 100,000 people in the past week. The UK considers imposing  quarantine on travellers when a country's infection rate exceeds 20 cases per 100,000, over seven days. Over the past month, so-calledtravel corridors,external- which allow people to travel without having to self-isolate on their return - have been scrapped between England and at least 18 countries and territories. Ministers have said this cautious approach prevents coronavirus cases being imported. Andrew Flintham, head of Tui UK, has said the government should consider ""regional travel corridors"" - meaning quarantine measures would apply to people returning from regions over whole countries. He said there were fewer cases in the popular Algarve, where most tourists are, than elsewhere in Portugal. Using the example of Leicester, the first area in the UK to be placed under local lockdown, Mr Flintham told the BBC: ""In the UK we have a slightly different policy in the fact that we don't lock down the whole UK when the Leicester rate goes up. ""Can we apply the same kind of principle to almost allow us to operate to those places where the rates are low or are within those thresholds? ""We don't want to put anybody in danger but clearly it is not the same everywhere in a country,"" he added. It is not the first time Tui has urged the government against slapping blanket quarantines on whole countries. Mr Flintham previously called for ""regionalised"" policyafter quarantine measures were imposed on Spain in July. The travel industry had hoped that the quarantine rules could be eased for the Balearic and Canary Islands, as data suggested there were lower rates of infection there than in mainland Spain. Elsewhere, the boss of British Airways' parent firm, Willie Walsh, has accused the government of using ""arbitrary statistics to effectively ban 160 countries and in the process destroying the economy"". The ""ever-changing"" quarantine requirements meant ""the UK has officially hung up the 'closed' sign"", he said,writing in the Times.,external Last week, Switzerland, Jamaica and the Czech Republic joined France, Spain and a number of others on the UK's quarantine list. UK tourists have spent thousands of pounds on new flights and ferries, and endured long drives in a race to get home before quarantine measures kick in. The government has not commented on whether requirements for arrivals from Portugal will change again. As soon as Portugal came off the quarantine list less than two weeks ago, John Cushing and his 12-year-old daughter Georgie headed straight out to the Algarve where he has a villa. Now the quarantine rules look set to change, he's facing a quandary. ""It's very precarious at the moment,"" says the 61-year-old company director. ""My daughter and I won't be able to leave the house when we get back to the UK on Saturday and there's a risk of being fined because I won't be able to send her back to school on Monday. ""She's in tears because she wants to go back to school but Ryanair is charging Â£1,000 to get back before the possible cut-off point. ""It's a very difficult decision to make [to pay for the early flight home] and I'm not really enjoying myself here now."" FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal, making up the largest number of overseas tourists to the country. Most head to the Algarve in the south, drawn by sunny Atlantic beaches, picturesque fishing villages and golf courses. Over May and June, the Portuguese government reopened its restaurants, coffee shops, museums and beaches. Hotels have mainly reopened, but nightclubs remain closed. The government has warned that stricter measures will be put in place in mid-September as pupils return to school and some workers return to offices. As of 31 August, the UK recorded 24 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the past fortnight while Portugal recorded 35.7,according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,external.

"Search and rescue teams, along with fishermen, are combing the area for the missing crew member Three sailors have died and one is missing after their tugboat capsized while they were helping to clear a major oil spill off Mauritius. Four others were rescued after the boat collided with a barge on Monday. The accident happened two days aftermajor protests in Mauritius over the government's handling of the clean up. About 1,000 tonnes of oil spilled into a sanctuary for rare wildlife after the Japanese ship MV Wakashio struck a coral reef on 25 July. Concern mounted further after 39 dead dolphins were found washed up on the shore last week. The cause of their deaths is not yet known but environmental campaigners believe it is linked to the spill and are demanding an inquiry. Why the Mauritius oil spill is so serious Why do oil spills keep happening? What is Mauritius like? The tugboat had been towing the unmanned barge back from the spill site in rough seas when the collision between them happened, the barge operator Taylor Smith Group said.

Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth visited the rescued sailors in hospital and said rescue teams were searching for the missing crew members, the BBC's Yasine Mohabuth reports from the capital Port Louis. Mr Jugnauth has promised an investigation into the accident. His government has also promised to set up a commission to investigate the spill itself after coming under pressure over its handling of the incident. Many Mauritians believe the government could have done more to prevent the spill. There is also criticism over the decision to deliberately sink part of the ship after it split in two.

"White farmer Dave Wakefield (pictured in 2019) lost his farm in 2001 and now leases land from a black owner Zimbabwe has offered to return land to foreign nationals whose farms were seized under a controversial government programme two decades ago. Thousands of white farmers were forced from their land, often violently, between 2000 and 2001. The seizures were meant to redress colonial-era land grabs but contributed to the country's economic decline and ruined relations with the West. A separate compensation scheme has been launched for local white farmers. They have not been offered land, but the government last month promised them $3.5bn (Â£2.6bn) for seized infrastructure. Reality Check: What happened to Zimbabwe's land reforms? Who will compensate Zimbabwe's white farmers? Mugabe admits land reform flaws The US has said compensating farmers is one of the requirements for it to lift decades of economic sanctions. Zimbabwe on Monday said foreign citizens who had their land seized could now apply to get it back. Hundreds of Europeans - mostly Dutch, British and German nationals - whose investments were protected under international agreements could benefit from the offer, reports the BBC's Shingai Nyoka from the capital, Harare. The farms were taken under a controversial land reform programme launched by former President Robert Mugabe. He argued that this was to redress colonial-era land grabs, when much of the country's best land was reserved for the white population and black farmers were forced onto marginal areas. Under the programme, most of the country's 4,000 white farmers - then the backbone of Zimbabwe's agricultural economy - were forced from their land, which was handed over to about a million black Zimbabweans. In a joint statement on Monday, the ministers of finance and agriculture said some black farmers who received land under the programme would now be moved. To allow the former owners ""to regain possession"" of their land, the government will revoke offers made to black farmers currently occupying the farms and ""offer them alternative land elsewhere"", the statement said. The offer marks an important step in repairing relations with Western nations and avoiding international judgements against Zimbabwe worth hundreds of millions of dollars, our reporter says.

"Jacob Blake's father said his son was ""holding on for dear life"" after he was shot by a police officer The father of a black man shot by police has refused to ""play politics"" with his son's life when Donald Trump visits the city of Kenosha on Tuesday. Jacob Blake's shooting sparked a fresh wave of anti-racism protests in the US, prompting calls for President Trump to acknowledge him and his family. The president will meet police officers on the visit, but not the Blake family. The visit comes with ""law and order"" becoming highly politicised ahead of the 3 November presidential election. Jacob Blake shooting: What we know Blake reportedly released from handcuffs in hospital bed Two incidents, two different police responses In an interview with CNN,external, Mr Blake's father, Jacob Blake Sr, said his son's life was more important than a meeting with President Trump. ""I'm not getting into politics. It's all about my son, man. It has nothing to do with a photo op,"" he said. Local officials have urged Mr Trump to not visit Kenosha, in the state of Wisconsin, fearing his presence in the city may reignite protests that have calmed down in recent days. But Mr Trump has rejected their pleas, accusing Democratic mayors and governors of failing to get a grip on the violence. He is pushing a strong law and order message in his bid to a win a second term in the White House, although critics accuse him of stoking tensions. Ahead of the Kenosha trip, the president said he would not meet Mr Blake's family because they wanted lawyers to be present. Mr Trump has also defended a teenage supporter accused of fatally shooting two men amid demonstrations over Mr Blake's shooting. Who is US teen accused of Wisconsin protest murders? He suggested that Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was acting in self-defence, telling reporters: ""I guess he was in very big trouble, he probably would have been killed."" ""This is not politics. This is about the life of my son,"" Mr Blake Sr said, adding that his son was still paralysed from the waist down, ""holding on for dear life"". Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times in the back by a police officer during an arrest, as Mr Blake tried to get into a car where his three children were seated. ""We are dealing with an individual that a couple of weeks ago was running around with the boys and talking to me on the phone and laughing, to an individual that cannot move his leg,"" Mr Blake Sr said. This video can not be played Jacob Blake's sister: 'I have been watching police murder people that look like me for years' The officer involved in the shooting on 23 August, named as Rusten Sheskey, has been placed on administrative leave while an investigation takes place. Mr Blake Sr said that since his son's shooting he had ""received some threats"". Asked how his family was coping, Mr Blake Sr said he had had to take his other son, 20, to hospital because he was depressed. The father gave no further details but added: ""It's sad to me how people don't understand the kind of pressure this family is under."" The governor of the state, Democrat Tony Evers, has urged Mr Trump to reconsider his trip, warning his presence will ""hinder our healing"" and arguing that the citizens of the town are already traumatised. The White House said the president was expected to meet with law enforcement and tour ""property affected by recent riots"". This video can not be played Two people were killed and one injured on the third night of unrest Portland, Oregon, has also become a major flashpoint for demonstrations since a wave of Black Lives Matter protests were touched off by the killing of another African American - George Floyd - in May. Mr Floyd died in Minneapolis after a police officer knelt on his neck for a prolonged period during an arrest. In July, the Trump administration deployed federal forces to Portland, ostensibly to protect a federal courthouse and other federal property. But they were later withdrawn amid allegations their heavy-handed tactics only heightened the unrest. On Saturday night, right-wing activist Aaron ""Jay"" Danielson, 39, wasshot dead in the city after he was seen going to protect a caravan of Trump supporters,externalfrom counter protesters. Trump's crackdown on Portland protests explained Can Trump send in federal forces to quell violence? Asked to condemn supporters who had fired paint pellets during a confrontation with anti-racism demonstrators on the same night, Mr Trump described the protest as ""peaceful"" and said paint was ""a defensive mechanism, paint is not bullets"". He told a reporter: ""Your supporters, and they are your supporters indeed, shot a young gentleman...  and killed him, not with paint but with a bullet. And I think it's disgraceful."" Media reports say a man who calls himself an anti-fascist is being investigated over the death of Mr Danielson. Meanwhile,protests erupted in Los Angeles, California, on Monday night after an incident in which police shot dead a black man,externalin a southern neighbourhood of the city. Police say the man - named in local media as 29-year-old Dijon Kizzee - fled after officers spotted him riding a bicycle in violation of vehicle codes. According to the police, the man was shot at the end of a pursuit, after he allegedly struck an officer and dropped a bundle of clothing he was carrying. ""The deputies noticed that inside the clothing items that he dropped was a black semi-automatic handgun, at which time a deputy-involved shooting occurred,"" Lt Brandon Dean told reporters.

"This small zinc casket containing ex-mayor Pierre David's heart was in the fountain An ornate fountain in Verviers, eastern Belgium, has given up an object it held for more than a century: the heart of the city's first mayor. The organ, sealed in a jar of alcohol inside a small zinc casket, was found during renovation of the fountain. The casket is now on show in the city's Museum of Fine Arts. Mayor Pierre David died in 1839, but the fountain named after him was only inaugurated in 1883. An engraving on the casket says it was placed in the monument at the time. ""The heart of Pierre David was solemnly placed in the monument on 25 June 1883"", it reads. The casket was tucked away in this hollowed-out stone The Verviers Alderman for Public Works, Maxime Degey, said ""an urban legend has become reality: the casket was in the upper part of the fountain, right near the bust of Pierre David, behind a stone which we had removed during the fountain's renovation"". Quoted by broadcaster RTBF, he said the casket found by the builders on 20 August was ""in really impeccable condition"". The casket was hidden near the bust of Pierre David, nearly half-way up Mayor Pierre David died in a fall aged 68, while working in his hayloft in 1839. The city authorities launched a collection fund for a monument to honour him, and with his family's consent surgeons removed his heart, so that it could be entombed in the monument. The Verviers official website - verviers.be - says it then took decades for the city to collect enough money to erect a suitably ornate monument. Meanwhile there were also arguments over how best to honour the city's first mayor, before the fountain at Place Verte went ahead. The casket is in a special exhibition in Verviers Museum of Fine Arts He lived through turbulent times, including the establishment of Belgium as an independent state in 1830. He first served as Verviers mayor in 1800-1808, when today's Belgium was ruled from France. Later, Belgium's independence resulted from a revolution against Dutch rule in 1830, and in that year Pierre David was elected to serve as mayor again.

He was a Francophile who supported the ideology of the French Revolution, but then lived through the period of Dutch rule from 1815 to 1830. Verviers was badly damaged in the 1830 uprising, and Pierre David was given the task of restoring order in the city, as he was widely respected.

"This video can not be played ""You should feel free, if you want to ask for help, to ask for help"" - Rashford speaks to BBC Breakfast's Sally Nugent Footballer Marcus Rashford has formed a taskforce with some of the UK's biggest food brands to try to help reduce child food poverty. The 22-year-old Manchester United forward successfully campaignedto extend free school meals this summer. He has written to MPs, outlining the help he feels some families still need. They include expanding the numbers who are eligible for free school meals - and offer them free food and activities  during school holidays in England. Mr Rashford has spoken about his own experiences of using a food voucher scheme as a child and was praised for pressing the government into a U-turn on the issue. The group of supermarkets, businesses and charities - including Aldi, Asda, Co-op, Deliveroo, FareShare, Food Foundation, Iceland, Kellogg's, Lidl, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose - have formed a taskforce and backed proposals from the National Food Strategy, an independent review of UK food policy. The taskforce is calling for three policy recommendations by the National Food Strategy to be funded by the government as soon as possible: Expanding free school meals to every child from a household on Universal Credit or equivalent, reaching an additional 1.5m children aged seven to 16 Expanding an existing school holiday food and activities programme to support all children on free school meals in all areas of England. instead of the current 50,000 children that are helped Increasing the value of the Healthy Start vouchers - which help parents with children under the age of four and pregnant women buy some basic foods - from Â£3.10 to Â£4.25 per week, and expanding it to all those on Universal Credit or equivalent, reaching an additional 290,000 people The taskforce says implementing the three recommendations would mark a ""unifying step to identifying a long-term solution to child poverty in the UK"". 'We go hungry so we can feed our children' 'Bare cupboards' as food bank use rises in pandemic 'Emergency food' for families with nothing to eat Tara Brown, from Essex, is one of those who benefited from the extended voucher scheme Tara Brown, 50, receives Universal Credit and disability allowance for her nine-year-old son, who has autism. She says the voucher scheme has been ""brilliant"" because he eats what she calls a restrictive diet - so prefers consistent packed lunches to free cooked meals at his school in Essex. ""It's been nice to be able to get it so that I know it's not eating into my weekly food budget that I put aside for our evening meals,"" she says. She wants to see vouchers become a permanent option for parents. ""I think it should be down to parental choice as to whether the money goes direct to the school or if the money goes via a voucher [for packed lunches] to the parents,"" she adds. ""For people that are, financially, in a much worse situation, who have children with this sort of avoidance of foods, then the voucher scheme has probably been an absolute godsend to them."" Mr Rashford said he was ""confident"" the group could help change lives ""for the better"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said the move to extend free school meals over the summer had been a ""short-term solution"" to stopping children from going hungry, but it ""wasn't going to work in the long run"". ""We had to think about the best way to do it, to think about how these families can eat long term and not have any issues,"" he said. Mr Rashford is hoping that, with a bigger team of experts around him, he might be able to help more children. ""We wanted to do it the best way we could, introduce the best people into our group, and see if using them [we] can push it even more."" By Reality Check The Department of Health defines food poverty, also referred to as food insecurity, as the inability to afford, or have access to  food to make up a healthy diet. Last year, the government announced that it would start measuring food insecurity through itsFamily Resources Survey,externaland that data would be available from 2021. Earlier this year, a YouGov poll commissioned by the Food Foundation suggestedthat 2.4 million (17%) children are living in food-insecure households.,external. Poor nutrition is acknowledged to be a factor in children's performance at school and pupils whose parents receive certain benefits are eligible forFree School Meals.,external In England, around 1.3 million children claimed Free School Meals in 2019 - about 15% of state-educated pupils. In his letter to MPs, Mr Rashford says he hopes the chancellor will find the funds to do so in his Budget and spending review ""without delay"". Schools minister Nick Gibb said he would be delighted to meet Mr Rashford, saying the footballer was ""right to draw the nation's attention"" to the matter. He told BBC Breakfast the government shared Mr Rashford's objective to alleviate child food poverty and would look at the policy recommendations. The first report of the National Food Strategy,external, which was commissioned by the government in 2019, aims to help create a food system in the UK that is healthy, affordable and sustainable. Food entrepreneur Henry Dimbleby, who is leading the National Food Strategy review, has said school meals are a ""fantastic way"" to get children eating well at school. ""The alternative to a school lunch is a packed lunch and only 1% of packed lunches have the nutritional value of a school meal,"" he said. ""If you look at packed lunches as children get less affluent, those packed lunches have increasingly low nutritional value."" The footballer met some of the families who benefited from the extended children's food voucher scheme Speaking on Breakfast, he said nutrition was the basis of equality of opportunity - ""you can't level up if you are not getting enough nutrition into your most vulnerable children"". He added that the status of food, dining halls and particularly school cooks needed to be raised, saying they were ""as important as any teacher"". Members of the taskforce have also pledged to spend the next six weeks using their platforms to share stories of those affected by child food insecurity in the UK. Richard Walker, Iceland's managing director, said it was an issue they cared about deeply and wanted to support Mr Rashford to effect positive change. Came through the ranks at Manchester United, having grown up in the city and joined the club at the age of seven At the age of 18, he was named as a sub for a Europa League tie against Midtjylland, but was drafted into the starting line-up when Anthony Martial was injured in the warm-up He went on to score two goals in that match, breaking George Best's record as Manchester United's youngest ever scorer in European competition That immediate impact meant he made his Premier League debut against Arsenal three days later He has nowscored 67 goals in 214 matches for the club,external He scored three minutes into his England debut against Australia He played for England at both Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup, where he converted a penalty in the famous shoot-out win over Colombia At the age of 22, he now has 38 England caps (more than World Cup winners George Cohen, Jack Charlton, Roger Hunt and Nobby Stiles) and has scored 10 international goals Mr Rashford has stressed the importance of tackling the stigma around child food poverty, and changing attitudes about asking for help. He told the BBC: ""I feel like at times people think they are being looked down on if they ask for help, and I think in this generation... that is something that should change. ""You should feel free if you want to ask for help for anything,"" he said. ""Hold your head up high and if you need help go and get help."" The footballer has met some of the families who have benefitted from the extended children's food voucher scheme, which he said had been an ""unbelievable experience"". ""Just to see the smiles on their faces and to see how much it's helped them, you know, made me happy,"" he said. ""It was good to see the parents laughing and smiling."" During the coronavirus lockdown the government provided vouchers to families whose children qualify for free meals, but it had insisted this would not continue into the summer holidays. This prompted the England footballerto write an open letter to MPs, drawing on his own experiences of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up in Wythenshawe, Manchester. He called on the government to reverse its decision - which it did shortly after he spoke out. The U-turn enabled about 1.3m children in England to claim vouchers over the holidays, with the support working out as about Â£15 a week for each child.

"This video can not be played Chadwick Boseman: Five things to know Netflix delayed a virtual preview event for the film Ma Rainey's Black Bottom on Monday, following the death of its star, Chadwick Boseman. The film adaptation of August Wilson's play, about the queen of the blues and her band in the 1920s, will be his final movie performance. Boseman, who appears alongside Viola Davis and Colman Domingo, died of cancer last week aged 43. Tributes have been paid by producer Denzel Washington and Michael B Jordan. The Black Panther actor's diagnosis was kept entirely private and came as a shock to many in the film industry and beyond. 'A true superhero' - Chadwick Boseman remembered Black Panther director pays tribute to Boseman Netflix boss Ted Sarandos described Boseman as ""a superhero on screen and in life"". ""It's impossible to imagine working at the level he has while valiantly battling his illness,"" Sarandos said in a statement. ""His legacy as a person and an artist will inspire millions. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family during this difficult time,"" he added. In the forthcoming movie, Boseman plays the ambitious trumpet player Levee, who has desires for musical success of his own, and for Rainey's girlfriend. Davis, who plays the titular role, tweeted that it was ""an honour"" acting beside the star. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Boseman was not scheduled to appear at Monday's online event, but Davis and director George C Wolfe were due to take part in a Q&A session about the film, commenting on new preview footage. The late actor's family have confirmed he had completed all of his filming for the role, and Wolfe said that working with him was ""a glorious experience"". ""Every day we all got to witness the ferocity of his talent and the gentleness of his heart,"" he said. ""A truly blessed, loving, gifted and giving human being."" According to Variety,external, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is still due out this year, and ""there was no immediate word from Netflix about whether Boseman's death would impact its plans for the release"". The film has been produced by Oscar-winning actor, Washington, who in fact played a major role in Boseman's life and career. Washington paid for his tuition fees when the future star was studying at the British American Drama Academy. ""He was a gentle soul and a brilliant artist, who will stay with us for eternity through his iconic performances over his short yet illustrious career,""Washington told CNN,external. Boseman was viewed by many as the man who broke down screen barriers for black actors with his lead role as T'Challa/Black Panther in the Marvel superhero movie Black Panther in 2018. Michael B Jordan, who portrayed N'Jadaka/Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens in the film, paid tribute on social media on Monday to the man he called his ""big brother"". ""I've been trying to find the words, but nothing comes close to how I feel"", he posted, alongside a series of photos of the two of them together. ""I've been reflecting on every moment, every conversation, every laugh, every disagreement, every hug ... everything. ""I wish we had more time. One of the last times we spoke, you said we were forever linked, and now the truth of that means more to me than ever."" Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan acted opposite one another in Black Panther Jordan added that Boseman had ""paved the way for me"". ""You showed me how to be better, honour purpose, and create legacy,"" he wrote. ""I wish we had more time. Everything you've given the world... the legends and heroes that you've shown us we are... will live on forever."" He concluded that his friend's death had made him realise that ""time is short with people we love and admire,"" and promised to dedicate the rest of his life to living like him - ""with grace, courage, and no regrets"".

"Jacob Blake's father said his son was ""holding on for dear life"" after he was shot by a police officer The father of a black man shot by police has refused to ""play politics"" with his son's life when Donald Trump visits the city of Kenosha on Tuesday. Jacob Blake's shooting sparked a fresh wave of anti-racism protests in the US, prompting calls for President Trump to acknowledge him and his family. The president will meet police officers on the visit, but not the Blake family. The visit comes with ""law and order"" becoming highly politicised ahead of the 3 November presidential election. Jacob Blake shooting: What we know Blake reportedly released from handcuffs in hospital bed Two incidents, two different police responses In an interview with CNN,external, Mr Blake's father, Jacob Blake Sr, said his son's life was more important than a meeting with President Trump. ""I'm not getting into politics. It's all about my son, man. It has nothing to do with a photo op,"" he said. Local officials have urged Mr Trump to not visit Kenosha, in the state of Wisconsin, fearing his presence in the city may reignite protests that have calmed down in recent days. But Mr Trump has rejected their pleas, accusing Democratic mayors and governors of failing to get a grip on the violence. He is pushing a strong law and order message in his bid to a win a second term in the White House, although critics accuse him of stoking tensions. Ahead of the Kenosha trip, the president said he would not meet Mr Blake's family because they wanted lawyers to be present. Mr Trump has also defended a teenage supporter accused of fatally shooting two men amid demonstrations over Mr Blake's shooting. Who is US teen accused of Wisconsin protest murders? He suggested that Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was acting in self-defence, telling reporters: ""I guess he was in very big trouble, he probably would have been killed."" ""This is not politics. This is about the life of my son,"" Mr Blake Sr said, adding that his son was still paralysed from the waist down, ""holding on for dear life"". Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times in the back by a police officer during an arrest, as Mr Blake tried to get into a car where his three children were seated. ""We are dealing with an individual that a couple of weeks ago was running around with the boys and talking to me on the phone and laughing, to an individual that cannot move his leg,"" Mr Blake Sr said. This video can not be played Jacob Blake's sister: 'I have been watching police murder people that look like me for years' The officer involved in the shooting on 23 August, named as Rusten Sheskey, has been placed on administrative leave while an investigation takes place. Mr Blake Sr said that since his son's shooting he had ""received some threats"". Asked how his family was coping, Mr Blake Sr said he had had to take his other son, 20, to hospital because he was depressed. The father gave no further details but added: ""It's sad to me how people don't understand the kind of pressure this family is under."" The governor of the state, Democrat Tony Evers, has urged Mr Trump to reconsider his trip, warning his presence will ""hinder our healing"" and arguing that the citizens of the town are already traumatised. The White House said the president was expected to meet with law enforcement and tour ""property affected by recent riots"". This video can not be played Two people were killed and one injured on the third night of unrest Portland, Oregon, has also become a major flashpoint for demonstrations since a wave of Black Lives Matter protests were touched off by the killing of another African American - George Floyd - in May. Mr Floyd died in Minneapolis after a police officer knelt on his neck for a prolonged period during an arrest. In July, the Trump administration deployed federal forces to Portland, ostensibly to protect a federal courthouse and other federal property. But they were later withdrawn amid allegations their heavy-handed tactics only heightened the unrest. On Saturday night, right-wing activist Aaron ""Jay"" Danielson, 39, wasshot dead in the city after he was seen going to protect a caravan of Trump supporters,externalfrom counter protesters. Trump's crackdown on Portland protests explained Can Trump send in federal forces to quell violence? Asked to condemn supporters who had fired paint pellets during a confrontation with anti-racism demonstrators on the same night, Mr Trump described the protest as ""peaceful"" and said paint was ""a defensive mechanism, paint is not bullets"". He told a reporter: ""Your supporters, and they are your supporters indeed, shot a young gentleman...  and killed him, not with paint but with a bullet. And I think it's disgraceful."" Media reports say a man who calls himself an anti-fascist is being investigated over the death of Mr Danielson. Meanwhile,protests erupted in Los Angeles, California, on Monday night after an incident in which police shot dead a black man,externalin a southern neighbourhood of the city. Police say the man - named in local media as 29-year-old Dijon Kizzee - fled after officers spotted him riding a bicycle in violation of vehicle codes. According to the police, the man was shot at the end of a pursuit, after he allegedly struck an officer and dropped a bundle of clothing he was carrying. ""The deputies noticed that inside the clothing items that he dropped was a black semi-automatic handgun, at which time a deputy-involved shooting occurred,"" Lt Brandon Dean told reporters.

"The return of pupils to schools in England this week will be a ""massive milestone"", says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. But he apologised to students for the ""stress and uncertainty"" of problems with A-level and GCSE results. Mr Williamson told MPs the u-turn on results became necessary when ""too many inconsistencies"" appeared in grades. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green accused him of a ""summer of chaos, incompetence and confusion"". This week many pupils in England and Wales are going back to school - after the long disruption caused by the pandemic outbreak, with almost all schools expected to be ready to teach pupils full time. Williamson says A-levels and GCSEs likely to be later next summer Labour calls for delays to next summer's exams Next year's exams will need to be slimmed down, say head teachers England's education secretary, speaking in the House of Commons, welcomed that pupils will be returning to a safe environment. But for students caught up in the exam fiasco he said he ""can only apologise to them"". Labour's Ms Green pressed him on how many students might still have missed out on a first choice at university as a result of the confusion. This video can not be played BBC Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what schools are doing to keep pupils safe A survey from YouGov also suggested there were still fears about safety in school - with 17% of parents ""seriously considering"" not sending back their children. The polling firm has recordedgrowing confidence in sending pupils back, but this latest survey, as schools prepare to reopen, suggests a hard core of unconvinced parents. Parents were more likely to back wearing masks in school, with 47% in favour and 36% against. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the first Cabinet meeting since the summer break, said there was likely to be more of ""this wretched Covid still to come"" but he was ""absolutely confident"" that ""we are going to be able to deal with those outbreaks"". The return to school has raised concerns about what will happen to next summer's A-levels and GCSEs, when so much teaching time has been lost. Mr Williamson told MPs that exams would go ahead next summer - and there were plans being made ""to ensure that this is done as smoothly as possible"". Schools Minister Nick Gibb said earlier there would soon be a decision on whether exams would start later next summer - as previously suggested. In June, Mr Williamson told MPs that he would consult with Ofqual, England's exam regulator, on ""how we can move those exams back, giving children extra time in order to be able to learn"". Ofqual has suggested that relatively few changes will need to be made to how much is taught for exams - but heads' leader Geoff Barton criticised this as ""little more than tinkering at the edges"". The ASCL head teachers' union has called for a reduction in the scale of the content of exam courses to take account of the amount of teaching time that has been lost. This video can not be played The PM says workers are going back to the office âin huge numbersâ. There have also been questions about what will happen if schools face local lockdowns - and whether there will have to be a back-up plan for teachers' predictions to be used again. West Sussex head teacher Jules White said a month's delay for exams would only be ""window dressing"". ""The idea that all students, especially those who are disadvantaged, will rapidly catch up on vast amounts of subject content is naively optimistic and politicians from all sides must call for urgent and meaningful modifications to exams,"" said Mr White, who has organised school funding campaigns. Labour has called for the exams, usually taken in May and June, to be pushed back to mid-summer to help cope with the impact of coronavirus. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? This year's exams were dogged by chaos and left teachers, parents and pupils calling for a major rethink of next summer's exams. Nearly 40% of A-level grades awarded to students using an algorithm were below teachers' assessments, with disadvantaged students particularly badly affected. Days after the results were announced, and following widespread criticism, the government performed a U-turn and decided tobase grades on teachers' recommendationsinstead. Conservative MP Tim Loughton said the exam problems had been a ""shambles"" and that after such a ""turbulent"" summer when ""things have not gone as well as they should have done"", the government needed to ""get control of the agenda again"". ""I think a lot of people will find it surprising that we seem to have had a few heads roll who are civil servants and in charge in quangos but so far there has been no ministerial accountability and I think that is raising a few questions. ""Ministers have lost their jobs for a lot less, including education ministers,"" said Mr Loughton.

"Jacob Blake's father said his son was ""holding on for dear life"" after he was shot by a police officer The father of a black man shot by police has refused to ""play politics"" with his son's life when Donald Trump visits the city of Kenosha on Tuesday. Jacob Blake's shooting sparked a fresh wave of anti-racism protests in the US, prompting calls for President Trump to acknowledge him and his family. The president will meet police officers on the visit, but not the Blake family. The visit comes with ""law and order"" becoming highly politicised ahead of the 3 November presidential election. Jacob Blake shooting: What we know Blake reportedly released from handcuffs in hospital bed Two incidents, two different police responses In an interview with CNN,external, Mr Blake's father, Jacob Blake Sr, said his son's life was more important than a meeting with President Trump. ""I'm not getting into politics. It's all about my son, man. It has nothing to do with a photo op,"" he said. Local officials have urged Mr Trump to not visit Kenosha, in the state of Wisconsin, fearing his presence in the city may reignite protests that have calmed down in recent days. But Mr Trump has rejected their pleas, accusing Democratic mayors and governors of failing to get a grip on the violence. He is pushing a strong law and order message in his bid to a win a second term in the White House, although critics accuse him of stoking tensions. Ahead of the Kenosha trip, the president said he would not meet Mr Blake's family because they wanted lawyers to be present. Mr Trump has also defended a teenage supporter accused of fatally shooting two men amid demonstrations over Mr Blake's shooting. Who is US teen accused of Wisconsin protest murders? He suggested that Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was acting in self-defence, telling reporters: ""I guess he was in very big trouble, he probably would have been killed."" ""This is not politics. This is about the life of my son,"" Mr Blake Sr said, adding that his son was still paralysed from the waist down, ""holding on for dear life"". Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times in the back by a police officer during an arrest, as Mr Blake tried to get into a car where his three children were seated. ""We are dealing with an individual that a couple of weeks ago was running around with the boys and talking to me on the phone and laughing, to an individual that cannot move his leg,"" Mr Blake Sr said. This video can not be played Jacob Blake's sister: 'I have been watching police murder people that look like me for years' The officer involved in the shooting on 23 August, named as Rusten Sheskey, has been placed on administrative leave while an investigation takes place. Mr Blake Sr said that since his son's shooting he had ""received some threats"". Asked how his family was coping, Mr Blake Sr said he had had to take his other son, 20, to hospital because he was depressed. The father gave no further details but added: ""It's sad to me how people don't understand the kind of pressure this family is under."" The governor of the state, Democrat Tony Evers, has urged Mr Trump to reconsider his trip, warning his presence will ""hinder our healing"" and arguing that the citizens of the town are already traumatised. The White House said the president was expected to meet with law enforcement and tour ""property affected by recent riots"". This video can not be played Two people were killed and one injured on the third night of unrest Portland, Oregon, has also become a major flashpoint for demonstrations since a wave of Black Lives Matter protests were touched off by the killing of another African American - George Floyd - in May. Mr Floyd died in Minneapolis after a police officer knelt on his neck for a prolonged period during an arrest. In July, the Trump administration deployed federal forces to Portland, ostensibly to protect a federal courthouse and other federal property. But they were later withdrawn amid allegations their heavy-handed tactics only heightened the unrest. On Saturday night, right-wing activist Aaron ""Jay"" Danielson, 39, wasshot dead in the city after he was seen going to protect a caravan of Trump supporters,externalfrom counter protesters. Trump's crackdown on Portland protests explained Can Trump send in federal forces to quell violence? Asked to condemn supporters who had fired paint pellets during a confrontation with anti-racism demonstrators on the same night, Mr Trump described the protest as ""peaceful"" and said paint was ""a defensive mechanism, paint is not bullets"". He told a reporter: ""Your supporters, and they are your supporters indeed, shot a young gentleman...  and killed him, not with paint but with a bullet. And I think it's disgraceful."" Media reports say a man who calls himself an anti-fascist is being investigated over the death of Mr Danielson. Meanwhile,protests erupted in Los Angeles, California, on Monday night after an incident in which police shot dead a black man,externalin a southern neighbourhood of the city. Police say the man - named in local media as 29-year-old Dijon Kizzee - fled after officers spotted him riding a bicycle in violation of vehicle codes. According to the police, the man was shot at the end of a pursuit, after he allegedly struck an officer and dropped a bundle of clothing he was carrying. ""The deputies noticed that inside the clothing items that he dropped was a black semi-automatic handgun, at which time a deputy-involved shooting occurred,"" Lt Brandon Dean told reporters.

"Some of Ocado's vans will now show M&S's Percy Pig sweets Angry Ocado customers have been complaining to the online grocer after their orders were cancelled on the first day of the firm's tie-up with Marks and Spencer. M&S has bought a 50% share of Ocado's retail business, which gives the grocer an internet-based delivery service for the first time. But the ""surge in demand"" meant Ocado was unable to fulfil what it called a ""very small number"" of orders. The firm apologised to those affected. ""The vast majority of customers are unaffected and will be delivered as normal. We would like to thank our customers for giving M&S such a big welcome and sincere apologies to any customers having to wait a bit longer,"" it said in a statement. M&S has now begun doing something many of its competitors have been doing for years - it is making its full food range available to order online. A number of customers vented their disappointment at having their orders cancelled at the last minute, despite booking them well in advance Allow Twitter content?

One customer tweeted: ""Big day but you've cancelled my order that has been booked for 4 weeks! Long time customer who now can't get a delivery until Sunday... shocking service!"" Another said she was taking her business elsewhere in future. ""My order due 2pm tomorrow has been cancelled. I booked the slot over 10 days ago. I have been an Ocado customer for 10 years. Day 1 of M&S and I want to know how I can cancel my membership,"" she said. The deal with Ocado comes at a crucial time for M&S, which is cutting 7,000 jobs. But analysts are divided on the wisdom of the deal. One expert, Kate Hardcastle, told the BBC that M&S had ""taken a long time"" to enter the online grocery market and that expectations were high. But another analyst, Richard Hyman, said the move could erode the retailer's profits and was ""a big mistake"". Until now, the only M&S food available online has been party food and celebration dinners to order or, in certain locations, a limited range of about 130 M&Sfood and household items through Deliveroo. But if you live in Scotland, you're out of luck. Ocado does not currently operate north of the border and has no plans to do so at present. For existing customers of Ocado, it means big changes. In the past, consumers who wanted to buy into Waitrose's upmarket image without busting their budget had the option of choosing from the supermarket's Essential Waitrose range. But now they will need to take their pick from M&S's Remarksable Value range instead. Shoppers can now choose from 6,000 M&S food items, alongside Ocado own-label goods and big-name branded items. M&S has vowed that all its replacement products will be the same price as, or cheaper than, the equivalent Waitrose items. M&S and Ocado say that their joint offer now amounts to more than 50,000 products, which they say is ""double that of the next largest grocery retailer"". But if Ocado customers don't like the new set-up, they have the option of switching to Waitrose's own delivery service, Waitrose.com. The tie-up with Ocado comes at a critical time for M&S. The retailer employs almost 78,000 people, most of them in the UK. The bulk of the latest job cuts are expected to come among shop floor workers, with about 12% of customer assistant roles going. Shopping may never be the same again, says M&S The deal with Ocado was originally announced early last year, well before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. However, Covid-19 has exacerbated existing problems for M&S, which has struggled to restore the fortunes of its hard-hit clothing and home goods divisions since shops reopened after lockdown. At the height of lockdown, M&S boss Steve Rowe said customers might ""never shop the same way again"" after the coronavirus crisis. As a result, the company is shifting resources and recruiting towards areas that are expanding - online and food. Ocado Retail chief executive Melanie Smith hailed the deal as a ""winning combination of the country's fastest-growing grocer and the nation's most beloved food brand"". But it could still be a tricky moment for the online grocer if it turns out that shoppers valued Waitrose's goods more than they did Ocado's customer service and user-friendly website. And Ocado now has to face stronger competition, with its former partner eager to win market share for its own website. Ocado has been offering Waitrose products since it began its commercial delivery service in 2002. At that time, Waitrose already had its own internet-based deliveries, but on a much smaller basis. Now it says it can reach 90% of UK postcodes. ""The supply relationship has worked well for almost 20 years, but now both parties are ready to go their own way,"" says Waitrose. Consumer and retail expert Kate Hardcastle told the BBC she had placed an order for 1 September to test the new Ocado and had so far had two items cancelled. ""For each one, they sent me a Â£5 voucher,"" she said, adding that this was an indication of how much pressure M&S and Ocado were under to get their partnership right. ""Everyone's expectations are pretty high and the world is watching,"" she added. She acknowledged that M&S could have been in the online grocery market sooner, but compared the delay with previous foot-dragging by the retailer over issues such as accepting credit cards. M&S to cut 7,000 jobs over next three months Ocado says switch to online shopping is permanent ""M&S do things very much their way,"" she said. ""They've taken a long time to do it, but if there's a time to do it, it's now."" However, another retail analyst, Richard Hyman, thinks the whole deal is misconceived and M&S should stay on the High Street. ""It's very difficult to make money from selling food online,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm not sure that anyone does."" Mr Hyman said M&S had ""a terrific food business as it stands"", but risked eroding its profit margins as it tried to turn itself into a destination for the family shop. ""Old business thinking says, 'We must get bigger,'"" he says. ""But being big isn't as beautiful as it used to be."" He said M&S was ""trying to please too many people"" and would ""dilute its core offering"" as a result. ""It's almost as if M&S aspires to be like other food retailers, which strikes me as a big mistake.""

"Some primary school pupils in England returned to their classrooms at the beginning of June Children in England are three months behind in their studies after lockdown, with boys and poor pupils worst hit, suggests a survey of teachers by an educational research organisation. The learning gap between rich and poor pupils grew by almost half between March and July, the National Foundation for Educational Research has found. The authors also warn a quick catch-up is unlikely. The government says children must not lose out because of coronavirus. The new term begins in England and Wales this week, after the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Schools are already back in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The National Foundation for Educational Research's survey questioned a weighted sample of almost 3,000 heads and teachers in about 2,200 primary and secondary schools across England. The research was carried out just before the end of term in July - and showed how much children had fallen behind by the end of the last school year. Almost all the teachers questioned (98%) said their pupils were behind the place in the curriculum they would normally expect for the time of year. Overall, teachers said they had covered  just 66% of their usual curriculum by July, putting pupils three months behind in their learning. The researchers also found: boys are further behind in the curriculum than girls the learning gap for poorer pupils has widened by at least 46% It comes days after aseparate study showed the learning gap between rich and poor primary pupils had begun to widen, even before the pandemic. The National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) report found teachers in the most deprived schools (those with the greatest proportion of pupils on free school meals) were more than three times as likely (53%) to say their pupils were at least four months behind, compared with those in the wealthiest schools (15%). Even for those pupils who had places in school last term, attendance was poor - only 56% of eligible pupils actually went back amid safety concerns from parents, the report reveals, Almost three quarters of the teachers questioned thought they were unable to teach to their usual standard under the coronavirus regulations. Socially distanced classrooms make the job harder, say teachers Overall, teachers estimate 44% of their pupils are in need of intensive catch-up support, says the report, with teachers in the most deprived schools (57%) more likely to believe this than those in the wealthiest schools (32%). NFER chief social scientist, Dr Angela Donkin, welcomedthe government's National Tutoring Programmebut questioned ""whether the scale will be sufficient to meet the high demand for those requiring intensive support"". Almost all the school leaders questioned (90%) predicted they could manage to open to all pupils safely, however more than three quarters (78%) expressed concerns, with many saying additional funding would be needed for more staff, cleaning and protective equipment. Separately, head teachers and teachers criticised the government for""last-minute"" guidance on what to do during virus outbreaksand local lockdowns, which was published on Friday. In the NFER report, teachers urged better planning for further lockdowns, and called for more and better IT equipment for pupils and staff. More than a quarter of pupils (28%) were reported to have no access to a laptop or computer at home. The authors said it was encouraging that the government was offering laptop and internet connections for disadvantaged pupils but that ""a much swifter dispatch of devices"" was needed, as well as more training for teachers. Other recommendations included: more safety reassurance for parents better support for schools to bring in ""non-attending"" pupils more money for enhanced cleaning and extra staff to ensure social distancing Ofsted to modify its expectations of schools during social distancing acceptance that catch-up will be a long-term endeavour ""Whilst it is crucial that children catch up, we should not assume that teachers will immediately be able to deliver the same quality of teaching at the same speed, as before the pandemic,"" said Dr Donkin. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, asked the government to hire ""qualified teachers not currently in post"" to help reduce class sizes, which would in turn ""provide educational catch-up and ensure safety for all"". Dr Bousted also urged a more flexible approach to exams next year, ""one which learns from the mistakes of this year"". This video can not be played BBC Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what schools are doing to keep pupils safe Shadow education secretary Kate Green saidon Monday that students starting Year 11 and 13 in September had ""a mountain to climb"", having missed months of schooling. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called on Mr Williamson to face parliament to explain ""how he will protect"" children's futures. ""He needs to explain how he will make up for the damage already done, bring pupils up to speed and mitigate against the ongoing risk from the pandemic,"" Sir Keir added. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Does my child have to go back? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), called the NFER report ""another alarm bell"" for the government. The head teachers' union is also calling for a temporary ban on fining parents and guardians if their children do not return to school. Mr Whiteman said: ""If you are a parent and you are worried about safety, a fine is unlikely to make you feel any safer."" The Department for Education has said fines for school absences would only be used as a ""last resort"" in England. In a statement, the department added: ""Throughout the pandemic we have invested in remote education, providing devices, routes and resources for the children who need them most and why our Â£1bn Covid catch-up package will tackle the impact of lost teaching time, including targeted funding for the most disadvantaged students.""

"Alex Penn is concerned that his firm SSE Audio is losing talented staff Alex Penn has been planning for the unwinding of the government's coronavirus furlough scheme since July - but it doesn't make the job cuts any easier. From Tuesday, companies using the scheme are now having to contribute to workers' wages. And like many companies, Mr Penn's sound equipment firm SSE Audio has not seen a post-lockdown revival in business sufficient to keep everyone employed. ""We entered a consultation period in July,"" said the SSE co-managing director. ""We spoke to everybody in the company. We wanted to make sure we were preparing ourselves for the worst."" Since March, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has paid 80% of the wages of workers placed on leave, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. But now that is going down to 70%, with the employer paying 10%. Said Mr Penn: ""The fact that our costs would be ramping up in relation to the furlough scheme as of 1 September, that was when we decided we needed to go through our initial round of redundancies."" The firm, which provides sound systems for arena gigs such as the Reading and Leeds music festivals, is going from 200 employees to 150. The impact of the pandemic has hit the arts and entertainment sector particularly hard, and Mr Penn fears a loss of talent. ""Many of our freelancers are already working in other jobs and we don't expect all of them to come back so it is really important that businesses like ours are protected,"" he said. How is furlough changing now? Chancellor says furlough cannot last indefinitely Redundancy advice calls triple in June and July Many other companies are also likely to began shedding more staff as the scheme unwinds, which is why some economists are predicting a huge jump in unemployment. Calls for the scheme to be extended are growing. It is due to finish at the end of October andChancellor Rishi Sunak has repeatedly ruled out an extensionto it. Last month, he said it was ""wrong to keep people trapped"" in a situation where there was no realistic prospect of them having a job to go back to. From 1 September, the government will pay 70% of wages up to a cap of Â£2,187.50 a month. Employers are already paying employees' pension contributions and National Insurance, but will now have to pay 10% of salaries as well. In October, the government will pay 60% of wages up to a cap of Â£1,875. The employers' share of the bill will then go up to 20% of wages. BBC business correspondent Dharshini David It was hailed as groundbreaking: the scheme which provided a vital lifeline to businesses and more than 9.5 million workers. But weaning UK businesses off the retention scheme will be the biggest challenge so far for Rishi Sunak. With business far from usual, one in 12 workers continue to have their wages for paid by the state. The chancellor is adamant that it's time to end the scheme as businesses reopen. The price-tag so far has crossed Â£35bn, the kind of level which points to tax rises further down the road. Instead, he points to other forms of support for job retention and creation that he's introduced, from a bonus scheme for employers keeping on staff to targeted VAT cuts for the hospitality industry. Yet the chancellor's own independent forecaster reckons unemployment could reach rates not seen since the 1980s. Mr Sunak admits he can't save every job. The challenge is to prevent a crisis which could ultimately be far more costly for the economy. The increased cost of the scheme poses a problem for employers, who face difficult decisions about whether to make staff redundant. Craig Beaumont of the Federation of Small Businesses told the BBC's Today programme that one million small employers across the country had used the furlough scheme. He said that 23% of small employers were considering reducing their headcount in the next three months. ""This is very very serious. That's a huge section of the economy,"" he said. ""Sixty per cent of those who work in the private sector do so for a small business, so if that happens without any intervention, then that's a huge increase in mass unemployment."" Acas has seen a huge rise in calls to its redundancy advice line Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, told the programme that other countries, such as France and Germany, had extended comparable schemes. Last week, for instance,Germany agreed to extend a scheme that tops up payfor workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic until the end of 2021. ""The UK scheme, in that sense, looks a little bit short, especially when you take into account that the UK's economy is made up of a higher share of sectors that are hampered by social distancing,"" Mr Dales said. However, he added that many jobs were currently ""frozen"" and would not come back after the coronavirus crisis. ""You do want to start the process of reallocating those people to jobs that will be around for many many years,"" he said. Some businesses that are still suffering from the pandemic, including live music venues that have not yet reopened, are feeling the effects of the furlough tapering. Tristan Moffat, operations director of the Piano Works bars in London's Farringdon and West End districts, told BBC Radio 5 live that his business had 104 members of staff on furlough. This video can not be played What could post-lockdown nights out look like? The bars are still closed at present, but the company is hoping to reopen them in October with strict social distancing measures in place. The idea is that before customers even enter the club, they will have their temperatures taken and be sprayed with disinfectant in a special tunnel. Pandemic 'biggest knock to live music in my life' But that depends on the lifting of restrictions on audiences singing and dancing, as each venue has a six-piece band that plays non-stop music. ""If we're not able to reopen in the short term, then we would have very very difficult decisions ahead,"" he said. The impending end of the scheme is already having an impact on the economy, analysts say. Conciliation service Acas has saidcalls to its redundancy advice line almost tripled in June and July, as concerns mounted about the implications. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ''The unwinding of the furlough scheme has been followed by announcements of significant job losses across multiple sectors, particularly travel and retail. ""Although growth has been recovering as lockdown restrictions have eased, it has become increasingly clear that the government's job retention scheme has been masking the damage wreaked by the pandemic on jobs and the wider economy. ""As the scheme tapers further at the start of next month and the government stops subsidising wages altogether by 31 October, we would expect economic recovery to lose momentum as businesses across many industries are forced to lay off more staff.""

"Thousands more people in England with type 2 diabetes will be offered the chance to try a soup-and-shake diet weight-loss plan for free on the NHS. Studies show switching to the low-calorie liquid diet can put diabetes into remission. Experts say they want to help people to be as fit as possible, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are linked and both increase the risk of complications from Covid-19. Coronavirus: Diabetic people offered support Some NHS patientshave already benefitedfrom the year-long diet and exercise plan, which is why NHS England wants to expand the scheme to more people. People living with type 2 diabetes who are an unhealthy weight and have been diagnosed with the condition in the last six years will be considered for the scheme. After a few months on the shakes and soups, when some weight loss has been achieved, solid foods are reintroduced, with support to help the person maintain a nutritious diet and regular exercise. Results from one trial showedalmost half of those who went on the diet achieved remission of their type 2 diabetes after one year. It is a common condition that causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to become too high It is caused by problems with a chemical in the body (hormone) called insulin Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can include excessive thirst, needing to urinate a lot and tiredness It can increase the risk of getting serious problems with the eyes, heart and nerves Some cases are linked to being overweight Type 1 diabetes  is an autoimmune disease that is not linked to being overweight. Prof Jonathan Valabhji, NHS national clinical director for diabetes and obesity, said: ""This is the latest example of how the NHS, through our Long Term Plan, is rapidly adopting the latest evidence-based treatments to help people stay well, maintain a healthy weight and avoid major diseases. ""There has never been a more important time to lose weight and put their type 2 diabetes into remission, so it's good news for thousands of people across the country that practical, supportive measures like this are increasingly available on the NHS.""

"More than 100,000 pupils in Scotland are absent from school with attendance down to 84.5%, according to Scottish government figures. Data collected from local authorities shows that more than 15.5% pupils were off school last Friday. However, only 22,821 of the absences are recorded as ""Covid-19 related"". The Scottish government said it was common for other viral infections to circulate after a ""prolonged break"" away from school. Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, told BBC Scotland it believed many parents were ""erring on the side of caution"" and keeping children who had cold symptoms off school. Pupils in Scotlandbegan returning to school on 11 Augustafter being away since March. Provisional figures from 28 August show that 84.5% of pupils in Scottish schools were present, down from a confirmed 95.8% attendance on 17 August. Attendance remained above 90% until 21 August, before dropping to 89.2% on 24 August following the weekend. During the last decade, attendance levels over the whole school year have been between 93% and 94%. About 3% of pupils were absent last Friday for a Covid-related reason, with 12.3% absent for non-Covid reasons, including pupil exclusions. A Covid-related absence includes a ""positive test, showing symptoms, self-isolation, quarantining, and parents not sending their child to school against public health guidance"". The Scottish government reported on Tuesday that almost 40,000 pupils had been tested for coronavirus since term started, with 117 positive results. Absentee rates are higher than usual - but not dramatically higher. In the week before schools closed in March, there were reports that between a third and a half of pupils at some schools were off. The numbers provide reassurance most children are going to school but may also suggest that some parents are being cautious about sending them if they are slightly unwell - for instance suffering from a cold. Earlier this week the Scottish government's national clinical director Dr Jason Leitch wrote an open letter to parents. In the letter he offered advice on what parents should do if children are suffering from bugs and colds. He said that in many cases children would be well enough to attend. But he also stressed that those with potential Covid 19 symptoms should self-isolate and get tested. Speaking on Monday, Education Secretary John Swinney said it was common for ""colds and similar viral infections to circulate"" when pupils returned from a prolonged break. ""In many cases children will be well enough to attend school and continue their learning with little or no interruption to their education,"" he said. ""In other cases, for instance where they have quite a heavy cold with a runny nose, they may need to take a day or two off to recover."" He said any pupil with Covid-19 symptoms were required to self-isolate and seek a test. But he added: ""In order to ensure that your child does not miss out on their education it is important to be clear on how Covid-19 symptoms differ from those of other infections that we normally see circulating at this time of year."" National clinical director Jason Leitch has alsowritten to schools with guidance,externalon what to do about pupils who develop non-Covid symptoms. Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, said the union had received reports of ""higher than normal illness absences"" in schools across Scotland, with indications that cold viruses were circulating among pupils. He said significant numbers of pupils and staff were being affected in some areas. ""This may be the result of pupils and staff being isolated from others for a prolonged period, with the result that the virus is spreading more quickly now than schools have re-opened,"" he added. ""It is also likely to be the case that many parents will be erring on the side of caution in keeping their children off with cold symptoms at the present time.""

"This small zinc casket containing ex-mayor Pierre David's heart was in the fountain An ornate fountain in Verviers, eastern Belgium, has given up an object it held for more than a century: the heart of the city's first mayor. The organ, sealed in a jar of alcohol inside a small zinc casket, was found during renovation of the fountain. The casket is now on show in the city's Museum of Fine Arts. Mayor Pierre David died in 1839, but the fountain named after him was only inaugurated in 1883. An engraving on the casket says it was placed in the monument at the time. ""The heart of Pierre David was solemnly placed in the monument on 25 June 1883"", it reads. The casket was tucked away in this hollowed-out stone The Verviers Alderman for Public Works, Maxime Degey, said ""an urban legend has become reality: the casket was in the upper part of the fountain, right near the bust of Pierre David, behind a stone which we had removed during the fountain's renovation"". Quoted by broadcaster RTBF, he said the casket found by the builders on 20 August was ""in really impeccable condition"". The casket was hidden near the bust of Pierre David, nearly half-way up Mayor Pierre David died in a fall aged 68, while working in his hayloft in 1839. The city authorities launched a collection fund for a monument to honour him, and with his family's consent surgeons removed his heart, so that it could be entombed in the monument. The Verviers official website - verviers.be - says it then took decades for the city to collect enough money to erect a suitably ornate monument. Meanwhile there were also arguments over how best to honour the city's first mayor, before the fountain at Place Verte went ahead. The casket is in a special exhibition in Verviers Museum of Fine Arts He lived through turbulent times, including the establishment of Belgium as an independent state in 1830. He first served as Verviers mayor in 1800-1808, when today's Belgium was ruled from France. Later, Belgium's independence resulted from a revolution against Dutch rule in 1830, and in that year Pierre David was elected to serve as mayor again. A 19th-Century bust of Pierre David You might also like: The search for a 450-year-old heart Berlin buries remains kept by Nazi-era doctor The mayor is remembered especially for having founded a fire service in Verviers in 1802 - a rare innovation at that time. He was a Francophile who supported the ideology of the French Revolution, but then lived through the period of Dutch rule from 1815 to 1830. Verviers was badly damaged in the 1830 uprising, and Pierre David was given the task of restoring order in the city, as he was widely respected.

"The snakes were located inside the house A man in Australia got a shock when he returned home to find two snakes had crashed through his ceiling and were slithering around his Queensland house. David Tate found one snake in his bedroom and another in the living room on Monday. They weighed 22kg (3.4 stone) between them. Snake catcher Steven Brown said they were of ""exceptional size"". It's thought the two male snakes could have been fighting over a female snake which has not yet been located. The carpet pythons measured 2.8m (9.1 feet) and 2.5m long. The animals had fallen through the ceiling of the property Mr Tait said he had previously seen snakesbasking in the sun on his roof,external. ""When I came back...there was a large slab [of ceiling] on the kitchen table,"" he told The Courier-Mail. Boa constrictor 'at large' in Australian suburb Australian woman bitten by snake in toilet After seeing the state of his ceiling, he looked around and eventually found the animals. He called in a snake catcher and the ordeal was over ""pretty quickly"". ""I certainly didn't want to handle them,"" he said. One of the animals was located in the living room while another was found in the bedroom Mr Brown from North Brisbane Snake Catchers and Relocation told the BBC: ""These two were of exceptional size compared to the common size that's usually come across."" It wasn't until he arrived at the house that he realised the animals had crashed through the ceiling, hesaid on Facebook,external. ""We are just coming into our snake season as today is the start of the breeding season and snakes will only get more active as the temperatures rise into our summer period,"" he told the BBC.

"In a normal year, more than a million UK tourists visit Portugal's Algarve coast Ministers are considering reimposing quarantine measures for those arriving in the UK from Portugal as coronavirus cases rise, sources have told the BBC. The country has recorded more than 20 cases per 100,000 people in the past week. Normally when a country surpasses that mark the UK government imposes 14 days of self-isolation on returning travellers. Ministers are expected to reach a decision on the measures by Thursday. They will also have to decide whether the UK as a whole should follow Scotland, which has made a decision toadd Greece to its own quarantine list, effective from 04:00 BST on Thursday. It is the first of the four UK nations - each of which can add or remove countries to their own list - to make a decision on Greece, following several reports of people in the UK testing positive after holidaying on the island of Zante. Wales, which says at least 16 people tested positive following a flight from the Greek island last week, says it has told passengers arriving on a plane at Cardiff Airport on Tuesday evening toself-isolate for 14 days. Meanwhile, some travel industry leaders have suggested quarantine rules should only apply to people returning from specific regions where case numbers are high, such as resort islands - rather than having whole countries blacklisted. Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? How to fly during a global pandemic It has been less than two weeks since Portugal came off the quarantine list and was put back on the UK's safe travel list, following a sustained period of falling cases in the country that put it below the ""20 per 100,000"" mark that satisfied the UK. But now holidaymakers are scrambling to return from the country amid fears the country is again about to be taken off the list, based on the latest data. EasyJet has sold out all of its flights from Faro - which serves the Algarve - to airports in Britain for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. And British Airways is selling seats on a flight from Faro to Heathrow on Thursday for Â£554, while the same journey can be made seven days later for just Â£139. Thousands of people have travelled from the UK to Portugal since the country was added to the UK's quarantine exemption list on 22 August. This video can not be played Tui boss Andrew Flintham says the government should consider ""regional travel corridors"" Portugal has recorded 21.1 virus cases per 100,000 people in the past week. The UK considers imposing  quarantine on travellers when a country's infection rate exceeds 20 cases per 100,000, over seven days. Over the past month, so-calledtravel corridors,external- which allow people to travel without having to self-isolate on their return - have been scrapped between England and at least 18 countries and territories. Ministers have said this cautious approach prevents coronavirus cases being imported. Andrew Flintham, head of Tui UK, has said the government should consider ""regional travel corridors"" - meaning quarantine measures would apply to people returning from regions over whole countries. He said there were fewer cases in the popular Algarve, where most tourists are, than elsewhere in Portugal. Using the example of Leicester, the first area in the UK to be placed under local lockdown, Mr Flintham told the BBC: ""In the UK we have a slightly different policy in the fact that we don't lock down the whole UK when the Leicester rate goes up. ""Can we apply the same kind of principle to almost allow us to operate to those places where the rates are low or are within those thresholds? ""We don't want to put anybody in danger but clearly it is not the same everywhere in a country,"" he added. It is not the first time Tui has urged the government against slapping blanket quarantines on whole countries. Mr Flintham previously called for ""regionalised"" policyafter quarantine measures were imposed on Spain in July. The travel industry had hoped that the quarantine rules could be eased for the Balearic and Canary Islands, as data suggested there were lower rates of infection there than in mainland Spain. Elsewhere, the boss of British Airways' parent firm, Willie Walsh, has accused the government of using ""arbitrary statistics to effectively ban 160 countries and in the process destroying the economy"". The ""ever-changing"" quarantine requirements meant ""the UK has officially hung up the 'closed' sign"", he said,writing in the Times.,external Last week, Switzerland, Jamaica and the Czech Republic joined France, Spain and a number of others on the UK's quarantine list. UK tourists have spent thousands of pounds on new flights and ferries, and endured long drives in a race to get home before quarantine measures kick in. The government has not commented on whether requirements for arrivals from Portugal will change again. As soon as Portugal came off the quarantine list less than two weeks ago, John Cushing and his 12-year-old daughter Georgie headed straight out to the Algarve where he has a villa. Now the quarantine rules look set to change, he's facing a quandary. ""It's very precarious at the moment,"" says the 61-year-old company director. ""My daughter and I won't be able to leave the house when we get back to the UK on Saturday and there's a risk of being fined because I won't be able to send her back to school on Monday. ""She's in tears because she wants to go back to school but Ryanair is charging Â£1,000 to get back before the possible cut-off point. ""It's a very difficult decision to make [to pay for the early flight home] and I'm not really enjoying myself here now."" FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal, making up the largest number of overseas tourists to the country. Most head to the Algarve in the south, drawn by sunny Atlantic beaches, picturesque fishing villages and golf courses. Over May and June, the Portuguese government reopened its restaurants, coffee shops, museums and beaches. Hotels have mainly reopened, but nightclubs remain closed. The government has warned that stricter measures will be put in place in mid-September as pupils return to school and some workers return to offices.

"Emily Lewis, 15, was among 12 people on board the RIB when it struck a buoy A girl killed in a boat crash during a family sightseeing trip died from an abdominal injury, an inquest heard. Emily Lewis, 15, was among 12 people taken to hospital after the rigid inflatable boat (Rib) hit a buoy in Southampton Water on 22 August. An inquest opening heard she was taken to Southampton General Hospital but later died of her injuries. Miss Lewis' mother Nikki and sister Amy, 19, who were also in the boat, both suffered broken arms. Coroner Christopher Wilkinson said Miss Lewis was accompanied to hospital by her father, Simon Lewis, from the Park Gate area of Southampton, who confirmed her identity to medics. Mr Wilkinson said the teenager was ""rendered unconscious"" as a result of the crash off Netley, and later died after resuscitation attempts by medics failed. He added a post-mortem examination carried out at Winchester hospital by forensic pathologist Dr Russell Delaney revealed a preliminary cause of death as an upper abdominal injury. The coroner said that investigations were ongoing and adjourned the case for a full inquest on 5 May 2021. The Southampton Harbour Master was seen inspecting buoys in the stretch of water where the crash happened In a previously released statement, Miss Lewis' family said: ""We are all in shock that our beautiful daughter and sister is no longer with us. ""We suffered from broken bones, but the emotional pain far outweighs the physical."" Hampshire Constabulary is investigating the incident, which happened just after 10:00 BST, along with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Marine Accident Investigation Branch Officers confirmed the Rib had been on a commercial trip run by a local company.

""It's impossible to imagine working at the level he has while valiantly battling his illness,"" Sarandos said in a statement. ""His legacy as a person and an artist will inspire millions. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family during this difficult time,"" he added. In the forthcoming movie, Boseman plays the ambitious trumpet player Levee, who has desires for musical success of his own, and for Rainey's girlfriend. Davis, who plays the titular role, tweeted that it was ""an honour"" acting beside the star. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Boseman was not scheduled to appear at Monday's online event, but Davis and director George C Wolfe were due to take part in a Q&A session about the film, commenting on new preview footage. The late actor's family have confirmed he had completed all of his filming for the role, and Wolfe said that working with him was ""a glorious experience"". ""Every day we all got to witness the ferocity of his talent and the gentleness of his heart,"" he said. ""A truly blessed, loving, gifted and giving human being."" According to Variety,external, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is still due out this year, and ""there was no immediate word from Netflix about whether Boseman's death would impact its plans for the release"". The film has been produced by Oscar-winning actor, Washington, who in fact played a major role in Boseman's life and career. Washington paid for his tuition fees when the future star was studying at the British American Drama Academy. ""He was a gentle soul and a brilliant artist, who will stay with us for eternity through his iconic performances over his short yet illustrious career,""Washington told CNN,external. Boseman was viewed by many as the man who broke down screen barriers for black actors with his lead role as T'Challa/Black Panther in the Marvel superhero movie Black Panther in 2018. Michael B Jordan, who portrayed N'Jadaka/Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens in the film, paid tribute on social media on Monday to the man he called his ""big brother"". ""I've been trying to find the words, but nothing comes close to how I feel"", he posted, alongside a series of photos of the two of them together. ""I've been reflecting on every moment, every conversation, every laugh, every disagreement, every hug ... everything. ""I wish we had more time. One of the last times we spoke, you said we were forever linked, and now the truth of that means more to me than ever."" Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan acted opposite one another in Black Panther Jordan added that Boseman had ""paved the way for me"". ""You showed me how to be better, honour purpose, and create legacy,"" he wrote. ""I wish we had more time. Everything you've given the world... the legends and heroes that you've shown us we are... will live on forever."" He concluded that his friend's death had made him realise that ""time is short with people we love and admire,"" and promised to dedicate the rest of his life to living like him - ""with grace, courage, and no regrets"".

Earlier, another Black Panther star,Winston Duke, wrote,externalthat he was ""absolutely devastated"" by the loss of ""my friend and hero"". Harrison Ford also paid tribute, saying: ""Chadwick Boseman was as compelling, powerful and truthful as the characters he chose to play. ""His intelligence, personal dignity and deep commitment inspired his colleagues and elevated the stories he told. He is as much a hero as any he played. He is loved and will be deeply missed.""

"Young people will be guaranteed a job, education or formal training under a new Scottish government scheme. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the ""youth guarantee"" was aimed at ensuring young people do not carry the ""economic scars"" of coronavirus into adulthood. The Â£60m initiative will be backed by additional money for apprenticeships. It was announced as Ms Sturgeonset out her government's plans,externalfor the next year. Under the proposals, everyone aged between 16 and 24 in Scotland will be guaranteed ""an opportunity at university or college, an apprenticeship programme, employment including work experience, or participating in a formal volunteering programme"". Live reaction to the programme for government Indyref2 plans to be published in draft bill Scotland to get dedicated Covid-19 tracing app Ms Sturgeon said further details of the scheme would be outlined on Wednesday. And she said the guarantee ""signals our absolute determination that youth unemployment will not be a legacy of this pandemic."" The number of people in work in Scotland has beenhit hard by the coronavirus lockdown, with a sharp rise in those claiming benefits andmore than 700,000 staff placed on furlough. Other measures outlined in the programme for government included: A new""proximity tracing app""to help combat the spread of Covid-19 ""Examining and setting out options"" for the creation of a National Care Service A Â£25m fund to provide retraining opportunities for 10,000 people who have lost their jobs or are at risk of doing so Details of how Â£1.6bn of the Â£2bn Green New Deal that was unveiled last year will be spent, including measures aimed at decarbonising the way homes are heated, reducing emissions, tackling fuel poverty and a Â£100m Green Jobs fund Providing an ""electronic device, unlimited data and two years of digital support and training"" to  50,000 people who ""would otherwise be without digital access"" Introducing legislation on domestic abuse protection orders and progressing legislation to improve forensic medical examinations for victims of sexual assault The first minister also announced that there would be a draft bill on a second independence referendum - as shedid in her programme for government in 2016,external. This will include the government's preferred question that would be asked, and ""the timescale in which we consider the referendum should be held"". Allow Twitter content?

It says that this timescale would ""take account of the current state of the Covid-19 pandemic at the time of publication of the draft bill."" However, there is no prospect of the bill being passed before the next Scottish Parliament election in May - with Ms Sturgeon instead saying that the SNP would seek to ""make the case"" for the plan in the election campaign. The government hasalready shelved a series of billswhich will not be taken forward because of the pandemic, including proposals for a tourist tax and reforms to the Gender Recognition Act. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government would publish a draft bill on a second independence referendum Ms Sturgeon stressed that suppressing the virus was her ""most immediate priority"" - and would continue to be so ""for some time"". She added: ""Put simply, if Covid runs rampant again, our economy will sustain even deeper, longer lasting damage. ""However, we will not simply hunker down and wait for the storm to pass. ""Even amidst the uncertainties of a global pandemic, this is a time to be ambitious and to use the disruption of Covid to rethink how we do things."" The first minister said the NHS Louisa Jordan hospital at the SEC in Glasgow will open through the winter. And eligibility for the flu vaccine will be extended to ""everyone over the age of 55, social care workers and those who live with shielded people. The Scottish Conservatives said the programme for government fails to meet the challenges facing people in the ""real world"", and said Ms Sturgeon should be doing more to protect small businesses from ""the damage of local lockdown and business rates revaluations"",. Party leader Douglas Ross said: ""This was the moment where the first minister could have put selfish, narrow interests to one side and united the country. ""Instead, we're told the solution is another Referendum Bill, only this time in the middle of a pandemic. ""The fundamental difference between our outlook is this: I know Scotland can succeed today, the first minister thinks we can't until the SNP get their way with separation."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard welcomed Ms Sturgeon's commitment to ""take the first step on the road to a National Care Service"", but warned that ""time is running out"" to support care homes. He also welcomed employment support plans, but said promises about new green jobs had been made before without resulting in any progress, saying: ""How do we know that this time we won't simply go back to how things were?"" Green MSP Alison Johnstone welcomed Ms Sturgeon's pledge to build a ""fairer and greener Scotland"", but said work must begin immediately. government should ""step up the urgency"", adding: ""Work to build a fairer and greener Scotland is welcome, but the work to do that must begin now."" And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the government had failed to deliver on past promises, calling for a faster rollout of free childcare hours and a ""recovery plan"" for child mental health services. This programme is first of all a response to the health and economic crises caused by Covid-19. A youth guarantee of education, training or employment for young people is the centre piece of action on jobs. A review of adult social care with the promise to create a National Care Service is an eye-catching commitment for older people, worst-hit by the pandemic. That reform would probably take years to fulfil - which highlights another key thing about today's programme. It is a pre-election package. With a Holyrood vote due in May 2021, the first minister is also indicating what she would do if returned to office. That includes pushing for another independence referendum, with a draft bill setting out the proposed timetable and question to be published soon.

"This video can not be played Llangennech train fire: Wreckage on the rail tracks A huge clear-up operation is continuing after a train crash spilled hundreds of tonnes of oil into a wildlife haven. Ten wagons, each containing 75 tonnes of diesel,derailed and spilled oilinto the Loughor Estuary, near Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, on Wednesday. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said oil has now spread as far as Crofty, Swansea, about 4.5 miles (7km) away. Cockle beds and shell fisheries have been closed after advice from the Food Standards Agency. The scene of devastation could be seen from above The water was dark heading into the estuary The Loughor Estuary is part of the Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries Special Area of Conservation, and local wildlife groups have already warnedit could have a ""devastating impact"" on the environment. People wereevacuated from their homes and a major incident was declaredafter a freight train carrying wagons of Puma Energy's diesel derailed and burst into flames, causing the fuel to spill into the estuary, which is a site of special scientific interest and home to wildfowl and wading birds. On Sunday the oil had been spotted as far away as Crofty, Natural Resources Wales said Natural Resources Wales said it was ""doing everything in our power to mitigate the impacts of this incident"" NRW was not able to investigate the damage of the spill until the fire was put out, which took firefighters 33 hours. On Saturday, NRW said the spill was ""no longer confined to the upper reaches of the estuary and has been observed at many locations as far as Crofty"". On Tuesday, cranes are due to be brought in to start removing the wreckage from the tracks, with it estimated two wagons could be removed a day. NRW said thousands of litres of fuel had already been pumped from the wagons and the surrounding area. Over the weekend, trenches were dug and booms and absorbent pads put in place to try and contain the diesel, while ""vacuuming and skimming operations"" are also taking place, NRW said. ""These techniques have proved to be working well and are removing a considerable quantity of diesel from the water courses,"" a spokesman said. Samples are being taken, and an environment group made up of representatives from Public Health Wales, the Food Standards Agency, local councils, government departments and wildlife bodies has been formed to respond to the incident. Diesel has been pumped from the wagons ahead of their removal Ben Wilson, NRW's incident manager, said: ""Our priority at this time is to work with our partners at the incident scene to contain the diesel spill and prevent it from polluting the Loughor Estuary any further. ""We also have monitoring teams out assessing the extent of the pollution. Their work will help the multi-agency Wales Environment Group to assess the wider environmental impact at sites such as the local fisheries and bathing water sites, and any effect on wildlife in the area."" The estuary is home to important shellfisheries and cockle beds, which have been closed as a ""precaution"" following advice from the Food Standards Agency, NRW said. The map showing the observed presence of diesel in the Loughor Estuary on 29 August While Public Health Wales (PHW) said it was unlikely that anyone exposed to diesel for a short period of time would have any adverse health effects, it is sensible to avoid contact with diesel or the water in contaminated areas. Andrew Kibble of PHW said: ""If anyone gets diesel on their skin, they should remove any affected clothing and wash using soap and water and if they feel unwell seek medical attention. ""We would also advise that all pets are kept out of contact with the diesel and that members of the public do not pick up any birds or other animals affected by diesel from the shoreline.""

"Millions of people turning 18 from now will be able to withdraw money from Child Trust Funds for the first time. Children born from September 2002 were given vouchers by the government to invest for the future, with the money only accessible at the age of 18. The savings pots could now be worth more than Â£1,000, or more if parents added contributions. However, many thousands of young people may have no idea these savings exist in their name. Child Trust Funds were set up by the Labour government to encourage parents to save for their children. The idea was for children to have some savings at the age of 18, to assist with costs such as further education funding or living alone for the first time. The government initially put Â£250 into the tax-free account during a child's first year, then added another Â£250 when he or she reached the age of seven. For lower-income families, the payment was Â£500. Parents, family and friends could also contribute to the account, up to set limits. The scheme was watered down, then scrapped entirely by the coalition government in January 2011. The first recipients of Child Trust Fund vouchers will now be turning 18 and can access the money for the first time. Each month about 55,000 people turn 18, and eventually a total of about 6.3 million people will be able to redeem the money, or continue to save, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Teenagers can actually take control of their account from the age of 16, but can only withdraw money from it from 18. For those who do nothing, the Child Trust Fund provider will move it into an Individual Savings Account, which is also tax-free, or roll it into another account with similar benefits. Kerry McWalter was surprised about the windfall Kerry McWalter is turning 18 in two weeks and will have access to a Child Trust Fund worth Â£1,400. She is just about to start a pharmacy studies course in Edinburgh, and said she would use the money for living costs and a future holiday as well as saving some of it. She found out about the possibility of a fund while looking on social media and used The Share Foundation's tracing service. ""When I found out, I was quite surprised. I wasn't aware I had one. My mum had forgotten about it,"" she said. She then told a close friend, who discovered she had a similar level of savings that she had no idea about. This money has often been in accounts where it is invested in shares. The success of those shares over time will determine their value, as will the original value of the government voucher. Accountants estimate that with the maximum parental contribution over the years, and investment growth, the fund could be worth as much as Â£70,000. A more realistic scenario for many people is that the money has sat untouched in accounts over the years. Even then, those born into low-income families are likely to receive a windfall of around Â£1,500. Parents were invited to open a Child Trust Fund with one of a number of providers within a year of their child being born. About 4.5 million were set up by parents or guardians. Children in care had accounts set up by local authorities and these are now managed by The Share Foundation - a charity which is also helping people to track down their funds. In 1.8 million cases when parents did nothing, the accounts were set up automatically by the UK's tax authority. HMRC admits that in potentially many thousands of cases, youngsters have no idea that they have such savings. Child Trust Fundscan be found using the Government Gateway service,external, which requires a login or registration. The Child Trust Fund unique reference number, or national insurance number is also needed. The Share Foundation charity runsa free finding service,external. Moreinformation on Child Trust Funds,externalis available on through the government-backed Money and Pensions Service. Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: ""We want to make sure all young people can access the money which has been set aside for them, to invest in their future and continue a savings habit, as they turn 18. ""If you're unsure if you have an account or where it may be, it's easy to track down your provider online."" When accessed there are a range of options for teenagers to consider. ""Getting a windfall like this can be daunting,"" said Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at financial firm Willis Owen. ""There are lots of options to consider when it comes to how to use the money. Some may want to spend it, and others may want to invest it to make more money for their futures.""

"Stormzy, who has previously headlined Glastonbury, was due to perform at Reading and Leeds this year Reading and Leeds Festival will be back next year with six headliners split across two main stages in each site. The event, which sees acts rotate between Reading and Leeds, had been due to happen last weekend but was called off due to the coronavirus pandemic. Now 2021's headliners will be Stormzy, Liam Gallagher, Post Malone, Catfish And The Bottlemen, Disclosure and Queens Of The Stone Age. Up to 200,000 fans are expected at next year's events - from 27 to 29 August. Liam Gallagher seems pretty pleased to be back on stage next year The head of the event's promoters Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, said it was their ""most epic plan yet"". ""Two main stages, six headliners, the best line up of acts 2021 will see and 200,000 fans are going to celebrate the best music,"" he added. The event, regarded by many live music fans as second only to Glastonbury in the annual UK music calendar, will also include AJ Tracey, Doja Cat, Lewis Capaldi, Mabel and Two Door Cinema Club, along with rappers Ashnikko, DaBaby and Fever 333. Vale Earth Fair festival held in Covid-free Guernsey - BBC News Festival staff 'devastated' by summer of cancellations - BBC News Rapper Stormzy and former Oasis frontman Gallagher had been due to headline the 2020 events - along with rock band Rage Against The Machine - and the organisers were able to retain the services of both British superstars. Gallagher said: ""Yes Brothers and Sisters, I come bearing good news...Yours Truly is headlining Reading & Leeds 2021. C'MON YOU KNOW. LG"" Catfish And The Bottlemen, who will headline the festival for the first time, told BBC Radio 1 it was a ""huge honour"" to have been asked to top the bill. ""We've always had it in the back of our minds since we first played the BBC Introducing stage [in 2013],"" the band's frontman Van McCann said. ""To be able to come back now and have that slot, it's a big one. ""We'll probably turn up with a few new songs."" The organisers are hoping fans will still enjoy attending - although it may not look quite like this next year However, some on social media complained about the lack of female artists among next year's headliners, all of whom are male. Robert accused the organisers of ""misogyny"", while another tweeted that the headliners were being outshone by the women featured in the 2021 line-up, but apparently ""deemed not headline-worthy"".

"The return of pupils to schools in England this week will be a ""massive milestone"", says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. But he apologised to students for the ""stress and uncertainty"" of problems with A-level and GCSE results. Mr Williamson told MPs the u-turn on results became necessary when ""too many inconsistencies"" appeared in grades. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green accused him of a ""summer of chaos, incompetence and confusion"". This week many pupils in England and Wales are going back to school - after the long disruption caused by the pandemic outbreak, with almost all schools expected to be ready to teach pupils full time. Williamson says A-levels and GCSEs likely to be later next summer Labour calls for delays to next summer's exams Next year's exams will need to be slimmed down, say head teachers England's education secretary, speaking in the House of Commons, welcomed that pupils will be returning to a safe environment. But for students caught up in the exam fiasco he said he ""can only apologise to them"". Labour's Ms Green pressed him on how many students might still have missed out on a first choice at university as a result of the confusion. This video can not be played BBC Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what schools are doing to keep pupils safe A survey from YouGov also suggested there were still fears about safety in school - with 17% of parents ""seriously considering"" not sending back their children. The polling firm has recordedgrowing confidence in sending pupils back, but this latest survey, as schools prepare to reopen, suggests a hard core of unconvinced parents. Parents were more likely to back wearing masks in school, with 47% in favour and 36% against. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the first Cabinet meeting since the summer break, said there was likely to be more of ""this wretched Covid still to come"" but he was ""absolutely confident"" that ""we are going to be able to deal with those outbreaks"". The return to school has raised concerns about what will happen to next summer's A-levels and GCSEs, when so much teaching time has been lost. Mr Williamson told MPs that exams would go ahead next summer - and there were plans being made ""to ensure that this is done as smoothly as possible"". Schools Minister Nick Gibb said earlier there would soon be a decision on whether exams would start later next summer - as previously suggested. In June, Mr Williamson told MPs that he would consult with Ofqual, England's exam regulator, on ""how we can move those exams back, giving children extra time in order to be able to learn"". Ofqual has suggested that relatively few changes will need to be made to how much is taught for exams - but heads' leader Geoff Barton criticised this as ""little more than tinkering at the edges"". The ASCL head teachers' union has called for a reduction in the scale of the content of exam courses to take account of the amount of teaching time that has been lost. This video can not be played The PM says workers are going back to the office âin huge numbersâ. There have also been questions about what will happen if schools face local lockdowns - and whether there will have to be a back-up plan for teachers' predictions to be used again. West Sussex head teacher Jules White said a month's delay for exams would only be ""window dressing"". ""The idea that all students, especially those who are disadvantaged, will rapidly catch up on vast amounts of subject content is naively optimistic and politicians from all sides must call for urgent and meaningful modifications to exams,"" said Mr White, who has organised school funding campaigns. Labour has called for the exams, usually taken in May and June, to be pushed back to mid-summer to help cope with the impact of coronavirus. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? This year's exams were dogged by chaos and left teachers, parents and pupils calling for a major rethink of next summer's exams. Nearly 40% of A-level grades awarded to students using an algorithm were below teachers' assessments, with disadvantaged students particularly badly affected. Days after the results were announced, and following widespread criticism, the government performed a U-turn and decided tobase grades on teachers' recommendationsinstead. Conservative MP Tim Loughton said the exam problems had been a ""shambles"" and that after such a ""turbulent"" summer when ""things have not gone as well as they should have done"", the government needed to ""get control of the agenda again"". ""I think a lot of people will find it surprising that we seem to have had a few heads roll who are civil servants and in charge in quangos but so far there has been no ministerial accountability and I think that is raising a few questions. ""Ministers have lost their jobs for a lot less, including education ministers,"" said Mr Loughton.

"Emily Lewis, 15, was among 12 people on board the RIB when it struck a buoy A girl killed in a boat crash during a family sightseeing trip died from an abdominal injury, an inquest heard. Emily Lewis, 15, was among 12 people taken to hospital after the rigid inflatable boat (Rib) hit a buoy in Southampton Water on 22 August. An inquest opening heard she was taken to Southampton General Hospital but later died of her injuries. Miss Lewis' mother Nikki and sister Amy, 19, who were also in the boat, both suffered broken arms. Coroner Christopher Wilkinson said Miss Lewis was accompanied to hospital by her father, Simon Lewis, from the Park Gate area of Southampton, who confirmed her identity to medics. Mr Wilkinson said the teenager was ""rendered unconscious"" as a result of the crash off Netley, and later died after resuscitation attempts by medics failed. He added a post-mortem examination carried out at Winchester hospital by forensic pathologist Dr Russell Delaney revealed a preliminary cause of death as an upper abdominal injury. The coroner said that investigations were ongoing and adjourned the case for a full inquest on 5 May 2021. The Southampton Harbour Master was seen inspecting buoys in the stretch of water where the crash happened In a previously released statement, Miss Lewis' family said: ""We are all in shock that our beautiful daughter and sister is no longer with us. ""We suffered from broken bones, but the emotional pain far outweighs the physical."" Hampshire Constabulary is investigating the incident, which happened just after 10:00 BST, along with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Marine Accident Investigation Branch Officers confirmed the Rib had been on a commercial trip run by a local company.

"Breakfast clubs and after school care is ""essential"" for many families Parents may be unable to return to work or could even stop their children going back to school amid uncertainty over childcare, a nursery has claimed. While schools gear up to welcome back pupils, many breakfast and after-school clubs are unable to fully reopen. Companies providing care said they were still unsure when services could fully resume - leaving parents in the dark. The Welsh Government said it expected more childcare places to become available as schools reopen. For those parents unable to drop off and collect their children at school-time,clubs before and after classes are essential. However some companies that provide services such as ""wraparound"" care - looking after children both before and after school - are unable to fully reopen due to coronavirus restrictions. When schools closed in March, childcare providers could only offer services to children of key workers. Services have slowly increased but restrictions have had ""a massive impact"" on those businesses, said Claire Bailyes, of Little Inspirations in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf. Parents are facing difficult decisions, said nursery manager Claire Bailyes The company has seven locations across south-east Wales and said navigating the guidance, often at ""short notice"" and ""not clear at times"", had been difficult. ""Normally we would have school collections, breakfast club and after-school club"", said Ms Bailyes. ""However with everything going on it's very limited, so it's had a big impact on the nurseries and it's been very short notice to let parents know."" Nursery closures lead to childcare struggle for NHS staff Childcare Offer for Wales: Parents 'shocked' by bills Free childcare 'could help close wealth gap' With many grandparents self-isolating, the lack of care is affecting parents' ability to return to work. ""There's been a lot of disappointment for parents. Some are not able to go back to work as they have to stay home with the children,"" she added. ""Some have even considered not sending their children to school as they're not going to be able to take and collect them. ""The staggered pick up times are just so awkward and many grandparents are not there because they are isolating or shielding."" ""We don't have the flexibility to leave work early,"" said Owain Rogers One parent facing uncertainty at how either he or his wife, who is a teacher, can drop off and collect their two sons is Owain Rogers, from Cardiff. ""That service is essential for us because we don't have a support network to pick up the kids at three o'clock,"" he said. ""We really depend on the after-school club to be able to go back to work because neither my wife or I have the flexibility to leave early. ""It's really hard to know what provision we can put in place. We're going to have to rely on friends, but then we feel a burden, and other families are in the same predicament - worrying about what's happening.

Schools are open and people need to go back to work."" Childcare providers have been inundated with queries from parents The Welsh Government said almost 70% of childcare settings in Wales were now open, with more expected to resume services as schools reopen. ""We understand there may be some variations in service at the start of the autumn term as schools and childcare providers get used to the new ways of operating and we are working with local authorities to ensure childcare is available to families,"" it said. ""We also recentlyannounced Â£4m in funding to support the childcare sectorto ensure more providers re-open as schools return in September."" It added that school-run breakfast clubs were under a ""legal duty"" to resume at the start of the new term. A spokesman said: ""We would expect that as primary schools open, [school-run] breakfast clubs should operate as normal unless it would be unreasonable for them to do so.""

"Alex Penn is concerned that his firm SSE Audio is losing talented staff Alex Penn has been planning for the unwinding of the government's coronavirus furlough scheme since July - but it doesn't make the job cuts any easier. From Tuesday, companies using the scheme are now having to contribute to workers' wages. And like many companies, Mr Penn's sound equipment firm SSE Audio has not seen a post-lockdown revival in business sufficient to keep everyone employed. ""We entered a consultation period in July,"" said the SSE co-managing director. ""We spoke to everybody in the company. We wanted to make sure we were preparing ourselves for the worst."" Since March, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has paid 80% of the wages of workers placed on leave, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. But now that is going down to 70%, with the employer paying 10%. Said Mr Penn: ""The fact that our costs would be ramping up in relation to the furlough scheme as of 1 September, that was when we decided we needed to go through our initial round of redundancies."" The firm, which provides sound systems for arena gigs such as the Reading and Leeds music festivals, is going from 200 employees to 150. The impact of the pandemic has hit the arts and entertainment sector particularly hard, and Mr Penn fears a loss of talent. ""Many of our freelancers are already working in other jobs and we don't expect all of them to come back so it is really important that businesses like ours are protected,"" he said. How is furlough changing now? Chancellor says furlough cannot last indefinitely Redundancy advice calls triple in June and July Many other companies are also likely to began shedding more staff as the scheme unwinds, which is why some economists are predicting a huge jump in unemployment. Calls for the scheme to be extended are growing. It is due to finish at the end of October andChancellor Rishi Sunak has repeatedly ruled out an extensionto it. Last month, he said it was ""wrong to keep people trapped"" in a situation where there was no realistic prospect of them having a job to go back to. From 1 September, the government will pay 70% of wages up to a cap of Â£2,187.50 a month. Employers are already paying employees' pension contributions and National Insurance, but will now have to pay 10% of salaries as well. In October, the government will pay 60% of wages up to a cap of Â£1,875. The employers' share of the bill will then go up to 20% of wages. BBC business correspondent Dharshini David It was hailed as groundbreaking: the scheme which provided a vital lifeline to businesses and more than 9.5 million workers. But weaning UK businesses off the retention scheme will be the biggest challenge so far for Rishi Sunak. With business far from usual, one in 12 workers continue to have their wages for paid by the state. The chancellor is adamant that it's time to end the scheme as businesses reopen. The price-tag so far has crossed Â£35bn, the kind of level which points to tax rises further down the road. Instead, he points to other forms of support for job retention and creation that he's introduced, from a bonus scheme for employers keeping on staff to targeted VAT cuts for the hospitality industry. Yet the chancellor's own independent forecaster reckons unemployment could reach rates not seen since the 1980s. Mr Sunak admits he can't save every job. The challenge is to prevent a crisis which could ultimately be far more costly for the economy. The increased cost of the scheme poses a problem for employers, who face difficult decisions about whether to make staff redundant. Craig Beaumont of the Federation of Small Businesses told the BBC's Today programme that one million small employers across the country had used the furlough scheme. He said that 23% of small employers were considering reducing their headcount in the next three months. ""This is very very serious. That's a huge section of the economy,"" he said. ""Sixty per cent of those who work in the private sector do so for a small business, so if that happens without any intervention, then that's a huge increase in mass unemployment."" Acas has seen a huge rise in calls to its redundancy advice line Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, told the programme that other countries, such as France and Germany, had extended comparable schemes. Last week, for instance,Germany agreed to extend a scheme that tops up payfor workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic until the end of 2021. ""The UK scheme, in that sense, looks a little bit short, especially when you take into account that the UK's economy is made up of a higher share of sectors that are hampered by social distancing,"" Mr Dales said. However, he added that many jobs were currently ""frozen"" and would not come back after the coronavirus crisis. ""You do want to start the process of reallocating those people to jobs that will be around for many many years,"" he said. Some businesses that are still suffering from the pandemic, including live music venues that have not yet reopened, are feeling the effects of the furlough tapering. Tristan Moffat, operations director of the Piano Works bars in London's Farringdon and West End districts, told BBC Radio 5 live that his business had 104 members of staff on furlough. This video can not be played What could post-lockdown nights out look like? The bars are still closed at present, but the company is hoping to reopen them in October with strict social distancing measures in place. The idea is that before customers even enter the club, they will have their temperatures taken and be sprayed with disinfectant in a special tunnel. Pandemic 'biggest knock to live music in my life' But that depends on the lifting of restrictions on audiences singing and dancing, as each venue has a six-piece band that plays non-stop music. ""If we're not able to reopen in the short term, then we would have very very difficult decisions ahead,"" he said. The impending end of the scheme is already having an impact on the economy, analysts say. Conciliation service Acas has saidcalls to its redundancy advice line almost tripled in June and July, as concerns mounted about the implications. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ''The unwinding of the furlough scheme has been followed by announcements of significant job losses across multiple sectors, particularly travel and retail. ""Although growth has been recovering as lockdown restrictions have eased, it has become increasingly clear that the government's job retention scheme has been masking the damage wreaked by the pandemic on jobs and the wider economy. ""As the scheme tapers further at the start of next month and the government stops subsidising wages altogether by 31 October, we would expect economic recovery to lose momentum as businesses across many industries are forced to lay off more staff.""

Mr Jeremy, whose real name is Ronald Jeremy Hyatt, appeared in court in June.He was accused of raping a 25-year-old woman and 30 year-old woman, and sexually assaulting two others, aged 33 and 46. At the time his lawyer denied the charges saying said that his client had been ""a paramour to over 4,000 women"" and that ""women throw themselves at him"". Ron Jeremy appeared in court in Los Angeles in June But prosecutors received further allegations of sexual violence in the days following his court appearance,the Los Angeles Times reported,external. The new charges include a total of 20 counts of rape and sexual assault against the 13 women. The alleged victims range in age between 15 and 54.

"Illegal bikers are being targeted by police and Natural Resources Wales Illegal off-road bikers using remote Wales as a ""playground"" are damaging sites of special scientific interest, police say. Dyfed-Powys Police has increased patrols around Teifi Pools and in the Tywi Forest, Ceredigion. Fines were issued to people who travelled to these places during lockdown. Now restrictions have been eased illegal off-roading is on the rise, officers say. Off-roading can be done legally on green lanes, a network of ancient unsurfaced public roads and rights of way. The Green Lane Association works with the police to target illegal off-roaders, who it says have a negative effect on the activity. Cardiff illegal off-road motorbiking fatality fear Illegal off-road bikes 'worse' during lockdown Off-road bikers: Police double number of officers The organisation's Lauren Eaton said: ""Wales is very much an area to go to when it comes to green-laning, it's extremely popular. ""What they're not necessarily interested in is joining organisations, and then rather than asking for advice and help, they try to do it off their own backs without the information to do it legally."" She wants the police to do more. ""We understand that resources are obviously spread thin, and that there are crimes that would take precedence over this type of behaviour, but it has a huge impact on residents and very sensitive land in some cases,"" she said. The police are working with Natural Resources Wales (NRW) to tackle the problem. Off-roading is a cause of major environmental damage, police say Its forestry area manager, Jim Ralph, said bikes were the cause of ""lots"" of complaints when they were used ""in a dangerous, noisy and antisocial way."" ""We regularly receive complaints concerning the antisocial use of off-road motorbikes, and to help reduce harm to individuals and communities, we will continue to work closely with Dyfed-Powys Police,"" he said. There are green lanes around Teifi Pools and Tywi Forest - but police are concerned some off-road vehicle owners are driving where they choose. Insp Matthew Howells, of Dyfed-Powys Police said: ""There are gangs of 10 to 15 males, they'll come down in their vans full of bikes, and they'll just off-road wherever as if it were a playground for them to play in. ""There's environmental damage in particular, a lot of these areas are SSIs [sites of special scientific interest] which come under NRW, so we work with them to tackle that problem."" ""You've got your legal 4x4s and off-road motorbikes, and as long as they're road legal then they can drive on the green lanes. ""But you also have people coming out with the 'pit bikes' - they're smaller motorbikes, they're not registered, they're not insured."" The police have warned local farmers not to approach any groups or individuals who they may come across who are off-roading illegally. Police have the power to seize vehicles which are used in a way which causes harassment, alarm or distress A warning is given first but if a vehicle is used in an antisocial manner again, it can be seized under Section 59 of the Police Reform Act Vehicles can also be seized if the rider or driver is not insured or has no road tax Riders are advised to contact councils' rights of way officers for information on where they can ride, or join a riders' organisation Source:Dyfed-Powys Police,external Police capture off-road biker with toddler on lap Crushed nuisance bikes to be publicly displayed Illegal off-road bikers 'worse' during pandemic Dyfed-Powys Police Natural Resources Wales Green Lane Association 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played All you need to know about Wales' schools returning full-time Exams in Wales could be delayed in 2021, following the cancellation of this year's tests. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said discussions would be held with regulator Qualifications Wales. There have been calls for the examsto be cancelled again, but Ms Williams said she intended for them to go ahead. There could be changes to how the qualifications are taught, with exam board WJEC looking at making changes like reducing set texts. It follows controversy in August at the way A-level results were provided,before the system to judge pupils' grades was scrappedin favour of teacher assessments. Exams in England are likely to be delayedwhere a UK government minister has promised a decision ""very soon"". Children will head back to the classroom across Wales this week. Amid concerns about coronavirus, truancy fines will not be issued if pupils do not attend at the start of the school year, but this plan will be reviewed as the term develops. Students had called on the government to use teacher-predicted grades Speaking at a Welsh Government press conference, Ms Williams said: ""It is our intention at this time, to hold examinations next year. ""There are discussions about when those examinations may take place."" The minister said Qualifications Wales was speaking to other UK regulators ""as to whether it would be wise to move those examinations to a different point in the year, primarily to maximise teaching"". But she said any delay would have a ""knock-on effect"" on matters such as progression and results day. Childcare uncertainty 'could block parents' work return' Unions call for school facemasks to be compulsory WJEC had been ""working on amendments to specs that will be taught this term, to make them as manageable as possible for schools"", Ms Williams said. That could include reducing case studies or set texts for literature students, changes she said ""go further"" than those made in England. Details of a review of 2020's exams were announced last week - it will provide recommendations for how next year's qualifications are handled. TheUK Labour Partyhas called for next summer's GCSE and A-level exams to be pushed back in England. Delyth Jewell of Plaid Cymru said the final report of the independent review is not due until mid-December, ""which is too close for those sitting exams in January 2021"". ""The Welsh Government has an opportunity now to cancel exams, rather than waste valuable time delaying what many feel will be an inevitable decision,"" she said. Meanwhile, Ms Williams said new funding was being provided to give reopening schools extra teachers and support. The Â£29m fund is targeted at Years 11, 12 and 13 as well as disadvantaged and vulnerable learners. It will also be used to provide extra coaching support, personalised learning programmes and resources for exam year pupils. Children in Wales start returning to school this week Children will be expected to wear their uniform when they go back to school, Ms Williams told the press conference. She said she wanted to see ""as much normality should be resumed"" where possible and it would be ""helpful"" if uniforms could be washed regularly, rather than being dry-cleaned. The minister said it was important school children are tested if they have suspected coronavirus. ""All children who are exhibiting a new continuous cough, temperature, loss of taste and smell, will be required to take a test. ""I appreciate that as we enter into the winter months, other potential illnesses could well be confused but at this stage any child, or member of staff in school, are exhibiting any of these signs they will need to be tested"". Kirsty Williams said discussions were ongoing about when next year's exams would be held Speaking earlier on BBC Wales Breakfast, Ms Williams said that in the first few days of the catch-up sessions before the summer break, some parents had been ""reluctant"" to send their children back. ""When parents saw other children were returning to school, that it was being done as safely and securely as possible, and that the children were getting so much out of going to school, we saw confidence growing,"" she said. ""We want to have reassuring conversations with parents, rather than threatening them with fines."" She added: ""At this stage it is absolutely appropriate that we have those conversations to understand why parents may have concerns, why they don't want to send their children back, and to work with parents, school by school, on an individual basis, to reassure them."" But Ms Williams stated the situation in schools would be reviewed as the term progressed. The UK's chief medical adviser has saidchildren are more likely to be harmed by not returning to school than if they catch coronavirus. But Ms Williams said while everything was being done to make sure schools were as safe as possible, there were ""no risk-free options"".

"Some of Ocado's vans will now show M&S's Percy Pig sweets Angry Ocado customers have been complaining to the online grocer after their orders were cancelled on the first day of the firm's tie-up with Marks and Spencer. M&S has bought a 50% share of Ocado's retail business, which gives the grocer an internet-based delivery service for the first time. But the ""surge in demand"" meant Ocado was unable to fulfil what it called a ""very small number"" of orders. The firm apologised to those affected. ""The vast majority of customers are unaffected and will be delivered as normal. We would like to thank our customers for giving M&S such a big welcome and sincere apologies to any customers having to wait a bit longer,"" it said in a statement. M&S has now begun doing something many of its competitors have been doing for years - it is making its full food range available to order online. A number of customers vented their disappointment at having their orders cancelled at the last minute, despite booking them well in advance Allow Twitter content?

One customer tweeted: ""Big day but you've cancelled my order that has been booked for 4 weeks! Long time customer who now can't get a delivery until Sunday... shocking service!"" Another said she was taking her business elsewhere in future. ""My order due 2pm tomorrow has been cancelled. I booked the slot over 10 days ago. I have been an Ocado customer for 10 years. Day 1 of M&S and I want to know how I can cancel my membership,"" she said. The deal with Ocado comes at a crucial time for M&S, which is cutting 7,000 jobs. But analysts are divided on the wisdom of the deal. One expert, Kate Hardcastle, told the BBC that M&S had ""taken a long time"" to enter the online grocery market and that expectations were high. But another analyst, Richard Hyman, said the move could erode the retailer's profits and was ""a big mistake"". Until now, the only M&S food available online has been party food and celebration dinners to order or, in certain locations, a limited range of about 130 M&Sfood and household items through Deliveroo. But if you live in Scotland, you're out of luck. Ocado does not currently operate north of the border and has no plans to do so at present. For existing customers of Ocado, it means big changes. In the past, consumers who wanted to buy into Waitrose's upmarket image without busting their budget had the option of choosing from the supermarket's Essential Waitrose range. But now they will need to take their pick from M&S's Remarksable Value range instead. Shoppers can now choose from 6,000 M&S food items, alongside Ocado own-label goods and big-name branded items. M&S has vowed that all its replacement products will be the same price as, or cheaper than, the equivalent Waitrose items. M&S and Ocado say that their joint offer now amounts to more than 50,000 products, which they say is ""double that of the next largest grocery retailer"". But if Ocado customers don't like the new set-up, they have the option of switching to Waitrose's own delivery service, Waitrose.com. The tie-up with Ocado comes at a critical time for M&S. The retailer employs almost 78,000 people, most of them in the UK. The bulk of the latest job cuts are expected to come among shop floor workers, with about 12% of customer assistant roles going. Shopping may never be the same again, says M&S The deal with Ocado was originally announced early last year, well before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. However, Covid-19 has exacerbated existing problems for M&S, which has struggled to restore the fortunes of its hard-hit clothing and home goods divisions since shops reopened after lockdown. At the height of lockdown, M&S boss Steve Rowe said customers might ""never shop the same way again"" after the coronavirus crisis. As a result, the company is shifting resources and recruiting towards areas that are expanding - online and food. Ocado Retail chief executive Melanie Smith hailed the deal as a ""winning combination of the country's fastest-growing grocer and the nation's most beloved food brand"". But it could still be a tricky moment for the online grocer if it turns out that shoppers valued Waitrose's goods more than they did Ocado's customer service and user-friendly website. And Ocado now has to face stronger competition, with its former partner eager to win market share for its own website. Ocado has been offering Waitrose products since it began its commercial delivery service in 2002. At that time, Waitrose already had its own internet-based deliveries, but on a much smaller basis. Now it says it can reach 90% of UK postcodes. ""The supply relationship has worked well for almost 20 years, but now both parties are ready to go their own way,"" says Waitrose. Consumer and retail expert Kate Hardcastle told the BBC she had placed an order for 1 September to test the new Ocado and had so far had two items cancelled. ""For each one, they sent me a Â£5 voucher,"" she said, adding that this was an indication of how much pressure M&S and Ocado were under to get their partnership right. ""Everyone's expectations are pretty high and the world is watching,"" she added. She acknowledged that M&S could have been in the online grocery market sooner, but compared the delay with previous foot-dragging by the retailer over issues such as accepting credit cards. M&S to cut 7,000 jobs over next three months Ocado says switch to online shopping is permanent ""M&S do things very much their way,"" she said. ""They've taken a long time to do it, but if there's a time to do it, it's now."" However, another retail analyst, Richard Hyman, thinks the whole deal is misconceived and M&S should stay on the High Street. ""It's very difficult to make money from selling food online,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm not sure that anyone does."" Mr Hyman said M&S had ""a terrific food business as it stands"", but risked eroding its profit margins as it tried to turn itself into a destination for the family shop. ""Old business thinking says, 'We must get bigger,'"" he says. ""But being big isn't as beautiful as it used to be."" He said M&S was ""trying to please too many people"" and would ""dilute its core offering"" as a result. ""It's almost as if M&S aspires to be like other food retailers, which strikes me as a big mistake.""

"Popular videoconferencing app Zoom has seen its revenues skyrocket as second quarter profits more than doubled due to the coronavirus crisis. Revenues leaped 355% to $663.5m (Â£496.3m) for the three months ending 31 July, beating analysts' expectations of $500.5m. Profits soared to $186m, while customer growth rose 458%, compared with the same period in 2019. Video conferencing apps remain crucial due to the increase in remote working. Zoom's shares hit a record high on Monday, closing at $325.10, as the firm raised its annual revenue forecast by more than 30% to the range of $2.37bn-$2.39bn, from its previous projection of $1.78bn-$1.80bn. Key to Zoom's success was its ability to add paying customers - high-budget corporate clients - as opposed to those who use its services for free. Zoom sees sales boom amid pandemic Coronavirus: Zoom under increased scrutiny as popularity soars The company said that its large customers - firms that generated more than $100,000 in revenue in the past year - doubled to 988 during the quarter. Zoom, together with rivals Cisco Webex and Microsoft Teams, have all seen a surge in usage of their video conferencing platforms since coronavirus lockdown measures were imposed by multiple countries in March. But Zoom's soaring popularity has also strained its infrastructure, with some outages last week as schools in many parts of the US resumed classes virtually. Its reputation also took a hit, as the new attention prompted hackers to hijack meetings and exposed a host of security flaws, revealing that the firm had sent user data to Facebook, had wrongly claimed the app had end-to-end encryption, and was allowing meeting hosts to track attendees. Zoom has also faced political scrutiny for its ties to China - where it has more than 700 staff, including most of its product development team - which have prompted warnings that it is not fit for government use.

"In a normal year, more than a million UK tourists visit Portugal's Algarve coast Ministers are considering reimposing quarantine measures for those arriving in the UK from Portugal as coronavirus cases rise, sources have told the BBC. The country has recorded more than 20 cases per 100,000 people in the past week. Normally when a country surpasses that mark the UK government imposes 14 days of self-isolation on returning travellers. Ministers are expected to reach a decision on the measures by Thursday. They will also have to decide whether the UK as a whole should follow Scotland, which has made a decision toadd Greece to its own quarantine list, effective from 04:00 BST on Thursday. It is the first of the four UK nations - each of which can add or remove countries to their own list - to make a decision on Greece, following several reports of people in the UK testing positive after holidaying on the island of Zante. Wales, which says at least 16 people tested positive following a flight from the Greek island last week, says it has told passengers arriving on a plane at Cardiff Airport on Tuesday evening toself-isolate for 14 days. Meanwhile, some travel industry leaders have suggested quarantine rules should only apply to people returning from specific regions where case numbers are high, such as resort islands - rather than having whole countries blacklisted. Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? How to fly during a global pandemic It has been less than two weeks since Portugal came off the quarantine list and was put back on the UK's safe travel list, following a sustained period of falling cases in the country that put it below the ""20 per 100,000"" mark that satisfied the UK. But now holidaymakers are scrambling to return from the country amid fears the country is again about to be taken off the list, based on the latest data. EasyJet has sold out all of its flights from Faro - which serves the Algarve - to airports in Britain for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. And British Airways is selling seats on a flight from Faro to Heathrow on Thursday for Â£554, while the same journey can be made seven days later for just Â£139. Thousands of people have travelled from the UK to Portugal since the country was added to the UK's quarantine exemption list on 22 August. This video can not be played Tui boss Andrew Flintham says the government should consider ""regional travel corridors"" Portugal has recorded 21.1 virus cases per 100,000 people in the past week. The UK considers imposing  quarantine on travellers when a country's infection rate exceeds 20 cases per 100,000, over seven days. Over the past month, so-calledtravel corridors,external- which allow people to travel without having to self-isolate on their return - have been scrapped between England and at least 18 countries and territories. Ministers have said this cautious approach prevents coronavirus cases being imported. Andrew Flintham, head of Tui UK, has said the government should consider ""regional travel corridors"" - meaning quarantine measures would apply to people returning from regions over whole countries. He said there were fewer cases in the popular Algarve, where most tourists are, than elsewhere in Portugal. Using the example of Leicester, the first area in the UK to be placed under local lockdown, Mr Flintham told the BBC: ""In the UK we have a slightly different policy in the fact that we don't lock down the whole UK when the Leicester rate goes up. ""Can we apply the same kind of principle to almost allow us to operate to those places where the rates are low or are within those thresholds? ""We don't want to put anybody in danger but clearly it is not the same everywhere in a country,"" he added. It is not the first time Tui has urged the government against slapping blanket quarantines on whole countries. Mr Flintham previously called for ""regionalised"" policyafter quarantine measures were imposed on Spain in July. The travel industry had hoped that the quarantine rules could be eased for the Balearic and Canary Islands, as data suggested there were lower rates of infection there than in mainland Spain. Elsewhere, the boss of British Airways' parent firm, Willie Walsh, has accused the government of using ""arbitrary statistics to effectively ban 160 countries and in the process destroying the economy"". The ""ever-changing"" quarantine requirements meant ""the UK has officially hung up the 'closed' sign"", he said,writing in the Times.,external Last week, Switzerland, Jamaica and the Czech Republic joined France, Spain and a number of others on the UK's quarantine list. UK tourists have spent thousands of pounds on new flights and ferries, and endured long drives in a race to get home before quarantine measures kick in. The government has not commented on whether requirements for arrivals from Portugal will change again. As soon as Portugal came off the quarantine list less than two weeks ago, John Cushing and his 12-year-old daughter Georgie headed straight out to the Algarve where he has a villa. Now the quarantine rules look set to change, he's facing a quandary. ""It's very precarious at the moment,"" says the 61-year-old company director. ""My daughter and I won't be able to leave the house when we get back to the UK on Saturday and there's a risk of being fined because I won't be able to send her back to school on Monday. ""She's in tears because she wants to go back to school but Ryanair is charging Â£1,000 to get back before the possible cut-off point. ""It's a very difficult decision to make [to pay for the early flight home] and I'm not really enjoying myself here now."" FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal, making up the largest number of overseas tourists to the country. Most head to the Algarve in the south, drawn by sunny Atlantic beaches, picturesque fishing villages and golf courses. Over May and June, the Portuguese government reopened its restaurants, coffee shops, museums and beaches. Hotels have mainly reopened, but nightclubs remain closed. The government has warned that stricter measures will be put in place in mid-September as pupils return to school and some workers return to offices. As of 31 August, the UK recorded 24 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the past fortnight while Portugal recorded 35.7,according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,external.

"Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is considered the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia A number of Saudi officials, including two members of the royal family, have been sacked. A royal decree said Saudi King Salman had relieved Prince Fahad bin Turki of his role as commander of joint forces in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. His son, Abdulaziz bin Fahad, was also removed as a deputy governor. The men, along with four other officials, face an investigation into ""suspicious financial dealings"" at the Ministry of Defence, the decree said. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is the king's son and is considered Saudi Arabia's de-facto ruler, has spearheaded a campaign against alleged corruption in the government. However, critics say the high-profile arrests have been aimed at removing obstacles to the prince's hold on power. How Saudi Arabia's crown prince rose to power Saudi royal arrests: Why top princes have been silenced Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported thatthree senior royals had been arrested, including the king's younger brother Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz and former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef. The most high-profile incident, in 2017, sawdozens of Saudi royal figures, ministers and businessmen detained at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh. Most of them were later released, but only after reachingsettlements worth a total of $106.7bn (Â£75.6bn) with the Saudi state. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 35, won international praise when he promised a series of economic and social reforms to the deeply-conservative country after coming to power in 2016. However he has been embroiled in a series of scandals, includingthe murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy in Istanbulin 2018 andan alleged murder plot against a former Saudi intelligence agent in Canada. He has also been criticised over thecontinuing conflict in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia backs pro-government forces, andthe harsh treatment of women's rights activists.despite the lifting of some restrictions including the right to drive.

"The swimmer was found just 500m off the coast of Dover A lone man attempting to swim the English Channel from Dover to Calais has been rescued following an eight-hour search. The hunt was prompted by a call to the coastguard from a friend of the swimmer on Monday. A helicopter and lifeboats were launched as part of the rescue effort, and the man was eventually found by a boat just 500m off the coast of Dover. The swimmer was brought to shore and was described as ""cold and tired"". The rescue operation began just after midday.

"Some primary school pupils in England returned to their classrooms at the beginning of June Children in England are three months behind in their studies after lockdown, with boys and poor pupils worst hit, suggests a survey of teachers by an educational research organisation. The learning gap between rich and poor pupils grew by almost half between March and July, the National Foundation for Educational Research has found. The authors also warn a quick catch-up is unlikely. The government says children must not lose out because of coronavirus. The new term begins in England and Wales this week, after the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Schools are already back in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The National Foundation for Educational Research's survey questioned a weighted sample of almost 3,000 heads and teachers in about 2,200 primary and secondary schools across England. The research was carried out just before the end of term in July - and showed how much children had fallen behind by the end of the last school year. Almost all the teachers questioned (98%) said their pupils were behind the place in the curriculum they would normally expect for the time of year. Overall, teachers said they had covered  just 66% of their usual curriculum by July, putting pupils three months behind in their learning. The researchers also found: boys are further behind in the curriculum than girls the learning gap for poorer pupils has widened by at least 46% It comes days after aseparate study showed the learning gap between rich and poor primary pupils had begun to widen, even before the pandemic. The National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) report found teachers in the most deprived schools (those with the greatest proportion of pupils on free school meals) were more than three times as likely (53%) to say their pupils were at least four months behind, compared with those in the wealthiest schools (15%). Even for those pupils who had places in school last term, attendance was poor - only 56% of eligible pupils actually went back amid safety concerns from parents, the report reveals, Almost three quarters of the teachers questioned thought they were unable to teach to their usual standard under the coronavirus regulations. Socially distanced classrooms make the job harder, say teachers Overall, teachers estimate 44% of their pupils are in need of intensive catch-up support, says the report, with teachers in the most deprived schools (57%) more likely to believe this than those in the wealthiest schools (32%). NFER chief social scientist, Dr Angela Donkin, welcomedthe government's National Tutoring Programmebut questioned ""whether the scale will be sufficient to meet the high demand for those requiring intensive support"". Almost all the school leaders questioned (90%) predicted they could manage to open to all pupils safely, however more than three quarters (78%) expressed concerns, with many saying additional funding would be needed for more staff, cleaning and protective equipment. Separately, head teachers and teachers criticised the government for""last-minute"" guidance on what to do during virus outbreaksand local lockdowns, which was published on Friday. In the NFER report, teachers urged better planning for further lockdowns, and called for more and better IT equipment for pupils and staff. More than a quarter of pupils (28%) were reported to have no access to a laptop or computer at home. The authors said it was encouraging that the government was offering laptop and internet connections for disadvantaged pupils but that ""a much swifter dispatch of devices"" was needed, as well as more training for teachers. Other recommendations included: more safety reassurance for parents better support for schools to bring in ""non-attending"" pupils more money for enhanced cleaning and extra staff to ensure social distancing Ofsted to modify its expectations of schools during social distancing acceptance that catch-up will be a long-term endeavour ""Whilst it is crucial that children catch up, we should not assume that teachers will immediately be able to deliver the same quality of teaching at the same speed, as before the pandemic,"" said Dr Donkin. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, asked the government to hire ""qualified teachers not currently in post"" to help reduce class sizes, which would in turn ""provide educational catch-up and ensure safety for all"". Dr Bousted also urged a more flexible approach to exams next year, ""one which learns from the mistakes of this year"".

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called on Mr Williamson to face parliament to explain ""how he will protect"" children's futures. ""He needs to explain how he will make up for the damage already done, bring pupils up to speed and mitigate against the ongoing risk from the pandemic,"" Sir Keir added. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Does my child have to go back? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), called the NFER report ""another alarm bell"" for the government. The head teachers' union is also calling for a temporary ban on fining parents and guardians if their children do not return to school. Mr Whiteman said: ""If you are a parent and you are worried about safety, a fine is unlikely to make you feel any safer."" The Department for Education has said fines for school absences would only be used as a ""last resort"" in England. In a statement, the department added: ""Throughout the pandemic we have invested in remote education, providing devices, routes and resources for the children who need them most and why our Â£1bn Covid catch-up package will tackle the impact of lost teaching time, including targeted funding for the most disadvantaged students.""

"Facebook has threatened to stop users from sharing news content in Australia as it prepares for a new law forcing it to pay publishers for their articles. Regulators want tech giants like Facebook and Google to pay for the content reposted from news outlets. Last month Google warned its users that its search services could be ""dramatically worse"" as a result. Facebook's latest move to block news sharing has escalated tensions between tech firms and regulators. The social media network said that if the proposed legislation becomes law it will stop Australians from sharing news on Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has drawn up the rules to ""level the playing field"" between the tech giants and publishers that it says are struggling due to lost advertising revenue. The ACCC responded to Facebook's threat to block news content saying it was ""ill-timed and misconceived"". ""The code simply aims to bring fairness and transparency to Facebook and Google's relationships with Australian news media businesses,"" ACCC chairman Rod Sims said. Australia plans to make tech giants pay for news Google accused of misinformation in Australia row News publishers fight tech giants for better deals But in a blog post, Facebook's managing director for Australia and New Zealand Will Easton, said the draft law ""misunderstands the dynamics of the internet and will do damage to the very news organisations the government is trying to protect"". He argued it would force Facebook to pay for content that publishers voluntarily place on its platform to generate traffic back to their news sites. Mr Easton claimed Facebook sent 2.3bn clicks from Facebook's newsfeed back to Australian news websites, worth around A$200m ($148m; Â£110m) during the first five months of the year. The blocking of news ""is not our first choice - it is our last,"" he said, adding that Facebook's other services that allow family and friends to connect will not be affected. A Facebook spokesman told the BBC that it will ""provide specific details soon"" on how it will enforce the ban. Some business experts argue that tech firms should pay publishers for the quality news content that they repost. ""Google, Facebook and others have been getting away with giving it away for free for too long,"" Michael Wade, a professor at the IMD Business School in Switzerland and Singapore, told the BBC last month. Google and Facebook do pay for some news content in specific markets, and said they plan to roll these initiatives out to more countries.

"Millions of people turning 18 from now will be able to withdraw money from Child Trust Funds for the first time. Children born from September 2002 were given vouchers by the government to invest for the future, with the money only accessible at the age of 18. The savings pots could now be worth more than Â£1,000, or more if parents added contributions. However, many thousands of young people may have no idea these savings exist in their name. Child Trust Funds were set up by the Labour government to encourage parents to save for their children. The idea was for children to have some savings at the age of 18, to assist with costs such as further education funding or living alone for the first time. The government initially put Â£250 into the tax-free account during a child's first year, then added another Â£250 when he or she reached the age of seven. For lower-income families, the payment was Â£500. Parents, family and friends could also contribute to the account, up to set limits. The scheme was watered down, then scrapped entirely by the coalition government in January 2011. The first recipients of Child Trust Fund vouchers will now be turning 18 and can access the money for the first time. Each month about 55,000 people turn 18, and eventually a total of about 6.3 million people will be able to redeem the money, or continue to save, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Teenagers can actually take control of their account from the age of 16, but can only withdraw money from it from 18. For those who do nothing, the Child Trust Fund provider will move it into an Individual Savings Account, which is also tax-free, or roll it into another account with similar benefits. Kerry McWalter was surprised about the windfall Kerry McWalter is turning 18 in two weeks and will have access to a Child Trust Fund worth Â£1,400. She is just about to start a pharmacy studies course in Edinburgh, and said she would use the money for living costs and a future holiday as well as saving some of it. She found out about the possibility of a fund while looking on social media and used The Share Foundation's tracing service. ""When I found out, I was quite surprised. I wasn't aware I had one. My mum had forgotten about it,"" she said. She then told a close friend, who discovered she had a similar level of savings that she had no idea about. This money has often been in accounts where it is invested in shares. The success of those shares over time will determine their value, as will the original value of the government voucher. Accountants estimate that with the maximum parental contribution over the years, and investment growth, the fund could be worth as much as Â£70,000. A more realistic scenario for many people is that the money has sat untouched in accounts over the years. Even then, those born into low-income families are likely to receive a windfall of around Â£1,500. Parents were invited to open a Child Trust Fund with one of a number of providers within a year of their child being born. About 4.5 million were set up by parents or guardians. Children in care had accounts set up by local authorities and these are now managed by The Share Foundation - a charity which is also helping people to track down their funds. In 1.8 million cases when parents did nothing, the accounts were set up automatically by the UK's tax authority. HMRC admits that in potentially many thousands of cases, youngsters have no idea that they have such savings. Child Trust Fundscan be found using the Government Gateway service,external, which requires a login or registration. The Child Trust Fund unique reference number, or national insurance number is also needed. The Share Foundation charity runsa free finding service,external. Moreinformation on Child Trust Funds,externalis available on through the government-backed Money and Pensions Service. Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: ""We want to make sure all young people can access the money which has been set aside for them, to invest in their future and continue a savings habit, as they turn 18. ""If you're unsure if you have an account or where it may be, it's easy to track down your provider online."" When accessed there are a range of options for teenagers to consider. ""Getting a windfall like this can be daunting,"" said Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at financial firm Willis Owen. ""There are lots of options to consider when it comes to how to use the money. Some may want to spend it, and others may want to invest it to make more money for their futures.""

"Breakfast clubs and after school care is ""essential"" for many families Parents may be unable to return to work or could even stop their children going back to school amid uncertainty over childcare, a nursery has claimed. While schools gear up to welcome back pupils, many breakfast and after-school clubs are unable to fully reopen. Companies providing care said they were still unsure when services could fully resume - leaving parents in the dark. The Welsh Government said it expected more childcare places to become available as schools reopen. For those parents unable to drop off and collect their children at school-time,clubs before and after classes are essential. However some companies that provide services such as ""wraparound"" care - looking after children both before and after school - are unable to fully reopen due to coronavirus restrictions. When schools closed in March, childcare providers could only offer services to children of key workers. Services have slowly increased but restrictions have had ""a massive impact"" on those businesses, said Claire Bailyes, of Little Inspirations in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf. Parents are facing difficult decisions, said nursery manager Claire Bailyes The company has seven locations across south-east Wales and said navigating the guidance, often at ""short notice"" and ""not clear at times"", had been difficult. ""Normally we would have school collections, breakfast club and after-school club"", said Ms Bailyes. ""However with everything going on it's very limited, so it's had a big impact on the nurseries and it's been very short notice to let parents know."" Nursery closures lead to childcare struggle for NHS staff Childcare Offer for Wales: Parents 'shocked' by bills Free childcare 'could help close wealth gap' With many grandparents self-isolating, the lack of care is affecting parents' ability to return to work. ""There's been a lot of disappointment for parents. Some are not able to go back to work as they have to stay home with the children,"" she added. ""Some have even considered not sending their children to school as they're not going to be able to take and collect them. ""The staggered pick up times are just so awkward and many grandparents are not there because they are isolating or shielding."" ""We don't have the flexibility to leave work early,"" said Owain Rogers One parent facing uncertainty at how either he or his wife, who is a teacher, can drop off and collect their two sons is Owain Rogers, from Cardiff. ""That service is essential for us because we don't have a support network to pick up the kids at three o'clock,"" he said. ""We really depend on the after-school club to be able to go back to work because neither my wife or I have the flexibility to leave early. ""It's really hard to know what provision we can put in place. We're going to have to rely on friends, but then we feel a burden, and other families are in the same predicament - worrying about what's happening.

Schools are open and people need to go back to work."" Childcare providers have been inundated with queries from parents The Welsh Government said almost 70% of childcare settings in Wales were now open, with more expected to resume services as schools reopen. ""We understand there may be some variations in service at the start of the autumn term as schools and childcare providers get used to the new ways of operating and we are working with local authorities to ensure childcare is available to families,"" it said. ""We also recentlyannounced Â£4m in funding to support the childcare sectorto ensure more providers re-open as schools return in September."" It added that school-run breakfast clubs were under a ""legal duty"" to resume at the start of the new term.

"Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is considered the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia A number of Saudi officials, including two members of the royal family, have been sacked. A royal decree said Saudi King Salman had relieved Prince Fahad bin Turki of his role as commander of joint forces in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. His son, Abdulaziz bin Fahad, was also removed as a deputy governor. The men, along with four other officials, face an investigation into ""suspicious financial dealings"" at the Ministry of Defence, the decree said. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is the king's son and is considered Saudi Arabia's de-facto ruler, has spearheaded a campaign against alleged corruption in the government. However, critics say the high-profile arrests have been aimed at removing obstacles to the prince's hold on power. How Saudi Arabia's crown prince rose to power Saudi royal arrests: Why top princes have been silenced Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported thatthree senior royals had been arrested, including the king's younger brother Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz and former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef. The most high-profile incident, in 2017, sawdozens of Saudi royal figures, ministers and businessmen detained at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh. Most of them were later released, but only after reachingsettlements worth a total of $106.7bn (Â£75.6bn) with the Saudi state. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 35, won international praise when he promised a series of economic and social reforms to the deeply-conservative country after coming to power in 2016. However he has been embroiled in a series of scandals, includingthe murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy in Istanbulin 2018 andan alleged murder plot against a former Saudi intelligence agent in Canada. He has also been criticised over thecontinuing conflict in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia backs pro-government forces, andthe harsh treatment of women's rights activists.despite the lifting of some restrictions including the right to drive.
