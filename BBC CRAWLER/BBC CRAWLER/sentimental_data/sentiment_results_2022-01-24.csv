"People arriving in England or Scotland from abroad will no longer have to take Covid tests if they are fully vaccinated, it has been confirmed. In a boost for families, the changes will come in from 4am on 11 February, in time for the half-term break. Rules have also been eased for unvaccinated travellers, who will no longer have to take a day eight test or self isolate. However, they will still need pre-departure and day two tests. And everyone arriving in England and Scotland, regardless of vaccination status, will need to fill in a passenger locator form - although these will be made ""easier"" to complete, said UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Wales and Northern Ireland have not yet said whether they will change their testing rules, although they are expected to follow suit. What are the travel rules? In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Shapps said the move would save families about Â£100 on visits abroad, as well as boost the beleaguered travel industry. ""Today I can confirm that our international travel regime will now be liberalised as part our efforts to ensure that 2022 is the year in which restrictions on travel, on lockdowns and limits on people's lives are firmly placed in the past,"" he said. ""From 4am on February 11, and in time for the half-term break, eligible fully-vaccinated passengers arriving in the UK will no longer have to take a post-arrival lateral flow test. ""That means that after months of pre-departure testing, post-arrival testing, self-isolation, additional expense, all that fully vaccinated people will now have to do, when they travel to the UK, is to verify their status via a passenger locator form."" Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the measures were ""extremely welcome"" for the tourism and aviation sectors. But he said ""further surveillance"" would be needed across all UK nations to catch variants if they emerged. Dan from Surrey is planning to travel to Italy on a skiing trip with his son in the half term holiday. ""I was geared up for having to do all the tests and the forms that I needed to,"" he says, adding that today's news was ""a welcome change"". ""It's one less thing to worry about,"" he says. ""It's a bit less cost, but also it's a bit less stress. So overall, hopefully we can focus on having a nice holiday instead of worrying about the paperwork."" Dan and his family have only travelled abroad once since the pandemic started, but he hopes that as the rules ease, planning holidays will become more straightforward. ""I'm quite happy there are fewer barriers, it makes me feel more confident going away from that point of view,"" he says. However, safety remains his number one priority: ""If a new variant came along or something changed and the rules had to be revisited, I for one would understand that."" Mr Shapps also confirmed that from 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. It comes after families have struggled to prove their children's vaccination status when trying to enter countries including Spain, Italy and France. Mr Shapps also told MPs the UK is set to recognise vaccine certificates from 16 further nations, including countries like China and Mexico. This will take the total number of recognised countries and territories to 180. The moves were welcomed by the travel and tourism industry, which has been one of the sectors hit hardest by coronavirus lockdown measures. Airline Virgin Atlantic said: ""The removal of all testing for vaccinated passengers is the final step in moving towards frictionless air travel, allowing passengers to reconnect with loved ones and business colleagues. ""It restores customer confidence and demand will be boosted in a critical booking window for the travel industry."" Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said the airline would ""now look ahead to what we believe will be a strong summer"". He said: ""It is clear travel restrictions did not materially slow the spread of Omicron in the UK and so it is important that there are no more knee jerk reactions to future variants."" However, the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, warned rules had been lifted too quickly. Its chairman Tom Watson said: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" What are the travel rules? Covid test firm urges end to tests for travellers Currently, fully vaccinated passengers, who have had two doses (or one dose of the Janssen vaccine), and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK. However, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over -  or 11 and over in Scotland - must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test. If they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result. Vaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK. But Mr Shapps said the form, which had been ""complex and difficult to navigate"", would now be made simpler and travellers would have an extra day to fill it in. Earlier in January, the government scrapped the need for fully vaccinated travellers coming to England to take a Covid test before they travel. However, arrivals who are not fully vaccinated must take a pre-departure test and two post-arrival PCR tests, which are more expensive than the lateral flow version. They must also self-isolate for 10 days. Are your journey plans affected by the removal of Covid travel tests in England?  Share your stories by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"This video can not be played Lord Agnew accuses the Treasury of having ""little interest in the consequences of fraud to our society"" A Conservative minister in the House of Lords has resigned attacking the government's handling of fraudulent Covid business loans. Lord Agnew accused the Treasury of having ""little interest in the consequences of fraud to our society"". But he said his departure was ""not an attack on the prime minister"". Last year, the National Audit Office criticised the government for failing to implement measures to prevent people exploiting Covid schemes. Bounce Back Loan fraud checks called inadequate 'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan' PM faces key week ahead of No 10 parties report Lord Agnew, a Treasury minister with responsibility for cross-government efficiency, said ""a combination of arrogance, indolence and ignorance"" was ""freezing the government machine"". He accused the government of making ""schoolboy errors"" by giving loans to over 1,000 companies who were not trading when Covid struck. ""I hope that as a virtually unknown minister beyond this place giving up my career might prompt others to get behind this and sort it out,"" he said. In a dramatic moment in the House of Lords, he read out his resignation speech in response to a question from Labour about the Â£4.3bn of Covid loans written off by the Treasury. He concluded with a ""thank you and goodbye"", before marching out of the chamber to a round of applause - a rare occurrence in the Lords. A No 10 spokesman said: ""We are grateful to Lord Agnew for the significant contribution he has made to government."" The spokesman said the government was taking action against fraud, adding that 150,000 ineligible claims have been blocked and Â£500m recovered last year. An HMRC tax protection taskforce was also expected to recover an additional Â£1bn, the spokesman added. This video can not be played WATCH: Hunting down the Covid loan fraudsters The Bounce Back Loan scheme was set up in April 2020 with the aim of keeping small businesses afloat during the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 1.5 million loans worth Â£47bn were issued through the initiative, after about a quarter of UK businesses applied. Banks, building societies and other accredited lenders loaned companies up to Â£50,000, or a maximum of 25% of annual turnover, with the government guaranteeing them repayments if the firms defaulted. In September, the state-owned British Business Bank, which oversees the scheme, said Â£2bn of loans had been repaid and Â£1.3bn had been defaulted on. In December 2021, the public spending watchdog the National Audit Office said counter-fraud activity had been ""implemented too slowly"". It estimated that the business department had put the estimated cost of fraudulent loans at Â£4.9bn - 11% of the total given out. In response to Lord Agnew's resignation, the British Business Bank said ""key counter-fraud measures"" had been put in place at the start of the scheme, and it had worked with the scheme's lenders to put additional measures in place. ""Arrogance, indolence, ignorance"", ""schoolboy errors"", and ""nothing less than woeful"". As the political joke goes, Lord Agnew may not have been a household name, even in his own household, but the manner of his attack on the government from the ministerial despatch box points to a serious issue. There was always a trade-off between due diligence on pandemic rescue loans and getting some Â£72bn of cash into the bank accounts of businesses. The government made a strategic decision to prioritise speed ""in good conscience"", as ministers put it. As a result,  a process that would have taken months, in some cases took just days. This undoubtedly helped the whole economy bounce back. But it is the scale, not of the losses in general (expected to top Â£20bn, mainly on Bounce Back loans) of the Â£4bn at least that will be written off due to fraud, that led to this highly public exit from the minister. In particular, over 1,000 businesses that were not even trading, received Bounce Back loans, said the minister. Right now, the banks that operated the scheme are deciding how to account for the loans in their full year results. Over a quarter of the Â£1bn given to banks by taxpayers has so far been for fraudulent loans, Lord Agnew told peers. And he fears a ""new dangerous phase"" where banks act less than rigorously in seeking repayment, given they know they can reclaim the cash from the taxpayer. At a time of tight budgets, rising prices and taxes, banks could come under pressure to try a little harder to collect the monies owed. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves described Lord Agnew's departure as ""a damning indictment"" of the chancellor's failures on fraud. ""It should be a source of enduring shame to [Rishi] Sunak that he has so casually written off Â£4.3bn of taxpayers' money,"" she added. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said the government had ""allowed fraudsters to steal billions of taxpayers' money"" and urged the chancellor to explain how he would get the money back. Lord Agnew was appointed a Treasury minister in February 2020. He has also sat as a non-executive director for the Department for Education.

"This video can not be played ""We should have prioritised that request for resources"" Police have been criticised over their handling of a riot which broke out in Swansea, in an independent review that said residents were left ""unprotected"". Cars were burnt and windows smashed in the Mayhill area after a vigil to a young man who had died turned violent. Ethan Powell's father Jonathan Russlater condemned those who rioted at his son's vigilin May 2021, calling them ""scumbags"". South Wales Police has now apologised for its slow response. Seven police officers were injuredand37 people were arrestedon suspicion of unlawful violence following the disturbances. A joint review between Swansea council, South Wales Police and its Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) was led by a panel made up of chairwoman Prof Elwen Evans QC, police expert Martin Jones, and local government consultant Jack Straw. What do we know about Mayhill - the scene of the riot? The report found a senior officer on the ground that night requested support from specialist public order officers but was twice denied it. The officer was so frustrated, he had to go outside the chain of command to authorise support but it was too late. South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Mark Travis said confusion led to the request being denied. ""There were competing demands on the night, but the main reason is a lack of clarity about information,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Drive. ""We've put measures in place to make sure it's a far more straight process. We had sufficient resources but didn't use them efficiently."" This video can not be played Adam Romain pleads for police help as his children scream during riot In its conclusions, the panel said: ""Despite the absence of a full investigation, it is clear to the panel that significant failings are evident throughout this event. ""Currently available evidence strongly suggests failings in command structures and decisions, operational decisions and tactics, and communications."" The report continued: ""The full extent of these failings and explanations for any failings can only be determined by a forensic investigation. ""All of the available evidence shows clearly that the residents of Waun Wen Road, Mayhill were left unprotected for a significant period of time on the 20 May 2021. ""Further analysis will not alter this fact, but should address more completely the question 'Why?'."" The panel heard from residents who said they felt terrorised in their own homes and abandoned by the police. It said: ""There was evident raw emotion and distress in the re-living of experiences of that night and its aftermath. ""Some of the views shared with us include the following: 'the police let us down'; 'they didn't protect us'; 'they failed to protect us'; 'they weren't there for us when we needed them'; and 'we don't understand why they didn't do anything'."" The report also said while there were no fatalities or serious physical injury, ""the criminal behaviours on that night presented a significant threat to life and to property"". The Mayhill street looked ""like a war zone"", one of the residents said A number of factors may have contributed to the riot, the panel said, including ""the effects of Covid lockdowns, social media narratives, criminal behaviours, socio-economic dynamics, and reactions to the tragic death of Ethan Powell"". The challenges facing local authorities and policing agencies were called ""exceptional and unprecedented"". It also said any assessment of the riot ""must start with a recognition that criminal responsibility sits with the adults and young people who committed criminal offences"". But it added it was clear there was ""significant"" work to be done by police to re-establish trust and confidence following the incident. South Wales Police Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said: ""I want to apologise to all those who have been affected by this incident and particularly those local residents who were tormented by those responsible. ""We failed to take action quickly enough on the night and for that I am truly sorry."" Assistant Chief Constable Mark Travis told BBC Radio Wales the force aimed to rebuild trust within the community. He said: ""We will spend time [there], be visible, hear them and make sure that we respond to those needs. ""It's important to note there were 37 people that went out with criminal intent and part of the closure for the community is bringing those people that damaged the community are brought to justice"" A criminal investigation into the rioting is ongoing. A file has been submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and charging decisions are expected shortly, the force added. An inquest into Ethan Powell's death is set to take place later this month.

"Mary Nightingale will present the new hour-long weekday news programme ITV has announced a shake-up of its evening schedule which will see its news programme extended and top soaps given new slots. Under the plans, ITV News will be broadcast from 18:30 to 19:30, with more focus on stories outside London. Emmerdale, which currently airs in the 19:00 slot, will move half an hour later, to 19:30, to make room. And Coronation Street will broadcast three hour-long episodes on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, the network said. This means the soap will no longer be divided into two separate half-hour chunks with a different programme in between, as it is currently. On certain nights of the week, ITV's soaps will also be on at the same time asEastEnders, which is on at 19:30, 20:00 and 20:30. ITV's soaps have been more popular in TV ratings than EastEnders for a few years, so when the shows clash, ITV will probably feel it is in the stronger position. Other changes mean there will be a total of 90 minutes of ITV news programming broadcast on the channel from 18:00. Sally Dynevor has appeared in Coronation Street since 1986 ITV's most popular soaps will move into new back-to-back schedule slots ""destined to build a strong block of continuing drama"", the network said. Emmerdale will continue to broadcast one half-hour episode every weeknight, but its slot will move further into prime time and air at 19:30 instead of the current 19:00. There are also changes for Coronation Street, which currently broadcasts six episodes per week across three nights. These are normally split between one half-hour episode at 19:30, and another at 20:30. Under the current schedule, a different programme is usually scheduled between the two Coronation Street episodes. Paul O'Grady: For The Love of Dogs and Bradley & Barney Walsh: Breaking Dad are among the programmes scheduled in the 20:00 slot this week, for example. However, under the new schedule, Coronation Street will be broadcast in a single hour-long chunk, from 20:00 until 21:00, interrupted only by regular advert breaks. ITV said this new ""super soap"" scheduling means live TV viewers of Coronation Street and Emmerdale ""can get their soap fix back-to-back"". Emmerdale won the serial best drama prize at the National Television Awards in 2020 Announcing the changes, ITV's managing director of media and entertainment, Kevin Lygo said Coronation Street and Emmerdale are ""fundamental to the success of ITV"". ""We know that, as with all dramas, viewers increasingly watch them whenever, and however they choose. The new scheduling means that viewers can watch them live on TV in one go in a continuous soap fix, as well as on ITV Hub where they are regularly in the most watched shows every month,"" he said. The broadcaster also announced on Monday its plan to increase news output, marking the biggest expansion of jobs in ITV News in 20 years. The newly-extended evening news programme, which will be presented by Mary Nightingale, will bring ""more focus on reporting from outside of London... to reflect the whole of the UK,"" ITV said. The new evening schedule will mean a total of 90 minutes of news, with the regional half-hour programme broadcast at 18:00, followed by the newly-expanded hour-long ITV News at 18:30. The changes mean ITV News will air until 19:30, placing it in competition with Channel 4 News and the BBC's magazine programme The One Show. The expansion of ITV News means it will compete with the BBC's magazine programme The One Show at 19:00 ITV said 27 new journalists, producers and multi-skilled camera operators/video editors would be recruited to join the programme alongside ITV's existing specialist editors and correspondents. Correspondents will be hired in Wales, Scotland and the north of England, while a new Social Affairs reporter based in the north of England will also be among the new appointments. When the email dropped at 10.30 this morning in the ITV newsroom, there were a lot of smiling faces (after weeks of rumours).  In recent years, news has more often been about 'managed decline', with decreasing budgets, bureaus closing and rounds of job cuts the norm not just at ITN (which makes ITV News). Instead, today the story is of investment in news, with the biggest expansion in airtime at ITV for decades and a round of appointments to come.  The pressure is now on ITN to get it right; to ensure disgruntled Emmerdale fans and others who switch on to get primetime ITV programmes at 7pm aren't turned off by what they'll now see instead. I understand the beefed-up evening news won't be morphing into a news and discussion show (like Channel 4 News) or even (as is being suggested by some) into a magazine format (like BBC's The One Show), but will, in the main, simply contain more on-the-ground reports and lives.  I'm told the phrase that has been used in recent months in planning this is 'getting Britain right' and that the programme will focus primarily on UK coverage and on telling the story of Britain. ITV's decision is an acknowledgement of the value of live broadcasting in the age of the streamers (think of the wall-to-wall coverage Paul Brand's scoop got recently, across the channels, as ITV News aired the video of the PM's former Press Secretary Allegra Stratton being asked about rumours of a Christmas party held at Downing Street).  The decision is also likely a sign that, in order to invest in primetime dramas like Trigger Point, which started last night on ITV, cuts need to be made in other parts of the primetime schedule.  News can fill that hole. The big question, of course, is what it means for ITV's News at Ten - or 'News at When' as it used to be dubbed as it bounced around the schedule.  Does an extended early evening news bulletin signal plans for a future scaling back of the later news bulletin?  It's a trend in the US, where the main news programmes are primarily aired in the early evening.  That's denied by ITV, but media watchers will be looking to see if anything else emerges from the channel in the months ahead. Lygo said their evening news programme continued to attract large audiences despite rapidly changing viewing habits. ""We are very excited to be announcing this investment in what is an important public service strength of ITV - high-quality, impartial, trusted broadcast journalism - at a time when it could not be more important,"" he added. Evening news bulletins are regularly among the most-watched programmes on both BBC One and ITV. On Friday (21 January), BBC One's Regional News and Weather was the most popular programme of the day on the network, with five million viewers watching at 18:30. ITV said it would hire 27 new journalists, producers and camera operators for its increased news coverage ITV said its own evening news programme was watched by an average of 3.2 million viewers in 2021, with the show posting its highest viewing shares for a decade in 2020 and 2021. Viewers in the Scottish STV licence areas will continue to receive STV News at 18:00 on Monday to Friday under the new plans, followed by the new hour-long news programme. On Thursdays, STV's current affairs programme, Scotland Tonight, will move from its usual 19:30 slot to 20:30. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Police officers examine a weapon near the crime scene at Heidelberg University A lone gunman has killed one person and seriously injured three others inside a lecture hall at Heidelberg University in the south-west of Germany, before shooting himself dead. He was an 18-year-old German student. German police said the shooter, who was armed with two guns, had used a ""long gun"", and fired shots around the amphitheatre ""wildly"". The bloodshed triggered a large operation at the university's campus in the Neuenheimer Feld area. Police asked people to avoid the area so rescue workers and emergency services could move around freely. German media reported that the gunman appeared to have no religious or political motive. Police have searched his flat in the city of Mannheim, and found a WhatsApp message he had sent shortly beforehand, in which he spoke of punishing people. Heidelberg is a university town with about 160,000 inhabitants. The country has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe, and school shootings are rare. Anyone under 25 is required to pass a psychological evaluation before getting a gun licence.

"This video can not be played Watch: Russia risks ""a new Chechnya"" if it invades Ukraine, warns Boris Johnson Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned Russia that invading Ukraine would be ""disastrous"" and a ""painful, violent and bloody business"". Speaking as theForeign Office pulled some embassy staff outof Ukraine, the PM said the situation was ""pretty gloomy"" but war was not inevitable. He said the UK was ""leading on creating a package of economic sanctions"" against Russia and was supplying defensive weaponry to Ukraine. Nato is putting forces on standby. It said Nato allies were sending additional ships and fighter jets to eastern Europe to reinforce defences and increase deterrence, in response to the continuing build-up of Russian forces. Russia has denied plans for military action, but an estimated 100,000 troops have amassed on the border. The head of Nato has warned of a risk of fresh conflict in Europe. The Kremlin has accused Nato of escalating tensions with the move. Russia considers the alliance as a threat, and is demanding legal guarantees that it will not expand further east, including into Ukraine. But the US has said the issue at stake is Russian aggression, not Nato expansion. Mr Johnson said: ""The intelligence is very clear that there are 60 Russian battle groups on the borders of Ukraine, the plan for a lightning war that could take out Kyiv is one that everybody can see. ""We need to make it very clear to the Kremlin, to Russia, that that would be a disastrous step."" Mr Johnson added that the UK stood ""four-square with the people of Ukraine"". Ukraine has been holding training exercises as Russian forces mount at the border US President Joe Biden helda video conference with EU leaders, the Nato secretary general and Mr Johnsonon Monday evening. Downing Street said the leaders agreed that if a further Russian incursion took place, ""allies must enact swift retributive responses including an unprecedented package of sanctions"". Earlier, No 10 said there were no plans to send British combat troops to defend Ukraine, however. Officials said there had been no specific threats to British diplomats but about half of the staff working in Kyiv will return to the UK. The US has ordered relatives of its embassy staff to leave, saying an invasion could come ""at any time"". The embassy moves were described as precautionary, and nothing specific is thought to have occurred in the past 24 hours to have triggered the decisions of the US and UK. About 30 British diplomats - including the ambassador - remain in Ukraine. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the British Embassy in Kyiv continued to operate but ""it's important that we prepare for any eventuality"". She said the UK had a ""very strong package of sanctions ready to go"" and called for Germany's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Russia to be cancelled in the event of an incursion into Ukraine, saying she  was ""very, very concerned"" about Europe's energy dependence on Russia. Asked about the UK's accusations that Russian President Vladimir Putin wasplotting to install a pro-Moscow figure to lead Ukraine's government, Ms Truss declined to elaborate on the source of the intelligence. But she said: ""We are going to call out every instance of Russia trying to influence democracy, trying to subvert Ukraine, false flag operations and sabotage. We will call that out."" EXPLAINED:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? FROM KYIV:Ukrainians wait as Russia faces off with the West FROM BRUSSELS:Europe 'closest to war' in decades UK SUPPORT:UK says it is sending weapons to defend Ukraine EU staff in Ukraine will stay in place for now - EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he would not ""dramatize"" the tensions. The prime minister said he had visited Ukraine and knew the people of the country, adding: ""My judgment is that they will fight."" Mr Johnson, speaking to reporters in Milton Keynes, said: ""We also need to get a message that invading Ukraine, from a Russian perspective, is going to be a painful, violent and bloody business. ""I think it's very important that people in Russia understand that this could be a new Chechnya."" There was a major separatist conflict inChechnyain the 1990s, with a decade of ultimately unsuccessful fighting for its independence. Asked if an invasion was imminent, Mr Johnson said: ""I've got to tell you that I think the intelligence is pretty gloomy at this point. There is certainly a very, very large array of Russian forces and we have to take the necessary steps. ""I don't think it's by any means inevitable now, I think that sense can still prevail."" He was due to speak to international allies on Monday. Russia has seized Ukrainian territory before, when it annexed Crimea in 2014, following fierce protests in Ukraine that toppled the country's pro-Russian president. Russian forces seized control of Crimea before the territory voted to join Russia in a referendum the West and Ukraine deemed illegal. Russian-backed rebels control areas of eastern Ukraine near Russia's borders in a conflict which has cost an estimated 14,000 lives. A 2015 peace deal is far from being fulfilled. On Sunday, the UK Foreign Office accused Mr Putin of planning to install a pro-Moscow figure to lead Ukraine's government, naming former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev as a possible candidate. Mr Murayev called the claims ""stupid"" in an interview with Reuters news agency. TheForeign Office has warned against all travel to Crimea,externaland two areas of eastern Ukraine, Donetsk oblast and Luhansk oblast. It is advising against all but essential travel to the rest of Ukraine. Are you in Ukraine? Have you been affected by the rising tensions?

"Ukrainian troops patrol an area near a border checkpoint Russia and the US have held ""frank"" talks as fears mount of a Russian military offensive against Ukraine. An estimated 100,000 Russian troops have been deployed near Ukraine, although Russia denies it has any plans to invade. The US and its allies have threatened new sanctions, but the two sides have agreed to keep talking. As the situation intensifies, two of the BBC's most senior journalists on the region answer your questions. Paul Adamsis the BBC's international affairs correspondent and has just returned from Ukraine. He has reported from conflict zones and negotiating rooms from across the world for more than three decades Steve Rosenbergis our Moscow correspondent and expert on all things Russia. He has lived and worked there since the end of the Cold War and has reported across the breadth of the country for the BBC You canread the full question and answer exchange here. 1. Are the countries around Ukraine safe from a bigger war? - Hristo, Bulgaria Paul Adams writes: There's no war, yet, and hopefully conflict can be avoided. The diplomats are still talking. But, yes, it's not only Ukraine that's worried about the possibility of war. Other countries in the region - like the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - are concerned that any future conflict could spread to their countries. 2. In the event of an invasion, how likely are civilian casualties? - Danil Gorbununov, Ukraine Paul Adams writes: This could play out in any number of ways, from so-called ""hybrid"" attacks - hacking, disinformation, etc - all the way up to a full-scale invasion, the likes of which Europe has not seen since World War Two. One way or another, civilians will be caught up in it. They might find themselves freezing in their homes as the power grid collapses, or trapped behind Russian lines if, as some have speculated, Russian tanks move in from the territory of neighbouring Belarus (personally I find this unlikely, but Russia seems happy to keep everyone guessing). This conflict has already claimed around 14,000 Ukrainian lives. If Russia tries to take more territory or install a more friendly regime in Kyiv, it's hard to see how this won't result in many, many casualties. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his US counterpart Antony Blinken held ""frank"" talks in Geneva 3. Why does Russia fear Nato? - Mike Hancock, US Steve Rosenberg writes: I don't believe Russian officials really fear Nato, which is a defensive alliance. According to the US Secretary of State, only 6% of Russia's borders touch Nato countries. Is that a threat to Russian national security? What is the Nato defence alliance? Also, many Nato countries actually have good relations with Moscow, and Russia even sells weapon systems to Turkey, a Nato member. I think this is more about the Kremlin trying to carve out a sphere of influence for itself on its doorstep - and using Nato as an excuse to do that. 4. Would this story be very different if Ukraine was already a Nato member? - Ryan Johnston, Belfast, Northern Ireland Paul Adams writes: Ukraine (and Georgia) have been on a theoretical path to Nato membership since a summit in Bucharest in 2008. But it's a long and rocky path. Since 2014, when Ukrainians got rid of a president they thought was going to side with Russia rather than Europe, the country has been at war with Russia. FirstRussia took over Crimea. Then it encouraged pro-Russian separatists in the south-east of the country (the area called the Donbas). Nato can't welcome members who are already involved in conflicts of this kind. There are also all sorts of other things Ukraine needs to do, in terms of political reforms and improving their military. Right now, to welcome Ukraine into Nato would be seen as the ultimate red rag to a Russian bull. So no-one thinks it's going to happen any time soon. In many ways, this is a red herring, as President Putin knows perfectly well that membership is not around the corner. EXPLAINED:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? FROM KYIV:Ukrainians wait as Russia faces off with the West FROM BRUSSELS:EU 'closest to war' in decades over Russia-Ukraine crisis UK SUPPORT:UK says it is sending weapons to defend Ukraine 5. If Putin says he won't invade Ukraine, why is the US warning Russia? - Assad Ullah, China Paul Adams writes: Words are one thing (and you're right - the Russians keep saying they won't invade), but their actions point in another direction. There has been the massing of forces, the support for separatists in the Donbas (including handing out around one million Russian passports), and the threat of dire consequences if Ukraine does anything provocative (which, until now, it sensibly hasn't). Plus, President Putin's rejection of Ukraine's independent identity is not a secret - he wrote a long essay on the subject last year.You can read it online,external, but be prepared for a deep dive into ancient Russian history. 6. What is Putin's justification for so many troops on the border? - Richard Sullivan, Gloucestershire, UK Steve Rosenberg writes: Basically, Russia's position is: ""Hey, this is our country: we can move our troops wherever we want to on our territory."" The result - an estimated 100,000 Russian soldiers near its border with Ukraine, plus more Russian troops arriving in Belarus for snap war games. A potential invasion force, says the West. Moscow denies it. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line 7. Why are the superpowers interested in Ukraine? Ernest Onyameamah, Ghana Paul Adams writes: For Russia, it's all about recreating something that was lost with thefall of the Berlin Wallin 1989 - a Russian sphere of influence. People also ignore how humiliated some Russians felt by the end of the Soviet empire and the West's eager expansion into eastern Europe. It left deep scars. For the US, it's about defending the principle that countries have the right to choose their own destiny, alliances and future paths. Not just Ukraine, but all those former members of the old Warsaw Pact (a Soviet-led military alliance during the Cold War) who turned to Nato in the 1990s. It's also about trying, as much as it can, to limit what the West sees as Vladimir Putin's malign influence. 8. What could Russia do to Europe's gas supplies? - George Steve Rosenberg writes: Could Russia choke off gas supplies if the West hits Russia with sanctions in the event of an invasion? It's a possibility. Russia likes to portray itself as a reliable energy supplier. But in a sanctions war, the energy gloves might come off. The EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas. So any supply reduction or cuts by Russia would be felt acutely in Europe. True, Russia would lose out financially, too. But the Russians think they have an alternative market - China - and are already looking to boost energy supplies there. President Putin wrote a long essay on his rejection of Ukraine's independent identity in 2021 9. How are people in Ukraine feeling? Paul Adams writes: I was in Kyiv last week and I found a mixture of apprehension and resignation. As President Zelensky says, ""what's new here?"" - Ukraine and Russia have been at loggerheads for eight years. War is already a reality, even if the conflict in the Donbas is now a frozen, low-level confrontation. I didn't detect any panic in Kyiv, but people did seem to believe that one day, unless he's stopped, Vladimir Putin will try to do something. They know where their bomb shelters are and some say they're willing to volunteer in one way or another if war breaks out. But they're really tired of the conflict and have no appetite for a fight which they know they would probably lose. 10. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Paul Adams writes: The only honest answer any of us can give right now is that we have absolutely no idea. Russia has certainly assembled enough men and equipment to do something in Ukraine. Not enough (by a mile) for a full scale invasion, but enough, perhaps, to mount a more limited operation - perhaps in the Donbas. But Russians are not clamouring for war and Putin knows that ""victory"" in Ukraine could kill an awful lot of his own soldiers. Does his visceral distaste for the very idea of Ukraine trump all other rational considerations? Surely not. But he's caught the West's attention and he has a long list of demands which go way beyond the question of Ukraine and Nato (particularly as he knows Ukraine is not about to join). So he will continue to hold a figurative gun against Ukraine's head while he pursues his wider agenda. And as any film buff will tell you, when there's a gun on the table, it usually means someone's going to use it later.

"Downing Street has admitted that staff gathered inside No 10 to celebrate Boris Johnson's birthday when the first Covid lockdown was still in place. ITV News reports,externalup to 30 people attended the June 2020 event, sang Happy Birthday and were served cake. No 10 said staff had ""gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes"". Rules at the time banned most indoor gatherings of more than two people. ITV News said the birthday event had taken place in the Cabinet Room just after 2pm on 19 June 2020, adding that it had been a surprise for Mr Johnson after he returned from an official trip to a school in Hertfordshire. It also reported that family friends had been hosted in the prime minister's residence that evening. But a No 10 spokesperson said: ""This is totally untrue. In line with the rules at the time the prime minister hosted a small number of family members outside that evening."" A source told the BBC this second gathering had involved a barbecue in the No 10 garden with members of Mr Johnson's family. PM faces key week ahead of No 10 parties report Sue Gray report: What exactly is she looking at? A source told the BBC that the prime minister's then-fiancee, Carrie Symonds, had organised the cake served in the Cabinet Room and arrived at the event with Lulu Lytle, the interior designer who carried out a revamp of the couple's Downing Street flat. They also said some sandwiches and picnic food had been arranged and that there was no discussion about social distancing, with up to 30 people in attendance. A spokeswoman for Ms Lytle's company said she was present in Downing Street on 19 June working on the refurbishment, and ""entered the Cabinet Room briefly as requested, while waiting to speak with the prime minister"".

"People arriving in England or Scotland from abroad will no longer have to take Covid tests if they are fully vaccinated, it has been confirmed. In a boost for families, the changes will come in from 4am on 11 February, in time for the half-term break. Rules have also been eased for unvaccinated travellers, who will no longer have to take a day eight test or self isolate. However, they will still need pre-departure and day two tests. And everyone arriving in England and Scotland, regardless of vaccination status, will need to fill in a passenger locator form - although these will be made ""easier"" to complete, said UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Wales and Northern Ireland have not yet said whether they will change their testing rules, although they are expected to follow suit. What are the travel rules? In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Shapps said the move would save families about Â£100 on visits abroad, as well as boost the beleaguered travel industry. ""Today I can confirm that our international travel regime will now be liberalised as part our efforts to ensure that 2022 is the year in which restrictions on travel, on lockdowns and limits on people's lives are firmly placed in the past,"" he said. ""From 4am on February 11, and in time for the half-term break, eligible fully-vaccinated passengers arriving in the UK will no longer have to take a post-arrival lateral flow test. ""That means that after months of pre-departure testing, post-arrival testing, self-isolation, additional expense, all that fully vaccinated people will now have to do, when they travel to the UK, is to verify their status via a passenger locator form."" Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the measures were ""extremely welcome"" for the tourism and aviation sectors. But he said ""further surveillance"" would be needed across all UK nations to catch variants if they emerged. Dan from Surrey is planning to travel to Italy on a skiing trip with his son in the half term holiday. ""I was geared up for having to do all the tests and the forms that I needed to,"" he says, adding that today's news was ""a welcome change"". ""It's one less thing to worry about,"" he says. ""It's a bit less cost, but also it's a bit less stress. So overall, hopefully we can focus on having a nice holiday instead of worrying about the paperwork."" Dan and his family have only travelled abroad once since the pandemic started, but he hopes that as the rules ease, planning holidays will become more straightforward. ""I'm quite happy there are fewer barriers, it makes me feel more confident going away from that point of view,"" he says. However, safety remains his number one priority: ""If a new variant came along or something changed and the rules had to be revisited, I for one would understand that."" Mr Shapps also confirmed that from 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. It comes after families have struggled to prove their children's vaccination status when trying to enter countries including Spain, Italy and France. Mr Shapps also told MPs the UK is set to recognise vaccine certificates from 16 further nations, including countries like China and Mexico. This will take the total number of recognised countries and territories to 180. The moves were welcomed by the travel and tourism industry, which has been one of the sectors hit hardest by coronavirus lockdown measures. Airline Virgin Atlantic said: ""The removal of all testing for vaccinated passengers is the final step in moving towards frictionless air travel, allowing passengers to reconnect with loved ones and business colleagues. ""It restores customer confidence and demand will be boosted in a critical booking window for the travel industry."" Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said the airline would ""now look ahead to what we believe will be a strong summer"". He said: ""It is clear travel restrictions did not materially slow the spread of Omicron in the UK and so it is important that there are no more knee jerk reactions to future variants."" However, the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, warned rules had been lifted too quickly. Its chairman Tom Watson said: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" What are the travel rules? Covid test firm urges end to tests for travellers Currently, fully vaccinated passengers, who have had two doses (or one dose of the Janssen vaccine), and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK. However, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over -  or 11 and over in Scotland - must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test. If they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result. Vaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK. But Mr Shapps said the form, which had been ""complex and difficult to navigate"", would now be made simpler and travellers would have an extra day to fill it in. Earlier in January, the government scrapped the need for fully vaccinated travellers coming to England to take a Covid test before they travel. However, arrivals who are not fully vaccinated must take a pre-departure test and two post-arrival PCR tests, which are more expensive than the lateral flow version. They must also self-isolate for 10 days. Are your journey plans affected by the removal of Covid travel tests in England?  Share your stories by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"The protocol created a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has said he is not setting ""artificial deadlines"" after talks on the NI Protocol failed to make a breakthrough. Maros Å efÄoviÄ was speaking after a meeting in Brussels with the UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. He added if political goodwill was maintained it could ""lead to a timely agreement on durable solutions"". Mrs Truss said there had been ""progress"" and she wants to work with the EU ""in short order"". ""We're putting as much resource as we can into making this work and making things happen for the people of Northern Ireland,"" she added. In a joint statement, the lead negotiators said they would hold further talks next week. They added that the Joint Committee, the formal body overseeing the protocol, would meet before the end of February. That will be the first Joint Committee meeting in more than six months. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is acting as lead negotiator for the first time since replacing Lord Frost Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney described the mood of the talks as ""quite good"" and welcomed the foreign secretary's ""personal engagement."" ""We need to show a bit of patience here and allow the negotiating teams to try to advance areas where they can find agreement,"" he said. He added that the Joint Committee meeting in February could create a ""platform for agreement"". Liz Truss replaces Lord Frost in post-Brexit talks A simple guide to the Brexit border problem What is Article 16 and why does it matter? The protocolkeeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. That means new paperwork and processes when importing materials and equipment from Great Britain. Unionist politicians have criticised the arrangements and say the Irish Sea border undermines Northern Ireland's position in the UK. Over the past six months the UK government has been attempting to renegotiate the deal. In July, the UK proposed an arrangement in which goods from Great Britain, which are due to stay in Northern Ireland, would not be checked and would have minimal paperwork. Goods which are due to move onwards to the Republic of Ireland would be checked at Northern Ireland's ports. The EU published its own proposals in October, which it said would significantly reduce, but not eliminate, checks on goods. It has previously said that the easiest way to reduce checks would be for the UK to sign up to a Swiss-style agri-food agreement. That would involve all of the UK following the relevant EU rules, something the government says it could not accept. What is Article 16 and why does it matter?

"Covid testing rules are to be eased for double-vaccinated people travelling to England, the government says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the changes will come into force on 11 February Passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arrival or to self isolate Travel industry bosses have welcomed the change, saying they hope demand for holidays will soar The chief executive of Airlines UK says it ""brings international travel towards near-normality for the fully vaccinated"" Covid restrictions introduced to tackle Omicron are eased in Scotland, meaning nightclubs and large indoor events can return In France, adults must show a pass proving they are vaccinated to visit cafes, restaurants and cinemas - negative tests are no longer enough Welsh care providers say they could employ unvaccinated workers whoâve left their jobs under NHS England's mandatory vaccination policy Edited by James Clarke That's all for today - our coverage has been brought to you by Chris Giles, Alex Kleiderman, Jack Hunter, Claire Heald and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus updates tomorrow. We're wrapping up our live coverage for the day shortly, here's a reminder of the key Covid stories we've been covering: The transport secretary has indicated he is committed to simplifying the UK's passenger locator form filled out by travellers ahead of their journey. In a question to Grant Shapps, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw says the form is a ""massive irritant"", being longer than the EU equivalent and ""very complicated"". Speaking in the Commons after announcing changes to the testing rules, Shapps said: ""I entirely agree with him about the complexity of the passenger locator form."" From 11 February, fully-vaccinated arrivals to England will need to verify their status via a passenger locator form but will not have to be tested. People who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. It's been all about alterations to travel rules this afternoon but some other measures have been changing too. Some restrictions in Scotland introduced in response to the Omicron variant were eased earlier today. Crowd limits on large indoor events have been lifted - but people are still being asked to work from home and take lateral flow tests before meeting others. Meanwhile, England is due to ease some of its own rules over the next week. So what are the rules in place  across the UK? Read asummary here. You can also check what the rules are in your area byentering your postcodeor council name in this page. Responding to Grant Shapps' announcement in the Commons on the changes to travel rules, the shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh questioned how the government will deal with future Covid variants. She welcomed the transport secretary's promise to ""develop a full tool box of contingency options to provide more certainty on how we respond against future variants"". Haigh says the government appears to be ""finally"" producing a plan to give the travel industry and the public the certainty they need after a ""chaotic"" approach to date. She says ministers should have provided ""sector-specific support"" to the aviation industry during the pandemic, and says its actions have caused ""uncertainty"" for both passengers and business. Haigh says ministers must publish the data that will guide the decisions it will take to travel if future variants emerge. And she says the public deserve an ""easily understandable plan"" for any future border restrictions. More now on theannouncement to axe Covid tests for fully vaccinated international travellers arriving in Englandfrom next month. Gavin Newlands of the SNP asks Grant Shapps what discussion heâs had with the Scottish government about the new measures that have been announced for England? The transport secretary says he spoke this morning to Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and adds, through the UK Health Security Agency âthe four chief medical officers were involved in studying the data and reaching this conclusionâ. While we've been focusing on the changes to travel rules, the UK's usual daily coronavirus data has been released. Thenew statistics show,externalthat there have been another 88,447 Covid cases, and a further 56 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. And about 85,000 people were vaccinated yesterday, with around half of those being booster jabs. Some 64.2% of eligible people aged 12 and over in the UK have now had a booster jab. The travel industry has beenwelcoming the confirmationthat fully-vaccinated people arriving in England from abroad will no longer have to take Covid tests - but companies involved in testing are suggesting the move is happening too quickly. The Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, says the UK's ability to discover new Covid variants, may be harmed. The organisation's chairman Tom Watson says: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" He adds: ""We believe removing testing completely for international travel would weaken our wall of defence - because testing is the antidote to lockdowns."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the changes mean the UK now has âone of the most open travel sectors in the worldâ. He says while we know Covid can bring surprises, he hopes everybody will now feel confident about booking holidays, business trips and visits to family and friends abroad. Shapps says thatâs because âthe government got the big calls rightâ on vaccination, on boosters and dealing with Omicron. He says thatâs allowed them to âopen travelâ and adds âtoday, we are setting Britain freeâ.   Meanwhile, away from travel, a treasury minister has resigned from the government over its handling of fraudulent Covid business loans. Lord Agnew of Oulton, who was the minister of counter fraud, tells peers ""it would be somewhat dishonest to stay on in that role if I am incapable of doing it properly"". He acknowledges the timing of his move may appear to be connected to the criticism Boris Johnson is currently facing from some Tory MPs - but he stresses it was not an attack on the PM. In December, theNational Audit Office said the government had failed to put adequate measures in placeto prevent fraudsters stealing billions of pounds through its Bounce Back Loan scheme. Lord Agnew said he was unhappy with working between the Department for Business and the Treasury. Downing Street said the government had been clear fraud was ""unacceptable"" and stressed it was taking action against people  abusing the system. The transport secretary says âfor kids travelling to the UKâ, under-18s will continue to be treated as eligible fully vaccinated passengers. Grant Shapps says that means they ""will not face any tests at the UK border"". He says from 3 February 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. Shapps says he hopes the move will help families plan holidays for the February half-term. The transport secretary says passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arrival or to self isolate. Grants Shapps says they will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate a proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post arrival PCR test.

"Covid testing rules are to be eased for double-vaccinated people travelling to England, the government says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the changes will come into force on 11 February Passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arrival or to self isolate Travel industry bosses have welcomed the change, saying they hope demand for holidays will soar The chief executive of Airlines UK says it ""brings international travel towards near-normality for the fully vaccinated"" Covid restrictions introduced to tackle Omicron are eased in Scotland, meaning nightclubs and large indoor events can return In France, adults must show a pass proving they are vaccinated to visit cafes, restaurants and cinemas - negative tests are no longer enough Welsh care providers say they could employ unvaccinated workers whoâve left their jobs under NHS England's mandatory vaccination policy Edited by James Clarke That's all for today - our coverage has been brought to you by Chris Giles, Alex Kleiderman, Jack Hunter, Claire Heald and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus updates tomorrow. We're wrapping up our live coverage for the day shortly, here's a reminder of the key Covid stories we've been covering: The transport secretary has indicated he is committed to simplifying the UK's passenger locator form filled out by travellers ahead of their journey. In a question to Grant Shapps, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw says the form is a ""massive irritant"", being longer than the EU equivalent and ""very complicated"". Speaking in the Commons after announcing changes to the testing rules, Shapps said: ""I entirely agree with him about the complexity of the passenger locator form."" From 11 February, fully-vaccinated arrivals to England will need to verify their status via a passenger locator form but will not have to be tested. People who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. It's been all about alterations to travel rules this afternoon but some other measures have been changing too. Some restrictions in Scotland introduced in response to the Omicron variant were eased earlier today. Crowd limits on large indoor events have been lifted - but people are still being asked to work from home and take lateral flow tests before meeting others. Meanwhile, England is due to ease some of its own rules over the next week. So what are the rules in place  across the UK? Read asummary here. You can also check what the rules are in your area byentering your postcodeor council name in this page. Responding to Grant Shapps' announcement in the Commons on the changes to travel rules, the shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh questioned how the government will deal with future Covid variants. She welcomed the transport secretary's promise to ""develop a full tool box of contingency options to provide more certainty on how we respond against future variants"". Haigh says the government appears to be ""finally"" producing a plan to give the travel industry and the public the certainty they need after a ""chaotic"" approach to date. She says ministers should have provided ""sector-specific support"" to the aviation industry during the pandemic, and says its actions have caused ""uncertainty"" for both passengers and business. Haigh says ministers must publish the data that will guide the decisions it will take to travel if future variants emerge. And she says the public deserve an ""easily understandable plan"" for any future border restrictions. More now on theannouncement to axe Covid tests for fully vaccinated international travellers arriving in Englandfrom next month. Gavin Newlands of the SNP asks Grant Shapps what discussion heâs had with the Scottish government about the new measures that have been announced for England? The transport secretary says he spoke this morning to Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and adds, through the UK Health Security Agency âthe four chief medical officers were involved in studying the data and reaching this conclusionâ. While we've been focusing on the changes to travel rules, the UK's usual daily coronavirus data has been released. Thenew statistics show,externalthat there have been another 88,447 Covid cases, and a further 56 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. And about 85,000 people were vaccinated yesterday, with around half of those being booster jabs. Some 64.2% of eligible people aged 12 and over in the UK have now had a booster jab. The travel industry has beenwelcoming the confirmationthat fully-vaccinated people arriving in England from abroad will no longer have to take Covid tests - but companies involved in testing are suggesting the move is happening too quickly. The Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, says the UK's ability to discover new Covid variants, may be harmed. The organisation's chairman Tom Watson says: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" He adds: ""We believe removing testing completely for international travel would weaken our wall of defence - because testing is the antidote to lockdowns."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the changes mean the UK now has âone of the most open travel sectors in the worldâ. He says while we know Covid can bring surprises, he hopes everybody will now feel confident about booking holidays, business trips and visits to family and friends abroad. Shapps says thatâs because âthe government got the big calls rightâ on vaccination, on boosters and dealing with Omicron. He says thatâs allowed them to âopen travelâ and adds âtoday, we are setting Britain freeâ.   Meanwhile, away from travel, a treasury minister has resigned from the government over its handling of fraudulent Covid business loans. Lord Agnew of Oulton, who was the minister of counter fraud, tells peers ""it would be somewhat dishonest to stay on in that role if I am incapable of doing it properly"". He acknowledges the timing of his move may appear to be connected to the criticism Boris Johnson is currently facing from some Tory MPs - but he stresses it was not an attack on the PM. In December, theNational Audit Office said the government had failed to put adequate measures in placeto prevent fraudsters stealing billions of pounds through its Bounce Back Loan scheme. Lord Agnew said he was unhappy with working between the Department for Business and the Treasury. Downing Street said the government had been clear fraud was ""unacceptable"" and stressed it was taking action against people  abusing the system. The transport secretary says âfor kids travelling to the UKâ, under-18s will continue to be treated as eligible fully vaccinated passengers. Grant Shapps says that means they ""will not face any tests at the UK border"". He says from 3 February 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. Shapps says he hopes the move will help families plan holidays for the February half-term. The transport secretary says passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arrival or to self isolate. Grants Shapps says they will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate a proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post arrival PCR test.

"This video can not be played Lord Agnew accuses the Treasury of having ""little interest in the consequences of fraud to our society"" A Conservative minister in the House of Lords has resigned attacking the government's handling of fraudulent Covid business loans. Lord Agnew accused the Treasury of having ""little interest in the consequences of fraud to our society"". But he said his departure was ""not an attack on the prime minister"". Last year, the National Audit Office criticised the government for failing to implement measures to prevent people exploiting Covid schemes. Bounce Back Loan fraud checks called inadequate 'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan' PM faces key week ahead of No 10 parties report Lord Agnew, a Treasury minister with responsibility for cross-government efficiency, said ""a combination of arrogance, indolence and ignorance"" was ""freezing the government machine"". He accused the government of making ""schoolboy errors"" by giving loans to over 1,000 companies who were not trading when Covid struck. ""I hope that as a virtually unknown minister beyond this place giving up my career might prompt others to get behind this and sort it out,"" he said. In a dramatic moment in the House of Lords, he read out his resignation speech in response to a question from Labour about the Â£4.3bn of Covid loans written off by the Treasury. He concluded with a ""thank you and goodbye"", before marching out of the chamber to a round of applause - a rare occurrence in the Lords. A No 10 spokesman said: ""We are grateful to Lord Agnew for the significant contribution he has made to government."" The spokesman said the government was taking action against fraud, adding that 150,000 ineligible claims have been blocked and Â£500m recovered last year. An HMRC tax protection taskforce was also expected to recover an additional Â£1bn, the spokesman added. This video can not be played WATCH: Hunting down the Covid loan fraudsters The Bounce Back Loan scheme was set up in April 2020 with the aim of keeping small businesses afloat during the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 1.5 million loans worth Â£47bn were issued through the initiative, after about a quarter of UK businesses applied. Banks, building societies and other accredited lenders loaned companies up to Â£50,000, or a maximum of 25% of annual turnover, with the government guaranteeing them repayments if the firms defaulted. In September, the state-owned British Business Bank, which oversees the scheme, said Â£2bn of loans had been repaid and Â£1.3bn had been defaulted on. In December 2021, the public spending watchdog the National Audit Office said counter-fraud activity had been ""implemented too slowly"". It estimated that the business department had put the estimated cost of fraudulent loans at Â£4.9bn - 11% of the total given out. In response to Lord Agnew's resignation, the British Business Bank said ""key counter-fraud measures"" had been put in place at the start of the scheme, and it had worked with the scheme's lenders to put additional measures in place. ""Arrogance, indolence, ignorance"", ""schoolboy errors"", and ""nothing less than woeful"". As the political joke goes, Lord Agnew may not have been a household name, even in his own household, but the manner of his attack on the government from the ministerial despatch box points to a serious issue. There was always a trade-off between due diligence on pandemic rescue loans and getting some Â£72bn of cash into the bank accounts of businesses. The government made a strategic decision to prioritise speed ""in good conscience"", as ministers put it. As a result,  a process that would have taken months, in some cases took just days. This undoubtedly helped the whole economy bounce back. But it is the scale, not of the losses in general (expected to top Â£20bn, mainly on Bounce Back loans) of the Â£4bn at least that will be written off due to fraud, that led to this highly public exit from the minister. In particular, over 1,000 businesses that were not even trading, received Bounce Back loans, said the minister. Right now, the banks that operated the scheme are deciding how to account for the loans in their full year results. Over a quarter of the Â£1bn given to banks by taxpayers has so far been for fraudulent loans, Lord Agnew told peers. And he fears a ""new dangerous phase"" where banks act less than rigorously in seeking repayment, given they know they can reclaim the cash from the taxpayer. At a time of tight budgets, rising prices and taxes, banks could come under pressure to try a little harder to collect the monies owed. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves described Lord Agnew's departure as ""a damning indictment"" of the chancellor's failures on fraud. ""It should be a source of enduring shame to [Rishi] Sunak that he has so casually written off Â£4.3bn of taxpayers' money,"" she added. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said the government had ""allowed fraudsters to steal billions of taxpayers' money"" and urged the chancellor to explain how he would get the money back. Lord Agnew was appointed a Treasury minister in February 2020. He has also sat as a non-executive director for the Department for Education.

"The latest easing of the Omicron restrictions is ""a very significant moment"" in the fight against Covid, the deputy first minister has said. For the first time since Boxing Day nightclubs can reopen and crowd limits on large indoor events are lifted. But people are still being asked to work from home and take lateral flow tests before meeting others. John Swinney said the government would continue to take a ""proportionate"" approach to the remaining measures. On Sunday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that ""we're hopefully seeing Scotland firmly on the downward slope"". What are the Covid rules in Scotland? How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? The lifting of many of the remaining restrictions was announced last week following a significant fall in new case numbers. Guidance advising adults against meeting up with more than three households at a time has been dropped, along with restrictions on indoor contact sports. In hospitality, the requirement for 1m physical distancing and table service has now ended, but the vaccine passport scheme remains in force for certain venues. Longer-running measures such as the use of face coverings on public transport, in indoor public places and in secondary schools also remain in place. Mr Swinney welcomed the easing of restrictions that were introduced last month before Scotland experienced record-breaking virus case numbers. But he warned: ""It is too early to say if it is the beginning of the end."" Mr Swinney told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandthat worldwide there remained ""significant challenges"" in the handling of the virus, specifically around the possible emergence of new variants. He also said the Scottish government would continue to take a prudent approach to basic anti-virus measures such as the wearing of face coverings. Nightclubs can reopen as restrictions to tackle the Omicron wave are lifted Mr Swinney added: ""Covid is still out there. We can still see there are thousands of cases on a daily basis within Scotland. ""There are people who are still having a very hard time with Covid and our health service is still enduring the enormous pressures of Covid. ""So Covid has not, in any shape or form, disappeared."" The Omicron variant is now believed to have peaked in the first week of January. The percentage of positive tests has dropped from almost 30% in early January to under 20% . The number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid is also falling. In total, 6,329 positive cases were reported on Sunday with 1,441 patients in hospital. It is down from 7,158 cases a week earlier, with 100 fewer people in hospital. At the weekend Ms Sturgeon defended the continuing vaccine passport scheme, saying it had  helped as part of ""a package of measures"" to protect against transmission. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says case numbers are ""hopefully now... very firmly on the downward slope"" In an interview withthe BBC's Sunday Morning programme, she said: ""I don't underplay the impact of any of these measures on businesses and the night-time industry, but checking Covid certification is a better alternative to being closed."" She said that vaccine passports were ""not causing anybody any real hardship"" and had allowed large events to go ahead. The first minister said she hoped that passports and wearing of facemasks would ""eventually"" come to an end. But she said there would be big ""economic consequences"" if we allowed the virus to spread in an uncontrolled way. Despite restrictions easing, people have been advised to keep social meet-ups small to reduce the risk of infection. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Workers should also continue to work from home where possible. Ministers are due to hold talks with business leaders about a return to a hybrid working approach from February. Ms Sturgeon said the financial impact ofCovid restrictions on business and hospitality had been ""worth it""to stop the spread of Omicron. She told the programme: ""It is not a case of having protective measures and businesses are damaged, or having no proactive measures and everything is fine. ""It is the difference between having protective measures that stem transmission, or allowing transmission to go completely uncontrolled - in which case the impact on business is even greater and even more damaging.""

"People arriving in England or Scotland from abroad will no longer have to take Covid tests if they are fully vaccinated, it has been confirmed. In a boost for families, the changes will come in from 4am on 11 February, in time for the half-term break. Rules have also been eased for unvaccinated travellers, who will no longer have to take a day eight test or self isolate. However, they will still need pre-departure and day two tests. And everyone arriving in England and Scotland, regardless of vaccination status, will need to fill in a passenger locator form - although these will be made ""easier"" to complete, said UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Wales and Northern Ireland have not yet said whether they will change their testing rules, although they are expected to follow suit. What are the travel rules? In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Shapps said the move would save families about Â£100 on visits abroad, as well as boost the beleaguered travel industry. ""Today I can confirm that our international travel regime will now be liberalised as part our efforts to ensure that 2022 is the year in which restrictions on travel, on lockdowns and limits on people's lives are firmly placed in the past,"" he said. ""From 4am on February 11, and in time for the half-term break, eligible fully-vaccinated passengers arriving in the UK will no longer have to take a post-arrival lateral flow test. ""That means that after months of pre-departure testing, post-arrival testing, self-isolation, additional expense, all that fully vaccinated people will now have to do, when they travel to the UK, is to verify their status via a passenger locator form."" Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the measures were ""extremely welcome"" for the tourism and aviation sectors. But he said ""further surveillance"" would be needed across all UK nations to catch variants if they emerged. Dan from Surrey is planning to travel to Italy on a skiing trip with his son in the half term holiday. ""I was geared up for having to do all the tests and the forms that I needed to,"" he says, adding that today's news was ""a welcome change"". ""It's one less thing to worry about,"" he says. ""It's a bit less cost, but also it's a bit less stress. So overall, hopefully we can focus on having a nice holiday instead of worrying about the paperwork."" Dan and his family have only travelled abroad once since the pandemic started, but he hopes that as the rules ease, planning holidays will become more straightforward. ""I'm quite happy there are fewer barriers, it makes me feel more confident going away from that point of view,"" he says. However, safety remains his number one priority: ""If a new variant came along or something changed and the rules had to be revisited, I for one would understand that."" Mr Shapps also confirmed that from 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. It comes after families have struggled to prove their children's vaccination status when trying to enter countries including Spain, Italy and France. Mr Shapps also told MPs the UK is set to recognise vaccine certificates from 16 further nations, including countries like China and Mexico. This will take the total number of recognised countries and territories to 180. The moves were welcomed by the travel and tourism industry, which has been one of the sectors hit hardest by coronavirus lockdown measures. Airline Virgin Atlantic said: ""The removal of all testing for vaccinated passengers is the final step in moving towards frictionless air travel, allowing passengers to reconnect with loved ones and business colleagues. ""It restores customer confidence and demand will be boosted in a critical booking window for the travel industry."" Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said the airline would ""now look ahead to what we believe will be a strong summer"". He said: ""It is clear travel restrictions did not materially slow the spread of Omicron in the UK and so it is important that there are no more knee jerk reactions to future variants."" However, the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, warned rules had been lifted too quickly. Its chairman Tom Watson said: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" What are the travel rules? Covid test firm urges end to tests for travellers Currently, fully vaccinated passengers, who have had two doses (or one dose of the Janssen vaccine), and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK. However, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over -  or 11 and over in Scotland - must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test. If they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result. Vaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK. But Mr Shapps said the form, which had been ""complex and difficult to navigate"", would now be made simpler and travellers would have an extra day to fill it in. Earlier in January, the government scrapped the need for fully vaccinated travellers coming to England to take a Covid test before they travel. However, arrivals who are not fully vaccinated must take a pre-departure test and two post-arrival PCR tests, which are more expensive than the lateral flow version. They must also self-isolate for 10 days. Are your journey plans affected by the removal of Covid travel tests in England?  Share your stories by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"People arriving in England or Scotland from abroad will no longer have to take Covid tests if they are fully vaccinated, it has been confirmed. In a boost for families, the changes will come in from 4am on 11 February, in time for the half-term break. Rules have also been eased for unvaccinated travellers, who will no longer have to take a day eight test or self isolate. However, they will still need pre-departure and day two tests. And everyone arriving in England and Scotland, regardless of vaccination status, will need to fill in a passenger locator form - although these will be made ""easier"" to complete, said UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Wales and Northern Ireland have not yet said whether they will change their testing rules, although they are expected to follow suit. What are the travel rules? In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Shapps said the move would save families about Â£100 on visits abroad, as well as boost the beleaguered travel industry. ""Today I can confirm that our international travel regime will now be liberalised as part our efforts to ensure that 2022 is the year in which restrictions on travel, on lockdowns and limits on people's lives are firmly placed in the past,"" he said. ""From 4am on February 11, and in time for the half-term break, eligible fully-vaccinated passengers arriving in the UK will no longer have to take a post-arrival lateral flow test. ""That means that after months of pre-departure testing, post-arrival testing, self-isolation, additional expense, all that fully vaccinated people will now have to do, when they travel to the UK, is to verify their status via a passenger locator form."" Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the measures were ""extremely welcome"" for the tourism and aviation sectors. But he said ""further surveillance"" would be needed across all UK nations to catch variants if they emerged. Dan from Surrey is planning to travel to Italy on a skiing trip with his son in the half term holiday. ""I was geared up for having to do all the tests and the forms that I needed to,"" he says, adding that today's news was ""a welcome change"". ""It's one less thing to worry about,"" he says. ""It's a bit less cost, but also it's a bit less stress. So overall, hopefully we can focus on having a nice holiday instead of worrying about the paperwork."" Dan and his family have only travelled abroad once since the pandemic started, but he hopes that as the rules ease, planning holidays will become more straightforward. ""I'm quite happy there are fewer barriers, it makes me feel more confident going away from that point of view,"" he says. However, safety remains his number one priority: ""If a new variant came along or something changed and the rules had to be revisited, I for one would understand that."" Mr Shapps also confirmed that from 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. It comes after families have struggled to prove their children's vaccination status when trying to enter countries including Spain, Italy and France. Mr Shapps also told MPs the UK is set to recognise vaccine certificates from 16 further nations, including countries like China and Mexico. This will take the total number of recognised countries and territories to 180. The moves were welcomed by the travel and tourism industry, which has been one of the sectors hit hardest by coronavirus lockdown measures. Airline Virgin Atlantic said: ""The removal of all testing for vaccinated passengers is the final step in moving towards frictionless air travel, allowing passengers to reconnect with loved ones and business colleagues. ""It restores customer confidence and demand will be boosted in a critical booking window for the travel industry."" Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said the airline would ""now look ahead to what we believe will be a strong summer"". He said: ""It is clear travel restrictions did not materially slow the spread of Omicron in the UK and so it is important that there are no more knee jerk reactions to future variants."" However, the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, warned rules had been lifted too quickly. Its chairman Tom Watson said: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" What are the travel rules? Covid test firm urges end to tests for travellers Currently, fully vaccinated passengers, who have had two doses (or one dose of the Janssen vaccine), and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK. However, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over -  or 11 and over in Scotland - must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test. If they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result. Vaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK. But Mr Shapps said the form, which had been ""complex and difficult to navigate"", would now be made simpler and travellers would have an extra day to fill it in. Earlier in January, the government scrapped the need for fully vaccinated travellers coming to England to take a Covid test before they travel. However, arrivals who are not fully vaccinated must take a pre-departure test and two post-arrival PCR tests, which are more expensive than the lateral flow version. They must also self-isolate for 10 days. Are your journey plans affected by the removal of Covid travel tests in England?  Share your stories by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Covid testing rules are to be eased for double-vaccinated people travelling to England, the government says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the changes will come into force on 11 February Passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arrival or to self isolate Travel industry bosses have welcomed the change, saying they hope demand for holidays will soar The chief executive of Airlines UK says it ""brings international travel towards near-normality for the fully vaccinated"" Covid restrictions introduced to tackle Omicron are eased in Scotland, meaning nightclubs and large indoor events can return In France, adults must show a pass proving they are vaccinated to visit cafes, restaurants and cinemas - negative tests are no longer enough Welsh care providers say they could employ unvaccinated workers whoâve left their jobs under NHS England's mandatory vaccination policy Edited by James Clarke That's all for today - our coverage has been brought to you by Chris Giles, Alex Kleiderman, Jack Hunter, Claire Heald and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus updates tomorrow. We're wrapping up our live coverage for the day shortly, here's a reminder of the key Covid stories we've been covering: The transport secretary has indicated he is committed to simplifying the UK's passenger locator form filled out by travellers ahead of their journey. In a question to Grant Shapps, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw says the form is a ""massive irritant"", being longer than the EU equivalent and ""very complicated"". Speaking in the Commons after announcing changes to the testing rules, Shapps said: ""I entirely agree with him about the complexity of the passenger locator form."" From 11 February, fully-vaccinated arrivals to England will need to verify their status via a passenger locator form but will not have to be tested. People who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. It's been all about alterations to travel rules this afternoon but some other measures have been changing too. Some restrictions in Scotland introduced in response to the Omicron variant were eased earlier today. Crowd limits on large indoor events have been lifted - but people are still being asked to work from home and take lateral flow tests before meeting others. Meanwhile, England is due to ease some of its own rules over the next week. So what are the rules in place  across the UK? Read asummary here. You can also check what the rules are in your area byentering your postcodeor council name in this page. Responding to Grant Shapps' announcement in the Commons on the changes to travel rules, the shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh questioned how the government will deal with future Covid variants. She welcomed the transport secretary's promise to ""develop a full tool box of contingency options to provide more certainty on how we respond against future variants"". Haigh says the government appears to be ""finally"" producing a plan to give the travel industry and the public the certainty they need after a ""chaotic"" approach to date. She says ministers should have provided ""sector-specific support"" to the aviation industry during the pandemic, and says its actions have caused ""uncertainty"" for both passengers and business. Haigh says ministers must publish the data that will guide the decisions it will take to travel if future variants emerge. And she says the public deserve an ""easily understandable plan"" for any future border restrictions. More now on theannouncement to axe Covid tests for fully vaccinated international travellers arriving in Englandfrom next month. Gavin Newlands of the SNP asks Grant Shapps what discussion heâs had with the Scottish government about the new measures that have been announced for England? The transport secretary says he spoke this morning to Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and adds, through the UK Health Security Agency âthe four chief medical officers were involved in studying the data and reaching this conclusionâ. While we've been focusing on the changes to travel rules, the UK's usual daily coronavirus data has been released. Thenew statistics show,externalthat there have been another 88,447 Covid cases, and a further 56 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. And about 85,000 people were vaccinated yesterday, with around half of those being booster jabs. Some 64.2% of eligible people aged 12 and over in the UK have now had a booster jab. The travel industry has beenwelcoming the confirmationthat fully-vaccinated people arriving in England from abroad will no longer have to take Covid tests - but companies involved in testing are suggesting the move is happening too quickly. The Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, says the UK's ability to discover new Covid variants, may be harmed. The organisation's chairman Tom Watson says: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" He adds: ""We believe removing testing completely for international travel would weaken our wall of defence - because testing is the antidote to lockdowns."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the changes mean the UK now has âone of the most open travel sectors in the worldâ. He says while we know Covid can bring surprises, he hopes everybody will now feel confident about booking holidays, business trips and visits to family and friends abroad. Shapps says thatâs because âthe government got the big calls rightâ on vaccination, on boosters and dealing with Omicron. He says thatâs allowed them to âopen travelâ and adds âtoday, we are setting Britain freeâ.   Meanwhile, away from travel, a treasury minister has resigned from the government over its handling of fraudulent Covid business loans. Lord Agnew of Oulton, who was the minister of counter fraud, tells peers ""it would be somewhat dishonest to stay on in that role if I am incapable of doing it properly"". He acknowledges the timing of his move may appear to be connected to the criticism Boris Johnson is currently facing from some Tory MPs - but he stresses it was not an attack on the PM. In December, theNational Audit Office said the government had failed to put adequate measures in placeto prevent fraudsters stealing billions of pounds through its Bounce Back Loan scheme. Lord Agnew said he was unhappy with working between the Department for Business and the Treasury. Downing Street said the government had been clear fraud was ""unacceptable"" and stressed it was taking action against people  abusing the system. The transport secretary says âfor kids travelling to the UKâ, under-18s will continue to be treated as eligible fully vaccinated passengers. Grant Shapps says that means they ""will not face any tests at the UK border"". He says from 3 February 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. Shapps says he hopes the move will help families plan holidays for the February half-term. The transport secretary says passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arrival or to self isolate. Grants Shapps says they will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate a proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post arrival PCR test.   The transport secretary says fully-vaccinated travellers will only need to verify their status via a passenger locator form. Grants Shapps says border testing for vaccinated travellers had ""outlived its usefulness"". He says the move will make travel ""much easier"", save families money and provide certainty for passengers and the industry ahead of the summer season. He adds vaccinations from 16 more countries - including China and Mexico - would be recognised, meaning vaccinated people from 118 nations would be able to enter England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has just announced that from 04:00 on 11 February ""eligible fully vaccinated travellers"" arriving in the UK will no longer have to take a post arrival lateral flow test.

""Nearly two years since the initial Covid restrictions were introduced, today's announcement brings international travel towards near-normality for the fully vaccinated, and at last into line with hospitality and the domestic economy,"" he says. Alderslade hopes itâll offer âfurther reassuranceâ to travellers and demonstrate that, following the success of the vaccine programme, âthe UK can lead the world in our recovery from the pandemicâ.

You can also check what the rules are in your area byentering your postcodeor council name in this page. Responding to Grant Shapps' announcement in the Commons on the changes to travel rules, the shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh questioned how the government will deal with future Covid variants. She welcomed the transport secretary's promise to ""develop a full tool box of contingency options to provide more certainty on how we respond against future variants"". Haigh says the government appears to be ""finally"" producing a plan to give the travel industry and the public the certainty they need after a ""chaotic"" approach to date. She says ministers should have provided ""sector-specific support"" to the aviation industry during the pandemic, and says its actions have caused ""uncertainty"" for both passengers and business. Haigh says ministers must publish the data that will guide the decisions it will take to travel if future variants emerge. And she says the public deserve an ""easily understandable plan"" for any future border restrictions. More now on theannouncement to axe Covid tests for fully vaccinated international travellers arriving in Englandfrom next month. Gavin Newlands of the SNP asks Grant Shapps what discussion heâs had with the Scottish government about the new measures that have been announced for England? The transport secretary says he spoke this morning to Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and adds, through the UK Health Security Agency âthe four chief medical officers were involved in studying the data and reaching this conclusionâ. While we've been focusing on the changes to travel rules, the UK's usual daily coronavirus data has been released. Thenew statistics show,externalthat there have been another 88,447 Covid cases, and a further 56 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. And about 85,000 people were vaccinated yesterday, with around half of those being booster jabs. Some 64.2% of eligible people aged 12 and over in the UK have now had a booster jab. The travel industry has beenwelcoming the confirmationthat fully-vaccinated people arriving in England from abroad will no longer have to take Covid tests - but companies involved in testing are suggesting the move is happening too quickly. The Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, says the UK's ability to discover new Covid variants, may be harmed. The organisation's chairman Tom Watson says: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" He adds: ""We believe removing testing completely for international travel would weaken our wall of defence - because testing is the antidote to lockdowns."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the changes mean the UK now has âone of the most open travel sectors in the worldâ. He says while we know Covid can bring surprises, he hopes everybody will now feel confident about booking holidays, business trips and visits to family and friends abroad. Shapps says thatâs because âthe government got the big calls rightâ on vaccination, on boosters and dealing with Omicron. He says thatâs allowed them to âopen travelâ and adds âtoday, we are setting Britain freeâ.   Meanwhile, away from travel, a treasury minister has resigned from the government over its handling of fraudulent Covid business loans. Lord Agnew of Oulton, who was the minister of counter fraud, tells peers ""it would be somewhat dishonest to stay on in that role if I am incapable of doing it properly"". He acknowledges the timing of his move may appear to be connected to the criticism Boris Johnson is currently facing from some Tory MPs - but he stresses it was not an attack on the PM. In December, theNational Audit Office said the government had failed to put adequate measures in placeto prevent fraudsters stealing billions of pounds through its Bounce Back Loan scheme. Lord Agnew said he was unhappy with working between the Department for Business and the Treasury. Downing Street said the government had been clear fraud was ""unacceptable"" and stressed it was taking action against people  abusing the system. The transport secretary says âfor kids travelling to the UKâ, under-18s will continue to be treated as eligible fully vaccinated passengers. Grant Shapps says that means they ""will not face any tests at the UK border"". He says from 3 February 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. Shapps says he hopes the move will help families plan holidays for the February half-term. The transport secretary says passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arrival or to self isolate. Grants Shapps says they will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate a proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post arrival PCR test.   The transport secretary says fully-vaccinated travellers will only need to verify their status via a passenger locator form. Grants Shapps says border testing for vaccinated travellers had ""outlived its usefulness"". He says the move will make travel ""much easier"", save families money and provide certainty for passengers and the industry ahead of the summer season. He adds vaccinations from 16 more countries - including China and Mexico - would be recognised, meaning vaccinated people from 118 nations would be able to enter England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has just announced that from 04:00 on 11 February ""eligible fully vaccinated travellers"" arriving in the UK will no longer have to take a post arrival lateral flow test.

We'll be back with more coronavirus updates tomorrow. We're wrapping up our live coverage for the day shortly, here's a reminder of the key Covid stories we've been covering: The transport secretary has indicated he is committed to simplifying the UK's passenger locator form filled out by travellers ahead of their journey. In a question to Grant Shapps, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw says the form is a ""massive irritant"", being longer than the EU equivalent and ""very complicated"". Speaking in the Commons after announcing changes to the testing rules, Shapps said: ""I entirely agree with him about the complexity of the passenger locator form."" From 11 February, fully-vaccinated arrivals to England will need to verify their status via a passenger locator form but will not have to be tested. People who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. It's been all about alterations to travel rules this afternoon but some other measures have been changing too. Some restrictions in Scotland introduced in response to the Omicron variant were eased earlier today.

"This video can not be played Lord Agnew accuses the Treasury of having ""little interest in the consequences of fraud to our society"" A Conservative minister in the House of Lords has resigned attacking the government's handling of fraudulent Covid business loans. Lord Agnew accused the Treasury of having ""little interest in the consequences of fraud to our society"". But he said his departure was ""not an attack on the prime minister"". Last year, the National Audit Office criticised the government for failing to implement measures to prevent people exploiting Covid schemes. Bounce Back Loan fraud checks called inadequate 'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan' PM faces key week ahead of No 10 parties report Lord Agnew, a Treasury minister with responsibility for cross-government efficiency, said ""a combination of arrogance, indolence and ignorance"" was ""freezing the government machine"". He accused the government of making ""schoolboy errors"" by giving loans to over 1,000 companies who were not trading when Covid struck. ""I hope that as a virtually unknown minister beyond this place giving up my career might prompt others to get behind this and sort it out,"" he said. In a dramatic moment in the House of Lords, he read out his resignation speech in response to a question from Labour about the Â£4.3bn of Covid loans written off by the Treasury. He concluded with a ""thank you and goodbye"", before marching out of the chamber to a round of applause - a rare occurrence in the Lords. A No 10 spokesman said: ""We are grateful to Lord Agnew for the significant contribution he has made to government."" The spokesman said the government was taking action against fraud, adding that 150,000 ineligible claims have been blocked and Â£500m recovered last year. An HMRC tax protection taskforce was also expected to recover an additional Â£1bn, the spokesman added. This video can not be played WATCH: Hunting down the Covid loan fraudsters The Bounce Back Loan scheme was set up in April 2020 with the aim of keeping small businesses afloat during the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 1.5 million loans worth Â£47bn were issued through the initiative, after about a quarter of UK businesses applied. Banks, building societies and other accredited lenders loaned companies up to Â£50,000, or a maximum of 25% of annual turnover, with the government guaranteeing them repayments if the firms defaulted. In September, the state-owned British Business Bank, which oversees the scheme, said Â£2bn of loans had been repaid and Â£1.3bn had been defaulted on. In December 2021, the public spending watchdog the National Audit Office said counter-fraud activity had been ""implemented too slowly"". It estimated that the business department had put the estimated cost of fraudulent loans at Â£4.9bn - 11% of the total given out. In response to Lord Agnew's resignation, the British Business Bank said ""key counter-fraud measures"" had been put in place at the start of the scheme, and it had worked with the scheme's lenders to put additional measures in place. ""Arrogance, indolence, ignorance"", ""schoolboy errors"", and ""nothing less than woeful"". As the political joke goes, Lord Agnew may not have been a household name, even in his own household, but the manner of his attack on the government from the ministerial despatch box points to a serious issue. There was always a trade-off between due diligence on pandemic rescue loans and getting some Â£72bn of cash into the bank accounts of businesses. The government made a strategic decision to prioritise speed ""in good conscience"", as ministers put it. As a result,  a process that would have taken months, in some cases took just days. This undoubtedly helped the whole economy bounce back. But it is the scale, not of the losses in general (expected to top Â£20bn, mainly on Bounce Back loans) of the Â£4bn at least that will be written off due to fraud, that led to this highly public exit from the minister. In particular, over 1,000 businesses that were not even trading, received Bounce Back loans, said the minister. Right now, the banks that operated the scheme are deciding how to account for the loans in their full year results. Over a quarter of the Â£1bn given to banks by taxpayers has so far been for fraudulent loans, Lord Agnew told peers. And he fears a ""new dangerous phase"" where banks act less than rigorously in seeking repayment, given they know they can reclaim the cash from the taxpayer. At a time of tight budgets, rising prices and taxes, banks could come under pressure to try a little harder to collect the monies owed. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves described Lord Agnew's departure as ""a damning indictment"" of the chancellor's failures on fraud. ""It should be a source of enduring shame to [Rishi] Sunak that he has so casually written off Â£4.3bn of taxpayers' money,"" she added. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said the government had ""allowed fraudsters to steal billions of taxpayers' money"" and urged the chancellor to explain how he would get the money back. Lord Agnew was appointed a Treasury minister in February 2020. He has also sat as a non-executive director for the Department for Education.

"Police officers examine a weapon near the crime scene at Heidelberg University A lone gunman has killed one person and seriously injured three others inside a lecture hall at Heidelberg University in the south-west of Germany, before shooting himself dead. He was an 18-year-old German student. German police said the shooter, who was armed with two guns, had used a ""long gun"", and fired shots around the amphitheatre ""wildly"". The bloodshed triggered a large operation at the university's campus in the Neuenheimer Feld area. Police asked people to avoid the area so rescue workers and emergency services could move around freely. German media reported that the gunman appeared to have no religious or political motive. Police have searched his flat in the city of Mannheim, and found a WhatsApp message he had sent shortly beforehand, in which he spoke of punishing people. Heidelberg is a university town with about 160,000 inhabitants. The country has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe, and school shootings are rare. Anyone under 25 is required to pass a psychological evaluation before getting a gun licence. Police initially said four victims had been wounded, with a later update confirming one had died in hospital.

"People arriving in England or Scotland from abroad will no longer have to take Covid tests if they are fully vaccinated, it has been confirmed. In a boost for families, the changes will come in from 4am on 11 February, in time for the half-term break. Rules have also been eased for unvaccinated travellers, who will no longer have to take a day eight test or self isolate. However, they will still need pre-departure and day two tests. And everyone arriving in England and Scotland, regardless of vaccination status, will need to fill in a passenger locator form - although these will be made ""easier"" to complete, said UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Wales and Northern Ireland have not yet said whether they will change their testing rules, although they are expected to follow suit. What are the travel rules? In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Shapps said the move would save families about Â£100 on visits abroad, as well as boost the beleaguered travel industry. ""Today I can confirm that our international travel regime will now be liberalised as part our efforts to ensure that 2022 is the year in which restrictions on travel, on lockdowns and limits on people's lives are firmly placed in the past,"" he said. ""From 4am on February 11, and in time for the half-term break, eligible fully-vaccinated passengers arriving in the UK will no longer have to take a post-arrival lateral flow test. ""That means that after months of pre-departure testing, post-arrival testing, self-isolation, additional expense, all that fully vaccinated people will now have to do, when they travel to the UK, is to verify their status via a passenger locator form."" Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the measures were ""extremely welcome"" for the tourism and aviation sectors. But he said ""further surveillance"" would be needed across all UK nations to catch variants if they emerged. Dan from Surrey is planning to travel to Italy on a skiing trip with his son in the half term holiday. ""I was geared up for having to do all the tests and the forms that I needed to,"" he says, adding that today's news was ""a welcome change"". ""It's one less thing to worry about,"" he says. ""It's a bit less cost, but also it's a bit less stress. So overall, hopefully we can focus on having a nice holiday instead of worrying about the paperwork."" Dan and his family have only travelled abroad once since the pandemic started, but he hopes that as the rules ease, planning holidays will become more straightforward. ""I'm quite happy there are fewer barriers, it makes me feel more confident going away from that point of view,"" he says. However, safety remains his number one priority: ""If a new variant came along or something changed and the rules had to be revisited, I for one would understand that."" Mr Shapps also confirmed that from 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. It comes after families have struggled to prove their children's vaccination status when trying to enter countries including Spain, Italy and France. Mr Shapps also told MPs the UK is set to recognise vaccine certificates from 16 further nations, including countries like China and Mexico. This will take the total number of recognised countries and territories to 180. The moves were welcomed by the travel and tourism industry, which has been one of the sectors hit hardest by coronavirus lockdown measures. Airline Virgin Atlantic said: ""The removal of all testing for vaccinated passengers is the final step in moving towards frictionless air travel, allowing passengers to reconnect with loved ones and business colleagues. ""It restores customer confidence and demand will be boosted in a critical booking window for the travel industry."" Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said the airline would ""now look ahead to what we believe will be a strong summer"". He said: ""It is clear travel restrictions did not materially slow the spread of Omicron in the UK and so it is important that there are no more knee jerk reactions to future variants."" However, the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, warned rules had been lifted too quickly. Its chairman Tom Watson said: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" What are the travel rules? Covid test firm urges end to tests for travellers Currently, fully vaccinated passengers, who have had two doses (or one dose of the Janssen vaccine), and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK. However, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over -  or 11 and over in Scotland - must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test. If they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result. Vaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK. But Mr Shapps said the form, which had been ""complex and difficult to navigate"", would now be made simpler and travellers would have an extra day to fill it in. Earlier in January, the government scrapped the need for fully vaccinated travellers coming to England to take a Covid test before they travel. However, arrivals who are not fully vaccinated must take a pre-departure test and two post-arrival PCR tests, which are more expensive than the lateral flow version. They must also self-isolate for 10 days. Are your journey plans affected by the removal of Covid travel tests in England?  Share your stories by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"People arriving in England or Scotland from abroad will no longer have to take Covid tests if they are fully vaccinated, it has been confirmed. In a boost for families, the changes will come in from 4am on 11 February, in time for the half-term break. Rules have also been eased for unvaccinated travellers, who will no longer have to take a day eight test or self isolate. However, they will still need pre-departure and day two tests. And everyone arriving in England and Scotland, regardless of vaccination status, will need to fill in a passenger locator form - although these will be made ""easier"" to complete, said UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Wales and Northern Ireland have not yet said whether they will change their testing rules, although they are expected to follow suit. What are the travel rules? In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Shapps said the move would save families about Â£100 on visits abroad, as well as boost the beleaguered travel industry. ""Today I can confirm that our international travel regime will now be liberalised as part our efforts to ensure that 2022 is the year in which restrictions on travel, on lockdowns and limits on people's lives are firmly placed in the past,"" he said. ""From 4am on February 11, and in time for the half-term break, eligible fully-vaccinated passengers arriving in the UK will no longer have to take a post-arrival lateral flow test. ""That means that after months of pre-departure testing, post-arrival testing, self-isolation, additional expense, all that fully vaccinated people will now have to do, when they travel to the UK, is to verify their status via a passenger locator form."" Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the measures were ""extremely welcome"" for the tourism and aviation sectors. But he said ""further surveillance"" would be needed across all UK nations to catch variants if they emerged. Dan from Surrey is planning to travel to Italy on a skiing trip with his son in the half term holiday. ""I was geared up for having to do all the tests and the forms that I needed to,"" he says, adding that today's news was ""a welcome change"". ""It's one less thing to worry about,"" he says. ""It's a bit less cost, but also it's a bit less stress. So overall, hopefully we can focus on having a nice holiday instead of worrying about the paperwork."" Dan and his family have only travelled abroad once since the pandemic started, but he hopes that as the rules ease, planning holidays will become more straightforward. ""I'm quite happy there are fewer barriers, it makes me feel more confident going away from that point of view,"" he says. However, safety remains his number one priority: ""If a new variant came along or something changed and the rules had to be revisited, I for one would understand that."" Mr Shapps also confirmed that from 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. It comes after families have struggled to prove their children's vaccination status when trying to enter countries including Spain, Italy and France. Mr Shapps also told MPs the UK is set to recognise vaccine certificates from 16 further nations, including countries like China and Mexico. This will take the total number of recognised countries and territories to 180. The moves were welcomed by the travel and tourism industry, which has been one of the sectors hit hardest by coronavirus lockdown measures. Airline Virgin Atlantic said: ""The removal of all testing for vaccinated passengers is the final step in moving towards frictionless air travel, allowing passengers to reconnect with loved ones and business colleagues. ""It restores customer confidence and demand will be boosted in a critical booking window for the travel industry."" Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said the airline would ""now look ahead to what we believe will be a strong summer"". He said: ""It is clear travel restrictions did not materially slow the spread of Omicron in the UK and so it is important that there are no more knee jerk reactions to future variants."" However, the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, warned rules had been lifted too quickly. Its chairman Tom Watson said: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" What are the travel rules? Covid test firm urges end to tests for travellers Currently, fully vaccinated passengers, who have had two doses (or one dose of the Janssen vaccine), and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK. However, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over -  or 11 and over in Scotland - must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test. If they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.

"This video can not be played ""We should have prioritised that request for resources"" Police have been criticised over their handling of a riot which broke out in Swansea, in an independent review that said residents were left ""unprotected"". Cars were burnt and windows smashed in the Mayhill area after a vigil to a young man who had died turned violent. Ethan Powell's father Jonathan Russlater condemned those who rioted at his son's vigilin May 2021, calling them ""scumbags"". South Wales Police has now apologised for its slow response. Seven police officers were injuredand37 people were arrestedon suspicion of unlawful violence following the disturbances. A joint review between Swansea council, South Wales Police and its Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) was led by a panel made up of chairwoman Prof Elwen Evans QC, police expert Martin Jones, and local government consultant Jack Straw. What do we know about Mayhill - the scene of the riot? The report found a senior officer on the ground that night requested support from specialist public order officers but was twice denied it. The officer was so frustrated, he had to go outside the chain of command to authorise support but it was too late. South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Mark Travis said confusion led to the request being denied. ""There were competing demands on the night, but the main reason is a lack of clarity about information,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Drive. ""We've put measures in place to make sure it's a far more straight process. We had sufficient resources but didn't use them efficiently."" This video can not be played Adam Romain pleads for police help as his children scream during riot In its conclusions, the panel said: ""Despite the absence of a full investigation, it is clear to the panel that significant failings are evident throughout this event. ""Currently available evidence strongly suggests failings in command structures and decisions, operational decisions and tactics, and communications."" The report continued: ""The full extent of these failings and explanations for any failings can only be determined by a forensic investigation. ""All of the available evidence shows clearly that the residents of Waun Wen Road, Mayhill were left unprotected for a significant period of time on the 20 May 2021. ""Further analysis will not alter this fact, but should address more completely the question 'Why?'."" The panel heard from residents who said they felt terrorised in their own homes and abandoned by the police. It said: ""There was evident raw emotion and distress in the re-living of experiences of that night and its aftermath. ""Some of the views shared with us include the following: 'the police let us down'; 'they didn't protect us'; 'they failed to protect us'; 'they weren't there for us when we needed them'; and 'we don't understand why they didn't do anything'."" The report also said while there were no fatalities or serious physical injury, ""the criminal behaviours on that night presented a significant threat to life and to property"". The Mayhill street looked ""like a war zone"", one of the residents said A number of factors may have contributed to the riot, the panel said, including ""the effects of Covid lockdowns, social media narratives, criminal behaviours, socio-economic dynamics, and reactions to the tragic death of Ethan Powell"". The challenges facing local authorities and policing agencies were called ""exceptional and unprecedented"". It also said any assessment of the riot ""must start with a recognition that criminal responsibility sits with the adults and young people who committed criminal offences"". But it added it was clear there was ""significant"" work to be done by police to re-establish trust and confidence following the incident. South Wales Police Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said: ""I want to apologise to all those who have been affected by this incident and particularly those local residents who were tormented by those responsible. ""We failed to take action quickly enough on the night and for that I am truly sorry."" Assistant Chief Constable Mark Travis told BBC Radio Wales the force aimed to rebuild trust within the community. He said: ""We will spend time [there], be visible, hear them and make sure that we respond to those needs. ""It's important to note there were 37 people that went out with criminal intent and part of the closure for the community is bringing those people that damaged the community are brought to justice"" A criminal investigation into the rioting is ongoing. A file has been submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and charging decisions are expected shortly, the force added. An inquest into Ethan Powell's death is set to take place later this month.

"Police officers examine a weapon near the crime scene at Heidelberg University A lone gunman has killed one person and seriously injured three others inside a lecture hall at Heidelberg University in the south-west of Germany, before shooting himself dead. He was an 18-year-old German student. German police said the shooter, who was armed with two guns, had used a ""long gun"", and fired shots around the amphitheatre ""wildly"". The bloodshed triggered a large operation at the university's campus in the Neuenheimer Feld area. Police asked people to avoid the area so rescue workers and emergency services could move around freely. German media reported that the gunman appeared to have no religious or political motive. Police have searched his flat in the city of Mannheim, and found a WhatsApp message he had sent shortly beforehand, in which he spoke of punishing people. Heidelberg is a university town with about 160,000 inhabitants. The country has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe, and school shootings are rare. Anyone under 25 is required to pass a psychological evaluation before getting a gun licence. Police initially said four victims had been wounded, with a later update confirming one had died in hospital.

"Matthew Willson was visiting his girlfriend Katherine Shepard when he was shot The death of an English astrophysicist who was killed by a stray bullet fired through the wall of a US apartment was ""senseless"", his sister has said. Dr Matthew Willson, 31, from Chertsey, Surrey, was found in bed with a single gunshot wound to the head. Police were called to the apartment in Brookhaven, Atlanta, at 02:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on 16 January. Kate Willson said: ""Everyone who knew my brother has lost a wonderful friend."" Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Ms Willson said her brother ""was a joy to be around"". She said she had flown to the US as soon as she heard the news, arriving 36 hours later. ""The bullet had caused too much damage to his brain, he was brain dead, and there was very little chance he was ever going to wake up."" He was later pronounced dead in hospital. Ms Willson said: ""The outpouring of love from everybody who knew Matt from around the world has been a real sign of what a wonderful person he was."" Kate Willson described her brother as a ""wonderful person"" Ms Willson said: ""A bullet came through the wall and struck my brother in the head. ""It was too dangerous for the police to go in to investigate. They had to stand back until it was safe to go to my brother. ""It's a real senseless act,"" she said. Ms Willson said her brother's girlfriend, Katherine Shepard, had been left ""traumatised"". ""I admire her and I can't imagine what she's going through,"" she said. Ms Willson said the family had not received any more information from the police and there had been no arrests so far. ""Somebody knows who did this, and somebody know who's responsible."" Sgt Jake Kissel, from the Brookhaven Police Department,earlier said the shooting was believed to have been a random act. He said the stray bullet that hit Dr Willson travelled less than 100 yards (91m) and entered through an exterior wall of the apartment. ""We're saying it's the reckless discharge of firearms from one apartment complex and the stray bullet travelled through the woods and entered his apartment."" Aman Kar, who shared the flat with Ms Shepard told the BBC ""multiple rounds of gunshots"" were fired in the opposite complex ""about 20ft away"".

"Emad Al Swealmeen was the passenger in a taxi which was destroyed by his bomb New details have emerged about the Liverpool bomber Emad Al Swealmeen's failed asylum attempts - and the false information he used to make his cases. A previously confidential 2015 asylum judgment, released to the BBC, reveals how his claim of being a Syrian refugee lacked basic facts. Al Swealmeen, an Iraqi, lost that case but the Home Office did not remove him before he tried again under a new name. The Home Office will not comment on his case and no review has been announced. It is not clear whether officials spotted his second application from checking his fingerprint records. But the papers raise further questions about why he was not removed from the UK before the attack. Al Swealmeen, 32, was killed when hisbomb went off inside a taxi at Liverpool Women's Hospitalon Remembrance Sunday in November. The driver escaped seconds before the vehicle was engulfed in flames and was taken to hospital, but did not suffer life-threatening injuries. Nobody else was hurt. Bomber made device with murderous intent - coroner Taxi driver 'saw red light on bomber's vest' Miracle I'm alive, says Liverpool bomb taxi driver The fresh details about Al Swealmeen's asylum claim are in the 2015 judgment from the tribunal that rules on appeals against Home Office immigration decisions. It shows how he told obvious lies in an attempt to stay in the UK, and that his application lacked basic facts about his home and the danger he faced. According to the documents, released after legal representations from BBC News, Al Swealmeen arrived in the UK on 30 April 2014 and claimed asylum six days later. He claimed to be fleeing from his native Syria, which was then in the grip of a worsening civil war. But it was all untrue. October 1989: Born in Baghdad December 2013: Applied for a visitor's visa and is fingerprinted April 2014: Arrived and sought asylum November 2014: Rejected and appealed April 2015: Lost appeal August 2015: Lost challenge to that appeal Unknown date in 2017: Applied again under a new name By end of 2020: Lost that second claim January 2021: Lodged another appeal During his interview with a Home Office assessor, Al Swealmeen confirmed he had been living in the United Arab Emirates for 14 years and gave a vague account about returning to Syria to visit family, despite the raging conflict. He said he had then left out of fear for his life, returned to the UAE and flown on to the UK to claim asylum. That flight, on a genuine Jordanian passport, came four months after he had already applied for a UK visa  - meaning that British immigration officials had a copy of his fingerprints before he arrived. When a Home Office asylum case worker questioned Al Swealmeen closely about his travels, he couldn't explain why he had been in danger or describe his purported family's situation in Syria - such as basic facts about the geography of where they lived. An expert in Arabic also analysed Al Swealmeen's speech and concluded he was almost certainly Iraqi. Pictures of the burning car outside the hospital were widely shared on social media Al Swealmeen was housed in Liverpool while he waited for a decision - which came in a rejection letter in November 2014. He then appealed - but did not attend the 2015 hearing in Manchester. He had been detained under the Mental Health Act, after he had been found waving a knife at people in a Liverpool underpass. The judge handling the case concluded that Al Swealmeen's account was straightforward and so lacking in credibility that it could be dealt with immediately. ""His account of his time in Syria gives the impression of someone quoting information that is in the public domain rather than having first-hand experience,"" ruled the judge. ""The appellant did not identify himself with any particular faction or indicate that he would be at risk other than in a general sense. ""In view of all of the evidence, I reject his account of events in Syria and his fears on his return in their entirety and dismiss his asylum appeal."" That conclusion meant the Home Office had the green light to send Al Swealmeen back to Iraq or Jordan, as it had previously warned him it would do. During 2015 and the years that followed, the government was forcibly sending some people back to both countries - but Emad Al Swealmeen was not one of them. Enforced returns were falling during this period as the government pursued its so-called ""hostile environment"" policies designed to encourage people to leave of their own choice. Instead of going, Al Swealmeen tried to appeal again in August 2015, failed, and then joined Liverpool Cathedral's course on the foundations of Christianity, presenting himself as a potential convert. By 2017 he had converted and Malcolm and Elizabeth Hitchcott, a couple who volunteered in the local Christian community, gave him a bed. It's around this time he made a new asylum application under the name Enzo Almeni. As part of that claim, officials would have expected him to volunteer his fingerprints, so they could verify he had not claimed before - but it's not clear whether these checks were carried out. Emad Al Swealmeen (on right in light grey jacket) during a service at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral, alongside the bishop Right Reverend Cyril Ashton The Home Office eventually rejected this second application - but instead of being removed from the UK, Al Swealmeen was yet again able to lodge an appeal in January 2021. That challenge was outstanding when he detonated his homemade bomb. The Home Office has declined to comment on the specific circumstances of Emad Al Swealmeen's case but said it was ""fixing the broken asylum system"" in its current legislation. ""The new plan for immigration will require people to raise all protection-related issues up front, to tackle the practice of making multiple and sequential claims and enable the removal of those with no right to be in our country more quickly,"" said a spokesman.

"A Ukrainian civilian takes part in a training exercise - Russian forces have been mounting at the border Britain has started withdrawing staff from its embassy in Ukraine, amid growing fears of a Russian invasion. Officials say there have been no specific threats to British diplomats, but about half of the staff working in Kyiv will return to the UK. The US has ordered relatives of its embassy staff to leave, saying an invasion could come ""at any time"". Russia has denied plans for military action, but tens of thousands of troops have amassed on the border. The embassy moves were described as precautionary, and nothing specific is thought to have occurred in the past 24 hours to have triggered the decisions of the US and UK. EU staff in Ukraine will stay in place for now, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell saying he would not ""dramatise"" the tensions. Members of the Nato alliance, including Denmark, Spain, Bulgaria and the Netherlands, are sending more fighter jets and warships to Eastern Europe to bolster defences in the region. With an estimated 100,000 Russian troops now at the border with Ukraine, the head of Nato has warned there is a risk of fresh conflict in Europe. The US also told non-essential staff they could leave Ukraine, stressing its moves were not an evacuation. But the State Department told AFP news agency that if there was a Russian invasion, it  would ""not be in a position to evacuate US citizens"". Americans have also been warned by officials not to travel to Ukraine and Russia due to the ""potential for harassment"" against them. Ukraine said it was ""premature"" of the US to withdraw relatives of staff, calling the decision ""a display of excessive caution"". EXPLAINED:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? FROM KYIV:Ukrainians wait as Russia faces off with the West FROM BRUSSELS:Europe 'closest to war' in decades UK SUPPORT:UK says it is sending weapons to defend Ukraine On Saturday, some 90 tonnes of US ""lethal aid""including ammunition for ""front-line defenders"" arrived in Ukraine. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the government was putting together a ""series of actions that would figure into [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin's calculus"" including beefing up defences in Ukraine with more military assistance. Russia has seized Ukrainian territory before, when it annexed Crimea in 2014, following fierce protests in Ukraine that toppled the country's pro-Russian president. Russian forces seized control of Crimea before the territory voted to join Russia in a referendum the West and Ukraine deemed illegal. Russian-backed rebels control areas of eastern Ukraine near Russia's borders in a conflict which has cost an estimated 14,000 lives. A 2015 peace deal is far from being fulfilled. On Sunday, the UK Foreign Office accused Mr Putin ofplanning to install a pro-Moscow figure to lead Ukraine's government. The man named by the UK Foreign Office - former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev - called the claims ""stupid"" in an interview with Reuters news agency. UK ministers have warned that the Russian government will face serious consequences if there is an incursion. US officials said they were concerned that Russia could try to topple and replace the Ukraine government but declined to comment on the UK accusation.

"People arriving in England or Scotland from abroad will no longer have to take Covid tests if they are fully vaccinated, it has been confirmed. In a boost for families, the changes will come in from 4am on 11 February, in time for the half-term break. Rules have also been eased for unvaccinated travellers, who will no longer have to take a day eight test or self isolate. However, they will still need pre-departure and day two tests. And everyone arriving in England and Scotland, regardless of vaccination status, will need to fill in a passenger locator form - although these will be made ""easier"" to complete, said UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Wales and Northern Ireland have not yet said whether they will change their testing rules, although they are expected to follow suit. What are the travel rules? In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Shapps said the move would save families about Â£100 on visits abroad, as well as boost the beleaguered travel industry. ""Today I can confirm that our international travel regime will now be liberalised as part our efforts to ensure that 2022 is the year in which restrictions on travel, on lockdowns and limits on people's lives are firmly placed in the past,"" he said. ""From 4am on February 11, and in time for the half-term break, eligible fully-vaccinated passengers arriving in the UK will no longer have to take a post-arrival lateral flow test. ""That means that after months of pre-departure testing, post-arrival testing, self-isolation, additional expense, all that fully vaccinated people will now have to do, when they travel to the UK, is to verify their status via a passenger locator form."" Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the measures were ""extremely welcome"" for the tourism and aviation sectors. But he said ""further surveillance"" would be needed across all UK nations to catch variants if they emerged. Dan from Surrey is planning to travel to Italy on a skiing trip with his son in the half term holiday. ""I was geared up for having to do all the tests and the forms that I needed to,"" he says, adding that today's news was ""a welcome change"". ""It's one less thing to worry about,"" he says. ""It's a bit less cost, but also it's a bit less stress. So overall, hopefully we can focus on having a nice holiday instead of worrying about the paperwork."" Dan and his family have only travelled abroad once since the pandemic started, but he hopes that as the rules ease, planning holidays will become more straightforward. ""I'm quite happy there are fewer barriers, it makes me feel more confident going away from that point of view,"" he says. However, safety remains his number one priority: ""If a new variant came along or something changed and the rules had to be revisited, I for one would understand that."" Mr Shapps also confirmed that from 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. It comes after families have struggled to prove their children's vaccination status when trying to enter countries including Spain, Italy and France. Mr Shapps also told MPs the UK is set to recognise vaccine certificates from 16 further nations, including countries like China and Mexico. This will take the total number of recognised countries and territories to 180. The moves were welcomed by the travel and tourism industry, which has been one of the sectors hit hardest by coronavirus lockdown measures. Airline Virgin Atlantic said: ""The removal of all testing for vaccinated passengers is the final step in moving towards frictionless air travel, allowing passengers to reconnect with loved ones and business colleagues. ""It restores customer confidence and demand will be boosted in a critical booking window for the travel industry."" Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said the airline would ""now look ahead to what we believe will be a strong summer"". He said: ""It is clear travel restrictions did not materially slow the spread of Omicron in the UK and so it is important that there are no more knee jerk reactions to future variants."" However, the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, warned rules had been lifted too quickly. Its chairman Tom Watson said: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" What are the travel rules? Covid test firm urges end to tests for travellers Currently, fully vaccinated passengers, who have had two doses (or one dose of the Janssen vaccine), and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK. However, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over -  or 11 and over in Scotland - must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test. If they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result. Vaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK. But Mr Shapps said the form, which had been ""complex and difficult to navigate"", would now be made simpler and travellers would have an extra day to fill it in. Earlier in January, the government scrapped the need for fully vaccinated travellers coming to England to take a Covid test before they travel. However, arrivals who are not fully vaccinated must take a pre-departure test and two post-arrival PCR tests, which are more expensive than the lateral flow version. They must also self-isolate for 10 days. Are your journey plans affected by the removal of Covid travel tests in England?  Share your stories by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"The protocol created a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has said he is not setting ""artificial deadlines"" after talks on the NI Protocol failed to make a breakthrough. Maros Å efÄoviÄ was speaking after a meeting in Brussels with the UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. He added if political goodwill was maintained it could ""lead to a timely agreement on durable solutions"". Mrs Truss said there had been ""progress"" and she wants to work with the EU ""in short order"". ""We're putting as much resource as we can into making this work and making things happen for the people of Northern Ireland,"" she added. In a joint statement, the lead negotiators said they would hold further talks next week. They added that the Joint Committee, the formal body overseeing the protocol, would meet before the end of February. That will be the first Joint Committee meeting in more than six months. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is acting as lead negotiator for the first time since replacing Lord Frost Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney described the mood of the talks as ""quite good"" and welcomed the foreign secretary's ""personal engagement."" ""We need to show a bit of patience here and allow the negotiating teams to try to advance areas where they can find agreement,"" he said. He added that the Joint Committee meeting in February could create a ""platform for agreement"". Liz Truss replaces Lord Frost in post-Brexit talks A simple guide to the Brexit border problem What is Article 16 and why does it matter? The protocolkeeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. That means new paperwork and processes when importing materials and equipment from Great Britain. Unionist politicians have criticised the arrangements and say the Irish Sea border undermines Northern Ireland's position in the UK. Over the past six months the UK government has been attempting to renegotiate the deal. In July, the UK proposed an arrangement in which goods from Great Britain, which are due to stay in Northern Ireland, would not be checked and would have minimal paperwork. Goods which are due to move onwards to the Republic of Ireland would be checked at Northern Ireland's ports. The EU published its own proposals in October, which it said would significantly reduce, but not eliminate, checks on goods. It has previously said that the easiest way to reduce checks would be for the UK to sign up to a Swiss-style agri-food agreement. That would involve all of the UK following the relevant EU rules, something the government says it could not accept. What is Article 16 and why does it matter?

"Covid testing rules are to be eased for double-vaccinated people travelling to England, the government says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the changes will come into force on 11 February Passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arrival or to self isolate Travel industry bosses have welcomed the change, saying they hope demand for holidays will soar The chief executive of Airlines UK says it ""brings international travel towards near-normality for the fully vaccinated"" Covid restrictions introduced to tackle Omicron are eased in Scotland, meaning nightclubs and large indoor events can return In France, adults must show a pass proving they are vaccinated to visit cafes, restaurants and cinemas - negative tests are no longer enough Welsh care providers say they could employ unvaccinated workers whoâve left their jobs under NHS England's mandatory vaccination policy Edited by James Clarke That's all for today - our coverage has been brought to you by Chris Giles, Alex Kleiderman, Jack Hunter, Claire Heald and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus updates tomorrow. We're wrapping up our live coverage for the day shortly, here's a reminder of the key Covid stories we've been covering: The transport secretary has indicated he is committed to simplifying the UK's passenger locator form filled out by travellers ahead of their journey. In a question to Grant Shapps, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw says the form is a ""massive irritant"", being longer than the EU equivalent and ""very complicated"". Speaking in the Commons after announcing changes to the testing rules, Shapps said: ""I entirely agree with him about the complexity of the passenger locator form."" From 11 February, fully-vaccinated arrivals to England will need to verify their status via a passenger locator form but will not have to be tested. People who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. It's been all about alterations to travel rules this afternoon but some other measures have been changing too. Some restrictions in Scotland introduced in response to the Omicron variant were eased earlier today. Crowd limits on large indoor events have been lifted - but people are still being asked to work from home and take lateral flow tests before meeting others. Meanwhile, England is due to ease some of its own rules over the next week. So what are the rules in place  across the UK? Read asummary here. You can also check what the rules are in your area byentering your postcodeor council name in this page. Responding to Grant Shapps' announcement in the Commons on the changes to travel rules, the shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh questioned how the government will deal with future Covid variants. She welcomed the transport secretary's promise to ""develop a full tool box of contingency options to provide more certainty on how we respond against future variants"". Haigh says the government appears to be ""finally"" producing a plan to give the travel industry and the public the certainty they need after a ""chaotic"" approach to date. She says ministers should have provided ""sector-specific support"" to the aviation industry during the pandemic, and says its actions have caused ""uncertainty"" for both passengers and business. Haigh says ministers must publish the data that will guide the decisions it will take to travel if future variants emerge. And she says the public deserve an ""easily understandable plan"" for any future border restrictions. More now on theannouncement to axe Covid tests for fully vaccinated international travellers arriving in Englandfrom next month. Gavin Newlands of the SNP asks Grant Shapps what discussion heâs had with the Scottish government about the new measures that have been announced for England? The transport secretary says he spoke this morning to Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and adds, through the UK Health Security Agency âthe four chief medical officers were involved in studying the data and reaching this conclusionâ. While we've been focusing on the changes to travel rules, the UK's usual daily coronavirus data has been released. Thenew statistics show,externalthat there have been another 88,447 Covid cases, and a further 56 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. And about 85,000 people were vaccinated yesterday, with around half of those being booster jabs. Some 64.2% of eligible people aged 12 and over in the UK have now had a booster jab. The travel industry has beenwelcoming the confirmationthat fully-vaccinated people arriving in England from abroad will no longer have to take Covid tests - but companies involved in testing are suggesting the move is happening too quickly. The Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, says the UK's ability to discover new Covid variants, may be harmed. The organisation's chairman Tom Watson says: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" He adds: ""We believe removing testing completely for international travel would weaken our wall of defence - because testing is the antidote to lockdowns."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the changes mean the UK now has âone of the most open travel sectors in the worldâ. He says while we know Covid can bring surprises, he hopes everybody will now feel confident about booking holidays, business trips and visits to family and friends abroad. Shapps says thatâs because âthe government got the big calls rightâ on vaccination, on boosters and dealing with Omicron. He says thatâs allowed them to âopen travelâ and adds âtoday, we are setting Britain freeâ.   Meanwhile, away from travel, a treasury minister has resigned from the government over its handling of fraudulent Covid business loans. Lord Agnew of Oulton, who was the minister of counter fraud, tells peers ""it would be somewhat dishonest to stay on in that role if I am incapable of doing it properly"". He acknowledges the timing of his move may appear to be connected to the criticism Boris Johnson is currently facing from some Tory MPs - but he stresses it was not an attack on the PM. In December, theNational Audit Office said the government had failed to put adequate measures in placeto prevent fraudsters stealing billions of pounds through its Bounce Back Loan scheme. Lord Agnew said he was unhappy with working between the Department for Business and the Treasury. Downing Street said the government had been clear fraud was ""unacceptable"" and stressed it was taking action against people  abusing the system. The transport secretary says âfor kids travelling to the UKâ, under-18s will continue to be treated as eligible fully vaccinated passengers. Grant Shapps says that means they ""will not face any tests at the UK border"". He says from 3 February 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. Shapps says he hopes the move will help families plan holidays for the February half-term. The transport secretary says passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arrival or to self isolate. Grants Shapps says they will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate a proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post arrival PCR test.   The transport secretary says fully-vaccinated travellers will only need to verify their status via a passenger locator form. Grants Shapps says border testing for vaccinated travellers had ""outlived its usefulness"". He says the move will make travel ""much easier"", save families money and provide certainty for passengers and the industry ahead of the summer season. He adds vaccinations from 16 more countries - including China and Mexico - would be recognised, meaning vaccinated people from 118 nations would be able to enter England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has just announced that from 04:00 on 11 February ""eligible fully vaccinated travellers"" arriving in the UK will no longer have to take a post arrival lateral flow test. Read more here. Transport secretary Grant Shapps has begun updating MPs on travel rules. We'll bring you updates here. As we wait to find out the full details of thegovernmentâs plan to scrap Covid tests for international travellers whoâve been fully vaccinated- letâs hear more from Airlines UK boss Tim Alderslade. The chief executive of the airline industry body has reacted to the PMâs earlier announcement by saying this is âa landmark day for passengers, businesses and UK plc"". ""Nearly two years since the initial Covid restrictions were introduced, today's announcement brings international travel towards near-normality for the fully vaccinated, and at last into line with hospitality and the domestic economy,"" he says. Alderslade hopes itâll offer âfurther reassuranceâ to travellers and demonstrate that, following the success of the vaccine programme, âthe UK can lead the world in our recovery from the pandemicâ. Weâre told Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will make a statement to MPs in about half an hour. Clinics in one part of England are offering quiet hours and women-only sessions to target people who may be hesitant about vaccinations. Female-only staff will deliver Covid-19 jabs to women during ""women's hour"" and ""quiet hour"" will see lights dimmed and noise minimised to attract people who have sensory disabilities or autism. South Worcestershire Healthcare will be running the sessions across the county over the coming week. The provider said a lot of people can be put off from getting their jabs by walk-in clinics.

Despite fears from the Tongan government that foreign workers coming to help the recovery fromlast week's volcanic eruption and tsunamicould trigger a coronavirus outbreak there, a UN official says she thinks they will eventually need to enter the country to speed up the process of delivering aid. Relief supplies have so far been delivered without contact. Katie Greenwood, head of delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross in the Pacific, says ""because of the size of this response...  the government might require additional assistance"". She says her team is âreadyâ to help and will observe âany protocolsâ the Tongan government requires to make sure they don't swap ""one disaster for another in terms of introducing Covid into the country"". More now on thegovernmentâs plans to axe coronavirus tests for fully vaccinated travellersarriving in England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will announce details of the new travel regulations in a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon. But reaction is already coming in, with EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren saying ""millions of our customers"" will be ""delighted to see the return of restriction-free travel in the UK"". Airlines UK chief Tim Alderslade describes it as a âlandmark day for passengers, businesses and UK plcâ and says the change ""brings international travel towards near-normality for the fully vaccinated"". While Christophe Mathieu, chief executive of Brittany Ferries, says the announcement means the company can expect âdemand to soarâ for the February half-term. As
more Covid measures are lifted in Scotland, today marks a significant moment of progress. Large indoor events can resume, social
distancing rules are dropped and more than three households can meet. People are still being asked to work from
home and to take lateral flow tests before meeting others. Lynn Williams from Paisley cares for her
husband, who's shielding with a severe spinal injury. She tellsRadio Scotlandthe easing of
restrictions leaves her feeling anxious: ""Itâs
still pretty risky for many families, and for many of those families we feel weâre
being left behind. ""Thereâs normality returning, but for us that seems actually
like a distant dream."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99999106

""That means that after months of pre-departure testing, post-arrival testing, self-isolation, additional expense, all that fully vaccinated people will now have to do, when they travel to the UK, is to verify their status via a passenger locator form."" Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the measures were ""extremely welcome"" for the tourism and aviation sectors. But he said ""further surveillance"" would be needed across all UK nations to catch variants if they emerged. Dan from Surrey is planning to travel to Italy on a skiing trip with his son in the half term holiday. ""I was geared up for having to do all the tests and the forms that I needed to,"" he says, adding that today's news was ""a welcome change"". ""It's one less thing to worry about,"" he says. ""It's a bit less cost, but also it's a bit less stress. So overall, hopefully we can focus on having a nice holiday instead of worrying about the paperwork."" Dan and his family have only travelled abroad once since the pandemic started, but he hopes that as the rules ease, planning holidays will become more straightforward. ""I'm quite happy there are fewer barriers, it makes me feel more confident going away from that point of view,"" he says. However, safety remains his number one priority: ""If a new variant came along or something changed and the rules had to be revisited, I for one would understand that."" Mr Shapps also confirmed that from 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. It comes after families have struggled to prove their children's vaccination status when trying to enter countries including Spain, Italy and France. Mr Shapps also told MPs the UK is set to recognise vaccine certificates from 16 further nations, including countries like China and Mexico. This will take the total number of recognised countries and territories to 180. The moves were welcomed by the travel and tourism industry, which has been one of the sectors hit hardest by coronavirus lockdown measures. Airline Virgin Atlantic said: ""The removal of all testing for vaccinated passengers is the final step in moving towards frictionless air travel, allowing passengers to reconnect with loved ones and business colleagues. ""It restores customer confidence and demand will be boosted in a critical booking window for the travel industry."" Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said the airline would ""now look ahead to what we believe will be a strong summer"". He said: ""It is clear travel restrictions did not materially slow the spread of Omicron in the UK and so it is important that there are no more knee jerk reactions to future variants."" However, the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, warned rules had been lifted too quickly. Its chairman Tom Watson said: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" What are the travel rules? Covid test firm urges end to tests for travellers Currently, fully vaccinated passengers, who have had two doses (or one dose of the Janssen vaccine), and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK. However, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over -  or 11 and over in Scotland - must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test. If they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result. Vaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK. But Mr Shapps said the form, which had been ""complex and difficult to navigate"", would now be made simpler and travellers would have an extra day to fill it in. Earlier in January, the government scrapped the need for fully vaccinated travellers coming to England to take a Covid test before they travel. However, arrivals who are not fully vaccinated must take a pre-departure test and two post-arrival PCR tests, which are more expensive than the lateral flow version. They must also self-isolate for 10 days. Are your journey plans affected by the removal of Covid travel tests in England?  Share your stories by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Covid testing rules are to be eased for double-vaccinated people travelling to England, the government says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the changes will come into force on 11 February Passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arrival or to self isolate Travel industry bosses have welcomed the change, saying they hope demand for holidays will soar The chief executive of Airlines UK says it ""brings international travel towards near-normality for the fully vaccinated"" Covid restrictions introduced to tackle Omicron are eased in Scotland, meaning nightclubs and large indoor events can return In France, adults must show a pass proving they are vaccinated to visit cafes, restaurants and cinemas - negative tests are no longer enough Welsh care providers say they could employ unvaccinated workers whoâve left their jobs under NHS England's mandatory vaccination policy Edited by James Clarke That's all for today - our coverage has been brought to you by Chris Giles, Alex Kleiderman, Jack Hunter, Claire Heald and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus updates tomorrow. We're wrapping up our live coverage for the day shortly, here's a reminder of the key Covid stories we've been covering: The transport secretary has indicated he is committed to simplifying the UK's passenger locator form filled out by travellers ahead of their journey. In a question to Grant Shapps, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw says the form is a ""massive irritant"", being longer than the EU equivalent and ""very complicated"". Speaking in the Commons after announcing changes to the testing rules, Shapps said: ""I entirely agree with him about the complexity of the passenger locator form."" From 11 February, fully-vaccinated arrivals to England will need to verify their status via a passenger locator form but will not have to be tested. People who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. It's been all about alterations to travel rules this afternoon but some other measures have been changing too. Some restrictions in Scotland introduced in response to the Omicron variant were eased earlier today. Crowd limits on large indoor events have been lifted - but people are still being asked to work from home and take lateral flow tests before meeting others. Meanwhile, England is due to ease some of its own rules over the next week. So what are the rules in place  across the UK? Read asummary here. You can also check what the rules are in your area byentering your postcodeor council name in this page. Responding to Grant Shapps' announcement in the Commons on the changes to travel rules, the shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh questioned how the government will deal with future Covid variants. She welcomed the transport secretary's promise to ""develop a full tool box of contingency options to provide more certainty on how we respond against future variants"". Haigh says the government appears to be ""finally"" producing a plan to give the travel industry and the public the certainty they need after a ""chaotic"" approach to date. She says ministers should have provided ""sector-specific support"" to the aviation industry during the pandemic, and says its actions have caused ""uncertainty"" for both passengers and business. Haigh says ministers must publish the data that will guide the decisions it will take to travel if future variants emerge. And she says the public deserve an ""easily understandable plan"" for any future border restrictions. More now on theannouncement to axe Covid tests for fully vaccinated international travellers arriving in Englandfrom next month. Gavin Newlands of the SNP asks Grant Shapps what discussion heâs had with the Scottish government about the new measures that have been announced for England? The transport secretary says he spoke this morning to Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and adds, through the UK Health Security Agency âthe four chief medical officers were involved in studying the data and reaching this conclusionâ. While we've been focusing on the changes to travel rules, the UK's usual daily coronavirus data has been released. Thenew statistics show,externalthat there have been another 88,447 Covid cases, and a further 56 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. And about 85,000 people were vaccinated yesterday, with around half of those being booster jabs. Some 64.2% of eligible people aged 12 and over in the UK have now had a booster jab. The travel industry has beenwelcoming the confirmationthat fully-vaccinated people arriving in England from abroad will no longer have to take Covid tests - but companies involved in testing are suggesting the move is happening too quickly. The Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, says the UK's ability to discover new Covid variants, may be harmed. The organisation's chairman Tom Watson says: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" He adds: ""We believe removing testing completely for international travel would weaken our wall of defence - because testing is the antidote to lockdowns."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the changes mean the UK now has âone of the most open travel sectors in the worldâ. He says while we know Covid can bring surprises, he hopes everybody will now feel confident about booking holidays, business trips and visits to family and friends abroad. Shapps says thatâs because âthe government got the big calls rightâ on vaccination, on boosters and dealing with Omicron. He says thatâs allowed them to âopen travelâ and adds âtoday, we are setting Britain freeâ.   Meanwhile, away from travel, a treasury minister has resigned from the government over its handling of fraudulent Covid business loans. Lord Agnew of Oulton, who was the minister of counter fraud, tells peers ""it would be somewhat dishonest to stay on in that role if I am incapable of doing it properly"". He acknowledges the timing of his move may appear to be connected to the criticism Boris Johnson is currently facing from some Tory MPs - but he stresses it was not an attack on the PM. In December, theNational Audit Office said the government had failed to put adequate measures in placeto prevent fraudsters stealing billions of pounds through its Bounce Back Loan scheme. Lord Agnew said he was unhappy with working between the Department for Business and the Treasury. Downing Street said the government had been clear fraud was ""unacceptable"" and stressed it was taking action against people  abusing the system. The transport secretary says âfor kids travelling to the UKâ, under-18s will continue to be treated as eligible fully vaccinated passengers. Grant Shapps says that means they ""will not face any tests at the UK border"". He says from 3 February 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. Shapps says he hopes the move will help families plan holidays for the February half-term. The transport secretary says passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arrival or to self isolate. Grants Shapps says they will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate a proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post arrival PCR test.   The transport secretary says fully-vaccinated travellers will only need to verify their status via a passenger locator form. Grants Shapps says border testing for vaccinated travellers had ""outlived its usefulness"". He says the move will make travel ""much easier"", save families money and provide certainty for passengers and the industry ahead of the summer season. He adds vaccinations from 16 more countries - including China and Mexico - would be recognised, meaning vaccinated people from 118 nations would be able to enter England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has just announced that from 04:00 on 11 February ""eligible fully vaccinated travellers"" arriving in the UK will no longer have to take a post arrival lateral flow test. Read more here. Transport secretary Grant Shapps has begun updating MPs on travel rules. We'll bring you updates here. As we wait to find out the full details of thegovernmentâs plan to scrap Covid tests for international travellers whoâve been fully vaccinated- letâs hear more from Airlines UK boss Tim Alderslade. The chief executive of the airline industry body has reacted to the PMâs earlier announcement by saying this is âa landmark day for passengers, businesses and UK plc"". ""Nearly two years since the initial Covid restrictions were introduced, today's announcement brings international travel towards near-normality for the fully vaccinated, and at last into line with hospitality and the domestic economy,"" he says. Alderslade hopes itâll offer âfurther reassuranceâ to travellers and demonstrate that, following the success of the vaccine programme, âthe UK can lead the world in our recovery from the pandemicâ. Weâre told Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will make a statement to MPs in about half an hour. Clinics in one part of England are offering quiet hours and women-only sessions to target people who may be hesitant about vaccinations. Female-only staff will deliver Covid-19 jabs to women during ""women's hour"" and ""quiet hour"" will see lights dimmed and noise minimised to attract people who have sensory disabilities or autism. South Worcestershire Healthcare will be running the sessions across the county over the coming week. The provider said a lot of people can be put off from getting their jabs by walk-in clinics. Read more here. Despite fears from the Tongan government that foreign workers coming to help the recovery fromlast week's volcanic eruption and tsunamicould trigger a coronavirus outbreak there, a UN official says she thinks they will eventually need to enter the country to speed up the process of delivering aid. Relief supplies have so far been delivered without contact. Katie Greenwood, head of delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross in the Pacific, says ""because of the size of this response...  the government might require additional assistance"". She says her team is âreadyâ to help and will observe âany protocolsâ the Tongan government requires to make sure they don't swap ""one disaster for another in terms of introducing Covid into the country"". More now on thegovernmentâs plans to axe coronavirus tests for fully vaccinated travellersarriving in England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will announce details of the new travel regulations in a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon. But reaction is already coming in, with EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren saying ""millions of our customers"" will be ""delighted to see the return of restriction-free travel in the UK"". Airlines UK chief Tim Alderslade describes it as a âlandmark day for passengers, businesses and UK plcâ and says the change ""brings international travel towards near-normality for the fully vaccinated"". While Christophe Mathieu, chief executive of Brittany Ferries, says the announcement means the company can expect âdemand to soarâ for the February half-term. As
more Covid measures are lifted in Scotland, today marks a significant moment of progress. Large indoor events can resume, social
distancing rules are dropped and more than three households can meet. People are still being asked to work from
home and to take lateral flow tests before meeting others. Lynn Williams from Paisley cares for her
husband, who's shielding with a severe spinal injury. She tellsRadio Scotlandthe easing of
restrictions leaves her feeling anxious: ""Itâs
still pretty risky for many families, and for many of those families we feel weâre
being left behind. ""Thereâs normality returning, but for us that seems actually
like a distant dream."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,4.974797e-05
"This video can not be played ""We should have prioritised that request for resources"" Police have been criticised over their handling of a riot which broke out in Swansea, in an independent review that said residents were left ""unprotected"". Cars were burnt and windows smashed in the Mayhill area after a vigil to a young man who had died turned violent. Ethan Powell's father Jonathan Russlater condemned those who rioted at his son's vigilin May 2021, calling them ""scumbags"". South Wales Police has now apologised for its slow response. Seven police officers were injuredand37 people were arrestedon suspicion of unlawful violence following the disturbances. A joint review between Swansea council, South Wales Police and its Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) was led by a panel made up of chairwoman Prof Elwen Evans QC, police expert Martin Jones, and local government consultant Jack Straw. What do we know about Mayhill - the scene of the riot? The report found a senior officer on the ground that night requested support from specialist public order officers but was twice denied it. The officer was so frustrated, he had to go outside the chain of command to authorise support but it was too late. South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Mark Travis said confusion led to the request being denied. ""There were competing demands on the night, but the main reason is a lack of clarity about information,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Drive. ""We've put measures in place to make sure it's a far more straight process. We had sufficient resources but didn't use them efficiently."" This video can not be played Adam Romain pleads for police help as his children scream during riot In its conclusions, the panel said: ""Despite the absence of a full investigation, it is clear to the panel that significant failings are evident throughout this event. ""Currently available evidence strongly suggests failings in command structures and decisions, operational decisions and tactics, and communications."" The report continued: ""The full extent of these failings and explanations for any failings can only be determined by a forensic investigation. ""All of the available evidence shows clearly that the residents of Waun Wen Road, Mayhill were left unprotected for a significant period of time on the 20 May 2021. ""Further analysis will not alter this fact, but should address more completely the question 'Why?'."" The panel heard from residents who said they felt terrorised in their own homes and abandoned by the police. It said: ""There was evident raw emotion and distress in the re-living of experiences of that night and its aftermath. ""Some of the views shared with us include the following: 'the police let us down'; 'they didn't protect us'; 'they failed to protect us'; 'they weren't there for us when we needed them'; and 'we don't understand why they didn't do anything'."" The report also said while there were no fatalities or serious physical injury, ""the criminal behaviours on that night presented a significant threat to life and to property"". The Mayhill street looked ""like a war zone"", one of the residents said A number of factors may have contributed to the riot, the panel said, including ""the effects of Covid lockdowns, social media narratives, criminal behaviours, socio-economic dynamics, and reactions to the tragic death of Ethan Powell"". The challenges facing local authorities and policing agencies were called ""exceptional and unprecedented"". It also said any assessment of the riot ""must start with a recognition that criminal responsibility sits with the adults and young people who committed criminal offences"". But it added it was clear there was ""significant"" work to be done by police to re-establish trust and confidence following the incident. South Wales Police Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said: ""I want to apologise to all those who have been affected by this incident and particularly those local residents who were tormented by those responsible. ""We failed to take action quickly enough on the night and for that I am truly sorry."" Assistant Chief Constable Mark Travis told BBC Radio Wales the force aimed to rebuild trust within the community. He said: ""We will spend time [there], be visible, hear them and make sure that we respond to those needs. ""It's important to note there were 37 people that went out with criminal intent and part of the closure for the community is bringing those people that damaged the community are brought to justice"" A criminal investigation into the rioting is ongoing. A file has been submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and charging decisions are expected shortly, the force added. An inquest into Ethan Powell's death is set to take place later this month.

"Anest was born with a heart defect and was entering heart failure at three weeks old A mother whose baby daughter had open heart surgery in England wants treatments to be offered in Wales. Two years on, Elin, from Ceredigion, worries her family will re-live the ""horrific experience"" in future. Under-16s have had to travel to England for heart surgery since 1998. The Welsh government said children are treated across the border where there's ""higher levels of specialism in dealing with these complex conditions"". Heart ops outside Wales cut lists 'I'm ecstatic I got such an amazing gift of a heart' Child heart surgery fight goes on On Christmas Eve 2019, Elin and Emyr's daughter, Anest, was taken by air ambulance from Aberystwyth to Noah's Ark Children Hospital in Cardiff. She was born with holes in her heart and, at three weeks old, doctors told her parents she was entering heart failure. Anest was put on life support and following a ""traumatic few weeks"", her condition deteriorated further when she contracted a virus. She was then transferred to Bristol for heart surgery. ""It's quite horrific [thinking back]. I try not to think about it if I'm honest. It really has been put to the back of my mind,"" said Elin. ""We live in rural Ceredigion, so Cardiff is a long way away to start with, without travelling again to Bristol, so yes it was a traumatic experience for us."" The care they received was excellent, she added, but facing surgery across the border was ""a challenge"". ""We'd been in Cardiff for around a month, so we knew the hospital, we knew the staff, the doctors of course. But then we had to start from new in Bristol,"" she said. ""Getting to know a new hospital, new doctors, so it was extra stress really on top of what was a traumatic experience to start off with."" Last year, almost 200 children from Wales had heart surgery in Bristol, and many patients in north Wales travelled to hospitals in Liverpool and Birmingham. With Anest facing further surgery in the future, mum Elin wants cardiology treatments to return to Wales. ""There's an excellent team of cardiologists and expertise in Cardiff, so why not get surgeons involved in that team?"" she said. ""There's definitely a demand for it in Cardiff, and if adults are allowed to have treatment in Wales, in their own country, why aren't children?"" Bridget said the answer is not moving treatment to Wales Bridget's daughter Elain was diagnosed with a rare heart condition as a baby and they have travelled to Bristol many times over the past 11 years. But for Bridget, the answer is not moving treatments to Wales. ""I do feel happy that Elain goes to the surgeon and the team of experts in Bristol,"" she said. ""They understand her condition and I would fear if things changed."" However, as a member of a support group for families who share the same journey, she said there is ""a gap"" in the support available. Elain received heart surgery in 2015 and is still treated in England After almost 12 years, she said it was ""disappointing"" that nothing has changed. ""Many times, we've been faced with tough situations where we've had to travel and be away from home for months, it has been a challenge over the years. ""I just think maybe the government should support families more - travel costs, time off work, the stress it puts on families from all aspects. ""There's a gap in support from that perspective."" GP Dr Graham Thomas, of the Wales Cardiac Network, said cardiac surgery for children was more complex than in adults. He said: ""Children who have complex difficulties with their hearts need to be under expert tertiary centres. ""But, in Wales, there isn't quite enough of the population [who need cardiac surgery] to justify that. ""Also, because of our geography, in north Wales, we use our expertise in Manchester and Liverpool and in the south, in Bristol."" The Welsh government said children needing cardiac surgery require ""higher levels of specialism"" and that centres in England had been established to ""achieve the best outcomes"". ""Whilst health boards in Wales offer access to paediatricians with expertise in cardiology, children requiring cardiac surgery are treated at larger centres where they have higher levels of specialism in dealing with these complex conditions. ""There are only 11 centres in England and they typically provide services for a large area which achieves the best outcomes for patients.""

"The draft online safety bill would not stop the sharing of ""insidious"" images of child abuse and violence against women and girls, MPs have said. The Commons culture committee warned the government its proposed legislation is not clear or robust enough. Content which is currently technically legal, such as deepfake pornography, still needs addressing, they said. But the government said the bill will make the UK ""the safest place in the world to be online"". MPs said the bill's definition of illegal content must be reframed, and more should be done to define the risk around activities that fall below the threshold of criminality but still form part of the sequence for online abuse. They warned violent images including child abuse could still be shared through the practice of ""breadcrumbing"", where perpetrators leave digital hints to indicate they have harmful content to share. Julian Knight, the Conservative chair of the committee, said: ""In its current form what should be world-leading, landmark legislation instead represents a missed opportunity."" Online safety plans need more clarity, says Twitter What's in the Online Safety Bill? ""The Online Safety Bill neither protects freedom of expression nor is it clear nor robust enough to tackle illegal and harmful online content. ""Urgency is required to ensure that some of the most pernicious forms of child sexual abuse do not evade detection because of a failure in the online safety law."" MPs said the government should change the bill to ensure Ofcom had powers to assess whether online platforms were sufficiently considering the right to freedom of expression in their decision making. They raised concerns that a focus on threatening companies with fines could lead to ""excessive takedowns"" of content. This video can not be played Fitness influencer Elle Edwards speaks about dealing with explicit messages and cyber-flashing The MPs' comments come after another report by parliamentarians - published in December - said the draft laws needed to bring more offences into scope, such as cyber-flashing, content promoting self-harm, paid-for scam and fraudulent advertising, and the deliberate sending of flashing images to people with photosensitive epilepsy. Earlier this month, Culture minister Chris Philp told MPs there were a ""number of areas"" where the bill could be ""improved substantially"". But a spokesperson from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said it did not agree with the criticism from the Commons culture committee, saying the bill set a ""global gold standard for internet safety."" ""It has strict measures including a duty of care to stamp out child sexual abuse, grooming and illegal and harmful content,"" they said. ""There are also stringent rules to make sure tech firms and Ofcom protect people's free speech and privacy, so content is not taken down without good reason."" Children's charity the NSPCC said it was ""crucial the bill is tightened to comprehensively respond to the child abuse threat"". ""The legislation needs to unambiguously tackle grooming across multiple platforms, and prevent abusers being able to exploit gaps that allow them to continue to commit and organise abuse in plain sight,"" its chief executive Sir Peter Wanless said. The bill is currently in draft and a revised form is expected within months.

"Covid testing rules are to be eased for double-vaccinated people travelling to England, the government says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the changes will come into force on 11 February Passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arrival or to self isolate Travel industry bosses have welcomed the change, saying they hope demand for holidays will soar The chief executive of Airlines UK says it ""brings international travel towards near-normality for the fully vaccinated"" Covid restrictions introduced to tackle Omicron are eased in Scotland, meaning nightclubs and large indoor events can return In France, adults must show a pass proving they are vaccinated to visit cafes, restaurants and cinemas - negative tests are no longer enough Welsh care providers say they could employ unvaccinated workers whoâve left their jobs under NHS England's mandatory vaccination policy Edited by James Clarke That's all for today - our coverage has been brought to you by Chris Giles, Alex Kleiderman, Jack Hunter, Claire Heald and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus updates tomorrow. We're wrapping up our live coverage for the day shortly, here's a reminder of the key Covid stories we've been covering: The transport secretary has indicated he is committed to simplifying the UK's passenger locator form filled out by travellers ahead of their journey. In a question to Grant Shapps, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw says the form is a ""massive irritant"", being longer than the EU equivalent and ""very complicated"". Speaking in the Commons after announcing changes to the testing rules, Shapps said: ""I entirely agree with him about the complexity of the passenger locator form."" From 11 February, fully-vaccinated arrivals to England will need to verify their status via a passenger locator form but will not have to be tested. People who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. It's been all about alterations to travel rules this afternoon but some other measures have been changing too. Some restrictions in Scotland introduced in response to the Omicron variant were eased earlier today. Crowd limits on large indoor events have been lifted - but people are still being asked to work from home and take lateral flow tests before meeting others. Meanwhile, England is due to ease some of its own rules over the next week. So what are the rules in place  across the UK? Read asummary here. You can also check what the rules are in your area byentering your postcodeor council name in this page. Responding to Grant Shapps' announcement in the Commons on the changes to travel rules, the shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh questioned how the government will deal with future Covid variants. She welcomed the transport secretary's promise to ""develop a full tool box of contingency options to provide more certainty on how we respond against future variants"". Haigh says the government appears to be ""finally"" producing a plan to give the travel industry and the public the certainty they need after a ""chaotic"" approach to date. She says ministers should have provided ""sector-specific support"" to the aviation industry during the pandemic, and says its actions have caused ""uncertainty"" for both passengers and business. Haigh says ministers must publish the data that will guide the decisions it will take to travel if future variants emerge. And she says the public deserve an ""easily understandable plan"" for any future border restrictions. More now on theannouncement to axe Covid tests for fully vaccinated international travellers arriving in Englandfrom next month. Gavin Newlands of the SNP asks Grant Shapps what discussion heâs had with the Scottish government about the new measures that have been announced for England? The transport secretary says he spoke this morning to Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and adds, through the UK Health Security Agency âthe four chief medical officers were involved in studying the data and reaching this conclusionâ. While we've been focusing on the changes to travel rules, the UK's usual daily coronavirus data has been released. Thenew statistics show,externalthat there have been another 88,447 Covid cases, and a further 56 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. And about 85,000 people were vaccinated yesterday, with around half of those being booster jabs. Some 64.2% of eligible people aged 12 and over in the UK have now had a booster jab. The travel industry has beenwelcoming the confirmationthat fully-vaccinated people arriving in England from abroad will no longer have to take Covid tests - but companies involved in testing are suggesting the move is happening too quickly. The Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, says the UK's ability to discover new Covid variants, may be harmed. The organisation's chairman Tom Watson says: ""We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."" He adds: ""We believe removing testing completely for international travel would weaken our wall of defence - because testing is the antidote to lockdowns."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the changes mean the UK now has âone of the most open travel sectors in the worldâ. He says while we know Covid can bring surprises, he hopes everybody will now feel confident about booking holidays, business trips and visits to family and friends abroad. Shapps says thatâs because âthe government got the big calls rightâ on vaccination, on boosters and dealing with Omicron. He says thatâs allowed them to âopen travelâ and adds âtoday, we are setting Britain freeâ.   Meanwhile, away from travel, a treasury minister has resigned from the government over its handling of fraudulent Covid business loans. Lord Agnew of Oulton, who was the minister of counter fraud, tells peers ""it would be somewhat dishonest to stay on in that role if I am incapable of doing it properly"". He acknowledges the timing of his move may appear to be connected to the criticism Boris Johnson is currently facing from some Tory MPs - but he stresses it was not an attack on the PM. In December, theNational Audit Office said the government had failed to put adequate measures in placeto prevent fraudsters stealing billions of pounds through its Bounce Back Loan scheme. Lord Agnew said he was unhappy with working between the Department for Business and the Treasury. Downing Street said the government had been clear fraud was ""unacceptable"" and stressed it was taking action against people  abusing the system. The transport secretary says âfor kids travelling to the UKâ, under-18s will continue to be treated as eligible fully vaccinated passengers. Grant Shapps says that means they ""will not face any tests at the UK border"". He says from 3 February 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. Shapps says he hopes the move will help families plan holidays for the February half-term. The transport secretary says passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arrival or to self isolate. Grants Shapps says they will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate a proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post arrival PCR test.   The transport secretary says fully-vaccinated travellers will only need to verify their status via a passenger locator form. Grants Shapps says border testing for vaccinated travellers had ""outlived its usefulness"". He says the move will make travel ""much easier"", save families money and provide certainty for passengers and the industry ahead of the summer season. He adds vaccinations from 16 more countries - including China and Mexico - would be recognised, meaning vaccinated people from 118 nations would be able to enter England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has just announced that from 04:00 on 11 February ""eligible fully vaccinated travellers"" arriving in the UK will no longer have to take a post arrival lateral flow test. Read more here. Transport secretary Grant Shapps has begun updating MPs on travel rules. We'll bring you updates here. As we wait to find out the full details of thegovernmentâs plan to scrap Covid tests for international travellers whoâve been fully vaccinated- letâs hear more from Airlines UK boss Tim Alderslade. The chief executive of the airline industry body has reacted to the PMâs earlier announcement by saying this is âa landmark day for passengers, businesses and UK plc"". ""Nearly two years since the initial Covid restrictions were introduced, today's announcement brings international travel towards near-normality for the fully vaccinated, and at last into line with hospitality and the domestic economy,"" he says. Alderslade hopes itâll offer âfurther reassuranceâ to travellers and demonstrate that, following the success of the vaccine programme, âthe UK can lead the world in our recovery from the pandemicâ. Weâre told Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will make a statement to MPs in about half an hour. Clinics in one part of England are offering quiet hours and women-only sessions to target people who may be hesitant about vaccinations. Female-only staff will deliver Covid-19 jabs to women during ""women's hour"" and ""quiet hour"" will see lights dimmed and noise minimised to attract people who have sensory disabilities or autism. South Worcestershire Healthcare will be running the sessions across the county over the coming week. The provider said a lot of people can be put off from getting their jabs by walk-in clinics. Read more here. Despite fears from the Tongan government that foreign workers coming to help the recovery fromlast week's volcanic eruption and tsunamicould trigger a coronavirus outbreak there, a UN official says she thinks they will eventually need to enter the country to speed up the process of delivering aid. Relief supplies have so far been delivered without contact. Katie Greenwood, head of delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross in the Pacific, says ""because of the size of this response...  the government might require additional assistance"". She says her team is âreadyâ to help and will observe âany protocolsâ the Tongan government requires to make sure they don't swap ""one disaster for another in terms of introducing Covid into the country"". More now on thegovernmentâs plans to axe coronavirus tests for fully vaccinated travellersarriving in England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will announce details of the new travel regulations in a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon. But reaction is already coming in, with EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren saying ""millions of our customers"" will be ""delighted to see the return of restriction-free travel in the UK"". Airlines UK chief Tim Alderslade describes it as a âlandmark day for passengers, businesses and UK plcâ and says the change ""brings international travel towards near-normality for the fully vaccinated"". While Christophe Mathieu, chief executive of Brittany Ferries, says the announcement means the company can expect âdemand to soarâ for the February half-term. As
more Covid measures are lifted in Scotland, today marks a significant moment of progress. Large indoor events can resume, social
distancing rules are dropped and more than three households can meet. People are still being asked to work from
home and to take lateral flow tests before meeting others. Lynn Williams from Paisley cares for her
husband, who's shielding with a severe spinal injury. She tellsRadio Scotlandthe easing of
restrictions leaves her feeling anxious: ""Itâs
still pretty risky for many families, and for many of those families we feel weâre
being left behind. ""Thereâs normality returning, but for us that seems actually
like a distant dream."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Emad Al Swealmeen was the passenger in a taxi which was destroyed by his bomb New details have emerged about the Liverpool bomber Emad Al Swealmeen's failed asylum attempts - and the false information he used to make his cases. A previously confidential 2015 asylum judgment, released to the BBC, reveals how his claim of being a Syrian refugee lacked basic facts. Al Swealmeen, an Iraqi, lost that case but the Home Office did not remove him before he tried again under a new name. The Home Office will not comment on his case and no review has been announced. It is not clear whether officials spotted his second application from checking his fingerprint records. But the papers raise further questions about why he was not removed from the UK before the attack. Al Swealmeen, 32, was killed when hisbomb went off inside a taxi at Liverpool Women's Hospitalon Remembrance Sunday in November. The driver escaped seconds before the vehicle was engulfed in flames and was taken to hospital, but did not suffer life-threatening injuries. Nobody else was hurt. Bomber made device with murderous intent - coroner Taxi driver 'saw red light on bomber's vest' Miracle I'm alive, says Liverpool bomb taxi driver The fresh details about Al Swealmeen's asylum claim are in the 2015 judgment from the tribunal that rules on appeals against Home Office immigration decisions. It shows how he told obvious lies in an attempt to stay in the UK, and that his application lacked basic facts about his home and the danger he faced. According to the documents, released after legal representations from BBC News, Al Swealmeen arrived in the UK on 30 April 2014 and claimed asylum six days later. He claimed to be fleeing from his native Syria, which was then in the grip of a worsening civil war. But it was all untrue. October 1989: Born in Baghdad December 2013: Applied for a visitor's visa and is fingerprinted April 2014: Arrived and sought asylum November 2014: Rejected and appealed April 2015: Lost appeal August 2015: Lost challenge to that appeal Unknown date in 2017: Applied again under a new name By end of 2020: Lost that second claim January 2021: Lodged another appeal During his interview with a Home Office assessor, Al Swealmeen confirmed he had been living in the United Arab Emirates for 14 years and gave a vague account about returning to Syria to visit family, despite the raging conflict. He said he had then left out of fear for his life, returned to the UAE and flown on to the UK to claim asylum. That flight, on a genuine Jordanian passport, came four months after he had already applied for a UK visa  - meaning that British immigration officials had a copy of his fingerprints before he arrived. When a Home Office asylum case worker questioned Al Swealmeen closely about his travels, he couldn't explain why he had been in danger or describe his purported family's situation in Syria - such as basic facts about the geography of where they lived. An expert in Arabic also analysed Al Swealmeen's speech and concluded he was almost certainly Iraqi. Pictures of the burning car outside the hospital were widely shared on social media Al Swealmeen was housed in Liverpool while he waited for a decision - which came in a rejection letter in November 2014. He then appealed - but did not attend the 2015 hearing in Manchester. He had been detained under the Mental Health Act, after he had been found waving a knife at people in a Liverpool underpass. The judge handling the case concluded that Al Swealmeen's account was straightforward and so lacking in credibility that it could be dealt with immediately. ""His account of his time in Syria gives the impression of someone quoting information that is in the public domain rather than having first-hand experience,"" ruled the judge. ""The appellant did not identify himself with any particular faction or indicate that he would be at risk other than in a general sense. ""In view of all of the evidence, I reject his account of events in Syria and his fears on his return in their entirety and dismiss his asylum appeal."" That conclusion meant the Home Office had the green light to send Al Swealmeen back to Iraq or Jordan, as it had previously warned him it would do. During 2015 and the years that followed, the government was forcibly sending some people back to both countries - but Emad Al Swealmeen was not one of them. Enforced returns were falling during this period as the government pursued its so-called ""hostile environment"" policies designed to encourage people to leave of their own choice. Instead of going, Al Swealmeen tried to appeal again in August 2015, failed, and then joined Liverpool Cathedral's course on the foundations of Christianity, presenting himself as a potential convert. By 2017 he had converted and Malcolm and Elizabeth Hitchcott, a couple who volunteered in the local Christian community, gave him a bed. It's around this time he made a new asylum application under the name Enzo Almeni. As part of that claim, officials would have expected him to volunteer his fingerprints, so they could verify he had not claimed before - but it's not clear whether these checks were carried out. Emad Al Swealmeen (on right in light grey jacket) during a service at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral, alongside the bishop Right Reverend Cyril Ashton The Home Office eventually rejected this second application - but instead of being removed from the UK, Al Swealmeen was yet again able to lodge an appeal in January 2021. That challenge was outstanding when he detonated his homemade bomb. The Home Office has declined to comment on the specific circumstances of Emad Al Swealmeen's case but said it was ""fixing the broken asylum system"" in its current legislation. ""The new plan for immigration will require people to raise all protection-related issues up front, to tackle the practice of making multiple and sequential claims and enable the removal of those with no right to be in our country more quickly,"" said a spokesman.

"Matthew Willson was visiting his girlfriend Katherine Shepard when he was shot The death of an English astrophysicist who was killed by a stray bullet fired through the wall of a US apartment was ""senseless"", his sister has said. Dr Matthew Willson, 31, from Chertsey, Surrey, was found in bed with a single gunshot wound to the head. Police were called to the apartment in Brookhaven, Atlanta, at 02:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on 16 January. Kate Willson said: ""Everyone who knew my brother has lost a wonderful friend."" Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Ms Willson said her brother ""was a joy to be around"". She said she had flown to the US as soon as she heard the news, arriving 36 hours later. ""The bullet had caused too much damage to his brain, he was brain dead, and there was very little chance he was ever going to wake up."" He was later pronounced dead in hospital. Ms Willson said: ""The outpouring of love from everybody who knew Matt from around the world has been a real sign of what a wonderful person he was.""

"The latest easing of the Omicron restrictions is ""a very significant moment"" in the fight against Covid, the deputy first minister has said. For the first time since Boxing Day nightclubs can reopen and crowd limits on large indoor events are lifted. But people are still being asked to work from home and take lateral flow tests before meeting others. John Swinney said the government would continue to take a ""proportionate"" approach to the remaining measures. On Sunday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that ""we're hopefully seeing Scotland firmly on the downward slope"". What are the Covid rules in Scotland? How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? The lifting of many of the remaining restrictions was announced last week following a significant fall in new case numbers. Guidance advising adults against meeting up with more than three households at a time has been dropped, along with restrictions on indoor contact sports. In hospitality, the requirement for 1m physical distancing and table service has now ended, but the vaccine passport scheme remains in force for certain venues. Longer-running measures such as the use of face coverings on public transport, in indoor public places and in secondary schools also remain in place. Mr Swinney welcomed the easing of restrictions that were introduced last month before Scotland experienced record-breaking virus case numbers. But he warned: ""It is too early to say if it is the beginning of the end."" Mr Swinney told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandthat worldwide there remained ""significant challenges"" in the handling of the virus, specifically around the possible emergence of new variants. He also said the Scottish government would continue to take a prudent approach to basic anti-virus measures such as the wearing of face coverings. Nightclubs can reopen as restrictions to tackle the Omicron wave are lifted Mr Swinney added: ""Covid is still out there. We can still see there are thousands of cases on a daily basis within Scotland. ""There are people who are still having a very hard time with Covid and our health service is still enduring the enormous pressures of Covid. ""So Covid has not, in any shape or form, disappeared."" The Omicron variant is now believed to have peaked in the first week of January. The percentage of positive tests has dropped from almost 30% in early January to under 20% . The number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid is also falling. In total, 6,329 positive cases were reported on Sunday with 1,441 patients in hospital. It is down from 7,158 cases a week earlier, with 100 fewer people in hospital. At the weekend Ms Sturgeon defended the continuing vaccine passport scheme, saying it had  helped as part of ""a package of measures"" to protect against transmission. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says case numbers are ""hopefully now... very firmly on the downward slope"" In an interview withthe BBC's Sunday Morning programme, she said: ""I don't underplay the impact of any of these measures on businesses and the night-time industry, but checking Covid certification is a better alternative to being closed."" She said that vaccine passports were ""not causing anybody any real hardship"" and had allowed large events to go ahead. The first minister said she hoped that passports and wearing of facemasks would ""eventually"" come to an end. But she said there would be big ""economic consequences"" if we allowed the virus to spread in an uncontrolled way. Despite restrictions easing, people have been advised to keep social meet-ups small to reduce the risk of infection. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Workers should also continue to work from home where possible. Ministers are due to hold talks with business leaders about a return to a hybrid working approach from February. Ms Sturgeon said the financial impact ofCovid restrictions on business and hospitality had been ""worth it""to stop the spread of Omicron. She told the programme: ""It is not a case of having protective measures and businesses are damaged, or having no proactive measures and everything is fine. ""It is the difference between having protective measures that stem transmission, or allowing transmission to go completely uncontrolled - in which case the impact on business is even greater and even more damaging."" The lifting of restrictions was welcomed by business groups.

"A Ukrainian civilian takes part in a training exercise - Russian forces have been mounting at the border Britain has started withdrawing staff from its embassy in Ukraine, amid growing fears of a Russian invasion. Officials say there have been no specific threats to British diplomats, but about half of the staff working in Kyiv will return to the UK. The US has ordered relatives of its embassy staff to leave, saying an invasion could come ""at any time"". Russia has denied plans for military action, but tens of thousands of troops have amassed on the border. The embassy moves were described as precautionary, and nothing specific is thought to have occurred in the past 24 hours to have triggered the decisions of the US and UK. EU staff in Ukraine will stay in place for now, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell saying he would not ""dramatise"" the tensions. Members of the Nato alliance, including Denmark, Spain, Bulgaria and the Netherlands, are sending more fighter jets and warships to Eastern Europe to bolster defences in the region. With an estimated 100,000 Russian troops now at the border with Ukraine, the head of Nato has warned there is a risk of fresh conflict in Europe. The US also told non-essential staff they could leave Ukraine, stressing its moves were not an evacuation. But the State Department told AFP news agency that if there was a Russian invasion, it  would ""not be in a position to evacuate US citizens"". Americans have also been warned by officials not to travel to Ukraine and Russia due to the ""potential for harassment"" against them. Ukraine said it was ""premature"" of the US to withdraw relatives of staff, calling the decision ""a display of excessive caution"". EXPLAINED:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? FROM KYIV:Ukrainians wait as Russia faces off with the West FROM BRUSSELS:Europe 'closest to war' in decades UK SUPPORT:UK says it is sending weapons to defend Ukraine On Saturday, some 90 tonnes of US ""lethal aid""including ammunition for ""front-line defenders"" arrived in Ukraine. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the government was putting together a ""series of actions that would figure into [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin's calculus"" including beefing up defences in Ukraine with more military assistance. Russia has seized Ukrainian territory before, when it annexed Crimea in 2014, following fierce protests in Ukraine that toppled the country's pro-Russian president. Russian forces seized control of Crimea before the territory voted to join Russia in a referendum the West and Ukraine deemed illegal. Russian-backed rebels control areas of eastern Ukraine near Russia's borders in a conflict which has cost an estimated 14,000 lives. A 2015 peace deal is far from being fulfilled. On Sunday, the UK Foreign Office accused Mr Putin ofplanning to install a pro-Moscow figure to lead Ukraine's government. The man named by the UK Foreign Office - former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev - called the claims ""stupid"" in an interview with Reuters news agency. UK ministers have warned that the Russian government will face serious consequences if there is an incursion. US officials said they were concerned that Russia could try to topple and replace the Ukraine government but declined to comment on the UK accusation.

"Phase 2b will bring HS2 to Manchester The government and business will herald a ""landmark moment"" in improving the North West's rail connections on Monday when the bill to extend HS2 to Manchester is laid in Parliament. Phase 2b of the high-speed line will cut journey times by 55 minutes from London to Manchester, ministers say. The bill laid on Monday seeks powers to lay new track and build new stations. Work is under way on phase one of HS2 between London and Birmingham. It is set to open between 2029 and 2033. The next section will extend the line to Crewe, with the final phase taking HS2 to Manchester - with that part of the line expected to open between 2035 and 2040. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""We are determined to improve transport connections and level up communities across the country, and this bill marks a landmark moment as we bring HS2 to Manchester and lay the foundations for Northern Powerhouse Rail."" HS2 rail extension to Leeds scrapped What is HS2 and where will it go? Vast Roman settlement found by HS2 archaeologists HS2 Ltd, the organisation delivering the railway, said phase 2b would deliver ""significant connectivity, reliability and journey time benefits"" for passengers travelling between Scotland, the North, the Midlands and the South East. Among other things, the 52-mile route includes new high-speed stations at Manchester Airport and Manchester Piccadilly. It will also provide the infrastructure required for Northern Powerhouse Rail - a new high-speed line between Warrington, Manchester and Marsden in Yorkshire Some 17,500 construction jobs are expected to be created, HS2 limited said. ""HS2 has an integral role to play in levelling up and rebalancing Britain's economy, and this extension of the network fuels that role by bringing the country's economic centres in the North and Midlands closer together,"" HS2 Ltd boss Mark Thurston said. ""Construction of the first phase of HS2 is already supporting over 20,000 jobs and spearheading investment and growth in major population centres along the route,"" he added. ""This bill is a vote of confidence in HS2's ability to help towns and cities in the North realise their economic potential."" In November, the government sparked outrage when it scrapped the planned extension of HS2 from East Midlands Parkway to Leeds. Instead it promised to deliver similar benefits, faster and more cheaply, through its scaled back Integrated Rail Plan. However, business leaders in the Midlands and North accused the government of reneging on its investment promises, noting many journey times would now be slower than under the previous proposals.
