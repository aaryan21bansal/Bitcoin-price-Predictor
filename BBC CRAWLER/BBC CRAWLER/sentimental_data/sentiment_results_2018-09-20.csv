"The 'cat killer' was thought to have been behind the death of Missy, who went missing in Coulsdon in December 2015 The so-called Croydon cat killer does not exist, the Metropolitan Police has confirmed. The force launched an investigation in 2015 into reports of mutilated cats in Croydon and the surrounding area. Twenty-five post-mortem examinations were carried out but found no evidence of ""human involvement"". Scotland Yard said injuries inflicted on cats were ""likely to be the result of predation or scavenging by wildlife on cats killed in vehicle collisions"". Foxes are believed to be behind some of the mutilations. During the probe, detectives received more than 400 similar reports of cats being mutilated across London and surrounding counties. However, all of the cases will now be recorded as ""no crime"". Ukiyo's remains were found on a neighbour's doorstep in West Norwood in September 2015 Commander Amanda Pearson said each individual report had to be investigated, which led to an ""increased workload"" for officers working on the case. ""The decision was made to allocate a large number of similar reports of mutilated cats to the officers who were investigating the initial spate of such allegations,"" she said. Latest news and stories from London ""In particular, they were following up six suspicious cases identified by the post-mortem examinations. ""It is this collating of reports that enabled officers to work with experts and reach the conclusion that no further police investigations are required into any of the allegations relating to mutilated cats."" The cat killer stalking suburbia 'Croydon cat killer': Animals lured with raw chicken Five Northampton cat deaths linked to 'Croydon cat killer' probe The Met's inquiry found there was CCTV footage showing foxes carrying pet body parts in three cases. Dr Henny Martineau, head of veterinary forensic pathology at the Royal Veterinary College, carried out post-mortems on the six cats whose deaths were initially treated as ""suspicious"". She found puncture wounds not previously uncovered on some of the animals and concluded some had been potentially scavenged. Police started investigating the animal killings in 2015 Ch Insp Stuart Orton from Hertfordshire Police, which led a linked investigation, said the prospect of ""a person or persons travelling the country and mutilating animals"" had been ""eliminated"". ""Evidence suggests the animals had been predated by foxes - in a rabbit's case after being removed from a hutch, and in a cat's case after death, likely caused by a road traffic collision,"" he said. ""I hope this conclusion brings comfort to pet owners who have, up until now, been frightened to let their animals out at night."" Boudicca Rising, of Snarl, has investigated cat deaths alongside police The Met worked alongside the RSPCA and Croydon-based group South Norwood Animal Rescue Liberty (Snarl). Despite police saying ""there were no witnesses, no identifiable patterns and no forensic leads that pointed to human involvement"",  Snarl released a statement saying it was ""surprised"" by the announcement. It said: ""We consider that the evidence we have gathered over the last three years does indicate human involvement and there is expert opinion to back this up."" At one point during the three-year investigation a Â£10,000 reward was offered for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for mutilations in Greater London, Surrey, Kent, Manchester, Birmingham, St Albans and Northamptonshire. Ivy was found dead and her body was kept in a freezer so it could be re-examined One cat owner, Naomi, spoke to the BBC about finding her cat Ivy'sdecapitated body discarded by the side of a road in Northamptonshire. ""I was very emotional. I couldn't stop crying,"" she said. Although she searched for Ivy's head, she wasn't able to find it. Naomi had to take three weeks off work with depression and anxiety and said she struggled with nightmares and interrupted sleep. Ivy's death had ""caused so much pain, and a feeling of anger"", she added. The Met urged people to report cases, where there is no direct evidence of human involvement, to the RSPCA.

"Most people are trying their best to recycle plastic - but the many different ways in which recycling is collected by councils across the UK has left them confused over what can be recycled and what can't. New plans on howplastic is recycledin England are being put forward by the government. In the rest of the UK, the strategy for recycling is a devolved issue. Each council collects its plastic recycling differently. BBC analysis shows there are 39 different sets of rules for what can be put in plastic recycling collections: Most collect bottles Others collect pots, tubs and trays Some collect a much wider range Around the UK, all four nations are hoping to improve their recycling rates. The review sticks to the aim that 50% of waste will be recycled by 2020 and aims to recycle three quarters of plastic packaging by 2035. Scotland has a target to recycle 70% of waste by 2025, as does Wales. Northern Ireland has a proposal that 60% of municipal waste is recycled by 2020. Waste plastic is collected in different ways too: Some local authorities collect all their recycling in one bin Others ask households to separate their plastics from the rest of their recycling Councils also employ many different companies to collect and sort their plastics. And having different recycling schemes in different areas - for example, in some areas you can recycle margarine tubs and in other areas you cannot - makes labelling difficult. Five ways to break up with plastic Giant plastic catcher heads for ocean clean-up Swindon council's plan to stop plastic recycling 'concerning' Most people in Britain regularly recycle plastic but almost half have had disagreements at home about what type they can put in which bin, a ComRes poll for the BBC suggests. And more than a quarter have these disagreements at least once a month. How is the government proposing to tackle plastic recycling? Tackle the current postcode recycling lottery under which different materials are recyclable in different areas Introduce consistent labelling on packaging so consumers know what they can recycle Make the firms that produce materials responsible for the cost of disposing of those items Encourage manufacturers to design products that last longer and increase the levels of repair and re-use Crack down on waste crime by introducing electronic tracking of waste shipments Introduce a tax on plastic packaging made of less than 30% recycled plastic Ban plastic packaging where an alternative material could be used Improve the quality of plastic being exported Plastic can often become too contaminated for recycling and have to be sent to landfill or incinerated instead. This happens for several reasons: People are confused about what goes in which bin People are not always very careful about what they put in The plastic is contaminated with food waste In areas where all recycling is collected in one bin, one type of waste can contaminate another Bottles are mainly made of PET and HDPE and these are easy to collect and recycle Most trays are made from polypropylene and this is pretty easy to recycle too but not all councils have access to the right facilities LDPE, used to make some carrier bags and cling film, is easy to process but more difficult to sort and can often be contaminated with food Polystyrene, used to make some yoghurt pots and plastic cutlery, is not widely recycled PVC makes up small amount of packaging but can contaminate other plastic recycling Biscuit wrappers and meat trays can be made from a mixture of many different types of plastic, making them the most difficult type of packaging to recycle All plastic can be recycled - but it is not always economical to do so. Bottles attract the best prices, especially clear ones, which is why almost all councils recycle them Coloured plastic is less desirable because the colour cannot be removed, restricting its reuse Polystyrene is almost never recycled because there is no market for it Most bottles will be sent for reprocessing in this country. But plastic that is less valuable - about two-thirds collected for recycling - goes overseas and this figure has been rising. Earlier this year, the National Audit Office reported the plastic sent abroad could be highly contaminated, meaning it may not be reprocessed and could end up in landfill or contributing to pollution. Some countries are refusing to take any more of our waste. China, Malaysia, and Vietnam have banned waste imports Thailand will introduce a ban in 2021 These bans are having an effect on the prices paid for waste plastic. And this year the prices of the more contaminated plastics have fallen below zero, meaning companies are now expecting to be paid to take them away. Design: Debie Loizou. Development: Eleanor Keane.

"This video can not be played Bassist Theo Ellis recalled the band's first ever label meeting in their acceptance speech Indie band Wolf Alice have picked up the 2018 Mercury Prize for their eclectic, enchanting second album, Visions of a Life. The London four-piece were almost lost for words as they took to the stage to accept the Â£25,000 prize. ""It means so much to pick this up with my three best friends,"" said singer Ellie Rowsell. The group beat the likes of Noel Gallagher, Arctic Monkeys and Lily Allen to lift the trophy. They also saw off the bookies' favourite, Nadine Shah, whose third album, Holiday Destination, explores her experiences as a second-generation immigrant, and the UK's attitudes to refugees. But the 31-year-old, who was born to Pakistani and Norwegian parents and raised in Whitburn, South Tyneside, stole the televised prize ceremony with a fierce and passionate performance of the song Out The Way. Visions of a Life was praised by judges as ""an exuberant tapestry of swirling pop, grunge and indie guitar rock."" The band put their appeal more idiosyncratically: ""We're too pop for rock and too rock for pop."" In fact, their second album built on the promise of their debut My Love Is Cool (which also received a Mercury nomination) cementing their status as future festival headliners with a hypnotic jumble of grunge, dream-pop and shoegaze stoner rock. The songs coalesce around Rowsell, an enigmatic frontwoman who can switch from a shy ingÃ©nue (Don't Delete The Kisses) to a screaming, vengeful She-Ra (Yuk Foo) without pretence or artifice. As it happened; Wolf Alice win the Mercury Prize Wolf Alice interview: 'Our album is like hummus' Mercury Prize 2018: Guide to the nominees The 26-year-old was a Mercury Prize judge in 2016, and said that made her band's victory all the more meaningful. ""You get given almost 300 albums -  so I know the intensity and the frustration of  making that decision,"" she said backstage, adding: ""Now I know what overwhelmed feels like.""

Earlier, the band's bassist Theo Ellis said he felt vindicated after the band faced years of rejection from record companies. ""The first label meeting we ever had, we walked into a room, and the geezer said, 'You don't look like a band at all. What are you? What are you supposed to be? All your songs sound different. You don't look like each other.' ""We never really figured it out, but here we are,"" he added. The group said they would invest their prize money in building a studio to record their third album next year. Other nominees for the 2018 Mercury Prize included jazz act Sons of Kemet, London MC Novelist and up-and-coming soul star Jorja Smith. But there had been criticism that this year's list favoured mainstream, commercial artists at the expense of newcomers who needed exposure. This video can not be played Mercury Prize 2018: Watch the nominees in action Wolf Alice's victory strikes a happy medium between the two extremes; with a record that was popular enough to reach number two in the charts, but was overlooked in the best album category at this year's Brit Awards. ""These kind of things can never please everybody,"" said Rowsell. ""The last time we were nominated, I hardly recognised most of the list, and this [year's] list was far more well known. ""It's nice to champion lesser-known and smaller artists, but there's plenty of other ways of doing that."" ""I don't think the award has any duty to any one sector of the industry or the other,"" said Jeremy Pritchard, bass player for fellow nominees Everything Everything. ""Contrariness is part of its identity."" Everything Everything were also two-time nominees for the prize and stressed that even being featured on the shortlist could change a young band's career. ""Our first nomination gave us some longevity. It gave us a kick at that stage of our career when we needed it most.""

"Judge Kavanaugh is accused of sexually assaulting a woman in the 1980s, when they were both teenagers. A woman who accuses Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh of trying to rape her in 1982 has offered to testify to the Senate if it can ""ensure her safety"". Christine Blasey Ford's lawyer says her client will not appear on Monday, as senators proposed, but might do so next week on ""terms that are fair"". Republicans had vowed to press ahead with the confirmation amid uncertainty over whether the accuser would testify. Judge Kavanaugh has issued a fresh rebuttal of the allegation. The truth about false assault accusations Kavanaugh accuser 'faces death threats' Could Kavanaugh confirmation be derailed? Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley welcomed Prof Ford's offer. This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out ""We are happy that Dr Ford's attorneys are now engaging with the Committee,"" his spokesperson told US media. Thursday's development came on the eve ofa Republican-set deadlinefor Prof Ford to decide whether she would give evidence. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has agreed to testify to the judiciary committee, which vets Supreme Court nominees, on Monday. ""Since the moment I first heard the allegation,"" he said in a statement on Thursday, ""I have categorically and unequivocally denied it. I remain committed to defending my integrity."" The California psychology lecturer's legal team emailed the panel's staff on Thursday. Debra Katz, the lawyer, wrote that she wished to ""discuss the conditions under which [Prof Ford] would be prepared to testify next week"". ""As you are aware, she's been receiving death threats which have been reported to the FBI and she and her family have been forced out of their home."" This video can not be played Alumni of Ford's school: 'We believe her' She continued: ""She wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety."" But she ruled out any testimony next Monday, calling the date ""arbitrary"". The attorney said her client would prefer to wait for the FBI to investigate the accusation before agreeing to testify. But US President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have already ruled that out. The FBI investigated a sexual harassment claim against a Supreme Court nominee in 1991 at the behest of the White House, finishing that inquiry in three days. Capitol Police arrested 56 people on Thursday in anti-Kavanaugh protests Senior Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas told CNN: ""If she doesn't want to participate and tell her story, there's no reason for us to delay."" Senator Dean Heller, a Nevada Republican, sounded bullish about the prospects of confirming the nominee, who would be expected to bring a more conservative tilt to America's highest court. ""We got a little hiccup here with the Kavanaugh nomination, we'll get through this and we'll get off to the races,"" he said in a call with fellow Republicans, the Nevada Independent reports. Why is the US top court so important? Meet the Supremes - who are the justices? A petition backing Prof Ford, signed by more than 1,000 alumnae from Holton-Arms, her former Maryland high school, was delivered on Thursday to two Democratic women senators. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, said at the event: ""Someone who is lying does not ask the FBI to investigate their claims. ""Judge Kavanaugh has not asked to have the FBI investigate these claims. Is that the reaction of an innocent person? It is not."" Prof Ford says Brett Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and tried to take off her clothes On Thursday, 56 people were arrested while attending anti-Kavanaugh protests on Capitol Hill. The mostly female demonstrators wore pins reading: ""I believe Christine Blasey Ford."" Protesters occupied the office of Senator Chuck Grassley on Thursday Twelve of Prof Ford's family members have written an open letter, posted on Twitter, in which they call her ""highly ethical"", adding that ""her honesty is above reproach"". ""Chrissy is not someone who chooses to be in the spotlight,"" the letter said. Prof Ford has accused Judge Kavanaugh of drunkenly pinning her to a bed and trying to remove her clothing at a house party in a Washington DC suburb when they were both teenagers 36 years ago.

"The inquest was shown CCTV images of Khalid Masood in the days before the Westminster attack The widow of Westminster attacker Khalid Masood has said he was ""evil"" as she described his violent outbursts while on steroids to an inquest. Rohey Hydara apologised to his victims' families for not being ""more vigilant"", saying: ""I had no reason to doubt him"". She said Masood could be ""very short tempered"" but denied playing down her knowledge of his extremism. Masood, 52, stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death outside Parliament, after running down four pedestrians in his car. Westminster attacker 'told children he would die' Who was attacker Khalid Masood? Victims of the Westminster terror attack The inquest into the deaths of PC Palmer, 48, Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, is taking place at the Old Bailey in London. An inquest into the death of Masood - who was shot dead by armed officers during the attack on 22 March 2017 - will take place afterwards. Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives Ms Hydara, who married Masood in 2006 and is the mother of his two children, told the inquest: ""I can't believe I was married to someone that evil."" ""He would get very bad when he was on steroids,"" she said.  ""If you would look at him in a certain way he would talk about it for an hour. He was angry. I would always back down."" A recording made by Ms Hydara while Masood was using steroids was played in court in which he said the Islamic State group was ""not the enemy"". She said she contacted police when she realised Masood had been involved in the Westminster attack and rejected a claim from Gareth Patterson QC,  the barrister for the victims' families, that she had been aware he had been ""going down a particularly dangerous path"". The night before the attack, the couple spoke online and she said Masood appeared ""emotional"", Ms Hydra said. The next day, Masood sent his wife and children two texts, including one featuring an emoji blowing a kiss, the inquest heard. Ms Hydara said she had been sent a document by text shortly before the attack titled ""Jihad"" in which he had said ""please forgive me"". Along with Masood's mother, Janet Ajao, Ms Hydra was refused anonymity by a coroner at the inquest, but was allowed to give evidence out of sight of the public and media. Earlier, Ms Ajao told the inquest she only found out about hers son's actions on the TV news - but then it all ""made sense"". She when she last saw him - days before the attack - he just looked at her and said ""they'll say I'm a terrorist but I'm not"". She said that at the time she ""had no idea what he was referring to"". ""I know it sounds ridiculous but it didn't enter my head,"" she said. ""I'm utterly ashamed. I'm ashamed he's done this."" Mrs Ajao said her son had ""always been a fiery, angry personality"" who once turned into the ""Incredible Hulk"" in a row over a chicken dinner. She added he would go ""on and on and on"" about Islam after he converted while in prison for a wounding offence but had never expressed extremist views to her or hostility towards other people. The inquest heard Masood had seen his mother at her Welsh farmhouse only days before the attack - travelling there in the rented Hyundai Tucson car which he would later use to kill four people on Westminster Bridge. The barrister for some of the victims' families told Mrs Ajao that a ""golden opportunity"" was missed to prevent the attack by her failure to ""follow up"" on his comments to her. Mrs Ajao said: ""With hindsight, yes, I can see it would have made a difference... but at the time it didn't occur to me that this was going to happen."" She explained her son had been involved in violent incidents in the past but she thought he had settled down with his second wife. Mrs Ajao told the inquest she remained unaware of the Westminster attack until she watched the news at 22:00 that night which featured images of her son at the scene. ""As soon as I saw the body, I just knew. I just knew,"" she added. Turning to the victims' families after her evidence, Mrs Ajao added: ""Please understand I continue to be deeply saddened by the hurt that my son has caused and want to offer my deepest sympathies and condolences.""

"Data was gathered to help campaigning during the UK referendum A Canadian analytics firm that worked for Vote Leave has received the UK's first formal notice under a key data law, the UK's data protection watchdog has confirmed. AggregateIQ (AIQ) was accused of processing people's data ""for purposes which they would not have expected"". The firm has appealed againstthe notice, which was issued by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office.,external Law firmMishcon de Reya said the notice was ""significant"".,external If the company fails to appeal to the ICO's notice or does not comply with it, it could face a large fine. The Information Commissioner's Office confirmed the story to the BBC. AIQ is a small Canadian data firm that uses data to target online ads at voters during public polls. It was paid nearly Â£2.7m ($3.6m) by Vote Leave to target ads at prospective voters during the Brexit referendum campaign. It was also used by pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. Vote Leave has been fined Â£61,000 and referred to the police after an Electoral Commission probe said it broke electoral law by exceeding its spending limit by funnelling money through BeLeave. AIQ also received funding from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party and Veterans for Britain, amounting to a total of Â£3.5m from all of its pro-Brexit clients. The ICO said that although the data was gathered before 25 May, when the GDPR regulations came into effect, it was concerned about the ""continued retention and processing"" of data after that date. This, it said, meant GDPR applied to AIQ's handling of that information. Earlier this year it was linked to UK data firm Cambridge Analytica by whistleblower Chris Wylie, who alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired Facebook data belonging to 50 million people via a third party. Cambridge Analytica has been credited with helping Donald Trump win the US presidential election in 2016. Electoral Commission 'misinterpreted' Vote Leave expenses, court rules Vote Leave's targeted Brexit ads released by Facebook Vote Leave broke electoral law, says Electoral Commission Mr Wylie told the Guardian newspaper in March that staff at the now defunct Cambridge Analytica referred to AIQ as ""our Canadian office"". AIQ rejects this description and says it is 100% Canadian-owned. Following the allegations, Facebook suspended both firms from its platform. AggregateIQ denied any wrongdoing and stated that it ""works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where we operate"". Facebook suspended AIQ following allegations about its data use AIQ has previously denied any direct links to Cambridge Analytica. It has also denied ever employing Mr Wylie. ""We appealed the enforcement notice to the first level tribunal [a legal mechanism for challenging ICO notices],"" a spokesman for AIQ told the BBC, though he declined to comment further. ""It was just a matter of time before it would happen,"" said Sandra Wachter, a data regulation expert at the University of Oxford.'s Internet Institute. ""The GDPR makes it very clear that if you process data within the EU obviously the laws are applicable but also if you transfer data out of the EUâ¦ or if you are targeting European markets then the GDPR is also applicable."" Meaningful data protection meant that such issues had to be considered ""globally not just locally"", she told the BBC. According to Mishcon de Reya, the ICO's notice is phrased in relatively vague terms. Dean Armstrong QC, chairman of the independent legal advisory service Elias Partnership, told the BBC he agreed with that assessment. ""The ICO has given very vague instructions that are not particularly helpful,"" he said. ""Perhaps the vagueness of the terminology is a deliberate ploy to ensure entities take an extremely cautious approach in changing their data-handling activities.""

"Evans Cycles has 60 stores across the UK Evans Cycles has put itself up for sale as it seeks fresh funding amid tough High Street trading conditions. The BBC understands PwC is in talks with a number of potential buyers for the bike store chain, which has more than 60 outlets in the UK. The consultancy has asked for final bids by the end of next week, but Evans is not thought to be seeking a rescue deal. PwC declined to comment and Evans did not respond to requests for comment. Concerns over the retailer's financial position first emerged in September, when Sky News reported the chain wasseeking an emergency cash injection,externalfrom its lenders. Last Maplin stores close their doors Toys R Us shops to close down Like other retailers, Evans has struggled with the recent slowdown on Britain's High Streets that has led to the demise of brands such as Maplins and Toys R Us. High Street cycling retailers also face mounting competition from online rivals such as Wiggle, which have eaten into their market share. As first reported by Sky, Evans is thought to need at least Â£10m to keep up with obligations over the coming months. However, it is not thought to be considering a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) - a form of rescue deal that would allow it to shut stores and slash rents without going bust. The controversial insolvency process has been used recently by retailers such as New Look, Mothercare and Homebase. Evans traces its history to 1921, when the first FW Evans Cycles shop opened in Kennington, south London. It was bought by private equity firm ECI Partners for Â£80m in 2015, but has had a bumpy ride since then. In April, the chain sacked its chief executive Andy King amid reports he had failed to turn the business around. Mr King, who joined Evans in November 2016 amid profit slump, was replaced by Alan Fort - the firm's third new boss in two years. According to Companies House, earnings at Evans' parent company, April Topco, fell from Â£2.2m to Â£2m in the year to 28 October 2017. However, turnover increased slightly to Â£138.8m.

"Marine Le Pen has been battling to revive her party after she lost presidential elections last year A French court has ordered far-right leader Marine Le Pen to undergo psychiatric tests as part of an inquiry into her sharing images of Islamic State group atrocities.

Guide to nationalist parties in Europe As leader of what was then the National Front, Ms Le Pen was comfortably beaten by Emmanuel Macron in the second round of presidential elections last year. Since then she has been attempting to rebuild, and the party has been rebranded as National Rally in part to try to distance it from the taint of racism. According to the document posted by Ms Le Pen, the judge wants the tests to determine if she suffers mental illness or is ""capable of understanding remarks and answering questions"".

"This video can not be played Footage shows former rap label boss Marion ""Suge"" Knight running over two men with his pick-up truck - the man in this clip survived Former US rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight has pleaded no contest to a voluntary manslaughter charge over a hit-and-run incident in 2015. The Death Row Records founder made the plea to avoid charges of murdering one man and attempting to murder a second with his pick-up truck in Los Angeles. Knight will be formally sentenced to 28 years in prison in October. His record label helped launch the careers of artists including Dr Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. The 2015 incident happened after an argument over the making of Straight Outta Compton, a biopic about rap group NWA. Under Californian state law, a no contest plea is the legal equivalent of a guilty plea. Knight was facing possible life in prison if found guilty as originally charged As part of the agreement, the murder charges against Knight, 53, will be dismissed by prosecutors, along with separate criminal cases charging him with robbery and making criminal threats. The deal, in which Knight admitted using a ""deadly and dangerous weapon"" when he ran down two men with his vehicle, calls for him to serve 22 years in prison for voluntary manslaughter with a further six years added because of the US ""three-strikes"" law relating to repeated violations. Had Knight been found guilty of murder as originally charged, he would have faced life in prison, prosecutors said. Knight co-founded Death Row Records with the pioneering producer Dr Dre in the 1990s, but later declared bankruptcy and the company was sold at auction for $24m (Â£16.7m). Sales and profits for Knight's Death Row Records declined after he was imprisoned in 1996 Knight has a history of legal problems. He spent time in jail in 1997 and 2003 for parole violations arising from assault charges. He later pleaded guilty to hitting his girlfriend in an incident in 2008. While his label was initially very successful, his fortunes began to slide in 1996 when rapper Tupac Shakur was shot and killed in the passenger seat of Knight's car. Allow YouTube content?

In 1997, rival rapper Biggie Smalls was shot and Knight was sued for wrongful death. Smalls' estate claimed that Knight had ordered the killing in revenge for Shakur's death. Knight denied it and the suit was dismissed. Suge Knight says Tupac may be alive Six of the most notorious execs in music How rock and rap combined to create Beats The charge relates to an incident in January 2015 in Compton, a suburb of Los Angeles. Knight was accused of deliberately running over two men with his pick-up truck outside a hamburger restaurant following an argument on the set of a commercial for Straight Outta Compton. One of the victims, Terry Carter, died of his injuries while the other, Cle ""Bone"" Sloan, suffered serious injuries to his feet and head. Footage of the incident captured by security cameras show Knight's vehicle pulling up to the drive-in shop, with one of the victims approaching the driver's side window. Following what appears to be a brief discussion, a struggle then ensues. Knight's truck is seen going into reverse, throwing the man to the ground. It then moves forward, driving over his legs and slams into the other victim, who was killed. Knight turned himself in to authorities a day after the incident. His attorneys had said he was acting in self-defence and was fleeing armed attackers when he ran over Mr Carter and Mr Sloan. Mr Sloan has denied claims he was carrying a gun during the confrontation.

"The UK government is considering ""all options"", including a regulator, as part of new legislation governing the internet. It has previously said it will publish a White Paper in the coming months, laying out its proposals. According toBuzzfeed News,external, the White Paper will propose a regulatory body similar to Ofcom, which regulates broadcasters and telecoms companies. The government told the BBC it would publish the White Paper this winter. But a spokesman for the department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said it had nothing to share at this time. A cross-partycommittee investigating misinformationand fake news has already suggested areas for new legislation ahead of the White Paper. In July, it recommended: reforming electoral law for the digital age - including clear rules about political advertising online taxing social networks to pay for digital literacy programmes in schools greater transparency around online advertising However, Buzzfeed News said the government's proposals would go further. It said it had seen details of the White Paper, which included: forcing websites to remove illegal hate speech within a specific time period or face penalties. A similar law is in force in Germany making social networks verify the age of their users punishing social networks that failed to remove terror content or child abuse images restricting advertisements online for food and soft drink products that were high in salt, fat or sugar A spokesman for the DCMS said the report was speculation.

The left-wing leader, who won the presidential election by a landslide in July, will be sworn in in December.

"Volunteers have been helping rescue efforts At least 42 people have died after a ferry carrying hundreds of people capsized on Lake Victoria, Tanzania. One official told the Reuters news agency the number who drowned could be more than 200. Rescue efforts have been halted until dawn on Friday. The MV Nyerere ferry overturned near the shore between the islands of Ukora and Bugolora. It is thought the overloaded vessel toppled over when crowds on board moved to one side as it docked. Officials have said the ferry was carrying more than 400 passengers. About 100 people were rescued while 32 are said to be in a critical condition. Exact figures, though, are yet to be confirmed - Reuters said the person who dispensed tickets for the journey also died, with the machine recording the data lost. ""We pray to God to give us hope in such an accident,"" Regional Commissioner Adam Malima told reporters. ""We pray to God to give us hope that there has not been a high death toll."" Locals joined with emergency teams in rescue efforts on Thursday afternoon. Tanzania has seen a number of nautical disasters, with overcrowding often playing a role. In 2012, at least 145 people died when a packed ferry sank while transporting people to the island of Zanzibar in the Indian Ocean. The year before, almost 200 people died in another major incident off the coast of Zanzibar. Hundreds survived, some found clinging to mattresses and fridges. In 1996, more than 800 people died when the MV Bukoba capsized on Lake Victoria. It was one of the the worst ferry disasters of the last century.

"The cause of the collision at a protected level crossing in Oss was unclear Four children from a Dutch day-care centre, two of them sisters, have died in a collision involving a train and an electric cart driven by a supervisor. The children were being taken to local schools in the cart when the accident happened on a level crossing in the southern town of Oss, west of Nijmegen. A fifth child and a woman were critically injured in the crash. The woman on the back of the cart had just dropped off a child at one school before setting off for another. Two of the children who died were four years old, and the others were aged six and eight, police said. Of the five children involved in the tragedy, three were sisters and two of them died. The surviving sister, aged 11, was being treated in hospital along with the 32-year-old woman. Mayor Wobine Buijs-Glaudemans told a news conference that everyone was affected by what had happened near Oss-West station, and her thoughts went out to those families caught up in the accident. ""There are no words to describe what they're going through,"" she said. The level crossing has barriers for cycle paths as well as cars, but the cart carrying the five children is thought to have gone under the barrier on a bike path before it was hit. The woman driving the cart was heard by one witness shouting that the brakes were not working. Others said 15 cars had been waiting at the level crossing when the cart had gone past without slowing down. Children have for years been taken to school by cargo bike in the Netherlands, and electric carts known as Stints have become increasingly popular with some 3,500 in use across the country. Described as a cross between a segway and a cargo bike, anyone can use a cart over the age of 16 after taking a short course. The cart has a maximum speed of 17km/h (11 mph). Stint carts have become a very popular means of transporting young children in the Netherlands (file pic) Edwin Renzen, who co-founded the Stint Urban Mobility company which makes the cart, told public broadcaster NOS that the accident was every parent's worst nightmare and he was intending to visit the scene. Several childcare groups said they would suspend their use of Stint carts until it was clear what had gone wrong. The tragedy came as a shock for residents in Oss, where a help centre was set up. An average of 11 people are killed on Dutch level crossings every year and the Dutch Safety Board (OVV) released a report in July saying the number of casualties was ""unacceptable"" in ""the only country in Europe with both a high volume of train traffic and a large number of level crossings,external"". The OVV was responding to three accidents in 2016 and 2017 in which two people had died and 18 were hurt. Most accidents had happened on manned level crossings, it said, calling for action to prevent people going over the crossings when barriers were down. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says she is worried about a 'blind brexit' Nicola Sturgeon has called for Brexit to be delayed beyond next March if the UK has not secured a detailed agreement with the EU by then. Scotland's first minister told the BBC it would be ""absolutely reckless"" to leave without knowing what will replace the country's existing relationship. She urged the other opposition parties to back a delay if the UK faces a choice between ""no deal and no detail"". Prime Minister Theresa May has already said delay is ""not an option"". Negotiations over the terms of the UK's exit and future relations are at a critical stage, with about six months to go before the UK is scheduled to leave on 29 March. Tusk: May's Brexit plan won't work Can May cling on to Chequers plan? At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Mrs May spoke to her 27 EU counterparts over dinner in Salzburg on Wednesday evening, when she told them that they must focus their minds on securing a Brexit deal in the next two months. But European Council head Donald Tusk later said Mrs May's proposed new economic partnership with the EU ""will not work"". Ms Sturgeon said that any statement setting out the future relationship between the UK and the EU is increasingly likely to be ""vague and lacking in meaningful detail"" - a prospect she has described as a ""blind Brexit"". The first minister said this would mean: ""All of the difficult issues that have defied resolution in the last two years will be kicked into the transition period, but at that point the UK will already have left the EU. ""That seems to me to be tantamount to jumping off a cliff with a blindfold on and having no idea where the landing place is. And that is in my view as unacceptable as a no deal option. ""So if that's the choice that the House of Commons faces I think it is far more in the interests of the whole UK for Article 50 to be extended so that all of the alternative options can be properly considered rather than having this choice between the frying pan and the fire."" This video can not be played Theresa May on what can be achieved at Salzburg summit Ms Sturgeon said she could not put a timescale on how long any delay should be for, but that there would need to be ""clarity for people"" before the UK did ultimately leave. The SNP is firmly opposed to Brexit, but has not yet backed calls by the People's Vote campaign for a second referendum to be held on the issue. Please upgrade your browser Ms Sturgeon said her party would not stand in the way of another vote on Brexit, and would be ""happy to have discussions"" with those advocating one. But she added: ""I think for me to become an enthusiastic advocate of that I would need some assurance that Scotland won't simply find itself in the same position all over again where Scotland votes to stay but the rest of the UK votes to leave and Scotland ends up being taken against their will."" Mrs May addressed the other EU leaders over dinner in Salzburg on Wednesday In her speech in Salzburg, Mrs May stressed her ""serious"" proposals for future co-operation between the UK and EU would ensure a ""shared close relationship"". She also told the EU leaders that her priorities were maintaining economic ties and ensuring promises to Northern Ireland were kept. There has been speculation that the UK will put forward new ideas for regulatory checks to address the current Irish deadlock. The other EU leaders, who have warned that time is running out for a deal to be reached, will discuss Brexit without Mrs May present on Thursday.

"Theresa May's uncompromising tone was matched by the EU The Brexit action plan for EU leaders coming to Salzburg - briefed over and again in advance of the summit in off-the-record conversations with European diplomats - had been to spout words of support for Theresa May to help her secure an EU/UK Brexit divorce deal not just with Brussels, but with political opponents back home. But this summit has now ended, leaving a decidedly bitter taste in the mouth and a sense that this will be a long and very difficult autumn of negotiations with a real prospect of no deal at the end. So what just happened? The EU's ""support Theresa"" effort was actually launched the day before the summit with chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, suggesting a ""new, improved"" proposal on the key sticking point of the Irish border. Taking stock of where we are with Brexit Reality Check: How are Brexit preparations getting on? With the intention of directly addressing UK concerns, Mr Barnier also made explicit assurances that no-one in the EU wanted to break up the constitutional integrity of the UK. Now, this ""new plan"" for the border wasn't really new at all, but EU leaders never intended to compromise their position on Ireland or their rejection of Theresa's May's Chequers proposal for the future economic partnership between the EU and UK. Their Brexit aim for this summit was to go as far as they could with words and gestures to throw Theresa May a lifeline. Please upgrade your browser But their tokenistic effort was a misreading of Theresa May's political position - especially ahead of what is likely to be a difficult annual conference with her own Conservative Party. The prime minister swiftly and bluntly rebuffed the Barnier Irish border suggestions - thereby misreading EU leaders right back. There was huge irritation in EU circles - and that's how this summit began. Brexit: All you need to know Chequers plan 'will avoid hard border' EU frustration only grew when the prime minister then arrived in Salzburg insisting unequivocally that her Chequers Brexit proposal was the only way forward. Theresa May's uncompromising tone was then matched note by note by the EU and here we are now. Theresa May rejected EU negotiator Michel Barnier's ""new"" proposal for the Irish border The fact that EU leaders had already pointed to problems in the Chequers proposal long before this summit; the fact that they praised other parts of the prime minister's plan, such as her thoughts on security; the fact that numerous European prime ministers said here in Salzburg that there was more hope now that there could be a successful Brexit deal, thanks in part to the prime minister's Chequers plan - all that has now been eclipsed. But let's face it, critics and political rivals of Theresa May were waiting and watching this summit for storm clouds to gather over Chequers. That now is the focus of their attention. And perhaps - if Theresa May can survive this next political storm at home - it rather suits both the EU and the UK in the long term to have the public perception of Brexit negotiations now as fraught. So that if a Brexit deal does finally emerge later this autumn, the perception will be that it was hard fought and hard won. Will EU's Salzburg summit mark a Brexit turning point?

"This video can not be played Sheriff Jeff Gahler said there had been multiple fatalities and multiple people wounded A woman shot dead three people and injured three more before turning a gun on herself in an attack at a warehouse complex in Maryland, US police say. The shooting happened on Thursday morning at a pharmacy distribution centre in Perryman, near Baltimore. The attacker, Snochia Moseley, 26, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The motive for her attack is unclear. Mass shootings by women are rare, with more than 95% of such attacks in the US carried out by men. The victims who died included Sunday Aguda, 45, Brindra Giri, 41, and Hayleen Reyes, 41, police said on Friday. The shooter was a temporary employee who reported for work as usual that morning, Harford County Sheriff's Office said. But shortly after 09:00 local time (13:00 GMT) she began shooting outside, then inside the facility, with a 9mm Glock handgun that she had brought with her. Police were on the scene within five minutes, by which time the shooter had killed three people and injured three more. Officers found the suspect in a critical condition, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head - she died later in hospital. She was from Baltimore County, police said. She legally owned and had registered the handgun, and had taken several magazines of ammunition with her, police said. The sheriff's office initially urged residents to avoid the area, which is about 40km (25 miles) north-east of Baltimore, as hundreds of employees evacuated the facility and nearby buildings. FBI agents were deployed to the scene just minutes after the shooting Investigators say the suspect was ""suffering from a mental illness and over the last two weeks had become increasingly agitated"". They say she had been employed at the facility for less than two weeks before the attack. She had no criminal arrest record, but had her car stopped three times in the area in just the past month. The suspect was issued tickets for not having proper vehicle registration, among other infractions,according to the Baltimore Sun newspaper,external. Authorities have described her as ""disgruntled"". A school friend told the newspaper that she was not an angry person but felt the ""world was against her"".

"This video can not be played A car was swept away in a river in Carmarthenshire after heavy rain across Wales Strong winds and heavy rain have caused travel disruption and flooding to parts of the UK. Storm Bronagh, the second named storm of the year, swept eastwards across Wales and England overnight, with gusts reaching 78mph. Flooding and fallen trees have caused problems on the roads and disrupted rail services. Sheffield and Sennybridge, Powys, both got around half a month's rain fall in 24 hours. A yellow weather warning for wind is in force for parts of England and Wales until 18:00 BST on Friday. However, forecasters said the impact of the storm was ""waning"" and will mainly affect offshore areas in the north east of the country.

"Volunteers have been helping rescue efforts At least 42 people have died after a ferry carrying hundreds of people capsized on Lake Victoria, Tanzania. One official told the Reuters news agency the number who drowned could be more than 200. Rescue efforts have been halted until dawn on Friday. The MV Nyerere ferry overturned near the shore between the islands of Ukora and Bugolora. It is thought the overloaded vessel toppled over when crowds on board moved to one side as it docked. Officials have said the ferry was carrying more than 400 passengers. About 100 people were rescued while 32 are said to be in a critical condition. Exact figures, though, are yet to be confirmed - Reuters said the person who dispensed tickets for the journey also died, with the machine recording the data lost. ""We pray to God to give us hope in such an accident,"" Regional Commissioner Adam Malima told reporters. ""We pray to God to give us hope that there has not been a high death toll."" Locals joined with emergency teams in rescue efforts on Thursday afternoon. Tanzania has seen a number of nautical disasters, with overcrowding often playing a role. In 2012, at least 145 people died when a packed ferry sank while transporting people to the island of Zanzibar in the Indian Ocean. The year before, almost 200 people died in another major incident off the coast of Zanzibar. Hundreds survived, some found clinging to mattresses and fridges. In 1996, more than 800 people died when the MV Bukoba capsized on Lake Victoria. It was one of the the worst ferry disasters of the last century.

Workers from three TGI Fridays chains and four McDonald's outlets were also expected to join the rally, which the BFAWU said had been inspired by industrial action in the hospitality sector last year. TGI Friday workers in London's Covent Garden demonstrated about pay conditions earlier this year Workers from McDonald's staged theirfirst strike in the UK last yearin a dispute over zero-hours contracts and conditions while TGI Fridays staff in Milton Keynes and Covent Garden walked outin May in a row about tips and wages. Chris Heppell, a team leader at The Post & Telegraph pub, told the BBC he and co-workers had seen the McDonald's strike and felt inspired. The 29 year-old is on Â£8.65 an hour and said he paid extortionate rent and worked in a ""physically and emotionally"" exhausting job. A rise to Â£10 an hour would ""give me an opportunity to pay off debts"". ""We don't feel we have a voice and if we come together then collectively we will be listened to,"" Mr Heppell said. Matt Rouse, 22, a kitchen worker at the Bright Helm, said: ""This is only the beginning, we will keep fighting for everyone, for better wages and rights for hospitality workers across the country"". Wetherspoon said it had announced Â£20m-worth of pay rises last year and Â£27m for this year, with pub managers put on 40 hour week instead of the current 42.5 hours from April 2019. ""We are also moving to the same [pay] rate for 18-21s as we already have for over 21s from November 5 2018,"" a Wetherspoon spokesperson said. ""In addition we are putting up the rate of pay."" Lauren McCourt, a worker at McDonald's, said: ""We're joining with Wetherspoon's and TGI Friday's workers because when we come together, hospitality workers have the power to transform our sector."" A spokesperson for McDonald's said the chain had been notified of industrial action in four outlets - Cambridge, Crayford, Watford and Brixton. ""Any suggestion that this activity is widespread and growing is not accurate - we understand that fewer of our employees are involved in potential industrial action than last May, with the support from our people of the union diminishing,"" said McDonald's, which a workforce of 120,000 in the UK. ""In Brixton, for example, just two of our employees have been balloted for strike out of a workforce of more than 100,"" McDonald's said. Conditions of workers in the restaurant and pub trade have been highlighted in recent yearssince claims that some chains were regularly holding back some or all of the tips meant for staff.

"The inquest was shown CCTV images of Khalid Masood in the days before the Westminster attack The widow of Westminster attacker Khalid Masood has said he was ""evil"" as she described his violent outbursts while on steroids to an inquest. Rohey Hydara apologised to his victims' families for not being ""more vigilant"", saying: ""I had no reason to doubt him"". She said Masood could be ""very short tempered"" but denied playing down her knowledge of his extremism. Masood, 52, stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death outside Parliament, after running down four pedestrians in his car. Westminster attacker 'told children he would die' Who was attacker Khalid Masood? Victims of the Westminster terror attack The inquest into the deaths of PC Palmer, 48, Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, is taking place at the Old Bailey in London. An inquest into the death of Masood - who was shot dead by armed officers during the attack on 22 March 2017 - will take place afterwards. Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives Ms Hydara, who married Masood in 2006 and is the mother of his two children, told the inquest: ""I can't believe I was married to someone that evil."" ""He would get very bad when he was on steroids,"" she said.  ""If you would look at him in a certain way he would talk about it for an hour. He was angry. I would always back down."" A recording made by Ms Hydara while Masood was using steroids was played in court in which he said the Islamic State group was ""not the enemy"". She said she contacted police when she realised Masood had been involved in the Westminster attack and rejected a claim from Gareth Patterson QC,  the barrister for the victims' families, that she had been aware he had been ""going down a particularly dangerous path"". The night before the attack, the couple spoke online and she said Masood appeared ""emotional"", Ms Hydra said. The next day, Masood sent his wife and children two texts, including one featuring an emoji blowing a kiss, the inquest heard. Ms Hydara said she had been sent a document by text shortly before the attack titled ""Jihad"" in which he had said ""please forgive me"". Along with Masood's mother, Janet Ajao, Ms Hydra was refused anonymity by a coroner at the inquest, but was allowed to give evidence out of sight of the public and media. Earlier, Ms Ajao told the inquest she only found out about hers son's actions on the TV news - but then it all ""made sense"". She when she last saw him - days before the attack - he just looked at her and said ""they'll say I'm a terrorist but I'm not"". She said that at the time she ""had no idea what he was referring to"". ""I know it sounds ridiculous but it didn't enter my head,"" she said. ""I'm utterly ashamed. I'm ashamed he's done this."" Mrs Ajao said her son had ""always been a fiery, angry personality"" who once turned into the ""Incredible Hulk"" in a row over a chicken dinner. She added he would go ""on and on and on"" about Islam after he converted while in prison for a wounding offence but had never expressed extremist views to her or hostility towards other people. The inquest heard Masood had seen his mother at her Welsh farmhouse only days before the attack - travelling there in the rented Hyundai Tucson car which he would later use to kill four people on Westminster Bridge. The barrister for some of the victims' families told Mrs Ajao that a ""golden opportunity"" was missed to prevent the attack by her failure to ""follow up"" on his comments to her. Mrs Ajao said: ""With hindsight, yes, I can see it would have made a difference... but at the time it didn't occur to me that this was going to happen."" She explained her son had been involved in violent incidents in the past but she thought he had settled down with his second wife. Mrs Ajao told the inquest she remained unaware of the Westminster attack until she watched the news at 22:00 that night which featured images of her son at the scene. ""As soon as I saw the body, I just knew. I just knew,"" she added. Turning to the victims' families after her evidence, Mrs Ajao added: ""Please understand I continue to be deeply saddened by the hurt that my son has caused and want to offer my deepest sympathies and condolences.""

" Told by David Lemke Nguyen Quoc Tuy was born in 1970 or 1971 in Sa Dec, a small town in southern Vietnam’s Mekong Delta. Tuy - pronounced two-ee - was handed over to the local church, which doubled as an orphanage, when he was just seven days old. The protracted and bloody Vietnam War - called the American War by the Vietnamese - was still raging in the swampy delta region to the south of Ho Chi Minh City, or Saigon, as it was called then. Tuy (r) with the nunsbefore he developed polio When he was one, Tuy contracted the polio virus from contaminated water. The virus attacked the muscles in his legs and left his lower limbs under-developed. By the time he was three, he was moved to a better-equipped orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City and, because of his health condition, was soon put on an adoption list. Thousands of miles away, a couple on the west coast of the United States were preparing to give him a new home. Tuy’s future American parents, Kristin and Thomas Buckner, had decided to create a multi-cultural family and give “forgotten” youngsters a chance to thrive. They already had a biological child, Paul, and then began adopting children from around the world. “We wanted a large family,” says Thomas, “but at that time, there was a lot of talk about the planet’s growing population. We decided to bring only one kid into the world ourselves, because there were so many other children needing families.” Kristin - now known by her maiden name, Brockschmidt, after she and Thomas divorced - says the size of their family was created as much by “blind luck” as any firm philosophy or plan. “It’s a little-known fact that, just as you can accidentally become pregnant and have a surprise baby, you can also accidentally find yourself adopting,” she jokes. “In Vietnam, Tuy was listed as abandoned. They said no-one had visited him since he was placed at the orphanage. “He was thought to be about three years old,” she explains, recalling her conversations with a US adoption agency more than 40 years ago. Thomas says Tuy only ended up with his family - in the autumn of 1974 - because their plans to adopt another Vietnamese boy were postponed. “We had wanted to take a child we were going to call Robin, but there were delays due to his mental disability. In the meantime, we agreed to take another boy - that boy was Tuy.” Tuy became the fourth Buckner sibling. Two more children - including Robin - were to follow. Tuy laughs, “We were the Buckner Bunch, mimicking the classic American TV show, The Brady Bunch.” Thomas and Tuy hang a Christmas stocking Tuy’s early days in Berkeley, northern California, were not easy. His anxieties had been well noted by staff at the orphanage, and being in a new environment did little to allay his fears. Instinctively, Tuy would either save or hide every bit of food he was given. Kristin with Tuy “He kept extra food in a bag that a family friend made for him, and he carried that bag wherever he went,” says Kristin. “He also hid the toys he wanted to keep track of in heater vents, so he could find them later. “For the first six months, I carried him everywhere to make him feel secure.” Gradually, Tuy began to open up and trust his new parents and siblings. He also became more confident as he overcame the daily physical challenges he faced because of the lack of muscles in his legs. Kristin recalls a visit to a park in the hills above Berkeley, when Tuy was watching his brothers and sisters having fun in a playground. She observed as he crawled over to the ladder of a slide, climbed up by himself, looked around from the top and then slid down on his own. “It was at that moment I knew he would be OK, and that challenges for Tuy were just things to overcome.” Tuy had to have major corrective surgery because his legs began to grow but the muscles and nerves did not. Tuy's corrective surgery He got around on crutches and leg braces, picked up spoken English quickly, and before turning six had learned how to hike, bike, climb and ski using outriggers (forearm crutches with ski tips mounted to the base). Yet as Tuy entered California’s education system, new obstacles impeded his progress. Teachers assumed he was lazy. “I’d read a sentence in class, and then I’d be done,” says Tuy. Both Kristin and Thomas were perplexed as to why Tuy fell behind in basic reading. “One night my mom had a theory,” says Tuy. “She came into my room and handed me one of my reading books upside down. I could read it fine. “That’s how we went on to discover that I was severely dyslexic.” With affection, his siblings describe their brother as “diabolically intelligent”. “When all the other kids went out to play, I had to do something else,” says Tuy. “I got really good at chess. I started carving and whittling wood. I read almanacs like you wouldn’t believe - just to have conversation material at dinner time.” But Tuy’s interest in building things and problem-solving gradually affected his performance in high school. “He would take wire coat-hangers from home and skip math classes to make bar puzzles - the type you have to physically manipulate to solve,” says Kristin. “Though this impressed his friends, his grades in the missing classes were less impressive. It became clear that a big public high school didn’t give him the support or opportunities to learn that he was going to need.” So, after a spell at a local private school in nearby Oakland, Tuy moved out of the family home. He travelled more than 2,000 miles to Big Island in Hawaii - where he had spent summers with his family - to attend a much smaller private boarding school. There, Tuy felt more independent - and island life suited him. He identified so strongly with Hawaiian culture that he used to pass himself off as an islander. He even set up a shop in the school dormitory selling noodles, sweets and fizzy drinks to make some cash on the side. Tuy readily admits he became aimless and easily distracted as a young adult. But in 1991, he got the chance to travel to Vietnam with Kristin. His parents had always been open about where he had come from and Kristin had taken him on previous trips to Asia, but this was the first time since the war that they - as American civilians - had the opportunity to visit Vietnam. Kristin was helping to organise the first peace walk in Vietnam to protest against America’s trade embargo. The trip mixed US war veterans with peace workers and returning overseas Vietnamese. “In 1991, Vietnam was a totally different place compared to today,” says Tuy. “It’s hard to describe, but there’s something about returning to your country. Up until then, Vietnam wasn’t really a conscious feeling for me. But as we landed, the experience became overwhelming. “The Hanoi airport was really small at the time. You walked from the plane to the terminal. I stopped half-way and kissed the ground. It was just something I felt I had to do.” Planting a peace pole in Ho Chi Minh City Of all the planned marches, perhaps the strangest one was in front of two curious monkey families on Monkey Island - one of the 1,600 islands in Ha Long Bay, a Unesco heritage site. Tuy remembers how they all had dinner that evening on the bay’s main island of Cat Ba. Ha Long Bay, Vietnam “We were all sitting at our tables, and our Vietnamese hosts, including an army general, invited me to join them to eat. “We all ended up drinking quite a lot. I had a cassette of the soundtrack to the Robin Williams’ film - Good Morning Vietnam. I convinced them to play that, sitting with this general and getting drunk off cheap Russian alcohol. “It was bizarre and awesome all at once.” Tuy and Kristin had hoped to head into the Mekong Delta - Tuy’s birthplace - after the peace walks were over, but travel restrictions against foreigners meant that was impossible. The visit had a lasting effect on Tuy. He felt that a whole new world had opened up to him. Back in the US, Tuy dived head first into as much Vietnamese culture as he could - including getting to know the adopted Vietnamese children of some friends of his parents. The DeBolt family - also based in northern California - became widely known in the US for raising a large family of adopted children, seven of whom were disabled and from Vietnam. One of those was among the thousands of babies and children who were airlifted out of Vietnam in the last days of the war. They went on to be adopted by families in the US, Canada, Australia and Europe. Tuy fitted right in. He became close friends with Ly, Tich and David. They spent their time hanging out, playing a Vietnamese card game called Tin Lin, eating Vietnamese food and drinking café sua da (iced coffee with plenty of sweetened milk). So in 1993, when Ly was flying to Vietnam to get married, Tuy agreed to join his friends for a three-month stay. This time, he would be able to travel within Vietnam more freely than he had done with the 1991 peace marchers. He also had unfinished business in the Mekong Delta. “I just wanted to see the town of Sa Dec and the first orphanage I had been put in,” he says. “I hoped to simply thank the nuns there and, in a way, seeing the people of that region would be like seeing my mother and father.” Tuy and his friends stayed at a hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, and the owners - a retired army officer and his wife - offered to help rent a car and drive Tuy, Tich and David into the remote Mekong. Bad roads and washed-out bridges meant the journey was much more difficult than they’d imagined. Travelling through Vietnam was not easy, and for a disabled person it was just that much harder. So it was decided that the hotel owners would venture ahead with Tuy’s papers by boat to Sa Dec, to visit the orphanage. A few hours later, they returned with news. The nun who had signed Tuy’s paperwork - Sister Desiree - was now living in the nearby city of Can Tho. Finding her proved to be relatively easy. While she couldn’t offer any information about his parents, she did offer to be his godmother. David and Tuy meet Sister Desiree (r) “Sister Desiree was awesome,” says Tuy. “I didn’t think I was going to find anyone - so just finding the nun who’d signed the birth certificate was incredible.” For the next two and a half months, Tuy stayed with his friends in Da Nang, a coastal city in central Vietnam. He was having a great time, but felt torn. His desire to see Sa Dec for himself remained strong, and so he decided to make one more attempt to get there before leaving Vietnam, to finally close that chapter of his life. Three days before his flight back to the US, Tuy left Ho Chi Minh City once again with his friends and the same hotel owners. This time, after more than five hours of driving on pothole-riddled roads, they made it. The arrival of this unusual group of disabled Vietnamese-Americans created an immediate buzz. The local market almost stopped trading, as people began to crowd around the front gates of the orphanage. Tuy remembers saying hello to the children, and sitting on the cracked concrete benches looking at the faded orange paint on the walls. The nuns presented Tuy with a ledger of all the orphans who had stayed with them. Turning the pages, Tuy arrived at entry 313 and saw his baby photo with the name Nguyen Quoc Tuy - the same as on his birth certificate. Written underneath was: “mother/father - unknown”. Tuy's entry in the ledger “I thought that was astonishing, that they still had these records and my name in Vietnamese was indeed the correct one,” says Tuy. Outside, the excitement on the street was growing. “Some in the crowd outside had started to come into the church courtyard to get a look. My story was spreading like wildfire through Sa Dec.” At one point, a woman came into the church - the nuns clearly knew her. She was introduced to Tuy as Phien, and was shown the baby photo in the ledger. Tuy was told that in the orphanage, older children were put in charge of the younger ones. Phien, it turned out, had cared for him when she was seven years old. It was pure coincidence that she was in town that day. She’d been heading to hospital to see a sick relative, but had stopped at the orphanage to visit the nuns. Phien began to speak quite animatedly to the nuns - but Tuy didn't speak Vietnamese and had no idea what was being said. David, Tuy’s Vietnamese friend from the DeBolt family, began to interpret. And what he began to reveal, Tuy says, made “my head feel like it was boiling”. Phien, it turned out, had information about Tuy’s mother. She was still alive. I just wanted to see the town of Sa Dec and the first orphanage I had been put in,” he says. “I hoped to simply thank the nuns there and, in a way, seeing the people of that region would be like seeing my mother and father.” Tuy and his friends stayed at a hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, and the owners - a retired army officer and his wife - offered to help rent a car and drive Tuy, Tich and David into the remote Mekong.

And what he began to reveal, Tuy says, made “my head feel like it was boiling”. Phien, it turned out, had information about Tuy’s mother. She was still alive. “She lives quite far away and it may take a while, but she can go and bring her back here to meet you,” David told him. “I was going numb,” says Tuy. “I had no idea how long I had to wait. I was happy, scared and sad. “’Who is she? Why is she? What is she?’ I thought. ‘What will it take to prove to her I am who I am, or vice versa? Is it a scam to take advantage of me? If it is, what do I do? If it isn’t, how will I handle it?’” As they waited, Tuy watched as his friends ate lunch. Afterwards they gathered on the front steps of the church. “Time was slow, and yet also a blur,” Tuy says. “I remember just looking back and forth across the sea of faces in the gathered crowd.” Eventually, a commotion began at the gates. What seemed to be the town’s entire population was parting for a small group of people inching their way forward. When the group reached the front, a small old lady wearing glasses popped out in front of Tuy. In a rush, Tuy blurted out the sentence in Vietnamese that his friends had been trying to teach him. “Con trai của mẹ đã xa nhà 20 năm nhưng bây giờ con ấy đã trở về.” In English it translates as, “Your son has been gone for 20 years, but now he has returned.” There was a moment of silence, before the people at the front of the crowd started gesturing to Tuy. “People began pointing at a second lady who had stepped out from behind the first one,” he says. “The lady I spoke to first wasn’t the right one!” “It was dead quiet, until someone in the crowd yelled out, ‘So which one is your kid?’” says Tuy’s friend Tich. “People laughed, and that broke the tension.” The second woman walked over to Tuy and grabbed him by the back of the head, pulling him down to her level. She parted his hair, which at that time was quite long. “I have this birthmark on my head,” says Tuy. “It’s one of the reasons why I had grown long hair, to hide it.” When the lady saw the mark, she released him and hit him on the arm proclaiming: “This is my son!” “Everybody cheered,” says Tuy. “I still had no idea what was happening or what was being said - so David and Tich translated for me. “It was in that instance, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this woman proved to me that she was my mom and that I was her son. “It was something only a mother could possibly know.” “She lives quite far away and it may take a while, but she can go and bring her back here to meet you,” David told him. “I was going numb,” says Tuy. “I had no idea how long I had to wait. I was happy, scared and sad. “’Who is she? Why is she? What is she?’ I thought. ‘What will it take to prove to her I am who I am, or vice versa? Is it a scam to take advantage of me?

When I was in Hawaii all the locals used to tell me I looked Filipino and it felt like they were challenging me. “I had identified solely as being Vietnamese, but it turns out they were right all along.” Tuy says he and his birth mother, Nguyen Thi Be, sat for a while and talked - with his friends interpreting. “I was totally just grooving off her speaking. I had so much to say, but wasn’t able to. I actually felt ashamed and shy - I was culturally inept. “She told me how when I was born, she was extremely ill and not able to care for me.  Fearing for her own life, she arranged for me to be taken to the church. “When she recovered she tried to get me back, but she said the nuns had told her that the rules were once a child had been given up, it could not be returned. “When the war was over, my mom lost all hope of ever seeing me again.” Thi Be gave Tuy a name and a place regarding his father - Fantaleon Sanchez and the city of Calamba in the Philippines. Six months after the mother-son reunion, Tuy landed in the capital Manila, joining his adopted father Thomas, to look for his birth father. Thomas, a baritone vocalist, had been booked to perform with the country’s national philharmonic orchestra - it seemed an ideal opportunity to search. It was 1994, the internet was in its infancy, and they had no idea exactly how to start looking in Calamba - which at the time had a population of about 200,000 people. The driver who took them the 30 miles or so from Manila suggested stopping at the local municipal offices. “Right as you enter the building there’s a missing persons bureau,” Thomas recollects. “Although no-one was technically missing, the officer at the desk - named Benito - took the photo that Tuy had brought of his Vietnamese mother and older sister. “Benito informed us he would speak with every neighbourhood barrio, a type of captain who looks after local affairs. And that was it. We left.” “I felt good that we had found that place,” says Tuy, “but honestly, it was like going through all those feelings again. “From cloud nine, to hoping but not knowing. I really wanted to find him, but I honestly didn’t think it would happen.” Thomas honoured his performance commitments and then flew home. Tuy had a few days to himself in Manila, before he also would return to the US. Then there was a phone call from Benito. “He told me that he’d found my father. The guy had been in Vietnam during the war, he was 65 and his name was actually Pantaleon Mance - similar sounding to the Fantaleon Sanchez my mom had recalled. “I was told he would come visit me where I was staying [in Manila] at 8am the next day.” The cold sweats that Tuy had experienced just six months prior in Sa Dec had returned. After a sleepless night, Tuy put on a traditional Filipino shirt which he had bought, and waited patiently. “It was quite different from meeting my Vietnamese mom,” he says. “Because my agenda was that he had to prove to me that he was my father. If his answers were not correct, then the meeting would be over.” As the two men chatted, it became clear that Pantaleon had the same agenda. Questions were asked - and answers given. At some point, it became apparent that they were father and son. “With Dad, it was just us - alone. Two people - two men - who could communicate. With Mom, it was a spectacle, and we could only talk in simple English and gestures. “We rented a car and went to Calamba to meet my half-sisters, Tess and Faye, and then to Pantaleon’s friend’s house to celebrate. “I remember the emotions overwhelming me in the car, which I think was quite hard for him. “Two days later, he and his children saw me off at the airport. My life was in total upheaval - I had huge choices to make…” Tuy with Pantaleon (l) It wasn’t just in the Philippines where Tuy had relatives he never knew existed. In Vietnam, he also had an extended family. In addition to his birth mother, Thi Be, he had one older full biological sister called Phuong and five younger half-siblings. Tuy with some of his Vietnamese family, 1993 Thi Be’s second husband had recently died after being bitten by a snake in the rice fields. The family was in debt and lived in extreme poverty. “They were living in a shack with a dirt floor and no electricity, whereas I was living a lottery life, going to art school in California,” he recalls. Tuy's mother's house in Sa Dec, 1993 Tuy’s emotional ties with Vietnam and his relatives there strengthened. For the next few years, his visits continued, and gradually his life became more focused on Vietnam than the US. He built a small hotel near Ho Chi Minh City’s airport with some new Vietnamese friends. He also bought a house in Da Nang, and threw himself into learning Vietnamese. On his trips to Sa Dec, Tuy says he always helped out - but never spoiled - his siblings.  Slowly but surely, Thi Be and the family began to climb out of poverty. Tuy also worked with his friend David Dang - one of the DeBolt family adoptees who had kept his original surname. David had founded Ablenet - a non-profit organisation - with a mission to bring used desktop PCs from the US to Vietnam. A school was also set up to teach Vietnamese people with disabilities how to use - and programme - computers. Ablenet classes “Back then, if you were disabled you were a drain on the family,” says Tuy. “You only had disabled workshops where the men would fix bicycles and the women were seamstresses or made arts and crafts.” The Ablenet team meet Tuy's mother for lunch Ablenet brokered US partnerships with some of Silicon Valley’s biggest names. But after a few years, partly because of increasing Vietnamese red tape, David closed the company. And then in 1996, Tuy was hurt in a car accident in the US. Until the car accident, because of the lack of muscle strength in his legs, Tuy had been able to get around using crutches and leg braces. But the accident forced him into a wheelchair permanently. Tuy suffered a serious tear to a rotator cuff - the group of four muscles that come together as tendons, to hold the arm and shoulder together. For two years, as the full extent of his shoulder damage became clear, Tuy was unable to travel outside the US. But one afternoon in October 2000, Tuy got a call from David Dang, and was made an offer too good to turn down. Because of their work with Ablenet, they were invited to join an IT delegation shadowing then US President Bill Clinton’s historic trip to Vietnam. President Clinton would become the first serving US president to visit the country since Richard Nixon had travelled to South Vietnam in 1969. IT delegation in Hanoi Tuy’s childhood creative streak had stayed with him and, since the mid-1990s, he’d been welding, building wheelchairs and designing jewellery. Before he travelled, he made a line of commemorative pins which he planned to hand out to some of the presidential delegation. Tuy admired Bill Clinton and it was his dream to meet him - but as the trip neared its end he hadn’t even been able to catch a glimpse of the president, other than on television. On the last day of the visit, Tuy wheeled up to Ho Chi Minh’s City Hall on a whim.  An IT business lunch was scheduled inside, and Tuy managed to blag his way in. There was no lift, so Tuy crawled up the staircase pulling his chair behind him. He mingled at the event for a time and then, because he was in his wheelchair, made his way out through a back room in the hope of finding an easier route to street level. He suddenly found himself in the company of Senators John Kerry and Loretta Sanchez, and Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta. Senator John Kerry with Tuy Tuy being Tuy, he introduced himself and they chatted. He learned that President Clinton was about to give a speech in the lobby downstairs. This was Tuy’s chance. He raced down to the small area beside the main staircase and sure enough, people were setting up a podium. He parked his wheelchair in front and waited. By the time Bill Clinton came out, the lobby was packed. Tuy recalls how the president spoke about his hopes for “normalisation” between Vietnam and the US - and how the internet would help future Vietnamese businesses. He also mentioned, says Tuy, how much he loved pho - a traditional Vietnamese noodle soup. At the end, the president moved towards the front row of the crowd to shake hands. With a big smile, Tuy grabbed the president’s hand with both of his - as is the way in Vietnamese culture when meeting someone important. Bill Clinton, in return, grabbed Tuy’s hands in the same fashion. “I had a speech hastily made up in my mind,” says Tuy. “I said that I had been watching Vietnam change for nine years, and I wanted to thank him for normalising relations. “I told him I was born here, but had gotten polio and been adopted by a family in America and grown up in Berkeley. “I went through my whole history as fast as I could, including the peace walk in ’91, and how I had found my Vietnamese family in ’93. “I said it was due to his decision to normalise relations with Vietnam that so many more overseas Vietnamese could now return and be reunited with their families, their culture and their motherland. “I thought he’d release my hand at this point, but instead he replied that it was people like me who made the whole trip worthwhile and he was glad to have done it.” Tuy says the president then asked if he could have a photo with him - and called his official photographer over. That long handshake made the national evening news that night in Vietnam. Again - just like the day he was reunited with his birth-mother in Sa Dec - Tuy was a mini-celebrity. A hundred photos that tell a hundred stories are dotted along the walls of a large, modern house in Sa Dec. They all revolve around Tuy’s adventures. It’s almost as if Forrest Gump had a real-life Vietnamese counterpart. There are snapshots from when Tuy was first reunited with Thi Be - and the time he took her and his older sister to the Philippines in 2008 to be reunited with his biological father Pantaleon. There are also pictures of the Vietnamese woman Tuy married in 2016. Huong - or Katie as she is also known - was introduced to Tuy by a mutual friend after she had returned from a four-year business course in Japan. She ended up working for Tuy at his custom jewellery business. One thing led to another, and the couple fell in love. Huong and Tuy Now, for the first time in five years, Tuy’s entire extended Vietnamese family have come together for a feast. It's being held in the home of Tuy's older sister Phuong. Tuy built the house for his mother, Thi Be, but she now stays with him and Huong in their apartment in Ho Chi Minh City. As I sit out back with Tuy, sipping steaming-hot Vietnamese green tea from tiny cracked jade-coloured porcelain glasses, he is keen to stress that a story of an adoptee meeting his biological parents is nothing new. But the story that isn’t told, he says, is what comes next. That’s the long process of integration, the challenges that face the adoptee as he or she tries to bond with their new family. And likewise, the family getting to know their long-lost son, daughter, brother or sister. Tuy's biological father and mother - with baby Phuong Tuy cherishes his extended family in Vietnam, the US and the Philippines - and in 2016, at his wedding, he fulfilled one of his life goals by bringing members from all three branches together. Thomas, Thi Be, Huong and Tuy After eating and drinking, the entire family sits together in the living room. Tuy, his siblings, mother and aunts all speak of the trials they have faced together. His younger half-brothers and sister explain how scared they were of Tuy at first - and how hard it was to understand him and his character. Tears flow freely as the whole family talk about their shared history. “Tears of joy or sadness?” I ask. Without hesitation, and in unison, they respond “vui”. Translated into English, it means “happiness”. Built with Shorthand",Negative,1.582602e-06
"Barclays says it has resolved a glitch that left frustrated customers locked out of their online accounts for hours on Thursday. The problem began during the morning and hit the Barclays website and telephone banking. Fed-up customers took to social media to vent their frustration as the outage continued through the day. A Barclays spokesperson said: ""We're very sorry about the technical problems our customers have experienced today."" The spokesperson added: ""Everything is now back up and running and we're really grateful for customers bearing with us."" Earlier, the bank had told customers they would still be able to use the Barclays Mobile Banking app to check their balance, as well as make and receive payments. Customers were told: ""You should still be able still make payments to existing payees through mobile banking. However, new payees aren't possible at the moment due to the incident."" It also told them: ""You can still use your card to make purchases as normal"" and ""payments into accounts are unaffected by the issues we've faced today"". But one alarmed customer said money had disappeared from his account. Paul Girling told the BBC: ""A significant payment due into my account has gone missing. It has been confirmed as sent but not received."" Meanwhile Julia from London told the BBC: ""The systems have also gone down inside branches with no transactions possible. ""My friend just called from inside one. The manager was trying to placate customers and couldn't advise when they would be back online.

The latest banking problems follow TSB's huge IT meltdown earlier this year, following a botched IT switch which saw customers locked out of their accounts. Meanwhile customers of online challenger bank Cashplus - which targets people with poor credit histories - were unable to access their accounts, make cash withdrawals, or make or receive payments earlier this week. The problems have prompted Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, to ask Richard Wagner, chief executive officer of Cashplus, for an explanation and what compensation he is paying victims of the outage. She said: ""While Cashplus may not be regulated as a bank, it claims to offer 'the UK's most seamless banking services experience'. Its customers rightly expect continuous access to their accounts, and it should be held to the same standards of operational resilience as a retail bank.

"This video can not be played Theresa May says hers is the ""only plan on the table"" that could achieve a frictionless Irish border Theresa May has just tried to put a brave face on it. Number 10 had not hoped for a breakthrough at this summit in Salzburg. But they were confident of getting a fair wind for the controversial compromise she agreed with her Cabinet in the heat of the summer. Mrs May has just told a clammy, tiny room full of journalists: ""I believe that there is willingness to do a deal but let nobody be in any doubt, that as I've always said, we are preparing for no deal."" But the comments from President of the European Council Donald Tusk give a pretty bleak assessment of the UK's plan. Tusk: May's Brexit plan won't work He and other EU leaders have expressed doubts before. But his bold comments only minutes after a private meeting with Mrs May that the plan ""does not work"", are more stark, and more damaging than expected. That's because Donald Tusk has been seen as one of those brokers in the Brexit talks who has been trying to make things work, and trying to urge others who are more reluctant to do so, to show the UK a little flexibility. Can the prime minister really cling on to her Chequers plan now? The EU clearly won't accept it as it stands. Significant chunks of her party won't wear the deal either. The opposition parties won't back her. Of course there are tactics at play here. One government minister has already suggested that the EU always knows how to overplay their hand. Sometimes in negotiations, there needs to be a crisis to focus minds. And in her press conference, Theresa May seemed frustrated that her proposals perhaps have not been properly digested or considered yet. Of course this is only one day, one set of fraught meetings, in a tangled and lengthy process. But as things stand, it seems Theresa May is going to have to budge, or walk away.

"This video can not be played Sheriff Jeff Gahler said there had been multiple fatalities and multiple people wounded A woman shot dead three people and injured three more before turning a gun on herself in an attack at a warehouse complex in Maryland, US police say. The shooting happened on Thursday morning at a pharmacy distribution centre in Perryman, near Baltimore. The attacker, Snochia Moseley, 26, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The motive for her attack is unclear. Mass shootings by women are rare, with more than 95% of such attacks in the US carried out by men. The victims who died included Sunday Aguda, 45, Brindra Giri, 41, and Hayleen Reyes, 41, police said on Friday. The shooter was a temporary employee who reported for work as usual that morning, Harford County Sheriff's Office said. But shortly after 09:00 local time (13:00 GMT) she began shooting outside, then inside the facility, with a 9mm Glock handgun that she had brought with her. Police were on the scene within five minutes, by which time the shooter had killed three people and injured three more. Officers found the suspect in a critical condition, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head - she died later in hospital. She was from Baltimore County, police said. She legally owned and had registered the handgun, and had taken several magazines of ammunition with her, police said. The sheriff's office initially urged residents to avoid the area, which is about 40km (25 miles) north-east of Baltimore, as hundreds of employees evacuated the facility and nearby buildings. FBI agents were deployed to the scene just minutes after the shooting Investigators say the suspect was ""suffering from a mental illness and over the last two weeks had become increasingly agitated"". They say she had been employed at the facility for less than two weeks before the attack. She had no criminal arrest record, but had her car stopped three times in the area in just the past month. The suspect was issued tickets for not having proper vehicle registration, among other infractions,according to the Baltimore Sun newspaper,external. Authorities have described her as ""disgruntled"". A school friend told the newspaper that she was not an angry person but felt the ""world was against her"".

"Data was gathered to help campaigning during the UK referendum A Canadian analytics firm that worked for Vote Leave has received the UK's first formal notice under a key data law, the UK's data protection watchdog has confirmed. AggregateIQ (AIQ) was accused of processing people's data ""for purposes which they would not have expected"". The firm has appealed againstthe notice, which was issued by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office.,external Law firmMishcon de Reya said the notice was ""significant"".,external If the company fails to appeal to the ICO's notice or does not comply with it, it could face a large fine. The Information Commissioner's Office confirmed the story to the BBC. AIQ is a small Canadian data firm that uses data to target online ads at voters during public polls. It was paid nearly Â£2.7m ($3.6m) by Vote Leave to target ads at prospective voters during the Brexit referendum campaign. It was also used by pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. Vote Leave has been fined Â£61,000 and referred to the police after an Electoral Commission probe said it broke electoral law by exceeding its spending limit by funnelling money through BeLeave. AIQ also received funding from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party and Veterans for Britain, amounting to a total of Â£3.5m from all of its pro-Brexit clients. The ICO said that although the data was gathered before 25 May, when the GDPR regulations came into effect, it was concerned about the ""continued retention and processing"" of data after that date. This, it said, meant GDPR applied to AIQ's handling of that information. Earlier this year it was linked to UK data firm Cambridge Analytica by whistleblower Chris Wylie, who alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired Facebook data belonging to 50 million people via a third party. Cambridge Analytica has been credited with helping Donald Trump win the US presidential election in 2016. Electoral Commission 'misinterpreted' Vote Leave expenses, court rules Vote Leave's targeted Brexit ads released by Facebook Vote Leave broke electoral law, says Electoral Commission Mr Wylie told the Guardian newspaper in March that staff at the now defunct Cambridge Analytica referred to AIQ as ""our Canadian office"". AIQ rejects this description and says it is 100% Canadian-owned. Following the allegations, Facebook suspended both firms from its platform. AggregateIQ denied any wrongdoing and stated that it ""works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where we operate"". Facebook suspended AIQ following allegations about its data use AIQ has previously denied any direct links to Cambridge Analytica. It has also denied ever employing Mr Wylie. ""We appealed the enforcement notice to the first level tribunal [a legal mechanism for challenging ICO notices],"" a spokesman for AIQ told the BBC, though he declined to comment further. ""It was just a matter of time before it would happen,"" said Sandra Wachter, a data regulation expert at the University of Oxford.'s Internet Institute. ""The GDPR makes it very clear that if you process data within the EU obviously the laws are applicable but also if you transfer data out of the EUâ¦ or if you are targeting European markets then the GDPR is also applicable."" Meaningful data protection meant that such issues had to be considered ""globally not just locally"", she told the BBC. According to Mishcon de Reya, the ICO's notice is phrased in relatively vague terms. Dean Armstrong QC, chairman of the independent legal advisory service Elias Partnership, told the BBC he agreed with that assessment. ""The ICO has given very vague instructions that are not particularly helpful,"" he said. ""Perhaps the vagueness of the terminology is a deliberate ploy to ensure entities take an extremely cautious approach in changing their data-handling activities.""

"Australian full-back Israel Folau is one of many rugby stars with large tattoos Tattooed rugby players will be asked to cover up during next year's World Cup in Japan to avoid offending people, the sport's governing body has said. In Japan, tattoos have long been associated with the notorious yakuza crime syndicates and inked tourists can find themselves barred from traditional communal hot springs, or onsens. Players are being asked to wear vests when using gyms or pools. Tattoos are common among players, especially Pacific Islanders. But tournament director Alan Gilpin said there had been no objections from teams. ""When we raised it with the teams a year or so ago, we were probably expecting a frustrated reaction from them, but there hasn't been at all,"" he said. ""We have done a lot in the last year or so with the teams to get them to understand that. ""The idea of putting a rash-vest [shirt used for watersports] on in the pool or in a gym, they will buy into as they want to respect the Japanese culture. We'll position it as self-policing."" Japan spas urged to relax tattoo rules Yakuza boss caught after tattoos go viral Japan artist's beautiful macabre tattoos The New Zealand All Blacks have confirmed that their players - many of whom sport full or half-sleeve tattoos - will comply. ""When any of our teams tour we endeavour to be respectful of the local customs and culture, and this will be no different when we visit Japan both this year and next year,"" New Zealand Rugby chief rugby officer Nigel Cass told news website Stuff. This video can not be played Japanâs tattoo artists fear the loss of centuries of culture, after a landmark court case In 2016, Japan's tourism agency called on spas in the country to relax their rules, pointing out that there are major cultural differences between how tattoos are viewed at home and abroad. The organisation suggested that onsens and bath houses could offer visitors stickers to cover up their tattoos, or set aside specific times of day when tattooed bathers can use the facilities. A 2015 survey found that 56% of hotels and inns did not allow tattooed guests to use communal bathing facilities. Tattoos have not always had a negative image in Japan, but they became linked to the yakuza, or Japanese mafia, in the 1960s after a deluge of films showed heavily-inked gangsters. The yakuza gangs have been part of Japanese society for centuries and have an estimated 35,000 members. This video can not be played Who are Japan's yakuza? In 60 secs The end of Japanese tattoo art?

A Barclays spokesperson said: ""We're very sorry about the technical problems our customers have experienced today."" The spokesperson added: ""Everything is now back up and running and we're really grateful for customers bearing with us."" Earlier, the bank had told customers they would still be able to use the Barclays Mobile Banking app to check their balance, as well as make and receive payments. Customers were told: ""You should still be able still make payments to existing payees through mobile banking. However, new payees aren't possible at the moment due to the incident."" It also told them: ""You can still use your card to make purchases as normal"" and ""payments into accounts are unaffected by the issues we've faced today"". But one alarmed customer said money had disappeared from his account. Paul Girling told the BBC: ""A significant payment due into my account has gone missing. It has been confirmed as sent but not received."" Meanwhile Julia from London told the BBC: ""The systems have also gone down inside branches with no transactions possible.

The latest banking problems follow TSB's huge IT meltdown earlier this year, following a botched IT switch which saw customers locked out of their accounts. Meanwhile customers of online challenger bank Cashplus - which targets people with poor credit histories - were unable to access their accounts, make cash withdrawals, or make or receive payments earlier this week. The problems have prompted Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, to ask Richard Wagner, chief executive officer of Cashplus, for an explanation and what compensation he is paying victims of the outage. She said: ""While Cashplus may not be regulated as a bank, it claims to offer 'the UK's most seamless banking services experience'. Its customers rightly expect continuous access to their accounts, and it should be held to the same standards of operational resilience as a retail bank.

"The visit of Moon Jae-in (R) took in the symbolic Mt Paektu North Korea's leader wants to complete denuclearisation quickly and hold a second summit with Donald Trump soon, South Korea's president says. President Moon Jae-in, who has ended a landmark trip to the North, said Kim Jong-un also wanted US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to visit again. Mr Pompeo said earlier he was ready to restart negotiations, stalled since the first Trump-Kim summit in June. Mr Pompeo said the aim was denuclearising North Korea ""by 2021"". Peace on the Korean peninsula? North Korea's woeful human rights record North Korea crisis in 300 words Moon Jae-in arrived back in Seoul on Thursday after a high-profile, three-day visit - the first by a Southern leader to the North's capital in a decade. Mr Moon said: ""Kim Jong-un expressed his wish that he wanted to complete denuclearisation quickly and focus on economic development. ""He said he hoped Mike Pompeo would visit North Korea soon, and also a second summit with Trump would take place in the near future, in order to move the denuclearisation process along quickly."" This video can not be played North Korea's agreed to shut one of the country's main missile launch sites. Laura Bicker considers what might happen next. Mr Kim had made pledges during earlier meetings with Mr Moon and Mr Trump about denuclearising the Korean peninsula but there were few specifics and US-North Korea progress faltered. Mr Kim this week, however, agreed to shut one of the country's main missile testing and launch sites, at Tongchang-ri. This, along with what Mr Moon described as agreement ""on a way to achieve denuclearisation"" appears to have swayed the US. Mr Pompeo said it was ""on the basis of these important commitments"" that the US was ""prepared to engage immediately in negotiations"". Plans were laid out for a reciprocal visit by Mr Kim to Seoul - which would make him the first North Korean leader to do so. Images: Moon's landmark appearance at mass games Did Moon do enough to revive diplomacy? Mr Moon gave a historic speech to thousands of North Koreans On Wednesday evening, Mr Moon and his host attended a show of the North Korean Arirang propaganda festival. The South Korean president gave a speech to tens of thousands of North Koreans, speaking both about reunification and the aim to denuclearise the Korean peninsula. Mr Moon's trip to Mount Paektu was also highly symbolic. South Korea's national anthem opens with a reference to the volcano while for the North it is the alleged birthplace of Mr Kim's father and grandfather, and is used in propaganda to reinforce the cult of personality around the ruling family. Mr Moon has stated that visiting Mount Paektu was a ""long unfulfilled dream"". President Moon, with his wife Kim Jung-sook, filled a bottle with water from Mt Paektu's Heaven Lake ""Many people in the South would go to Mount Paektu from the China side, but I decided not to, pledging myself that I would go stepping on our soil,"" he told Mr Kim at the summit. ""But time flew so fast, and I thought my wish may not come true, but it did today."" Summit puts diplomacy back on track Moon's speech at mass games Moon's red carpet welcome in N Korea.

"Game of Thrones draws big audiences for Sky in the UK The takeover of broadcaster Sky will be settled by an auction, the UK's Takeover Panel has announced. The broadcaster has been subject to rival bids from Rupert Murdoch's Fox and US conglomerate Comcast. The Takeover Panel said that the auction would start at 17:00 London time on Friday and end on Saturday evening. It said all parties had agreed to the process, which will have a maximum of three rounds. Fox had looked set to take over the 61% of Sky it does not already own until Comcast topped Fox's bid. Fox raised its offer to Â£24.5bn, but this was soon trumped by a Â£26bn bid from Comcast. The process has also been beset by regulatory issues amid concerns over media plurality and the degree of Mr Murdoch's influence over the UK media landscape. Ian Whittaker, head of European media research at Liberum Capital, said it was rare for takeovers to go to an auction in this way, but it would ensure that the long-running battle for Sky came to a conclusion. He said: ""To give credit to the Takeover Panel, what they have done is to act decisively to stop this thing dragging on. ""It's a very unusual course of action, but it's the best course of action."" Sky is ""a jewel in a crown"", says media analyst Alice Enders. The broadcaster has nearly 23 million pay-TV subscribers in Europe, with more scope for expansion there than in the US, and it has a broadband business. In February, Sky Sports won the rights to UK Premier League TV packages, and Sky also licenses shows including Game of Thrones, as well as producing its own original content. No matter who wins the bidding war, Sky subscribers are likely to face higher prices, Ms Enders says. The bidding war has pushed Sky's price up to more than Â£24bn, and that is likely to be recouped from customers, she says. Read the full analysis here Also at issue is the fate of 24-hour news channel Sky News, which could end up being sold separately or ring-fenced in order to preserve its editorial integrity. Sky has nearly 23 million pay-TV subscribers in the UK and Ireland, Italy, Austria and Germany. It reported pre-tax profits up 7.5% over the 12 months to the end of June and added more than 500,000 customers across Europe. The future of Sky has been hanging in the balance for more than eight years - and the nature of the game has changed in the meantime. The process began when Mr Murdoch's original News Corp put forward a bid for full control of what was then BSkyB. That bid was scuppered by the phone-hacking scandal that engulfed Mr Murdoch's UK tabloid newspapers and tarnished the firm's reputation. The bid was revived in December 2016, by which time News Corp had been broken up, leaving 21st Century Fox as one of its successors. The process has been complicated by Disney's deal to buy most of Fox's assets, which is due to be completed next year if approved by international regulators.

"This video can not be played Footage shows passengers on the flight reaching for oxygen masks More than 30 Indian passengers, some bleeding from their noses and ears, have received treatment after pilots ""forgot"" to turn on a switch regulating cabin pressure, officials said. Jet Airways flight 9W 697 from Mumbai to Jaipur turned back shortly after take off. Videos tweeted by passengers aboard the plane showed oxygen masks deployed inside the aircraft. The Boeing 737, which was carrying 166 passengers, landed safely. The aviation ministry said the cockpit crew had been taken off duty pending an investigation. Lalit Gupta, a senior official of India's aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), told the Hindustan Times newspaper that the crew had forgotten to select a switch to maintain cabin pressure. Jet Airways said in a statement that Thursday morning's flight had turned back ""due to loss in cabin pressure"" and ""regretted"" the inconvenience caused to its passengers. ""The B737 aircraft, with 166 guests and 5 crew landed normally in Mumbai. All guests were deplaned safely and taken to the terminal. First aid was administered to few guests who complained of ear pain, bleeding nose etc,"" the statement said. The airline said it was co-operating fully with the DGCA investigation.

"The search for Michael Spurr's successor will begin in October The head of the prison and probation service has been asked to step down after nine years amid an ongoing crisis in English and Welsh jails. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said Michael Spurr was prompted to resign because a ""fresh direction"" and new leadership structure was needed. Mr Spurr will leave his post in March 2019, the Ministry of Justice said. The news comes after Prisons Minister Rory Stewart admitted problems with drugs and violence in numerous jails. Last week, thousands of prison officers walked out for six hours in a protest at ""unprecedented violence"" in British prisons. Mr Stewartsaid that he would resign if the situation had not improved within a year. Probation system 'a mess' despite reforms Private probation contracts ended early by government In a statement announcing the departure, Justice Secretary David Gauke said he was ""extremely grateful"" to Mr Spurr ""for his leadership of HMPPS"". He added the formal process to appoint Mr Spurr's successor will start in October. In June,MPs described the systemfor supervising criminals in England and Wales as a ""mess"". The Commons justice committee said HMPPS reforms had failed to meet their aims, adding it was ""unconvinced"" reforms could ever deliver an effective probation service. One month later, it was announced that private companies that run probation services wouldhave their government contracts ended in 2020, two years earlier than planned. Many prisons in England and Wales have seen surging levels of violence, drug use and self-harm in recent years. Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, has demanded government action at four jails in less than a year, including three state-run establishments. Last week he triggered an ""urgent notification"" for HMP Bedford after an inspection found inmates had effectively taken over the violent, overcrowded and vermin-infested prison. In his annual report for 2017/18, the chief inspector highlighted how thousands of inmates are living in ""squalid"" and overcrowded cells, locked up for nearly 24 hours a day. Richard Heaton, permanent secretary at the MoJ said on Thursday it was time to ""look ahead"". Mr Heaton said the next chief executive would need to develop ""a strategy for the next decade"". Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said Mr Spurr would be ""an extraordinarily hard act to follow"". Mr Dawson added: ""He is an exceptionally principled and knowledgeable leader who has selflessly served an endless succession of short term ministers.""

"Australian full-back Israel Folau is one of many rugby stars with large tattoos Tattooed rugby players will be asked to cover up during next year's World Cup in Japan to avoid offending people, the sport's governing body has said. In Japan, tattoos have long been associated with the notorious yakuza crime syndicates and inked tourists can find themselves barred from traditional communal hot springs, or onsens. Players are being asked to wear vests when using gyms or pools. Tattoos are common among players, especially Pacific Islanders. But tournament director Alan Gilpin said there had been no objections from teams. ""When we raised it with the teams a year or so ago, we were probably expecting a frustrated reaction from them, but there hasn't been at all,"" he said. ""We have done a lot in the last year or so with the teams to get them to understand that. ""The idea of putting a rash-vest [shirt used for watersports] on in the pool or in a gym, they will buy into as they want to respect the Japanese culture. We'll position it as self-policing."" Japan spas urged to relax tattoo rules Yakuza boss caught after tattoos go viral Japan artist's beautiful macabre tattoos The New Zealand All Blacks have confirmed that their players - many of whom sport full or half-sleeve tattoos - will comply. ""When any of our teams tour we endeavour to be respectful of the local customs and culture, and this will be no different when we visit Japan both this year and next year,"" New Zealand Rugby chief rugby officer Nigel Cass told news website Stuff. This video can not be played Japanâs tattoo artists fear the loss of centuries of culture, after a landmark court case In 2016, Japan's tourism agency called on spas in the country to relax their rules, pointing out that there are major cultural differences between how tattoos are viewed at home and abroad. The organisation suggested that onsens and bath houses could offer visitors stickers to cover up their tattoos, or set aside specific times of day when tattooed bathers can use the facilities. A 2015 survey found that 56% of hotels and inns did not allow tattooed guests to use communal bathing facilities. Tattoos have not always had a negative image in Japan, but they became linked to the yakuza, or Japanese mafia, in the 1960s after a deluge of films showed heavily-inked gangsters. The yakuza gangs have been part of Japanese society for centuries and have an estimated 35,000 members. This video can not be played Who are Japan's yakuza? In 60 secs The end of Japanese tattoo art?

"The 'cat killer' was thought to have been behind the death of Missy, who went missing in Coulsdon in December 2015 The so-called Croydon cat killer does not exist, the Metropolitan Police has confirmed. The force launched an investigation in 2015 into reports of mutilated cats in Croydon and the surrounding area. Twenty-five post-mortem examinations were carried out but found no evidence of ""human involvement"". Scotland Yard said injuries inflicted on cats were ""likely to be the result of predation or scavenging by wildlife on cats killed in vehicle collisions"". Foxes are believed to be behind some of the mutilations. During the probe, detectives received more than 400 similar reports of cats being mutilated across London and surrounding counties. However, all of the cases will now be recorded as ""no crime"". Ukiyo's remains were found on a neighbour's doorstep in West Norwood in September 2015 Commander Amanda Pearson said each individual report had to be investigated, which led to an ""increased workload"" for officers working on the case. ""The decision was made to allocate a large number of similar reports of mutilated cats to the officers who were investigating the initial spate of such allegations,"" she said. Latest news and stories from London ""In particular, they were following up six suspicious cases identified by the post-mortem examinations. ""It is this collating of reports that enabled officers to work with experts and reach the conclusion that no further police investigations are required into any of the allegations relating to mutilated cats."" The cat killer stalking suburbia 'Croydon cat killer': Animals lured with raw chicken Five Northampton cat deaths linked to 'Croydon cat killer' probe The Met's inquiry found there was CCTV footage showing foxes carrying pet body parts in three cases. Dr Henny Martineau, head of veterinary forensic pathology at the Royal Veterinary College, carried out post-mortems on the six cats whose deaths were initially treated as ""suspicious"". She found puncture wounds not previously uncovered on some of the animals and concluded some had been potentially scavenged. Police started investigating the animal killings in 2015 Ch Insp Stuart Orton from Hertfordshire Police, which led a linked investigation, said the prospect of ""a person or persons travelling the country and mutilating animals"" had been ""eliminated"". ""Evidence suggests the animals had been predated by foxes - in a rabbit's case after being removed from a hutch, and in a cat's case after death, likely caused by a road traffic collision,"" he said. ""I hope this conclusion brings comfort to pet owners who have, up until now, been frightened to let their animals out at night."" Boudicca Rising, of Snarl, has investigated cat deaths alongside police The Met worked alongside the RSPCA and Croydon-based group South Norwood Animal Rescue Liberty (Snarl). Despite police saying ""there were no witnesses, no identifiable patterns and no forensic leads that pointed to human involvement"",  Snarl released a statement saying it was ""surprised"" by the announcement. It said: ""We consider that the evidence we have gathered over the last three years does indicate human involvement and there is expert opinion to back this up."" At one point during the three-year investigation a Â£10,000 reward was offered for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for mutilations in Greater London, Surrey, Kent, Manchester, Birmingham, St Albans and Northamptonshire. Ivy was found dead and her body was kept in a freezer so it could be re-examined One cat owner, Naomi, spoke to the BBC about finding her cat Ivy'sdecapitated body discarded by the side of a road in Northamptonshire. ""I was very emotional. I couldn't stop crying,"" she said. Although she searched for Ivy's head, she wasn't able to find it. Naomi had to take three weeks off work with depression and anxiety and said she struggled with nightmares and interrupted sleep. Ivy's death had ""caused so much pain, and a feeling of anger"", she added. The Met urged people to report cases, where there is no direct evidence of human involvement, to the RSPCA.

"Workers from McDonald's also went on strike last year A co-ordinated day of strike action is planned by workers at a small number of JD Wetherspoon, McDonald's and TGI Fridays outlets over pay. A rally is planned for 4 October in London, the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU) said. The workers want to obtain a pay deal of Â£10 an hour. JD Wetherspoon said it had increased pay for workers, while McDonald's said the action was not widespread. TGI Fridays had no immediate comment. The strike is part of an international day of action by fast-food workers, a BFAWU spokesperson said. The union spokesperson confirmeda report in the Guardian,externalthat workers at two Wetherspoon pubs in Brighton - The Bright Helm and The Post & Telegraph - were preparing to join the action. Workers from three TGI Fridays chains and four McDonald's outlets were also expected to join the rally, which the BFAWU said had been inspired by industrial action in the hospitality sector last year. TGI Friday workers in London's Covent Garden demonstrated about pay conditions earlier this year Workers from McDonald's staged theirfirst strike in the UK last yearin a dispute over zero-hours contracts and conditions while TGI Fridays staff in Milton Keynes and Covent Garden walked outin May in a row about tips and wages. Chris Heppell, a team leader at The Post & Telegraph pub, told the BBC he and co-workers had seen the McDonald's strike and felt inspired. The 29 year-old is on Â£8.65 an hour and said he paid extortionate rent and worked in a ""physically and emotionally"" exhausting job. A rise to Â£10 an hour would ""give me an opportunity to pay off debts"". ""We don't feel we have a voice and if we come together then collectively we will be listened to,"" Mr Heppell said.

Lauren McCourt, a worker at McDonald's, said: ""We're joining with Wetherspoon's and TGI Friday's workers because when we come together, hospitality workers have the power to transform our sector."" A spokesperson for McDonald's said the chain had been notified of industrial action in four outlets - Cambridge, Crayford, Watford and Brixton.

"This video can not be played Transport secretary Chris Grayling: Passengers were let down ""No-one took charge"" during the timetable chaos that caused severe disruption on Britain's railways in May, a regulator has said. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) blamed a lack of ""responsibility and accountability"" and said passengers were ""badly treated"". It said track manager Network Rail, two train operators and the Department for Transport ""had all made mistakes"". It came as the government promised a major review of Britain's railways. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling - who had previously insisted: ""I don't run the railways"" - told the BBC's Today programme that the problem was system-wide and that it was his job to ""make sure it doesn't happen again"". He said he had taken at ""face value"" assurances by industry-leaders that they were ready to make the changes. The unhappy face of rail travellers From 20 May, passengers suffered delays and cancellations after the rail industry attempted to introduce the biggest timetable change in a generation. The upgrade - which involved changes to 46% of train times - mainly affected Northern Trains in the north west of England and Govia Thameslink (GTR) routes into London. The ORR assessed the causes, consequences and management of the disruption Over a period of several weeks, GTR and Northern cancelled up to 470 and 310 scheduled trains respectively each weekday. ORR chairman Prof Stephen Glaister said: ""Good intentions and over-optimism within the rail industry about its ability to recover missed deadlines left no time to uncover and fix problems. Rail timetable chaos inquiry launched Northern axe trains in timetable reshuffle ""When problems arose, timetable planners were stretched and train operators were ill-equipped to help passengers."" Prof Glaister told the BBC ""it was unclear"" who should have the responsibility for tackling the problems. But, following a three-month inquiry, the ORR found the causes of the botched rollout dated back years. These included delays with Network Rail's electrification work in northern England, as well as late changes to the Thameslink programme. This pushed back the development of the timetable and gave train operators less time to prepare for the introduction of new services. Rail users expressed their frustrations at Manchester Piccadilly during the disruption The ORR also said that: Network Rail was best placed to manage these risks but did not take sufficient action Neither GTR or Northern were prepared for the disruption that arose, nor did they do enough to provide accurate information to passengers Both the Department for Transport (DfT) and the ORR itself failed in their duties to oversee the industry Prof Glaister told the BBC that the ORR itself had failings - like everyone else in the industry. ""We took on trust what we were told,"" he said. ""What happened here is that railway people have a tradition of sorting out problems as they occur. ""That led to complacency when in the process of planning the timetables - deadlines were missed, late decisions were made so that operators didn't have time to deliver a proper service on the day."" Tom Burridge, Transport correspondent This report underlines an inherent weakness in our rail system; No single entity or person is in overall control. The mayhem resulting from a complicated shake-up of timetables on Northern and Govia Thameslink was the product of systemic failings over several months. But as the problems built up on both Network Rail and Govia Thameslink in the run-up to the launch of the new schedules, it seems that no-one properly flagged up the risks and the potential that it all might go badly wrong. Officials from Network Rail, the Department for Transport (DfT) and the train companiesweremeeting. Industry sources say DfT officials were briefed that things weren't going to plan. The Transport Secretary Chris Grayling says he received the necessary assurances from the train companies. So the infamous and well-known British train blame game rolls on. Andrew Haines, the boss of Network Rail, offered his ""sincerest apologies to passengers for letting them down with May's timetable troubles"". ""A whole system approach to timetable planning must be the way ahead and we have already started on that path with the new winter timetable due in December that will see some modest improvements."" The DfT said it welcomed the ORR's findings and called May's disruption ""unacceptable"". The resignation of Charles Horton, chief executive of GTR,was announced in June. Mr Grayling, when asked if other resignations were needed, said the report found Northern Rail's problems were linked to local infrastructure problems. Northern Rail said the report found ""that the root cause of the timetable disruption was delays to engineering projects to improve the railway"". It said train operators were usually given 40 weeks to plan the twice-yearly introduction but had to rewrite its May 2018 timetable in 16 weeks. The company added it was ""deeply sorry"" for the disruption, saying it had reinstated 151 of the 165 services hit by the problems. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group which represents train companies and Network Rail, said the rail industry was determined to learn from the issues to avoid a repeat. He added: ""The structural issues highlighted in this report underline the need for the wide-ranging, root and branch rail review we have been calling for to deliver meaningful reform."" The government has also launched what it called the most significant review of the rail industry since privatisation, headed by former British Airways boss Keith Williams. It comes amid significant challenges, with punctuality at a 12-year low and commuters facing an increase of up to 3.2% in the cost of season tickets from January. The DfT said the review would consider all parts of the sector, including accountability, the franchising system and value for money for passengers and taxpayers. Mr Grayling told the BBC: ""The fragmentation of the industry today doesn't work"". ""What I am absolutely certain of is we need an integrated railway"". He pointed to Japan where the rail companies were integrated and  London where contracts were performance-related. Labour wantsto nationalise the industrybut Mr Grayling told the BBC: ""It's not about ownership... it's about the pressure on the system.""

The force launched an investigation in 2015 into reports of mutilated cats in Croydon and the surrounding area. Twenty-five post-mortem examinations were carried out but found no evidence of ""human involvement"". Scotland Yard said injuries inflicted on cats were ""likely to be the result of predation or scavenging by wildlife on cats killed in vehicle collisions"".

"Tony Chambers said it had been a ""particularly challenging"" time as he stepped down The chief executive of a hospital where an investigation into the deaths of babies is taking place has resigned. Tony Chambers said it had been a ""particularly challenging"" time at the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust as he stepped down. There is no suggestion that his resignation is linked to developments in the police inquiry. The hospital has been at the centre of an investigation into a series of baby deaths at its neonatal unit. A nurse arrested on suspicion of murdering eight babies at the hospital wasreleased on bail in July. Lucy Letby was also held on suspicion of the attempted murder of another six babies. Cheshire Constabularylaunched its investigation in May 2017. Police will focus on eight unexplained deaths at the neonatal unit between June 2015 and July 2016 The trust had contacted the force in relation to a greater number of baby deaths and collapses than normally expected between June 2015 and June 2016. Mr Chambers, who has been at the helm for six years, said: ""It has been a huge privilege to be the chief executive of Countess of Chester Hospital for the past six years. Hospital baby deaths probed by police Murder arrest over hospital baby deaths Nurse arrested over baby deaths is bailed ""Recent times have been particularly challenging for the hospital not least of which is the ongoing police investigation into an increase in mortality rates in our neonatal unit. ""My thoughts will continue to be with the bereaved families as they await the outcome of the police investigation. ""I have now decided to step aside to allow the trust to focus on its future and for me to explore new opportunities and the next stage of my career.""

"Cary Fukunaga directed the first series of HBO's True Detective The man behind Netflix series Maniac has been named as the director of the next James Bond film. Cary Joji Fukunaga replaces Danny Boyle,who dropped outlast month blaming ""creative differences"". Producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccolipraised Fukunaga's ""versatility and innovation"",external. He recently directed Netflix's dark comedy Maniac, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, and directed season one of True Detective. Fukunaga's work on the HBO crime drama series won him an Emmy in 2014. He also directed 2015's Beasts of No Nation, starring Idris Elba. And the Elba connection wasn't lost on many commentators. He came to prominence when he wrote and directed 2009's Sin Nombre, about the journey of a Honduran young girl and a Mexican gangster across the American border. It won a British Independent Film award for best foreign film, the new director's prize at Edinburgh International Film Festival and picked up three prizes at Sundance. In 2011, he directed an adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, which starred Mia Wasikowska, Michael Fassbender and Jamie Bell. He also directed and executive produced the acclaimed first series of True Detective in 2014, which starred Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. He was also one of the screenwriters on last year's It, Andy Muschietti's adaptation of the Stephen King thriller but thenleft the project,externalhaving been due to direct it. Maniac comes to Netflix on Friday and has a stellar cast which includes Justin Theroux and Sally Field. Speaking to the BBC about Maniac earlier this week, Fukunaga said he gives his actors plenty of freedom. ""I let Jonah be what Jonah wanted to be, obviously with some guidance,"" he said. ""And the same with Emma. Justin came in with his interpretation of Doctor Mantleray, I didn't rein him inâ¦ I was kind of like, this is interesting, it's just the right amount of energy."" Bond's producers added that Fukunaga was an ""excellent choice"" and they were ""delighted"" to be working with him. David Mackenzie, Yann Demange and Joe Wrightwere among the film-makers tipped to take over the director's chair, so Fukunaga is something of a surprise choice. Filming will begin at Pinewood Studios on 4 March and the film will be released on 14 February, 2020. Craig is returning for the new Bond movie Before Boyle's departure was announced, the film was set for a UK release on 25 October 2019, opening in US cinemas two weeks later. But the change of director has inevitably led to a delay. Craig has previously said it will be his final appearance as 007. The most recent Bond film, Spectre, came out in 2015. Cary Joji Fukunaga is something of a surprise choice for the Bond franchise, given that he's such a distinctive filmmaking voice, and the producers tend to go for a 'safe pair of hands'. I was surprised that he was announced after Danny Boyle departed due to creative differences, as Fukunaga left the horror remake It for the same reason. In his career so far, Fukunaga has proved himself across varied material, including immigration thriller Sin Nombre to Charlotte Bronte adaptation Jane Eyre, and he also directed the critically acclaimed first series of True Detective. Even though he doesn't have much action movie experience, that's not generally a problem with films of this scale, as he'll be working with world class department heads who'll steer him through that side of the production, while he focuses on the storytelling. Based on his previous work, I'd expect Fukunaga to bring a strong grasp on character and a slightly sinister tone to the upcoming Bond film. Fukunaga's Maniac drops on Netflix on Friday andhas had a mixed reception from critics. The series follows Stone and Hill's characters as they take part in a drug trial.

"The current US border wall with Mexico, seen from the United States in Nogales, Arizona - prototypes of Donald Trump's proposed wall are being built in California President Trump recommended building a wall across the Sahara to solve Europe's migrant crisis, Spain's foreign minister says. Josep Borrell, also a former President of the European Parliament, disagreed with the strategy. The comments came during a visit Mr Borrell made to the US at the end of June. Mr Trump's pledge to build a wall between the US and Mexico was one of his best-known election promises. Blood-stained clothing pictured hanging from the razor wire fence around the Spanish enclave of Melilla Mr Borrell recounted his conversation with the US president at a lunch event in Madrid this week, Spain's foreign ministry confirmed to the BBC. ""The border with the Sahara cannot be bigger than our border with Mexico,"" Mr Borrell quoted Mr Trump as saying. The US-Mexico border is 1,954 miles (3,145 km) long. The Sahara desert stretches for 3,000 miles. Spain has no sovereignty over the Sahara, but it does possess two small enclaves on the north African coast, Ceuta and Melilla, separated from Morocco by controversial wire fences. The enclaves have become magnets for African migrants seeking a better life in Europe and refugees fleeing persecution and conflict. Since January of this year, at least 35,000 undocumented migrants have arrived in Spain, the highest number received by any Mediterranean EU country. However, Germany - the most popular EU destination for migrants - has been registering more than 10,000 asylum-seekers a month this year.

"Courtney was the favourite heading into the finals British teenager Courtney Hadwin has finished in sixth place in the final of America's Got Talent. The 14-year-old from Hesleden, County Durham, was among the favourites to win the $1m (Â£760,000) prize on Wednesday. She wowed the judges and viewers with energetic and mature covers of rock 'n' roll classics by Tina Turner, James Brown and Steppenwolf. Host Tyra Banks told Hadwin she was proud and said she had ""made it"" for making it to the final 10. Later on, it was Canadian-American magician Shin Lim that was crowned the winner of the talent show. Hadwin performed Tina Turner's 1988 classic River Deep, Mountain High on Tuesday in the first of the two-part finale. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Following the performance, judge Howie Mandel said: ""You are on fire, you're amazing. I love everything about you. We are watching a superstar in the making right here on America's Got Talent."" Earlier in the series, Mandel used his golden buzzer to send the 14-year-old straight through to the quarter finals. Fellow judge Simon Cowell commented that Hadwin was more than just a singer, saying: ""Every time you perform, you inspire people, you are more than a great singer, you are a trendsetter."" Courtney competed last year in the UK's The Voice Kids, where she got through to the live finals after being tutored by McFly's Danny Jones. Courtney was just 13 years old when she first took to the AGT stage According to Courtney's grandfather, the singer, who busked on the streets of London and New York to fund singing lessons, chose to enter America's Got Talent instead of the British version. Speaking to theMailOnline,external, Tom Storey said the UK ""doesn't get her"", adding that the family was ""confident she will do well in the US"". Courtney and her family have been proved right. In the semi-finals, Hadwin performed a cover of Steppenwolf's 1968 hit Born To Be Wild and was described as a ""bundle of excitement"" by Cowell. The music mogul told her: ""You were born to be wild - this was wild! You were amazing. My prediction is you're going to be the winner."" Courtney was just 13 when she performed in the first round of America's Got Talent. Before Tuesday's performance, she thanked fans on social media, saying she had had ""an amazing time"".

"The search for Michael Spurr's successor will begin in October The head of the prison and probation service has been asked to step down after nine years amid an ongoing crisis in English and Welsh jails. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said Michael Spurr was prompted to resign because a ""fresh direction"" and new leadership structure was needed. Mr Spurr will leave his post in March 2019, the Ministry of Justice said. The news comes after Prisons Minister Rory Stewart admitted problems with drugs and violence in numerous jails. Last week, thousands of prison officers walked out for six hours in a protest at ""unprecedented violence"" in British prisons. Mr Stewartsaid that he would resign if the situation had not improved within a year. Probation system 'a mess' despite reforms Private probation contracts ended early by government In a statement announcing the departure, Justice Secretary David Gauke said he was ""extremely grateful"" to Mr Spurr ""for his leadership of HMPPS"". He added the formal process to appoint Mr Spurr's successor will start in October. In June,MPs described the systemfor supervising criminals in England and Wales as a ""mess"". The Commons justice committee said HMPPS reforms had failed to meet their aims, adding it was ""unconvinced"" reforms could ever deliver an effective probation service. One month later, it was announced that private companies that run probation services wouldhave their government contracts ended in 2020, two years earlier than planned. Many prisons in England and Wales have seen surging levels of violence, drug use and self-harm in recent years. Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, has demanded government action at four jails in less than a year, including three state-run establishments. Last week he triggered an ""urgent notification"" for HMP Bedford after an inspection found inmates had effectively taken over the violent, overcrowded and vermin-infested prison. In his annual report for 2017/18, the chief inspector highlighted how thousands of inmates are living in ""squalid"" and overcrowded cells, locked up for nearly 24 hours a day. Richard Heaton, permanent secretary at the MoJ said on Thursday it was time to ""look ahead"". Mr Heaton said the next chief executive would need to develop ""a strategy for the next decade"". Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said Mr Spurr would be ""an extraordinarily hard act to follow"". Mr Dawson added: ""He is an exceptionally principled and knowledgeable leader who has selflessly served an endless succession of short term ministers.""

"This video can not be played Recall petition: North Antrim's unshakable Paisley legacy Ian Paisley has said he is ""stunned"" and ""greatly humbled"" after retaining his seat as an MP. The North Antrim MP will not face a by-election after fewer than 10% of his constituents signed a recall petition. The petition was triggered after the DUP MP wassuspended from Westminster for failing to declare two holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government. ""I think it was a miracle,"" Mr Paisley told BBC News NI. Ian Paisley failed to declare two luxury holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government The petition was the first in UK Parliamentary history. It was open forsix weeks at three North Antrim constituency centres. Profile: Ian Paisley Who are the DUP? Timeline of events The petition needed 7,543 signatures - or 10% of Mr Paisley's constituents - to force a by-election and cause Mr Paisley to lose his seat. It was signed by 7,099 people. Speaking in Ballymena on Thursday, Mr Paisley said the result was evidence that ""people accepted"" his apology and that he had ""put his hands up"". He said: ""90.6% said: we are keeping you, big fella, we like you. ""I can't help the reasons why I am in the news....I could be a shrinking violet...I am not prepared to do that. I can't win in terms of my personality."" This video can not be played Ian Paisley: Petition result a 'miracle' Mr Paisley had been suspended by the DUP ""pending further investigation into his conduct"". But on Thursday the party confirmed that it had readmitted Mr Paisley to the party on Tuesday following an internal investigation. In a statement, the DUP added: ""Upon re-admission he is subject to a number of conditions including a ban on holding office within the party for 12 months. ""The party will be making no further comment on these matters."" Asked whether he expected to be re-instated by the party, the North Antrim MP said that while that decision is ""up to the party officers"", he ""would be surprised if I wasn't (brought back)"". ""I have been punished, I have been docked my salary. ""Going on the holiday was not the issue - not registering it was."" In an earlier statement, he said: ""In July I apologised for a mistake made almost six years ago. ""The electorate was asked to pass judgment - 90.6% have accepted my apology. ""The electorate has clearly spoken. This video can not be played Electoral officer defends petition process ""I would like to thank my true friends, family, the electorate who have stood by me with unwavering support. Hallelujah."" On Thursday morning Mr Paisley updated his Twitter biography to say he had ""90.6% support from recall petition"". The Recall of MPs Bill became law in 2015 under the coalition government. The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, was first to be notified before the result was posted online. Sinn FÃ©in Deputy Leader Michelle O'Neill criticised the DUP's ""minor sanction"" as an effective endorsement of his actions. She said she believed the appropriate action would have been to sack Mr Paisley. Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said the result was no cause for celebration. ""In any other part of the UK, Ian Paisley would have had to resign in disgrace,"" said Ms Armstrong. SDLP Chief Whip Colin McGrath said it was ""disappointing"" and that the DUP should remove Mr Paisley from the party. ""Given the heat around the ongoing RHI investigation, it is imperative Mrs Foster help restore public confidence in politics by acting swiftly to remove Mr Paisley from the party,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann said he would ""caution Ian Paisley not to see this as some sort of victory or endorsement of his actions in acting as a paid advocate for a foreign government and bringing North Antrim and the House of Commons into disrepute"". He suggested that Mr Paisley ""should demonstrate some humility"". Enda McClafferty, BBC News NI Political Correspondent If the petition was to succeed then it needed the support of at least 10% of the electorate in North Antrim. It got 9.4% and was 444 signatures short. That means Ian Paisley will remain in the seat his family has held for almost 50 years. He wasn't there for the count this morning but was told the news in a text from the Chief Electoral Officer, Virginia McVea. She defended how the process was managed. Mr Paisley can now look forward to returning to the House of Commons, once he serves the remainder of his 30-day ban from Westminster. The Chief Electoral Officer in Northern Ireland, Virginia McVea, has defended how the process was managed. ""The access to this electoral event is quite simply unprecedented,"" she told BBC News NI. ""Never before in Northern Ireland has there been postal vote on demand, no reason had to be given, and instead of one day for poll, we ran for six weeks and with two late nights on top."" Mr Paisley's 30-sitting day suspension from the House of Commons began on 4 September, and is one of the longest-ever bans to be handed down at Westminster. According to the Commons library, it is the longest suspension since 1949, which is as far as online records go.,external In July, after Westminster's standards committee announced its recommendations, Mr Paisleyapologised for his behaviourin the Commons. Mr Paisley went on three luxury holidays to Sri Lanka at the expense of the Sri Lankan government in 2013. The committee found the cost ""much higher"" than the Â£50,000 Mr Paisley estimated. In 2014, Mr Paisley wrote to the prime minister to lobby against supporting a UN resolution on Sri Lanka over alleged human rights abuses. By failing to declare his trip, Mr Paisley ""breached the rule against paid advocacy, the committee said. The committee acknowledged that there was ""inconsistent guidance"" in relation to registering such trips, but it did not ""exonerate Mr Paisley from breaching the advocacy rule"".

"Sewing needles have been inserted inside strawberries in Australia Australian supermarket giant Woolworths has temporarily removed sewing needles from its shelves as the country faces a strawberry safety scare. Last week, Australians were warned to cut fresh strawberries before biting into them after several people found sewing needles hidden inside the fruit. Several strawberry brands have been pulled from stores across the country. A country-wide investigation into the scare has since been launched amid growing public alarm. The government has also said it will introduce stricter criminal penalties for anyone found to have been tampering with food. Warning over needles in strawberries Australia's strawberry needle scare widens Apple and banana in Australia needle scares Strawberries Australia Inc, the country's largest industry body for strawberry growers, declined to comment on the move by Woolworths. But many of Australia's strawberry farmers remain frustrated and angry at what they say has been a huge overreaction to the scandal. Woolworths said the safety of its customers was its top priority and that pulling sewing needles from its shelves was a safety measure. ""We've taken the precautionary step of temporarily removing sewing needles from sale in our stores across the country,"" the supermarket told the BBC, but did not say how long the move would last. Sydney-based brand expert Paul Nelson said Woolworths' action could be seen as something of a ""knee jerk reaction"" to the crisis. They could be ""trying to do their bit"" to support farmers struggling with the fallout by taking needles of the shelves, he said, but ""cynically, you could also argue they want to be a part of the conversation and want to appear to be assisting"".

"Valentino Dixon served most of his sentence in New York's notorious Attica Correctional Facility A US convict whose talent for art caught the eye of a prison warden, ultimately leading to a review of his case, has been exonerated of murder. Valentino Dixon's colour pencil drawings of golf courses were featured in Golf Digest - prompting advocates to uncover flawed evidence in the case. Mr Dixon, 48, had maintained his innocence during 27 years behind bars for a shooting in Buffalo, New York. He walked free after another man formally confessed to the murder. Mr Dixon had served nearly two decades at a notorious prison in upstate New York when his artistic flair attracted the notice of correctional authorities. The warden gave him a photograph of the famed Augusta National's 12th hole in the US state of Georgia, and asked if he would draw it for him. ""After 19 years in Attica Correctional Facility, the look of a golf hole spoke to me,"" said Mr Dixon. ""It seemed peaceful. I imagine playing it would be a lot like fishing."" Surprising ways prisoners have won freedom Using colouring pencils, he began to create meticulous, lush drawings of various links and fairways. ""I didn't know anything about golf. I'm from the 'hood,"" he told local media. His sketches impressed the editors at Golf Digest, which featured his artwork anda profile of the prisoner in 2012,external. ""Maybe one day I'll get to play the game I've only imagined,"" Mr Dixon said in the article, describing how he drew landscapes he has never seen. The magazine's coverage spurred wrongful-conviction advocates to look into the matter. Georgetown University law students championed his case. Mr Dixon was handed a minimum 38-year-to-life sentence for killing 17-year-old Torriano Jackson one night in August 1991, after an argument over a girl. He acknowledged being at the crime scene, but said he was at a nearby shop buying beer when the gunshots rang out. Mr Dixon said multiple witnesses could have testified he did not fire the gun. But his trial lawyer did not call any of them as several had been accused of perjury. Unusually, the investigating homicide detective did not testify during the trial either. But a more serious flaw in the case was uncovered byGeorgetown University's Prisons and Justice Initiative,external. Prosecutors had omitted to reveal to Mr Dixon's defence attorney that a gunpowder test on his client's clothes had come back negative. Perhaps even more egregiously, another man, Lamarr Scott, admitted to local media only days after the murder that he shot Torriano Jackson. Scott told a WGRZ-TV reporter,external: ""I don't want my friend [Mr Dixon] to take the rap for something that I did."" Georgetown University students who worked on the case greeted Mr Dixon upon his release But he was never arrested. The victim's brother said he saw Mr Dixon open fire. According to the Buffalo News,external, prosecutors conceded that Scott had been admitting his guilt in the case for a long time. ""Mr Scott has been confessing to this crime since 12 August 1991,"" Assistant District Attorney Sara Dee told the court. ""He has confessed to this crime in excess of 10 times."" Lamarr Scott - who is currently in jail for a separate attack - finally had the chance to formally confess to the crime on Wednesday. Hours later, Mr Dixon was released. ""I grabbed the gun,"" Scott, now 46, told the courtroom in Erie County, New York. ""I pulled the trigger and all the bullets came out. Unfortunately, Torriano ended up dying."" It was Erie County District Attorney John Flynn - in the job less than a year - who ordered a review of the case. But despite Mr Dixon's exoneration, prosecutors say he did provide the murder weapon, which they described as a machine gun. They also said he was an ""up-and-coming drug dealer"" in Buffalo at the time of his arrest. ""Mr Dixon is innocent of the shooting and of the murder for what he was found guilty of, but Mr Dixon brought the gun to the fight,"" said the district attorney. ""It's the greatest feeling in the world,"" he said as he walked a free man from court in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday. He was greeted outside by his daughter, who was a baby when he was jailed. The 27-year-old brought along her own 14-month-old twins. Mr Dixon says he hopes to keep up his illustrations, and even visit a golf course in real life someday. ""With his mind and body intact, Dixon hopefully has some good years ahead,""Golf Digest wrote on Wednesday,external. ""Maybe he'll even take up golf.""

"A picture of the couple, posted on Ms Shapiro's Instagram account in 2015 A hoax is likely to be one line of inquiry after a couple apparently fell ill in a Salisbury restaurant on Sunday promptinga major incident, police sources have told the BBC. Alex King, 42, was admitted to hospital with his wife, six months after a nerve agent attack in the same city. Mr King is a convicted criminal and once hoaxed Prince Charles. Police sources said until the man had been spoken to, ""we can't rule anything in or out"". On Tuesday, Mr King's wife, Anna Shapiro, 30, told the Sun that the Russian state had poisoned her and her husband in Prezzo. The paper reported it was ""what security sources fear was a suspected rat poison attack"". Ms Shapiro is a model and an Israeli citizen of Russian heritage. A spokesman for the Sun told the BBC: ""Like any newspaper, we were keen to talk to those at the centre of the incident and give them the opportunity to share with the public their version of events."" The article has since been removed from the newspaper's website ""for legal reasons"". No arrests have been made and Wiltshire Police said on Wednesday: ""This is now a routine investigation. ""The woman from the restaurant has been interviewed once and is likely to be spoken to again. The next step is to speak to the man involved."" The BBC was unable to contact the couple. Wiltshire Police earlier confirmed the pair were not exposed to any nerve agent and that it wasnot linking their illnesswith the recent poisonings in Salisbury and Amesbury. ""Given recent events in Salisbury, the reporting of an event requiring the evacuation of bars and restaurants by police officers in bio-hazard suits, and that requires tests for the presence of Novichok, is of obvious public interest,"" a spokesman for the Sun added. Salisbury District Hospital said ""both patients are now medically fit"" and have been discharged from hospital. It is understood that the couple also tested negative for any other poisons, including rat poison. In 2006 Mr King carried out a ""prank"" on the Prince of Wales at a film premiere. He inserted himself into an official line-up of stars being greeted by Prince Charles and was later interviewed by the media about his deception. He claimed the ""prank"" was carried outas part of a Â£100,000 bet with his employer,external- the convicted fraudster Edward Davenport. In 2004, Mr King pleaded guilty at London's Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court to three counts of distributing indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children. In a statement on Wednesday, Lorna Wilkinson, director of nursing at Salisbury District Hospital, said ""given recent events"" they had tested Mr King and Ms Shapiro for nerve agents, when they were admitted on Sunday evening. ""Tests on both patients came back negative,"" she said. ""Both patients are now medically fit and there is no need for them to be in hospital."" ""While this incident did not involve nerve agents, it was still clearly very stressful for our staff who, once again, demonstrated the very best of the NHS. ""I want to thank them for rising to the occasion yet again,"" she added. On 4 March, Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliacollapsed in Salisburyhaving been exposed to the nerve agent Novichok. After weeks in hospital they were released, but in June, two Amesbury residents fell ill after being exposed to the same nerve agent. Dawn Sturgess, 44,later died.

"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: UK's Chequers Brexit plan 'won't work' Theresa May's proposed new economic partnership with the EU ""will not work"", the head of the European Council has said. Donald Tusk said the plans risked undermining the EU's single market. He was speaking at the end of an EU summit in Salzburg where leaders of the 27 remaining member states discussed Brexit. Mrs May said her proposals were the ""only serious credible"" way to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. She said she had held ""frank"" talks with Mr Tusk, adding: ""Yes, concerns have been raised and I want to know what those concerns are."" There was ""a lot of hard work to be done"", she said, but added that the UK was also making preparations in case no deal could be reached. Mrs May reiterated that she would not accept the EU's ""backstop"" plan to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland, and said the UK would shortly be bringing forward its own proposals. Katya Adler: What just happened in Salzburg? EU must 'evolve' Irish plans, insists May Sturgeon calls for Brexit to be delayed Brexit: All you need to know Europeâs press fear a hard Brexit The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and both sides are trying to reach a deal in time. There is still no agreement on some issues, including how to avoid new checks on the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland border. At a press conference, Mr Tusk said there were some ""positive elements"" in the UK's blueprint for future relations with the EU, which was agreed by ministers at Chequers in July. But, he added: ""The suggested framework for economic cooperation will not work."" Mr Tusk added that October would be the ""moment of truth"" for reaching a deal, and that ""if the conditions are there"" an additional summit would be held in November to ""formalise"" it. Can the prime minister really cling on to her Chequers plan now? The EU clearly won't accept it as it stands. Significant chunks of her party won't wear the deal either. The opposition parties won't back her. Of course there are tactics at play here. One government minister has already suggested that the EU always knows how to overplay their hand. Sometimes in negotiations, there needs to be a crisis to focus minds. And in her press conference, Theresa May seemed frustrated that her proposals perhaps have not been properly digested or considered yet. Of course this is only one day, one set of fraught meetings, in a tangled and lengthy process. But as things stand, it seems Theresa May is going to have to budge, or walk away. Read the rest of Laura's blog The EU leaders had been discussing the UK's plans, which were presented to them by Mrs May on Wednesday evening. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said ""substantial progress"" was needed on the UK's withdrawal agreement by the next European Council meeting in October, with ""still a large piece of work"" on the separate issue of future trade relations with the UK. The 27 remaining EU members were ""united that, in the matter of the single market, there can be no compromises,"" she said. French President Emmanuel Macron said Brexit had been ""pushed by certain people who predicted easy solutions"". He added: ""Brexit has shown us one thing - and I fully respect British sovereignty in saying this - it has demonstrated that those who said you can easily do without Europe, that it will all go very well, that it is easy and there will be lots of money, are liars. ""This is all the more true because they left the next day, so they didn't have to manage it."" Theresa May presented her Brexit plans to EU leaders on Wednesday evening As well the criticism from the EU, Mrs May's proposal for the UK to sign up to a common rule book for trade in goods and a combined customs territory with the EU is unpopular with many in her own party, who believe it will erode British sovereignty and is not what people voted for when they backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said although EU leaders ""were trying to give some warm words"" it was now going to be ""very, very difficult"" to meet their requirements: ""So it's time for a reset, time for a rethink"". And another prominent Brexiteer, Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, said Mr Tusk's remarks signalled the end for the Chequers proposals. Please upgrade your browser ""I think Chequers now has no supporters at all,"" he told the BBC. ""I think the time has come for Mrs May to say 'This is not going to work'."" For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mrs May had to ""urgently drop her reckless red lines and put forward a credible plan for Brexit"". But DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds blamed the EU for its ""unreasonable and inflexible approach"" adding: ""The UK government must demonstrate a resolute determination not to be bullied."" He said preserving the ""political, constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom"" was the ""absolute priority for us"". Earlier Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mrs May must delay Brexit beyond next March if there is not a detailed agreement on future trading arrangements.

"Council bosses in England say the ""worst is yet to come"" in cuts to services, as the government further reduces local authority funding. The County Council Network predicts ""unpalatable cutbacks"" next year as the councils identify at least Â£1bn savings to plug a Â£1.5bn shortfall by 2020. It also warns the risk of some councils stripping their services back to a minimum 'core offer' is growing. The government said councils will get a real term funding increase in 2018-19. It insists its approach strikes the right balance between relieving pressure on local government and ensuring taxpayers do not face excessive bills. But town hall bosses say local government funding from central government, through the revenue support grant, will have been cut by around 60% by 2020. Cllr Paul Carter, chairman of the County Council Network and leader of Kent County Council said: ""Counties will work hard to deliver the savings required, but the scope for making deliverable savings has dramatically reduced, and decisions for next year will be truly unpalatable if we are to fulfil our statutory duties. ""Without additional resource, the worst is yet to come."" Some councils have reached a financial crunch point, such asNorthampton - where Â£70m of savings are required by March. Somerset has had to rubber-stamp in-year funding cuts to keep to their 2018-19 budgets, while East Sussex is drawing up a plan outlining what its core offer will be. The County Council Network, which represents 36 larger authorities, surveyed its members about their budgets and what they planned to cut next year. All 36 responded said they faced significant cost pressures, including a growth in demand in some areas - particularly children's and adult social care, inflation and rising costs outside of their control. The survey revealed council bosses had already ear-marked Â£1bn worth of services as potential sources of savings. Some Â£685m of those are to balance the books going forward. Twenty five councils who responded to a separate survey, set out what they were planning to cut, moderately or severely: 58% said highways and transport  (including road improvements, streetlights, pothole filling) 47% said libraries 45% said early years and youth clubs. 44% ear-marked public health services like smoking cessation, sexual health, substance misuse 36% said children's services. Councils say they are expecting to have to switch funds from non-statutory services - the ones they are not obliged to provide by law - to ensure statutory services are provided. Councillor Nick Rushton, CCN finance spokesman and leader of Leicestershire County Council, said authorities were in a ""serious and extremely challenging financial position"" and further cuts and rising costs would make a ""bad situation even worse"". ""County councils across the country have no choice but to find a further Â£1bn of savings next year,"" he said. ""There is not enough money today to run vital services. Next year there is even less from the drop in government funding."" He added that councils were again at the point where council tax rises alone would not protect services. Councillor Martin Hill, leader of Lincolnshire County Council, said his authority had to save Â£25m a year since 2010. He said it would soon come to a point where the council would have to consider whether it can operate safely with regard to its responsibilities to vulnerable children and adults. A Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government spokesman said local authorities were responsible for their own funding decisions, ""but over the next two years, we are providing councils with Â£90.7bn to help them meet the needs of their residents"". They said local councils would have the power to retain the growth in income from business rates and develop a system for the future.

"Game of Thrones draws big audiences for Sky in the UK The takeover of broadcaster Sky will be settled by an auction, the UK's Takeover Panel has announced. The broadcaster has been subject to rival bids from Rupert Murdoch's Fox and US conglomerate Comcast. The Takeover Panel said that the auction would start at 17:00 London time on Friday and end on Saturday evening. It said all parties had agreed to the process, which will have a maximum of three rounds. Fox had looked set to take over the 61% of Sky it does not already own until Comcast topped Fox's bid. Fox raised its offer to Â£24.5bn, but this was soon trumped by a Â£26bn bid from Comcast. The process has also been beset by regulatory issues amid concerns over media plurality and the degree of Mr Murdoch's influence over the UK media landscape. Ian Whittaker, head of European media research at Liberum Capital, said it was rare for takeovers to go to an auction in this way, but it would ensure that the long-running battle for Sky came to a conclusion. He said: ""To give credit to the Takeover Panel, what they have done is to act decisively to stop this thing dragging on. ""It's a very unusual course of action, but it's the best course of action."" Sky is ""a jewel in a crown"", says media analyst Alice Enders. The broadcaster has nearly 23 million pay-TV subscribers in Europe, with more scope for expansion there than in the US, and it has a broadband business. In February, Sky Sports won the rights to UK Premier League TV packages, and Sky also licenses shows including Game of Thrones, as well as producing its own original content. No matter who wins the bidding war, Sky subscribers are likely to face higher prices, Ms Enders says. The bidding war has pushed Sky's price up to more than Â£24bn, and that is likely to be recouped from customers, she says. Read the full analysis here Also at issue is the fate of 24-hour news channel Sky News, which could end up being sold separately or ring-fenced in order to preserve its editorial integrity. Sky has nearly 23 million pay-TV subscribers in the UK and Ireland, Italy, Austria and Germany. It reported pre-tax profits up 7.5% over the 12 months to the end of June and added more than 500,000 customers across Europe. The future of Sky has been hanging in the balance for more than eight years - and the nature of the game has changed in the meantime. The process began when Mr Murdoch's original News Corp put forward a bid for full control of what was then BSkyB. That bid was scuppered by the phone-hacking scandal that engulfed Mr Murdoch's UK tabloid newspapers and tarnished the firm's reputation. The bid was revived in December 2016, by which time News Corp had been broken up, leaving 21st Century Fox as one of its successors. The process has been complicated by Disney's deal to buy most of Fox's assets, which is due to be completed next year if approved by international regulators.

"Three water companies face greater scrutiny from the watchdog after posting poor customer service records. Bristol Water, Surrey-based SES Water and Southern Water must provide quarterly reports of how they'll reduce complaints from 3.5 million customers. The watchdog's annual complaints report probed suppliers' actions when 200,000 customers were left without water after March's Beast from the East storm. The industry says it will invest Â£50bn from 2020 to 2025 to improve services. The annual complaints report by the Consumer Council for Water shows that nine out of 21 water companies in England and Wales reported an increase in calls from customers to resolve problems - known as ""unwanted"" contacts. Four companies also reported an increase in written complaints from their customers. It said some water companies struggled with the disruption caused by the sudden thaw following March's bad weather. More than 200,000 customers were left without running water, with many households criticising the poor communication and support they received from their supplier, the report said. Agency warns of water deficits for England Ofwat to quiz water firms over shortages The 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water Tony Smith, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, said: ""The frustration felt by thousands of customers after March's cold weather disruption to supplies should have reminded the industry that it cannot afford to be complacent."" But the water industry pointed out that complaints fell 17% over the year. Water UK chief executive Michael Roberts said: ""It's pleasing to see a fall in complaints this year, despite the impact of the Beast from the East and the dry summer. ""The figures published today continue a downward trend in both metrics, with complaints and unwanted calls falling by almost 70% over the last decade."" Bristol Water, SES Water and Southern Water have been told to provide the watchdog with quarterly reports highlighting what action they are taking to reduce complaints. In fact, it is the third successive year that Southern Water - which has two million customers - has faced similar demands after failing to improve on its position as the industry's worst performer, even though it reduced written complaints by a fifth. ""Southern Water is undergoing a period of significant transformation,"" said chief customer officer Simon Oates. """"We still have a long way to go to meet the standards our customers rightly expect but the changes we've introduced this year are driving down complaints."" Bristol Water - which has 1.2 million customers - reported a 37% increase in phone complaints and a 52% increase in written ones. Ben Newby, Bristol Water's customer services director, said: ""The past year has been one of the most difficult in the company's history. Four major incidents, including the largest burst in the company history, led to an increase in unwanted calls and written complaints."" He added: ""We are committed to improving our customer satisfaction."" SES Water - which has almost 300,000 customers - had a 21% rise in phone complaints. It said it is ""currently amidst a two-year programme which is specifically aimed at improving the experience our customers"". But water watchdog boss Tony Smith said: ""Some water companies still have a lot to learn when it comes to communicating effectively with their customers and ensuring that when something goes wrong, they put it right quickly and with the minimum of fuss. ""The poor performers highlighted in our report can expect to come under considerable pressure from us to improve this year.""

"Sewing needles have been inserted inside strawberries in Australia Australian supermarket giant Woolworths has temporarily removed sewing needles from its shelves as the country faces a strawberry safety scare. Last week, Australians were warned to cut fresh strawberries before biting into them after several people found sewing needles hidden inside the fruit. Several strawberry brands have been pulled from stores across the country. A country-wide investigation into the scare has since been launched amid growing public alarm. The government has also said it will introduce stricter criminal penalties for anyone found to have been tampering with food. Warning over needles in strawberries Australia's strawberry needle scare widens Apple and banana in Australia needle scares Strawberries Australia Inc, the country's largest industry body for strawberry growers, declined to comment on the move by Woolworths. But many of Australia's strawberry farmers remain frustrated and angry at what they say has been a huge overreaction to the scandal. Woolworths said the safety of its customers was its top priority and that pulling sewing needles from its shelves was a safety measure. ""We've taken the precautionary step of temporarily removing sewing needles from sale in our stores across the country,"" the supermarket told the BBC, but did not say how long the move would last. Sydney-based brand expert Paul Nelson said Woolworths' action could be seen as something of a ""knee jerk reaction"" to the crisis. They could be ""trying to do their bit"" to support farmers struggling with the fallout by taking needles of the shelves, he said, but ""cynically, you could also argue they want to be a part of the conversation and want to appear to be assisting"".

"Actor Ray Winstone is the floating face of Bet365's advertising campaign Labour is calling for a ban on gambling advertising during live sporting events in a bid to tackle problem gambling. It also said it would stop people using credit cards to pay for bets and introduce a levy on gambling operators to help pay for treatment. Deputy leader Tom Watson said problem gambling was ""a public health emergency"". But the Conservatives criticised Labour for ""liberalising the gambling market when it was in power"". A report commissioned by Labour found there are 430,000 identified gambling addicts in the UK, 25,000 of which are 16 or under. Mr Watson said his party would introduce a ""whistle-to-whistle"" ban on gambling adverts being shown during a specified time before, during and after a live sporting event. He said experts who specialise in dealing with gambling addiction said those types of adverts caused a ""particular problem"". Earlier this year,the Committee of Advertising Practice and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice announced tougher standards,externalon gambling advertising, including banning ads urging sports fans to ""bet now"" during events. Mr Watson told the BBC's Today programme: ""We're not anti-gambling. We just think we need to tighten up regulations because there has been a digital revolution in these new products since the last piece of legislation. ""Even the industry are saying that TV advertising for in-sport betting is getting out of hand and needs dealing with."" The proposed levy would amount to 1% of operators' gross gambling yield. At present, there is a voluntary levy which Mr Watson said brought in about Â£10m a year. He said a compulsory charge would yield about Â£140m a year ""which would allow us to treat more gambling addicts when they require help with their condition"". ""Gambling companies have to take more responsibility for harm caused by their products and contribute more to research and treatment."" Labour also said it would bring in new guidelines and resources to help problem gamblers. For example, it wants new rules that would enable gambling addicts to tell their bank to block online gambling transactions. Sky Bet boss Richard Flint welcomed the idea of a levy, but said banning advertising and credit card payments would not work. ""We'll study the advertising proposals carefully but think any type of blanket ban removes a key incentive for operators to get a UK gambling licence and therefore could leave UK customers more vulnerable to disreputable operators,"" he said. ""And our data on credit cards suggests that it is those customers with multiple cards that are at greater risk of harm so we believe attention should be placed on that rather than a complete ban."" Betting companies and gambling advertising have become synonymous with sporting events and sporting organisations in recent years - especially in football. This season,almost 60% of clubs in England's top two divisions have the names of gambling companies on their shirts,external- including nine of the 20 Premier League clubs, and 17 of the 24 in the Championship. Research also suggests that viewers of World Cup matches wereexposed to 90 minutes of betting adverts during the tournament,externalin Russia. There are also studies to showprofessional footballers themselves are a high-risk group,in terms of developing problematic gambling behaviour. Labour said it reiterated previous calls for Premier League clubs to volunteer to end sponsorship deals with gambling firms. But the party added it would take legislative action if clubs refused to do this on a voluntary basis. Other sports which are ""intrinsically linked"" to gambling, such as horse racing, would be exempt from the new rules. Labour's new policies stem from consultations with gambling addiction specialists, charities, industry bodies and those suffering from gambling problems. Its proposals reflect concern elsewhere about the impact of gambling advertising. In March, the Australian government banned betting ads from being shown during live sports broadcasts, and the ban was extended to include online streaming services in April. Rachel Cassidy, professor at Goldsmith's University, estimates gambling advertising increased by 600% from 2007 to 2013. Chris Skidmore, Conservative Vice Chairman for Policy, said: ""Labour liberalised the gambling market when they were in power, and have admitted that they were wrong. ""We are correcting Labour's mistakes - ensuring tighter rules on gambling advertising, increasing protections around online gambling, launching a multi-million pound awareness campaign, commissioning research on the harms of problem gambling, and slashing the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals, which were introduced under Labour.""

"Valentino Dixon served most of his sentence in New York's notorious Attica Correctional Facility A US convict whose talent for art caught the eye of a prison warden, ultimately leading to a review of his case, has been exonerated of murder. Valentino Dixon's colour pencil drawings of golf courses were featured in Golf Digest - prompting advocates to uncover flawed evidence in the case. Mr Dixon, 48, had maintained his innocence during 27 years behind bars for a shooting in Buffalo, New York. He walked free after another man formally confessed to the murder. Mr Dixon had served nearly two decades at a notorious prison in upstate New York when his artistic flair attracted the notice of correctional authorities. The warden gave him a photograph of the famed Augusta National's 12th hole in the US state of Georgia, and asked if he would draw it for him. ""After 19 years in Attica Correctional Facility, the look of a golf hole spoke to me,"" said Mr Dixon. ""It seemed peaceful. I imagine playing it would be a lot like fishing."" Surprising ways prisoners have won freedom Using colouring pencils, he began to create meticulous, lush drawings of various links and fairways. ""I didn't know anything about golf. I'm from the 'hood,"" he told local media. His sketches impressed the editors at Golf Digest, which featured his artwork anda profile of the prisoner in 2012,external. ""Maybe one day I'll get to play the game I've only imagined,"" Mr Dixon said in the article, describing how he drew landscapes he has never seen. The magazine's coverage spurred wrongful-conviction advocates to look into the matter. Georgetown University law students championed his case. Mr Dixon was handed a minimum 38-year-to-life sentence for killing 17-year-old Torriano Jackson one night in August 1991, after an argument over a girl. He acknowledged being at the crime scene, but said he was at a nearby shop buying beer when the gunshots rang out. Mr Dixon said multiple witnesses could have testified he did not fire the gun. But his trial lawyer did not call any of them as several had been accused of perjury. Unusually, the investigating homicide detective did not testify during the trial either. But a more serious flaw in the case was uncovered byGeorgetown University's Prisons and Justice Initiative,external. Prosecutors had omitted to reveal to Mr Dixon's defence attorney that a gunpowder test on his client's clothes had come back negative. Perhaps even more egregiously, another man, Lamarr Scott, admitted to local media only days after the murder that he shot Torriano Jackson. Scott told a WGRZ-TV reporter,external: ""I don't want my friend [Mr Dixon] to take the rap for something that I did."" Georgetown University students who worked on the case greeted Mr Dixon upon his release But he was never arrested. The victim's brother said he saw Mr Dixon open fire. According to the Buffalo News,external, prosecutors conceded that Scott had been admitting his guilt in the case for a long time. ""Mr Scott has been confessing to this crime since 12 August 1991,"" Assistant District Attorney Sara Dee told the court. ""He has confessed to this crime in excess of 10 times."" Lamarr Scott - who is currently in jail for a separate attack - finally had the chance to formally confess to the crime on Wednesday. Hours later, Mr Dixon was released. ""I grabbed the gun,"" Scott, now 46, told the courtroom in Erie County, New York. ""I pulled the trigger and all the bullets came out. Unfortunately, Torriano ended up dying."" It was Erie County District Attorney John Flynn - in the job less than a year - who ordered a review of the case. But despite Mr Dixon's exoneration, prosecutors say he did provide the murder weapon, which they described as a machine gun. They also said he was an ""up-and-coming drug dealer"" in Buffalo at the time of his arrest. ""Mr Dixon is innocent of the shooting and of the murder for what he was found guilty of, but Mr Dixon brought the gun to the fight,"" said the district attorney. ""It's the greatest feeling in the world,"" he said as he walked a free man from court in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday. He was greeted outside by his daughter, who was a baby when he was jailed. The 27-year-old brought along her own 14-month-old twins. Mr Dixon says he hopes to keep up his illustrations, and even visit a golf course in real life someday. ""With his mind and body intact, Dixon hopefully has some good years ahead,""Golf Digest wrote on Wednesday,external. ""Maybe he'll even take up golf.""

"Mitchell was the first black ballet dancer to achieve international stardom Arthur Mitchell, one of the first black ballet dancers, has died in New York City at the age of 84. The pioneering African-American dancer rose from a childhood in Harlem to perform leading roles under renowned choreographer George Balanchine. He was one of the most popular dancers with the New York City ballet in the 50s and 60s and was the first black dancer to gain international stardom. Mitchell said his greatest achievement was bringing black people into ballet. In 1969 he co-founded the Dance Theatre of Harlem, which was the first major classical ballet company in America to prioritise black dancers. Why don't they make shoes for black ballet dancers? Video: Ballet hoping to help heal Charleston's wounds His earlier pairing with the white prima ballerina Diana Adams in 1957 caused a major stir in a country which was, at the time, riven by segregation. In an interview earlier this year Mitchell, who lived in Manhattan, spoke of the early hostile reactions he had received from audiences before his talent ultimately won them over, leading to regular standing ovations. ""I danced myself into their hearts,"" he said. Mitchell (R) introduces his dancers for a performance at the White House in 2006 However he also pointed out that there was still just a tiny number of African-American ballerinas, commenting: ""There's still work to be done."" Mitchell's niece, Juli Mills-Ross, said his death had been caused by complications leading to heart failure. The current director of the Dance Theatre of Harlem, Anna Glass, hailed Mitchell as a true visionary. The theatre also paid tribute to the popular dancer in a tweet, saying that his legacy would live on. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Christine Blasey Ford says Brett Kavanaugh attacked her when he was a teenager The lawyer for a woman who accuses US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault has said the Senate's ""rush"" to a hearing is ""unnecessary"". Lisa Banks says her client, Christine Blasey Ford, is willing to co-operate but wants a ""full non-partisan investigation"" ahead of her testimony. Prof Ford has been given until Friday to decide if she will testify. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, says the assault allegation, which dates back to his teenage years, is ""completely false"". President Donald Trump has again defended his nominee, saying it is very hard for him to imagine anything happened. Prof Ford and the Senate Judiciary Committee are engaged in a stand-off, and time is running out, the BBC's Gary O'Donoghue reports from Washington. The Republicans on the committee know they have to give her every opportunity to tell her story but they are adamant that this is not a matter for the FBI and that Democrats are using the case to simply stall the nomination process, our correspondent says. ""Dr Ford was reluctantly thrust into the public spotlight only two days ago,"" Ms Banks said in a statement. ""Fairness and respect for her situation dictate that she should have time to deal with this."" The lawyer's statement repeats earlier reports of threats to Prof Ford and her family's safety, adding that she is ""currently unable to go home"". The truth about false assault accusations Kavanaugh accuser 'faces death threats' Could Kavanaugh confirmation be derailed? Ms Banks then suggests that the plan by the Senate Judiciary Committee to go ahead with a hearing next Monday involving both Judge Kavanaugh and Prof Ford - either publicly or in a closed-door session - ""is not a fair or good faith investigation"". ""There are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding. ""The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth,"" she adds. Prof Ford earlier declined the Senate's offer to testify unless the FBI began investigating the judge. In a letter to Prof Ford's legal team, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said ""it is not the FBI's role to investigate a matter such as this"". ""I have reopened the hearing because I believe that anyone who comes forward with allegations of sexual assault has a right to be heard, and because it is the Committee's responsibility to fully evaluate the fitness of a nominee to the Supreme Court,"" the Iowa Republican wrote. The Senate, the committee chairman notes, ""and only the Senate"", is tasked with vetting a president's Supreme Court nominee. ""The FBI does not make a credibility assessment of any information it receives with respect to a nominee. This video can not be played Senator Mazie Hirono urged ""the men in this country"" to ""do the right thing for a change"" Mr Grassley's letter states that Prof Ford has until Friday morning to provide the committee with her prepared testimony and biography if she plans to testify next Monday. He said he was ""disturbed"" to hear that she had been facing threats and harassment but urged her to speak before the committee. ""You have stated repeatedly that Dr Ford wants to tell her story. I sincerely hope that Dr Ford will accept my invitation to do so, either privately or publicly, on Monday."" Prof Ford, a psychology lecturer in California, has accused Mr Trump's Supreme Court nominee Judge Kavanaugh of drunkenly trying to remove her clothing in 1982 when they were both teenagers in a Washington DC suburb. She says he pinned her to a bed and clamped his hand over her mouth when she attempted to scream. The incident allegedly happened at a gathering of teenagers at a house, when Mr Kavanaugh and a friend allegedly ""corralled"" her into a bedroom. Judge Kavanaugh continues to deny the claim and has this week been meeting White House officials. On Wednesday, Mr Trump continued to support his nominee, telling reporters outside the White House: ""He is such an outstanding man, [it is] very hard for me to imagine anything happened."" ""I want to see what she [Prof Ford] has to say but I want to give it all the time they need,"" the Republican president said. ""If she shows up that would be wonderful."" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted that it was ""imperative"" to move forward on the Kavanaugh vote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Courtney was the favourite heading into the finals British teenager Courtney Hadwin has finished in sixth place in the final of America's Got Talent. The 14-year-old from Hesleden, County Durham, was among the favourites to win the $1m (Â£760,000) prize on Wednesday. She wowed the judges and viewers with energetic and mature covers of rock 'n' roll classics by Tina Turner, James Brown and Steppenwolf. Host Tyra Banks told Hadwin she was proud and said she had ""made it"" for making it to the final 10. Later on, it was Canadian-American magician Shin Lim that was crowned the winner of the talent show. Hadwin performed Tina Turner's 1988 classic River Deep, Mountain High on Tuesday in the first of the two-part finale. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Following the performance, judge Howie Mandel said: ""You are on fire, you're amazing. I love everything about you. We are watching a superstar in the making right here on America's Got Talent."" Earlier in the series, Mandel used his golden buzzer to send the 14-year-old straight through to the quarter finals. Fellow judge Simon Cowell commented that Hadwin was more than just a singer, saying: ""Every time you perform, you inspire people, you are more than a great singer, you are a trendsetter."" Courtney competed last year in the UK's The Voice Kids, where she got through to the live finals after being tutored by McFly's Danny Jones. Courtney was just 13 years old when she first took to the AGT stage According to Courtney's grandfather, the singer, who busked on the streets of London and New York to fund singing lessons, chose to enter America's Got Talent instead of the British version. Speaking to theMailOnline,external, Tom Storey said the UK ""doesn't get her"", adding that the family was ""confident she will do well in the US"". Courtney and her family have been proved right. In the semi-finals, Hadwin performed a cover of Steppenwolf's 1968 hit Born To Be Wild and was described as a ""bundle of excitement"" by Cowell. The music mogul told her: ""You were born to be wild - this was wild! You were amazing. My prediction is you're going to be the winner."" Courtney was just 13 when she performed in the first round of America's Got Talent. Before Tuesday's performance, she thanked fans on social media, saying she had had ""an amazing time"".

"Actor Ray Winstone is the floating face of Bet365's advertising campaign Labour is calling for a ban on gambling advertising during live sporting events in a bid to tackle problem gambling. It also said it would stop people using credit cards to pay for bets and introduce a levy on gambling operators to help pay for treatment. Deputy leader Tom Watson said problem gambling was ""a public health emergency"". But the Conservatives criticised Labour for ""liberalising the gambling market when it was in power"". A report commissioned by Labour found there are 430,000 identified gambling addicts in the UK, 25,000 of which are 16 or under. Mr Watson said his party would introduce a ""whistle-to-whistle"" ban on gambling adverts being shown during a specified time before, during and after a live sporting event. He said experts who specialise in dealing with gambling addiction said those types of adverts caused a ""particular problem"". Earlier this year,the Committee of Advertising Practice and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice announced tougher standards,externalon gambling advertising, including banning ads urging sports fans to ""bet now"" during events. Mr Watson told the BBC's Today programme: ""We're not anti-gambling. We just think we need to tighten up regulations because there has been a digital revolution in these new products since the last piece of legislation. ""Even the industry are saying that TV advertising for in-sport betting is getting out of hand and needs dealing with."" The proposed levy would amount to 1% of operators' gross gambling yield. At present, there is a voluntary levy which Mr Watson said brought in about Â£10m a year. He said a compulsory charge would yield about Â£140m a year ""which would allow us to treat more gambling addicts when they require help with their condition"". ""Gambling companies have to take more responsibility for harm caused by their products and contribute more to research and treatment."" Labour also said it would bring in new guidelines and resources to help problem gamblers. For example, it wants new rules that would enable gambling addicts to tell their bank to block online gambling transactions. Sky Bet boss Richard Flint welcomed the idea of a levy, but said banning advertising and credit card payments would not work. ""We'll study the advertising proposals carefully but think any type of blanket ban removes a key incentive for operators to get a UK gambling licence and therefore could leave UK customers more vulnerable to disreputable operators,"" he said. ""And our data on credit cards suggests that it is those customers with multiple cards that are at greater risk of harm so we believe attention should be placed on that rather than a complete ban."" Betting companies and gambling advertising have become synonymous with sporting events and sporting organisations in recent years - especially in football. This season,almost 60% of clubs in England's top two divisions have the names of gambling companies on their shirts,external- including nine of the 20 Premier League clubs, and 17 of the 24 in the Championship. Research also suggests that viewers of World Cup matches wereexposed to 90 minutes of betting adverts during the tournament,externalin Russia. There are also studies to showprofessional footballers themselves are a high-risk group,in terms of developing problematic gambling behaviour. Labour said it reiterated previous calls for Premier League clubs to volunteer to end sponsorship deals with gambling firms. But the party added it would take legislative action if clubs refused to do this on a voluntary basis. Other sports which are ""intrinsically linked"" to gambling, such as horse racing, would be exempt from the new rules. Labour's new policies stem from consultations with gambling addiction specialists, charities, industry bodies and those suffering from gambling problems. Its proposals reflect concern elsewhere about the impact of gambling advertising. In March, the Australian government banned betting ads from being shown during live sports broadcasts, and the ban was extended to include online streaming services in April. Rachel Cassidy, professor at Goldsmith's University, estimates gambling advertising increased by 600% from 2007 to 2013. Chris Skidmore, Conservative Vice Chairman for Policy, said: ""Labour liberalised the gambling market when they were in power, and have admitted that they were wrong. ""We are correcting Labour's mistakes - ensuring tighter rules on gambling advertising, increasing protections around online gambling, launching a multi-million pound awareness campaign, commissioning research on the harms of problem gambling, and slashing the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals, which were introduced under Labour.""

"""No, no, no!"" That is the response that you get when you ask EU players whether they can abandon the principles that are determining their stance on Brexit. The response you get when you ask UK insiders whether they can move on their core beliefs about Ireland. ""No, no, no!"". And guess what, for more than two years now people involved in the Brexit process have been saying, ah, until we can find a way through on the question of Ireland well, we can't be sure of anything. Sure, there is a huge amount of chatter about how some nips and tucks to the rival proposals might change things, to soften the hard edges of the arguments. May seeks backing for 'serious' Brexit plan Will EU's Salzburg summit mark a Brexit turning point? The UK might accept a border for rules and regulations in time, but there is no chance that as things stand, they will go anywhere near touching a different customs system for Northern Ireland. The EU might come up with cunning plan after cunning plan, asking for only one kind of check, or a system rather like the one that operates between Spain and the Canary Islands. Every single comment made by Michel Barnier is examined in microscopic detail to see what compromise it might reveal. Here's the thing. The disagreements aren't over the detail, it's not the practicalities that are really the problem but the principles. Officials involved privately admit there is little chance that the solution is going to be found in any of the technical solutions, there is going to have to be a big political move on one side, or moves on both sides to be able to get to a deal. And despite protestations from Brexiteers about how Ireland has come to dominate the talks, it has become whether they like it or not, the real life expression of Brexit's bigger conundrums. The talks were always going to be complicated. But summit after summit, the biggest obstacle remains what happens there after we leave the EU. Because after Brexit the border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the island becomes the line between the huge European trading club and a country that's on the outside. No one wants there to be anything that really changes or disrupts life  on either side. But Brexit is such a major change that everything simply can't remain the same. The two sides in the negotiations seem stuck in a deep clash over how to handle the change. Because the EU has more power in the negotiations it's often assumed that the UK will end up having to ditch its resistance. And with some soft soaping from Brussels around the language of their proposals Theresa May will just about be able to swallow more compromises. But ahead of the Tory conference, rather than showing any flexibility the UK is sticking with its position. The PM appealed to the other EU leaders on Wednesday, imploring them to understand that she can't accept what's on the table right now. But with a rough date set for deal day, the position might have to evolve. And Wednesday's digging in might make any eventual climbdown more painful still, yet the prime minister may not find herself with that much choice. After all, the answer she can't accept for the whole deal in the end, is, ""no, no, no!""

"The data breach affected 15 million UK customers Credit rating agency Equifaxis to be fined Â£500,000,externalby the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) after it failed to protect the personal data of 15 million Britons. A 2017 cyber-attack exposed information belonging to 146 million people around the world, mostly in the US. The compromised systems were also US-based. But the ICO ruled Equifax's UK branch had ""failed to take appropriate steps"" to protect UK citizens' data. It added that ""multiple failures"" meant personal information had been kept longer than necessary and left vulnerable. Originally, Equifax reported that fewer than 400,000 Britons had had sensitive data exposed in the breach - but it later revealed that the number was nearly 700,000. A further 14.5 million British records exposed would not have put people at risk, the company added last October. The ICO, which joined forces with the Financial Conduct Authority to investigate the breach, found that it affected three distinct groups in the following ways: 19,993 UK data subjects had names, dates of birth, telephone numbers and driving licence numbers exposed 637,430 UK data subjects had names, dates of birth and telephone numbers exposed Up to 15 million UK data subjects had names and dates of birth exposed Equifax had also been warned about a critical vulnerability in its systems by the US Department of Homeland Security in March 2017, the ICO revealed. And appropriate steps to fix the vulnerability were not taken, according to the ICO. Because the breach happened before the launch of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May this year, the investigation took place under the UK's Data Protection Act 1998 instead. And the fine of Â£500,000 is the highest possible under that law. ""The loss of personal information, particularly where there is the potential for financial fraud, is not only upsetting to customers, it undermines consumer trust in digital commerce,"" said  information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. ""This is compounded when the company is a global firm whose business relies on personal data."" An Equifax spokesperson said the firm was ""disappointed in the findings and the penalty"". ""As the ICO makes clear in its report, Equifax has successfully implemented a broad range of measures to prevent the recurrence of such criminal incidents and it acknowledges the strengthened procedures which are now in effect. ""The criminal cyber-attack against our US parent company last year was a pivotal moment for our company. We apologise again to any consumers who were put at risk.""

"Mitchell was the first black ballet dancer to achieve international stardom Arthur Mitchell, one of the first black ballet dancers, has died in New York City at the age of 84. The pioneering African-American dancer rose from a childhood in Harlem to perform leading roles under renowned choreographer George Balanchine. He was one of the most popular dancers with the New York City ballet in the 50s and 60s and was the first black dancer to gain international stardom. Mitchell said his greatest achievement was bringing black people into ballet. In 1969 he co-founded the Dance Theatre of Harlem, which was the first major classical ballet company in America to prioritise black dancers. Why don't they make shoes for black ballet dancers? Video: Ballet hoping to help heal Charleston's wounds His earlier pairing with the white prima ballerina Diana Adams in 1957 caused a major stir in a country which was, at the time, riven by segregation. In an interview earlier this year Mitchell, who lived in Manhattan, spoke of the early hostile reactions he had received from audiences before his talent ultimately won them over, leading to regular standing ovations. ""I danced myself into their hearts,"" he said. Mitchell (R) introduces his dancers for a performance at the White House in 2006 However he also pointed out that there was still just a tiny number of African-American ballerinas, commenting: ""There's still work to be done."" Mitchell's niece, Juli Mills-Ross, said his death had been caused by complications leading to heart failure. The current director of the Dance Theatre of Harlem, Anna Glass, hailed Mitchell as a true visionary. The theatre also paid tribute to the popular dancer in a tweet, saying that his legacy would live on. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played A woman died when the caravan she was in was blown off a cliff A huge clean-up operation is continuing after Storm Ali battered parts of the UK with winds of up to 100mph. Two people died, thousands of homes were without power and lorries overturned during the severe winds. Rail services are being disrupted, while engineers in Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England are working to restore energy supplies. A yellow warning for wind for parts of England and Wales remains in force from 18:00 BST on Thursday. The Met Office said gusts of up to 65mph were possible in some places, as strong winds were likely to develop cross parts of Wales and south west England during Thursday evening. A yellow warning for rain is in place until 22:00 for northern England and Wales. Ali is the UK's first named storm of the season. Ali, Idris, Lily: Why do storms have names? A history of UK named storms Scotland cleans up after storm Train operators including ScotRail, LNER and Virgin Trains have warned of possible disruption on Thursday morning in the aftermath of Storm Ali. Virgin Trains said delays, alterations and cancellations on services from Edinburgh and Glasgow to London Euston were expected because of damage to overhead lines. ""Multiple trees"" had been blown onto the railway, LNER said, resulting in disruption for trains travelling in north east England and into Scotland. Northern Powergrid said 43,500 people in the north of England had power restored overnight, and engineers were working to reconnect the 2,500 customers still affected. Scottish Power said 5,000 customers remained without electricity, while NIE Networks in Northern Ireland said its engineers had worked through the night to restore supplies. Fallen trees like this one in Belfast caused disruption On Wednesday, a woman died after the caravan she was in was blown off a cliff in the Irish Republic. It is understood the woman who was killed in County Galway was a tourist in her 50s who had been staying at a campsite in Claddaghduff. A man in his 20s was killedand another in his 40s was injured, after a tree fell on them at the gates of Slieve Gullion Forest Park, near Newry, County Armagh. The men were working on behalf of Northern Ireland Water. People in Blackpool brave the winds One person was injured after being blown over by high winds outside the new V&A Dundee museum, which was later closed. Five hundred cruise passengers and crew were stranded in Greenock after severe weather broke their ship's mooring lines. Tugs were called in to assist the Nautica. A 102mph gust was recorded on the Tay Road Bridge between Dundee and Fife at 15:00. Have you been affected by Storm Ali?

"Three water companies face greater scrutiny from the watchdog after posting poor customer service records. Bristol Water, Surrey-based SES Water and Southern Water must provide quarterly reports of how they'll reduce complaints from 3.5 million customers. The watchdog's annual complaints report probed suppliers' actions when 200,000 customers were left without water after March's Beast from the East storm. The industry says it will invest Â£50bn from 2020 to 2025 to improve services. The annual complaints report by the Consumer Council for Water shows that nine out of 21 water companies in England and Wales reported an increase in calls from customers to resolve problems - known as ""unwanted"" contacts. Four companies also reported an increase in written complaints from their customers. It said some water companies struggled with the disruption caused by the sudden thaw following March's bad weather. More than 200,000 customers were left without running water, with many households criticising the poor communication and support they received from their supplier, the report said. Agency warns of water deficits for England Ofwat to quiz water firms over shortages The 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water Tony Smith, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, said: ""The frustration felt by thousands of customers after March's cold weather disruption to supplies should have reminded the industry that it cannot afford to be complacent."" But the water industry pointed out that complaints fell 17% over the year. Water UK chief executive Michael Roberts said: ""It's pleasing to see a fall in complaints this year, despite the impact of the Beast from the East and the dry summer. ""The figures published today continue a downward trend in both metrics, with complaints and unwanted calls falling by almost 70% over the last decade."" Bristol Water, SES Water and Southern Water have been told to provide the watchdog with quarterly reports highlighting what action they are taking to reduce complaints. In fact, it is the third successive year that Southern Water - which has two million customers - has faced similar demands after failing to improve on its position as the industry's worst performer, even though it reduced written complaints by a fifth. ""Southern Water is undergoing a period of significant transformation,"" said chief customer officer Simon Oates. """"We still have a long way to go to meet the standards our customers rightly expect but the changes we've introduced this year are driving down complaints."" Bristol Water - which has 1.2 million customers - reported a 37% increase in phone complaints and a 52% increase in written ones. Ben Newby, Bristol Water's customer services director, said: ""The past year has been one of the most difficult in the company's history. Four major incidents, including the largest burst in the company history, led to an increase in unwanted calls and written complaints."" He added: ""We are committed to improving our customer satisfaction."" SES Water - which has almost 300,000 customers - had a 21% rise in phone complaints. It said it is ""currently amidst a two-year programme which is specifically aimed at improving the experience our customers"". But water watchdog boss Tony Smith said: ""Some water companies still have a lot to learn when it comes to communicating effectively with their customers and ensuring that when something goes wrong, they put it right quickly and with the minimum of fuss. ""The poor performers highlighted in our report can expect to come under considerable pressure from us to improve this year.""

"Actor Ray Winstone is the floating face of Bet365's advertising campaign Labour is calling for a ban on gambling advertising during live sporting events in a bid to tackle problem gambling. It also said it would stop people using credit cards to pay for bets and introduce a levy on gambling operators to help pay for treatment. Deputy leader Tom Watson said problem gambling was ""a public health emergency"". But the Conservatives criticised Labour for ""liberalising the gambling market when it was in power"". A report commissioned by Labour found there are 430,000 identified gambling addicts in the UK, 25,000 of which are 16 or under. Mr Watson said his party would introduce a ""whistle-to-whistle"" ban on gambling adverts being shown during a specified time before, during and after a live sporting event. He said experts who specialise in dealing with gambling addiction said those types of adverts caused a ""particular problem"". Earlier this year,the Committee of Advertising Practice and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice announced tougher standards,externalon gambling advertising, including banning ads urging sports fans to ""bet now"" during events. Mr Watson told the BBC's Today programme: ""We're not anti-gambling. We just think we need to tighten up regulations because there has been a digital revolution in these new products since the last piece of legislation. ""Even the industry are saying that TV advertising for in-sport betting is getting out of hand and needs dealing with."" The proposed levy would amount to 1% of operators' gross gambling yield. At present, there is a voluntary levy which Mr Watson said brought in about Â£10m a year. He said a compulsory charge would yield about Â£140m a year ""which would allow us to treat more gambling addicts when they require help with their condition"". ""Gambling companies have to take more responsibility for harm caused by their products and contribute more to research and treatment."" Labour also said it would bring in new guidelines and resources to help problem gamblers. For example, it wants new rules that would enable gambling addicts to tell their bank to block online gambling transactions. Sky Bet boss Richard Flint welcomed the idea of a levy, but said banning advertising and credit card payments would not work. ""We'll study the advertising proposals carefully but think any type of blanket ban removes a key incentive for operators to get a UK gambling licence and therefore could leave UK customers more vulnerable to disreputable operators,"" he said. ""And our data on credit cards suggests that it is those customers with multiple cards that are at greater risk of harm so we believe attention should be placed on that rather than a complete ban."" Betting companies and gambling advertising have become synonymous with sporting events and sporting organisations in recent years - especially in football. This season,almost 60% of clubs in England's top two divisions have the names of gambling companies on their shirts,external- including nine of the 20 Premier League clubs, and 17 of the 24 in the Championship. Research also suggests that viewers of World Cup matches wereexposed to 90 minutes of betting adverts during the tournament,externalin Russia. There are also studies to showprofessional footballers themselves are a high-risk group,in terms of developing problematic gambling behaviour. Labour said it reiterated previous calls for Premier League clubs to volunteer to end sponsorship deals with gambling firms. But the party added it would take legislative action if clubs refused to do this on a voluntary basis. Other sports which are ""intrinsically linked"" to gambling, such as horse racing, would be exempt from the new rules. Labour's new policies stem from consultations with gambling addiction specialists, charities, industry bodies and those suffering from gambling problems. Its proposals reflect concern elsewhere about the impact of gambling advertising. In March, the Australian government banned betting ads from being shown during live sports broadcasts, and the ban was extended to include online streaming services in April. Rachel Cassidy, professor at Goldsmith's University, estimates gambling advertising increased by 600% from 2007 to 2013. Chris Skidmore, Conservative Vice Chairman for Policy, said: ""Labour liberalised the gambling market when they were in power, and have admitted that they were wrong. ""We are correcting Labour's mistakes - ensuring tighter rules on gambling advertising, increasing protections around online gambling, launching a multi-million pound awareness campaign, commissioning research on the harms of problem gambling, and slashing the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals, which were introduced under Labour.""

"Council bosses in England say the ""worst is yet to come"" in cuts to services, as the government further reduces local authority funding. The County Council Network predicts ""unpalatable cutbacks"" next year as the councils identify at least Â£1bn savings to plug a Â£1.5bn shortfall by 2020. It also warns the risk of some councils stripping their services back to a minimum 'core offer' is growing. The government said councils will get a real term funding increase in 2018-19. It insists its approach strikes the right balance between relieving pressure on local government and ensuring taxpayers do not face excessive bills. But town hall bosses say local government funding from central government, through the revenue support grant, will have been cut by around 60% by 2020. Cllr Paul Carter, chairman of the County Council Network and leader of Kent County Council said: ""Counties will work hard to deliver the savings required, but the scope for making deliverable savings has dramatically reduced, and decisions for next year will be truly unpalatable if we are to fulfil our statutory duties. ""Without additional resource, the worst is yet to come."" Some councils have reached a financial crunch point, such asNorthampton - where Â£70m of savings are required by March. Somerset has had to rubber-stamp in-year funding cuts to keep to their 2018-19 budgets, while East Sussex is drawing up a plan outlining what its core offer will be. The County Council Network, which represents 36 larger authorities, surveyed its members about their budgets and what they planned to cut next year. All 36 responded said they faced significant cost pressures, including a growth in demand in some areas - particularly children's and adult social care, inflation and rising costs outside of their control. The survey revealed council bosses had already ear-marked Â£1bn worth of services as potential sources of savings. Some Â£685m of those are to balance the books going forward. Twenty five councils who responded to a separate survey, set out what they were planning to cut, moderately or severely: 58% said highways and transport  (including road improvements, streetlights, pothole filling) 47% said libraries 45% said early years and youth clubs. 44% ear-marked public health services like smoking cessation, sexual health, substance misuse 36% said children's services. Councils say they are expecting to have to switch funds from non-statutory services - the ones they are not obliged to provide by law - to ensure statutory services are provided. Councillor Nick Rushton, CCN finance spokesman and leader of Leicestershire County Council, said authorities were in a ""serious and extremely challenging financial position"" and further cuts and rising costs would make a ""bad situation even worse"". ""County councils across the country have no choice but to find a further Â£1bn of savings next year,"" he said. ""There is not enough money today to run vital services. Next year there is even less from the drop in government funding."" He added that councils were again at the point where council tax rises alone would not protect services. Councillor Martin Hill, leader of Lincolnshire County Council, said his authority had to save Â£25m a year since 2010. He said it would soon come to a point where the council would have to consider whether it can operate safely with regard to its responsibilities to vulnerable children and adults. A Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government spokesman said local authorities were responsible for their own funding decisions, ""but over the next two years, we are providing councils with Â£90.7bn to help them meet the needs of their residents"". They said local councils would have the power to retain the growth in income from business rates and develop a system for the future.

Timeline of events The petition needed 7,543 signatures - or 10% of Mr Paisley's constituents - to force a by-election and cause Mr Paisley to lose his seat. It was signed by 7,099 people. Speaking in Ballymena on Thursday, Mr Paisley said the result was evidence that ""people accepted"" his apology and that he had ""put his hands up"". He said: ""90.6% said: we are keeping you, big fella, we like you. ""I can't help the reasons why I am in the news....I could be a shrinking violet...I am not prepared to do that. I can't win in terms of my personality."" This video can not be played Ian Paisley: Petition result a 'miracle' Mr Paisley had been suspended by the DUP ""pending further investigation into his conduct"". But on Thursday the party confirmed that it had readmitted Mr Paisley to the party on Tuesday following an internal investigation. In a statement, the DUP added: ""Upon re-admission he is subject to a number of conditions including a ban on holding office within the party for 12 months. ""The party will be making no further comment on these matters."" Asked whether he expected to be re-instated by the party, the North Antrim MP said that while that decision is ""up to the party officers"", he ""would be surprised if I wasn't (brought back)"". ""I have been punished, I have been docked my salary. ""Going on the holiday was not the issue - not registering it was."" In an earlier statement, he said: ""In July I apologised for a mistake made almost six years ago. ""The electorate was asked to pass judgment - 90.6% have accepted my apology. ""The electorate has clearly spoken. This video can not be played Electoral officer defends petition process ""I would like to thank my true friends, family, the electorate who have stood by me with unwavering support. Hallelujah."" On Thursday morning Mr Paisley updated his Twitter biography to say he had ""90.6% support from recall petition"". The Recall of MPs Bill became law in 2015 under the coalition government. The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, was first to be notified before the result was posted online. Sinn FÃ©in Deputy Leader Michelle O'Neill criticised the DUP's ""minor sanction"" as an effective endorsement of his actions. She said she believed the appropriate action would have been to sack Mr Paisley. Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said the result was no cause for celebration. ""In any other part of the UK, Ian Paisley would have had to resign in disgrace,"" said Ms Armstrong. SDLP Chief Whip Colin McGrath said it was ""disappointing"" and that the DUP should remove Mr Paisley from the party. ""Given the heat around the ongoing RHI investigation, it is imperative Mrs Foster help restore public confidence in politics by acting swiftly to remove Mr Paisley from the party,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann said he would ""caution Ian Paisley not to see this as some sort of victory or endorsement of his actions in acting as a paid advocate for a foreign government and bringing North Antrim and the House of Commons into disrepute"". He suggested that Mr Paisley ""should demonstrate some humility"". Enda McClafferty, BBC News NI Political Correspondent If the petition was to succeed then it needed the support of at least 10% of the electorate in North Antrim. It got 9.4% and was 444 signatures short. That means Ian Paisley will remain in the seat his family has held for almost 50 years. He wasn't there for the count this morning but was told the news in a text from the Chief Electoral Officer, Virginia McVea. She defended how the process was managed. Mr Paisley can now look forward to returning to the House of Commons, once he serves the remainder of his 30-day ban from Westminster. The Chief Electoral Officer in Northern Ireland, Virginia McVea, has defended how the process was managed. ""The access to this electoral event is quite simply unprecedented,"" she told BBC News NI. ""Never before in Northern Ireland has there been postal vote on demand, no reason had to be given, and instead of one day for poll, we ran for six weeks and with two late nights on top."" Mr Paisley's 30-sitting day suspension from the House of Commons began on 4 September, and is one of the longest-ever bans to be handed down at Westminster. According to the Commons library, it is the longest suspension since 1949, which is as far as online records go.,external In July, after Westminster's standards committee announced its recommendations, Mr Paisleyapologised for his behaviourin the Commons. Mr Paisley went on three luxury holidays to Sri Lanka at the expense of the Sri Lankan government in 2013. The committee found the cost ""much higher"" than the Â£50,000 Mr Paisley estimated. In 2014, Mr Paisley wrote to the prime minister to lobby against supporting a UN resolution on Sri Lanka over alleged human rights abuses. By failing to declare his trip, Mr Paisley ""breached the rule against paid advocacy, the committee said. The committee acknowledged that there was ""inconsistent guidance"" in relation to registering such trips, but it did not ""exonerate Mr Paisley from breaching the advocacy rule"".

"Officials say rivers in South Carolina could reach their highest levels by the end of this week or early next Two mental health patients have died when the police van they were being transported in got caught in floodwaters in the US, police say. The two officers escorting the pair were eventually rescued. The patients' deaths bring the death toll from Storm Florence to 37. Thousands of homes and roadways in the region remain underwater less than a week after the storm made landfall. President Donald Trump arrived in North Carolina on Wednesday to survey damage. Mr Trump praised the response to the ""devastating"" storm by federal and local disaster officials at a news conference in North Carolina on Wednesday morning. ""Unfortunately, the money will be a lot, but it's going to come as fast as you need it,"" Mr Trump said. ""We're going to take care of everybody."" Mr Trump will be heading to South Carolina next. The storm's latest victims in South Carolina were identified as Wendy Wenton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, by the Marion County Coroner, US media report. The Horry County Sheriff's Department said in a statement that when the waters overtook the van, they rose too quickly for the pair to be saved. Pig waste pools overflow after Florence A community cut off after 'terrifying' storm The numbers behind impact of Florence A high water team eventually rescued the two deputies who were escorting them. The deputies were able to climb atop the van as waters inundated the vehicle. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Despite persistent and ongoing efforts, floodwater rose rapidly and the deputies were unable to open the doors to reach the individuals inside the van,"" the police statement said,according to the Greenville News,external. ""At this time, the recovery effort is ongoing, and the transportation vehicle cannot be removed due to rising waters and dangerous conditions."" Florence has caused major flooding across the Carolinas The detainees were women being transported from Waccamaw Mental Health and Loris Hospital to a behavioural health hospital in Darlington, South Carolina, according to the Associated Press. ""Tonight's incident is a tragedy,"" Sheriff Phillip Thompson told the Greenville News. ""Just like you, we have questions we want answered. We are fully co-operating with the State Law Enforcement Division to support their investigation of this event."" The tragic incident occurred near the Little Pee Dee River, which continues to rise as water from upriver North Carolina makes its way into South Carolina's waterways. The Little Pee Dee has crested in some regions at over 46ft (14m) and its flooding has impacted town water supplies, officials say. Florence has claimed eight lives in South Carolina thus far, and flooding is expected to worsen later this week and into next. Thousands of homes are still underwater in the Carolinas and thousands of families have had to be rescued from the floods. As of Wednesday, more than 3,000 people had been rescued in North Carolina and 20,000 federal and military personnel are supporting state efforts. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper called Florence ""a storm like no other"" during a news conference with Mr Trump and federal officials on Wednesday. ""We are a beacon in the South and we have weathered storms before in our state. But Mr President, we have never seen one like this. This one has been epic. It has been disastrous. It has been widespread."" Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the government is pushing disaster survivor assistance teams into the Carolinas. ""A disaster response like this takes all of us working together, not just the federal government,"" he said. ""This event's not over. The rivers are still cresting we still have a lot of work to do."" The president has promised to completely support the Carolinas' recovery efforts. ""We will be there 100%,"" he said. ""That's why we started early, and we'll be here late.""

"Mr Trump said in an inteview he was ""very disappointed"" in Mr Sessions US President Donald Trump has said he does not ""have an attorney general"" in his fiercest attack yet on Jeff Sessions. In an interview with Hill.TV, Mr Trump renewed criticism of Mr Sessions' decision to step aside from the inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. He also said he was unhappy with Mr Sessions' response to immigration. The attorney general is yet to respond to Mr Trump's comments. It is unusual for a sitting president to attack their attorney general and critics accuse Mr Trump of trying to meddle in the legal system. Afterthe president criticised Mr Sessions last month, two key Republican senators signalled that they would support Mr Trump if he were to fire Mr Sessions after the November mid-term elections. However, other Republicanstold Politico they thought this would be a bad move,externaland said they were standing by the attorney general. Mr Sessions has pushed back against previous criticism by Mr Trump. ""While I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,"" he said in August. ""I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action."" Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Will Trump remain bulletproof? Mr Sessions was an early supporter of Mr Trump's presidential campaign. But he left the Russia investigation - which is reportedly looking into whether Mr Trump attempted to obstruct justice - in 2017, citing a potential conflict of interest, and handed control to his deputy, Rod Rosenstein. The president insists there was no collusion between his campaign and the Russian government, and denies he has attempted to obstruct justice. ""I don't have an attorney general. It's very sad,"" Mr Trump said during Tuesday's interview. He added that he was ""very disappointed"" about Mr Sessions' decision to leave the investigation. Asked whether he would consider firing Mr Sessions, the president responded: ""We'll see what happens. A lot of people have asked me to do that. This video can not be played Relations between the two soured in 2017 ""And I guess I study history, and I say I just want to leave things alone, but it was very unfair what he did [in recusing himself from the Russia investigation]."" Mr Trump also told Hill.TV that he was ""not happy"" with Mr Sessions on immigration and other issues, and said the attorney general had performed ""very poorly"" during the nomination process for the post. ""I mean, he was mixed up and confused, and people that worked with him for, you know, a long time in the Senate were not nice to him, but he was giving very confusing answers,"" he said. ""Answers that should have been easily answered. And that was a rough time for him."" ByAnthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump no longer likes Jeff Sessions, one of his earliest, most prominent supporters. This is not news. There are also political reasons why the president has been unwilling to straight-up fire his attorney general. This is also not news. That Mr Trump went so far as to say he doesn't have an attorney general - a slightly tamer version of ""he's dead to me"" - is dramatic, but it's variations on a theme. What might be surprising, and might also be significant, is the president's decision to criticise Mr Sessions for more than just his recusal from the Russia probe. He doesn't like the way he's handling the immigration issue, for instance. Given that Mr Sessions was considered to be one of the hardest of the hard-liners on immigration while in the US Senate and the man who helped refine Mr Trump's anti-immigration strategy during the campaign, this is remarkable. It could also possibly be the beginning of the president's efforts to make a larger case for getting rid of Mr Sessions - after the mid-term elections removes the possibility of immediate political fallout, of course. If the president can frame axing Mr Sessions as part of a larger political disagreement, that could help deflect some of the intense criticism he will receive for the move. It's still going to be a rough ride, and confirming a replacement for the attorney general in the Senate will be a monumental task, but the pieces are being moved on the board. Mr Trump's comments mark just the latest stage of a torrid relationship: February 2016:Jeff Sessions becomes the first Republican senator to publicly endorse Mr Trump in the presidential race February 2017:He is confirmed as attorney general March 2017:He admits he met a Russian ambassador during the election. He insists the meeting only took place as part of his work as a senator, but recuses himself from the Russia investigation July 2017:Mr Trump tells the New York Times he never would have appointed Mr Sessions had he known he would recuse himself. Over the following year, he sends a number of tweets critical of Mr Sessions August 2018:Early in the month, Mr Trump tweets that Mr Sessions should ""stop this Rigged Witch Hunt"", in reference to the Russia inquiry. A few weeks later, he piles in again, saying ""the only reason I gave him the job"" was Mr Sessions' loyalty. Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas?

"The data breach affected 15 million UK customers Credit rating agency Equifaxis to be fined Â£500,000,externalby the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) after it failed to protect the personal data of 15 million Britons. A 2017 cyber-attack exposed information belonging to 146 million people around the world, mostly in the US. The compromised systems were also US-based. But the ICO ruled Equifax's UK branch had ""failed to take appropriate steps"" to protect UK citizens' data. It added that ""multiple failures"" meant personal information had been kept longer than necessary and left vulnerable. Originally, Equifax reported that fewer than 400,000 Britons had had sensitive data exposed in the breach - but it later revealed that the number was nearly 700,000. A further 14.5 million British records exposed would not have put people at risk, the company added last October. The ICO, which joined forces with the Financial Conduct Authority to investigate the breach, found that it affected three distinct groups in the following ways: 19,993 UK data subjects had names, dates of birth, telephone numbers and driving licence numbers exposed 637,430 UK data subjects had names, dates of birth and telephone numbers exposed Up to 15 million UK data subjects had names and dates of birth exposed Equifax had also been warned about a critical vulnerability in its systems by the US Department of Homeland Security in March 2017, the ICO revealed. And appropriate steps to fix the vulnerability were not taken, according to the ICO. Because the breach happened before the launch of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May this year, the investigation took place under the UK's Data Protection Act 1998 instead. And the fine of Â£500,000 is the highest possible under that law. ""The loss of personal information, particularly where there is the potential for financial fraud, is not only upsetting to customers, it undermines consumer trust in digital commerce,"" said  information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. ""This is compounded when the company is a global firm whose business relies on personal data."" An Equifax spokesperson said the firm was ""disappointed in the findings and the penalty"". ""As the ICO makes clear in its report, Equifax has successfully implemented a broad range of measures to prevent the recurrence of such criminal incidents and it acknowledges the strengthened procedures which are now in effect. ""The criminal cyber-attack against our US parent company last year was a pivotal moment for our company. We apologise again to any consumers who were put at risk.""
