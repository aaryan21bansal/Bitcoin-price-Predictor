"The group of women worked together to find out the identity of this man, who subjected them to brutal interrogations A Russian police officer's takeaway food order was the breakthrough clue which helped a group of women, who had been terrorised by him, reveal his true identity. For the first time, a BBC investigation tells the story of how they tracked him down. The women, mostly aged between 19 and 25, had attendeda rally in Moscow in Marchagainst Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They were quickly rounded up by officers and put in the back of a police van. Most of them didn't know each other, but despite the circumstances the atmosphere was upbeat. They even set up a Telegram group chat as they travelled across the city to Brateyevo police station. What happened next was far worse than they anticipated. Over the next six hours they suffered verbal and physical abuse that, in some cases, amounted to torture - one woman says she was repeatedly starved of oxygen when a plastic bag was put over her head. Marina (top right) and Anastasia (bottom right) - and in the police van (left) The abuse was carried out by the same unnamed plain-clothes officer - tall, athletic, dressed in a black polo neck. In their group chat, they gave him the nickname the ""man in black"". Two of the women, Marina and Alexandra, secretly recorded audio on their phones. In one, the officer can be heard shouting about his ""total impunity"". But if his aim was to intimidate them into silence, he would fail. This video can not be played Listen to the âman in blackâ shouting insults at Marina and Alexandra while he assaults them After their release, the women discussed on the Telegram group how they could work out who he was. ""If we just kept on living like it didn't happen, if we just published the [recordings] and laid lowâ¦ most likely, they would think they can do it again and that they would be completely unpunished,"" says 22-year-old student Marina. His image was seared in their memories, but they could find no sign of him on police websites. And with no name to go on, social media was a dead end. After more than a fortnight of searching, they were close to giving up. And then the women had a breakthrough. In late March, there was amassive data leak,externalfrom the popular Russian food delivery app Yandex Food. The group had an idea. They began raking through the data to see if there had been any orders to Brateyevo police station over the past year. They discovered there had - by nine different customers. Could one of them have been the ""man in black""? Most of the Yandex data only included first names and a phone number. The group of women used these to find several social media profiles for staff at the police station, but no photos resembled their interrogator. Finally they came to one of the last names on the list: Ivan. A popular Russian name, so one of the most difficult to pin down. Ivan's phone number, however, did reveal a trail online - six classified adverts from the Russian trading website Avito.ru. But most of the adverts only gave them the information they already knew - a first name. One, however - for a Skoda Rapid car sold 10 minutes' drive from Brateyevo police station, posted in 2018 - included the seller's full name: Ivan Ryabov. With a surname, they could search for a picture. And almost immediately, 19-year-old Anastasia came across one she recognised. ""I started crying. I could not believeâ¦ that I managed to do it."" She sent the picture to Marina, Alexandra, and others in the Telegram group, who agreed they had found their ""man in black"". They hope this will finally prompt the authorities to open a criminal investigation. The audio recordings give a chilling insight into the women's abuse. Ryabov can be heard telling Marina to answer his questions before ""I take off my boot and smash you on the head with it."" For 14 minutes, Marina says she was shouted at and kicked by Ryabov - a pistol in her face. Finding My Torturer BBC Eye Investigations tells the story of how these young Russian women came together to expose the identity of their torturer and his commanding officer. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Anastasia, waiting outside, remembers hearing the sound of screaming and blows. When she, too, refused to co-operate with the questioning, she says Ryabov beat her over the head with a water bottle, emptied its contents over her, and then pulled a plastic bag over her soaking head where he held it against her nose and mouth for 30-40 seconds at a time. ""You think to yourself - how much longer can I take this?"" she says. Alexandra, 26, also managed to record her abuse, and in her audio we hear Ryabov boast of his total impunity. ""You think we're going to get in trouble for this? Putin told us to kill all of [your type]. That's it! Putin's on our side!"" He then threatens to kill her himself, adding: ""And then they'll give me a bonus for it too."" At least 11 of the detainees say they experienced physical abuse at the hands of the ""man in black"". When the women publicly released the audio recorded on their phones earlier this year, one Russian politician called for action - but the country's Investigative Committee deemed there to be ""insufficient evidence"" to warrant opening a criminal investigation into the case. The women also wanted to know who had authority over Ryabov that day - and why that person wasn't stopped. Anastasia had always felt another man - who the women dubbed the ""man in beige"" - was in charge that evening. Though he wasn't present inside Room 103 - where the women were terrorised - ""all communication took place through him"", she says. One of the detainees had secretly filmed him in the station waiting room. But the shaky video wasn't much to go on. A grab from the video of the ""man in beige"" The BBC obtained an arrest report from 6 March, which was signed by the police station's acting head: Lieutenant Colonel AG Fedorinov. We then found a local newspaper report from 2012 which mentions an Alexander Georgievich Fedorinov, with an accompanying photograph which seemed to match his image. But because the photo was 10 years old, the BBC used facial recognition software to double-check - and found images matching the ""man in beige"" in the video were linked to a social media account in the name of Alexander Fedorinov. That same account was tagged in an online advert for job vacancies at Brateyevo police station. The BBC put the allegations - that police officer Ivan Ryabov initiated and participated in the abuse of detainees, and that this abuse in some cases amounted to torture - to both Ryabov and Fedorinov, and to Russia's Investigative Committee. There was no response. By uncovering the identity of their abuser, Marina, Anastasia and Alexandra hope that some form of justice and accountability will emerge. ""We want to makeâ¦ it possible for the law to affect them,"" says Marina. ""No one can do this to another person, even if he is a government official.""

"This video can not be played ""Lovely to have you with us"" - headmaster greets the Cambridge children The Cambridge ""gang"" have started a new chapter together, walking hand-in-hand with their parents on the first day at their new school. Prince George, nine, Princess Charlotte, seven, and Prince Louis, four, are all starting at Lambrook School, in Berkshire, after the family's recent move to Windsor. For little Louis, in summer uniform, it was his very first day at school. His older siblings previously attended Thomas's Battersea in London. On the settling-in day, the duke referred to his children as ""all the gang"", ushering them up the steps of the private school. Headmaster Jonathan Perry was on hand to greet the young royals, shaking each of them by the hand and saying it was ""lovely to have you with us"". Asked if they were excited, all three replied ""yes"" and Prince William said they were ""all looking forward to it"" and had ""lots of questions"". The siblings showed no obvious signs of nerves as they walked confidently into Lambrook in the sunshine holding their parents' hands. Earlier, they had been forced to dodge the showers after pulling up in the school's grounds. Parents arriving later were hit by torrential rain. As the family walked towards the school entrance in front of two cameras, they could be heard laughing and Prince William was seen stroking Prince Louis' hair reassuringly. The children's first full day is on Thursday, the official start of term. The Cambridge children are all smiles on the way to their new school Lambrook School headmaster Jonathan Perry greets the young royals This will be a privileged education. Annual fees for all three children will be more than Â£53,000. The school sits in 52 acres of Berkshire countryside close to Ascot Racecourse. It has a nine-hole golf course and swimming pool as well as bees, chickens and pigs for pupils to look after. Some children are boarders at the school but, for now, the Cambridges will be day pupils. In 1990, his parents Prince Charles and Princess Diana accompanied William on his first day at Ludgrove Preparatory School near Wokingham, Berkshire In 2017, Prince George started at Thomas's Battersea in London Princess Charlotte was greeted by one of the teachers at Thomas's Battersea on her first day in 2019 Marking a first day at school has become a royal rite of passage. Earlier, a single photographer and one TV camera filmed the Cambridge family as they arrived at Lambrook. The footage was then shared across a number of media organisations. Limiting the number of cameras and journalists is a way of protecting the children from the public glare. The hope is that a managed glimpse into life at Lambrook will afford the family some privacy at school from now on. It was very different when William started school. In the late-80s and mid-90s, he faced a barrage of cameras as he started nursery and then school, always accompanied by his mother and often his father. To cries of ""William"" or ""Diana"" those nervous, first steps into school were a major media event. When he started Eton in 1995, cameras were even allowed to follow him as he walked to his first lesson. Such access just would not happen now. These milestones are still recorded but royal children are no longer as exposed on these significant days. Prince William's sister-in-law, the Duchess of Sussex, recently discussed her concerns about her son Archie attending school in the UK duringan interview with US magazine The Cut. Meghan said she would not have been able to pick up Archie from school in the UK ""without it being a royal photo call with a press pen of 40 people snapping pictures"" and said that was something she had a problem with. The Editors' Code of Practice, the rules from the Independent Press Standards Organisation newspapers and magazines follow, prevents photographing children at school. George, Charlotte and Louis can stay at Lambrook until they are 13 years old. The school says its aims to create ""happy and thoughtful young adults who are global citizens"". Lambrook has some royal history, with two of Queen Victoria's grandsons, Prince Christian Victor and Prince Albert of Schleswig-Holstein, having been pupils. During their time at the school, Queen Victoria used to travel from Windsor Castle to watch them in plays and cricket matches.

"Workers at Royal Mail have announced further strikes in a dispute over pay and conditions. Staff in the Communication Workers Union (CWU) are already set to walk out on Thursday this week. They will now also strike for 48 hours on 30 September and 1 October - the latest move in a worsening dispute. The CWU said its 115,000 members did not support an ""imposed"" 2% pay rise. Royal Mail says the union rejected an offer worth up to 5.5%. CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: ""There can be no doubt that postal workers are completely united in their determination to secure the dignified, proper pay rise they deserve. ""We can't keep on living in a country where bosses rake in billions in profit while their employees are forced to use food banks."" He highlighted the Â£400m the company had returned to shareholders in the last year, saying ""our members won't accept pleads of poverty from the company"". Royal Mail's latest adjusted operating profit for the year to March was Â£416m, up from Â£344m previously, but the company says it is currently losing Â£1m a day. A spokesperson from Royal Mail apologised to customers for the inconvenience and reiterated that it was now a parcels business. ""We must adapt old ways of working designed for letters,"" the spokesperson said. Thousands of Royal Mail workers go on strike Why is everyone going on strike? ""Strike action has weakened our financial position and is threatening the long-term job security of our postmen and women,"" they added. ""The CWU has a responsibility to recognise the reality of the situation Royal Mail faces as a business and to engage urgently on the changes required."" Royal Mail said it was doing all it could to ""minimise any delays"". On strike days it will deliver as many Special Delivery and Tracked 24 parcels as possible, it said. It will also prioritise the delivery of medical prescriptions where possible. A range of workers including Openreach engineers, BT call centre staff, railway workers and barristers have walked out in recent weeks as wages fall further behind soaring inflation of about 10%.

"Apple has unveiled the iPhone 14, with emergency satellite connectivity and car crash detection technology, at a launch event in the US. The company revealed four versions of the new handset at its Cupertino headquarters, with an audience attending in person for the first time since the pandemic. It also showed off a new extreme sports wearable - the Watch Ultra. The event focused on next generation iPhone, Watch and AirPod products. Apple CEO Tim Cook was on stage at the Steve Jobs theatre inside the tech giant's California campus - but the presentation itself was entirely pre-recorded. Apple reveals iPhone 14 Pro and Watch Ultra Apple Watch Series 8 has a number of new features, including car crash detection, temperature sensors for tracking ovulation cycles and a new low-power mode option. People have been cautious about menstrual trackers since changes were made to abortion legislation in the US and there are concerns that data about periods could be used by law enforcement. Apple says the data on its devices will be encrypted and only accessible via a passcode or biometrics. ""We are taking our commitment to women's health even further,"" said Jeff Williams, chief operating officer at Apple. Apple said a new automatic retrospective ovulation notification could help those who are trying to conceive. If activated, the new watch can monitor body temperate every five seconds overnight, and detect tiny changes which can signal ovulation. Another new feature is car crash detection. Using sensors, the watch will be able to identify a severe crash and will automatically connect its wearer with emergency services, provide their exact location and notify emergency contacts. The Series 8 now also features a low power mode, a feature borrowed from the iPhone, that promises up to 36 hours of battery life on a full charge. The Apple Watch Series 8 is priced from $399 in the US, Â£419 in the UK. The new Apple Watch Ultra Swim-proof, dust-proof and crack-resistant - Apple has announced its rival to the likes of Garmin, Polar and other rugged watchmakers. Ultramarathoner Scott Jurek from Born to Run appeared in the presentation for the new watch, which focused on a larger face design for extreme sports use. All Ultra watches have up to 36 hours battery life on a single charge and an extended battery life of 60 hours, with Apple promising enough power for its customers to complete an ultra-triathlon which includes swimming, cycling and running. The Apple Watch Ultra is priced from $799 in the US, Â£849 in the UK. Apple CEO Tim Cook told the BBC it was ""good to be back"" in person The company is releasing the iPhone 14 in two sizes, the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus. The new handsets are capable of sending an emergency call for help via satellite. The phone will display the whereabouts of passing satellites overhead and demonstrate how to point the device at them correctly. It can take from 15 seconds to a few minutes to send a basic message. ""The investment to add satellite capability should not be underestimated,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. ""It will likely have taken Apple years to put all the pieces of the puzzle in place, including a commercial agreement with satellite provider Globalstar, and the creation of the infrastructure needed to pass messages to the emergency services."" Tech analyst Paolo Pescatore said he believed the innovation was good news for consumers ""in hard-to-reach areas"". ""It is encouraging to see providers starting to get serious about using satellite - ultimately reliable and robust connectivity is still highly sought-after among all users,"" he said. The tech giant announced a new 12-megapixel camera, capable of taking photos of fast-moving subjects, and the company claims a 49% improvement in low-light capturing. The front camera also included auto-focus for the first time, to help sharpen selfies. According to Apple, iPhone users took more than three trillion photos in the last 12 months. The iPhone 14 is priced from $799 (US), Â£849 (UK). The biggest change in iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max design is the top of the screen which is now a pill shaped cut-out. A feature called the Dynamic Island has replaced the black notch, which many iPhone users complain about - and it can change shape depending on what notifications there are. The other big change is that the handset can always remain on. When the phone is not in use, the screen dims and the refresh rate is lowered. The handset comes in a deep purple colour alongside black, silver and gold. The iPhone 14 Pro is priced at $999 (US), Â£1099 (UK). AirPods Pro are easier to find than their predecessors. Each pair comes with a new system for finding individual lost earphones, which play a chime when dropped outside of the case. Additionally, the case itself gets its own speaker, which will play a louder sound when prompted by the Find My app. The new AirPods Pro are priced at $249 (US), Â£249 (UK). Being here in person, among an enthusiastic crowd of Apple fans, certainly made for a more interesting launch than recent years. But nothing was announced today that is going to revolutionise the tech industry. Much of Apple's new tech seems ideal if you find yourself in some kind of peril on a regular basis.  The new iPhone 14 will be able to send texts by satellite when off the grid. The Ultra Watch design is chunky with extra-long battery life - the company says this is perfect for multi-day remote trips. Apple also announced a new crash detection system on new watches and phones, which will alert the emergency services when it detects an impact. The strategy here is pretty clear. Apple is continuing to pitch its hardware as a health and safety aid. Not surprisingly, Tim Cook describes the products as ""essential"". But in reality these are interesting but fairly niche updates - features that users will hope they will never have to use.

"The pound has plummeted to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985. Sterling fell 0.64% to $1.145 on Wednesday afternoon - a level not seen in 37 years. The Bank of England said a weaker outlook for the UK economy as well as a stronger dollar were putting pressure on sterling. Governor Andrew Bailey also warned that little could be done to stop the UK falling into a recession this year as the war in Ukraine continued. He added that it would ""overwhelmingly be caused by the actions of Russia and the impact on energy prices"". The Bank expects the economy to shrink in the last three months of 2022 and keep shrinking until the end of 2023. The warning comes ahead of a government plan to limit a sharp rise in energy bills. It is understood that a typical energy bill could be capped at around Â£2,500,with new Prime Minister Liz Truss set to announce the details on Thursday. Currently, a typical household's gas and electricity bill is due to rise from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 in October. UK will fall into recession this year, warns Bank How high will energy bills go now? Energy prices climbed sharply when lockdown was lifted and the economy started to return to normal. They have increased further as Russia sharply cut its gas supplies to Europe. It has pushed up the price of gas across the continent, including in the UK, having a huge knock-on effect on consumers. Speaking in front of the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday, Mr Bailey said ""sadly"" a recession remained the most likely outcome in the UK. When asked by MPs if there was much that the central bank could do to stop it, he said: ""Insofar as the war is having this huge effect, the answer to that would be no."" Governor Andrew Bailey said a recession would ""overwhelmingly be caused by the actions of Russia and the impact on energy prices"". The Bank predicted a UK recession last month as it raised interest rates by the highest margin in 27 years in a bid to keep soaring prices under control. Higher interest rates can make borrowing more expensive, meaning people have less money to spend and prices will stop rising as quickly. But there is a limit as to how effective UK rate rises can be when inflation is caused by global issues. Defending its recent moves, Mr Bailey added: ""The person going to put the UK in recession is Vladimir Putin, not the MPC [Monetary Policy Committee]."" He said the Bank would take the new prime minister's energy plan announcement ""into account"" when deciding on interest rates next week. During her campaign, Ms Truss hit out at the Bank of England, accusing it of being slow to react to rising prices and protect vulnerable households. But on Wednesday, the new Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng reiterated his ""full support for the independent Bank of England and their mission to control inflation, which is central to tackling cost of living challenges"". He also said he and Mr Bailey would meet twice a week from now on to discuss the cost-of-living crisis. Other economists also expect the UK to fall into a recession despite Ms Truss's energy support plan - albeit a shorter and less severe one. But some suggested on Wednesday that plans to cap energy bills could mean that increases in the cost of living will peak earlier and be ""significantly lower"" than previously forecast. The cost of living is rising at its fastest rate in 40 years, at 10.1%, with food, fuel and energy prices all up. Investment bank Goldman Sachs said a cap on bills for households could see inflation, which tracks how the cost of living changes over time, peak at 10.8% in October, rather than the 14.8% it forecast before. It then expects inflation to slow to 2.4% by December 2023. Deutsche Bank, HSBC and the Bank of England's own chief economist, Huw Pill, also believe the plan could slow price rises. But there is uncertainty around what exactly the plan will look like and what would happen once any cap is lifted. Mr Pill also said it was too soon to say how it might affect interest rates, which have gone up for the last six months in a row as the Bank tries to calm prices. Others say that capping energy prices at their current level would still leave many people struggling. According tothe Office for National Statistics,external, four in 10 adults who pay energy bills are already finding it ""very or somewhat difficult to afford them"". And the End Fuel Poverty Coalition pressure group estimates that if the energy price cap is frozen at Â£2,500 this October, 6.9 million UK households will still be in fuel poverty this winter - up from 4.6 million last winter. This video can not be played Worried about energy bills? The BBC's Colletta Smith tells you - in a minute - about four discounts and payments that could help There are also concerns about the cost of Ms Truss's plan, with research firm Capital Economics describing the support package as an ""effective but expensive sticking plaster"". Many expect the government to borrow at least Â£100bn, adding to the UK's already-high debt pile. This would come as Ms Truss attempts to push through a promised Â£30bn of tax cuts. On Wednesday, the chancellor said higher borrowing will be ""necessary"" in the short term to help people with bills. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC's Today programme: ""The big question here is: 'Is it going to be Â£100bn? What is the exit strategy from supporting bills?' ""My guess is it might end up being an awful lot more than that unless we react quite quickly to make it a better [energy] system,"" he said, adding that the plan would benefit affluent people more than the less well off. On the other side of the House of Commons just before the PMQs battle, was perhaps the more important Commons appearance. Governor Andrew Bailey and his team, confirming that there was not much they can do to stop a recession, blaming it on the Kremlin, and acknowledging that the UK is facing an historically unprecedented energy shock. It is heading to be three or four times worse for households than the hit to incomes in the 1970s' oil shock. At the same time the Bank welcomed the end of the summer uncertainty over energy bills, and anticipate that it will be big enough to prevent inflation spiralling higher. However Governor Bailey also acknowledged there were specific UK factors driving jittery markets, in addition to the strong dollar, especially the UK's extra reliance on gas. As Chief Economist Huw Pill put it, that dependence is not going to change quickly, so the only real question is ""who covers that cost?"". With sterling falling again today, to a 37 year low against the dollar, there are concerns in the markets that the PM and Chancellor will hope to contain tomorrow.

"Unite union members at Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council are to begin continuous strike action from Thursday. The union said there was ""a total failure to recognise the need to provide council workers with a living income"". It said the industrial action followed ""a proposal to settle the strike"" at a council meeting on Tuesday. The council said it had been unable to reach agreement at the meeting and warned residents to expect disruption. Gareth Scott of Unite said the union had hoped that Causeway councillors would ""support a deal similar to that which ended the disputes at Derry City and Strabane and Mid-Ulster council"". According to the union, a proposal was put to Tuesday's council meeting ""to settle the strike by offering two pay-point increments and a lump sum to workers"". In a statement, the council said the strike action related to a dispute over 2021-2022 pay, ""which is negotiated nationally by the National Joint Council (NJC) on behalf of councils in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland"". ""Further to this, council has been negotiating locally with trade unions, which led to the matter being discussed at last night's full council meeting,"" it said. ""Members were unable to reach agreement and therefore strike action will now proceed."" The council warned that services such as waste collection, recycling centres, and street cleaning could be affected. Mr Scott said Unite hoped other unions would join the industrial action, the latest in a series of such strikes across Northern Ireland. ""We are hopeful that both Nipsa and GMB trade unions will now swiftly proceed to ballot their members and lend their strength to a joint strike action,"" he said. ""Workers stand stronger when they stand together."" Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council said it ""deeply regrets that strike action is taking place and the impact this will have on residents"" The council asked residents to leave bins out for collection on their normal day, saying the would be emptied ""where there are sufficient crews to deliver a service"". ""If bins are not emptied, residents are asked to take their bins back in from the kerbside and place them out again on their next scheduled collection day during the strike,"" it said. It said it ""deeply regrets that strike action is taking place and the impact this will have on residents"" and remained ""fully committed to finding a resolution through ongoing discussions with trade unions"". Last week, it emerged that a strike affecting bin collections in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council areawas to be extended despite concerns about mounting rubbish. Unions said no deal had been reached with the council. The strike began on 15 August and it involves more than 1,000 council workers who are protesting over their pay and conditions. It is being staged by members of the GMB, Unite and Nipsa trade unions. The action was initially due to last for four weeks but the council said it would now continue past 11 September. About 200 members of the Unite union working for Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council havealso gone on strike. The action follows a dispute about pay and conditions. Unite has said a dispute is ongoing in Newry, Mourne and Down District Council. Maintenance workers at the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) havealso begun strike action over pay. Unite said on Monday the dispute involves about 300 of its members and would remain in place for four weeks.

"Workers at Royal Mail have announced further strikes in a dispute over pay and conditions. Staff in the Communication Workers Union (CWU) are already set to walk out on Thursday this week. They will now also strike for 48 hours on 30 September and 1 October - the latest move in a worsening dispute. The CWU said its 115,000 members did not support an ""imposed"" 2% pay rise. Royal Mail says the union rejected an offer worth up to 5.5%. CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: ""There can be no doubt that postal workers are completely united in their determination to secure the dignified, proper pay rise they deserve. ""We can't keep on living in a country where bosses rake in billions in profit while their employees are forced to use food banks."" He highlighted the Â£400m the company had returned to shareholders in the last year, saying ""our members won't accept pleads of poverty from the company"". Royal Mail's latest adjusted operating profit for the year to March was Â£416m, up from Â£344m previously, but the company says it is currently losing Â£1m a day. A spokesperson from Royal Mail apologised to customers for the inconvenience and reiterated that it was now a parcels business. ""We must adapt old ways of working designed for letters,"" the spokesperson said. Thousands of Royal Mail workers go on strike Why is everyone going on strike? ""Strike action has weakened our financial position and is threatening the long-term job security of our postmen and women,"" they added. ""The CWU has a responsibility to recognise the reality of the situation Royal Mail faces as a business and to engage urgently on the changes required."" Royal Mail said it was doing all it could to ""minimise any delays"". On strike days it will deliver as many Special Delivery and Tracked 24 parcels as possible, it said. It will also prioritise the delivery of medical prescriptions where possible. A range of workers including Openreach engineers, BT call centre staff, railway workers and barristers have walked out in recent weeks as wages fall further behind soaring inflation of about 10%.

"The suspect in a stabbing that left 10 dead and 18 others injured has died after he was arrested by police, officials say Myles Sanderson, 32, was apprehended when police rammed his stolen vehicle off the road after a high-speed car chase Police say Sanderson went into ""medical distress"" after he was detained, and was taken to hospital where he was declared dead His capture in the town of Rosthern in Saskatchewan on Wednesday afternoon ends a giant manhunt that covered three provinces Both Myles Sanderson and his brother, Damien, were charged with murder over Sunday's massacre Damien Sanderson was found dead on Monday at James Smith Cree Nation - the indigenous community where most of the victims lived Edited by Rebecca Seales We're now ending our live coverage of the arrest and death of the main suspect in the stabbing spree that claimed the lives of 10 people in Canada on Sunday. Myles Sanderson died after experiencing ""medical distress"" after his arrest on Wednesday, police said, without giving further detail. They also declined to comment further on how his brother Damien, who is accused of helping in the murders, died earlier this week. His body was found on Monday, and police say they suspect his brother may have killed him. Our live coverage was provided by Max Matza, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Nadine Yousif, Robin Levinson-King and Grace Conley, and edited by Rebecca Seales. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau will be holding a news conference on Thursday from the west coast city of Vancouver. It's safe to assume that he'll be asked extensively about the investigation by journalists there. Earlier on Thursday, he plans to speak on the phone with US President Joe Biden. Trudeau has been introducing tough new anti-gun laws in recent months, last monthimposing a total ban on the import of handguns. It remains to be seen what his administration can do to prevent future mass stabbing attacks. Jessica MurphyBBC News, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan In a story that has had many twists, there was a final one this evening: that suspect Myles Sanderson died after being taken into custody. And in a story that also has many unresolved questions, there was another to add: the circumstances of that death, particularly given photos have emerged that seem to show him standing up as he was being arrested. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore didn't have many answers to offer. Asked if he could have died from an overdose - he had a documented history of substance abuse - Blackmore gave no more details. She also refused to say whether Narcan, a drug given to stop overdoses, was administered. ""I can't speak to the specific manner of death"", she said, adding that how he died was part of the ongoing investigation. Here's what we've just heard from police: The police press conference is over. They confirmed that Myles Sanderson died following his arrest, but did not provide details on how he died. They said more would be revealed as the investigation continued, and urged the public to continue to share information pertaining to the case. Blackmore said it's traumatic for victims to recount memories. The investigation has included more than 100 interviews with victims and witnesses and members of the public. ""People want to understand what happened here and how that unfolded,"" she said. She acknowledged this was just the first step in victims' healing process and that many questions remain unanswered. ""They can rest easy tonight knowing that Myles Sanderson is no longer a threat to them,"" she said. Damien Sanderson was found dead on Monday, after being named a suspect and charged with first-degree murder along with his brother. His body was found near other victims around James Smith Cree Nation. ""At this point in time, he is considered a suspect in the homicides that were committed,"" Blackmore says. Police said his injuries did not appear self-inflicted at the time. They did not elaborate during Wednesday's press conference. As people hear updates from police on Myles Sanderson's arrest, several gathered in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan for a sombre vigil. ""Tomorrow we start the process on our grieving"", said James Smith Cree Nation chief Wally Burns to mourners, some of whom wiped away tears. âIâm holding back a lot of hurt, a lot of anger. I wish this was just a dream, but itâs not.â It is one of several vigils that have taken place or are planned for the coming days in honour of the 10 victims who died in the mass stabbing attacks. A collective prayer for James Smith Cree Nation and Weldon residents will also take place at First Nations University of Canada in Regina on Friday. Words of solidarity have poured in from across the nation and around the world. The Queen has also sent her condolences, with a statement earlier today saying she was mourning ""with all Canadians at this tragic time"". Police say there were signs the now-deceased suspect was injured before his arrest. Initial reports on Wednesday, when he was spotted near Wakaw, indicated he may have had an injury. A vehicle was broken into in Weldon, after the attacks on Sunday, and it appeared he may have stolen a first-aid kit. Jessica MurphyBBC News, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan Police in Saskatchewan were quick to send out mobile phone alerts to residents shortly after they realised that a mass attack was taking place. Over the last few days, loud emergency phone alerts with updates on the manhunt became commonplace. These types of alerts are usually sent for missing children or extreme weather events. People I spoke to here were on the fence about the alerts and their frequency. Some felt they were useful information that helped residents to remain cautious and aware. Others thought it was added stress amid the terrible news. But this response suggested that the RCMP - the Royal Canadian Mounted Police - had shifted public communication tactics in the wake of another killing spree in Canada. In Nova Scotia, a maritime province on Canada's east coast, a commission is looking into the police response to a mass shooting when a gunman, posing as a police officer, killed 22 people over the course of two days in April 2020. One of the main issues being looked into at the inquiry?  Why the force failed to use the provincial alert system to warn people of the danger. The last alert sent by police announcing a sighting of the suspect The assistant commissioner continues that police have conducted more than 120 interviews so far in connection with the case as they try to piece together what happened. Asked about the suspect's Myles Sanderson's brother, who was discovered dead on Monday, police say they are not prepared yet to say how he died. ""We may not know how some things unfolded,"" she says. Blackmore says it remains unclear how Damien died, and ""how that unfolded between the two of them"". Asked about the suspect's possible motive, the RCMP assistant commissioner says his motivation ""may at this time and forever just be known to Myles"". Police are now taking questions from journalists in Regina, and have refused to give more detail as to how Sanderson died. ""He was the only occupant of the vehicle when he was arrested,"" says the RCMP assistant commissioner. ""Shortly after being arrested he went into medical distress,"" she says, repeating her earlier statement. She says a post-mortem examination will determine how he died. ""I can't speak to the specific manner of death"", she says, saying how he died is part of the ongoing investigation. Police are now repeating their statement in French, one of Canada's two official languages alongside English. The Saskatchewan RCMP chief adds that she visited the affected communities today, and personally witnessed the ""generosity and support"" of the residents there. She adds her appreciation to all the police officers involved in the search, which took place over an area about half the size of Europe. Police spotted the white truck that he had stolen, and after stopping him, ""through verbal identification, confirmed the driver to Myles Sanderson,"" says Assistant Commissioner Blackmore. ""He was arrested by police and taken into custody. A knife was discovered inside his vehicle,"" she says. ""Shortly after his arrest he went into medical distress,"" she continued without describing how he died. The suspect's stolen vehicle Police have confirmed that Myles Sanderson died shortly after he was arrested earlier on Wednesday, after going into ""medical distress"". ""This evening our province is breathing a collective sigh of relief as Myles Sanderson is no longer at large,"" says Assistant Commissioner Blackmore, beginning her statement. She is now going through a timeline of the police response. Police first arrived at the James Smith Cree Nation at 06:18 on Sunday, she says. ""The magnitude of this investigation is immense,"" she continues. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are now giving an update from the Mounties' regional headquarters in Regina, the capital of Saskatchewan. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore, who leads the Saskatchewan RCMP, will be speaking. Many questions remain unanswered, including how people were stabbed across two communities in a short space of time, and why police failed to track down Myles Sanderson when he ceased contact with his parole officer. Police say they have will only permit journalists to ask question for 20 minutes after making a statement. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

"This video can not be played Watch: Truss faces Starmer in her first PMQ's as PM Sir Keir Starmer has told Liz Truss working people will be footing the bill for ""vast"" energy firm profits under her plans to tackle the energy crisis. At her first Prime Minister's Questions, Ms Truss rejected Labour's call to extend a windfall tax on gas and oil company profits. Ms Truss also used her first full day as PM to appoint more ministers. Meanwhile, an online meeting between the Queen and senior politicianshas been postponed. Buckingham Palace said the Queen had been advised to rest after ""a full day"" on Tuesday during which she met the outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson and his successor Ms Truss. Latest developments as Truss and Starmer clash at first PMQs Bank warns it cannot stop UK falling into recession What can Liz Truss do to help people pay their bills? Under a plan, to be outlined by Ms Truss in the Commons on Thursday, the typical energy bill could be capped at about Â£2,500. The full details have yet to be revealed but the overall package is likely to total around Â£100bn. This will be paid for, in the short-term, by higher government borrowing, according to the new Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, who had a meeting with bankers and other financial figures on Wednesday morning. At PMQs, Sir Keir told Ms Truss ""energy producers will make Â£170bn in excess profits over the next two years"". ""Is she really telling us that she is going to leave these vast excess profits on the table and make working people foot the bill for decades to come?"" the Labour leader asked. Ms Truss said she understood people were ""struggling with the cost of living"" and energy bills, which is why she would take ""immediate action to help people with the cost of their energy bills"". As Prime Minister's Questions finished, there appeared to be a warm, one-on-one brief chat between Liz Truss and Sir Keir Starmer. I think Sir Keir said ""well done"" to his opponent. All party leaders regularly acknowledge that PMQs is a tough gig. So how did it feel, and how did the main players perform? It felt less personal, much less theatrical and more ideological. Gone were the linguistic gymnastics of Boris Johnson, and the personal venom between the Conservative and Labour leaders. Judging either by this first outing is clearly ridiculous, it will take a while for both leaders to adjust to this new normal on a Wednesday lunchtime. But what is clear already is how different it will feel and the extent to which that will demand a very different approach from Sir Keir than the one he adopted with Boris Johnson. Liz Truss and Sir Keir Starmer chatting after Prime Minister's Questions The prime minister said she would reform the UK's overall energy mix by building more nuclear power stations and exploring more fossil fuel supplies in the North Sea. She argued extending the windfall tax on oil and gas companies would deter investment in the UK ""just when we need to be growing the economy"". Turning to Ms Truss's plan to halt planned tax rises on big business, Sir Keir accused her of ""protecting the profits of Shell and giving Amazon a tax break rather than helping families and public services"". Ms Truss said she was ""on the side of people who work hard and do the right thing"" and her plans would deliver new investment and new jobs ""right across our country"". Soaring energy bills mean firms close to collapse Liz Truss set to cut energy bills for millions Truss shelves plans to reform human rights law The Labour leader accused her of being part of a government that ""got us into this mess and now says how terrible it is"". ""Can't she see there's nothing new about a Tory prime minister who, when asked who pays, says 'it's you, the working people of Britain'?"" To cheers from Tory MPs, Ms Truss replied: ""There's nothing new about a Labour leader who is calling for more tax rises. It's the same old, same old tax and spend."" The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford joined Sir Keir's attacks, describing ""a Truss tax, that household and businesses will be paying for years to come"". Downing Street later said the existing windfall tax - the Energy Profits Levy put in place by former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in May - would not be altered. The levy is an additional 25% tax on UK oil and gas profits and is due to last until the end of 2025. Ms Truss discussed the problem of rising energy bills in a phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. No 10 said the two leaders discussed the importance of ""protecting countries made vulnerable by Russia's economic blackmail"", and the Northern Ireland Protocol. Following PMQs, Ms Trussannounced further appointmentsto her government, including some junior jobs for Sunak-supporting MPs such as Robert Jenrick who becomes a health minister. Former Brexit minister Steve Baker also makes a return to government, becoming a minister in the Northern Ireland Office.

"The windfall tax on oil and gas companies will increase in November, and will remain in place until March 2030. The levy was introduced as a response to soaring energy company profits, and was designed to help fund a scheme to limit household gas and electricity bills. However, firms in the sector have warned that the increase will hit jobs and investment. A windfall tax is a levy imposed on companies that have benefited from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Global oil and gas prices started to rise in late 2020 as demand increased with the lifting of Covid restrictions, but they soared in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The increase in prices led to bumper profits for energy companies, leading to calls for a windfall tax. The Energy Profits Levy - the formal name for the windfall tax -was introduced in May 2022 by the then Chancellor, Rishi Sunak,external. The government said the money raised would fund support for households facing rising energy bills. The levy applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas. It was initially set at 25% and was due to expire at the end of 2025. In January 2023 the then Chancellor Jeremy Hunt increased the levy to 35%. In the spring 2024 Budget,Hunt announced it would remain in place until March 2029because the continuing war in Ukraine was extending energy firms' windfall profits. The new Labour government saidit would increase the levy to 38% on 1 November,external. The tax will remain in place until 31 March 2030, unless - as originallyset out by the previous government- oil and gas prices drop below a certain level for six months. A separate levy was also brought in on ""extraordinary returns"" from low-carbon electricity generating firms in the UK. Larger operators started payingthe Electricity Generator Levy,externalon 1 January 2023. It was hoped this would raise about Â£14bn over six years. Among the UK energy giants, BP reported a record profit of $27.7bn in 2022. While this fell to$13.8bn in 2023, it was still the firm's second highest annual profit in a decade. Shell's profits of $39.9bn in 2022 were the highest in its 115-year history. Its 2023profits were $28.2bn. BP says its UK businesses account for less than 10% of global profits, while Shell makes about 5% of its revenue in the UK. Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea were already taxed differently before the levy was introduced In the financial year 2022-2023, the first year of its operation,the levy raised Â£2.6bn,external. In the following 12-month periodit raised Â£3.6bn,external. BP said its North Sea business paid $2.2bn in UK tax for its North Sea operations in 2022, of which $700m was due to the levy. In 2023 it paid $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn), including $720m under the levy. Shell said it paid Â£178m in UK windfall tax for 2022. In 2023, it paid Â£1.1bn in overall tax in the UK, Â£240m of which was a result of the levy. Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea are taxed differently to other companies. They pay 30% corporation tax on their profits and a supplementary 10% rate on top of that. In contrast, other firms with profits over Â£250,000 a year pay 25% corporation tax. When the windfall tax is added, it means the overall tax rate faced by oil and gas companies operating in the UK is 75%, rising to 78% in November. However, oil and gas firms have been able to reduce the amount of UK tax they pay by factoring in losses or spending on things like decommissioning North Sea oil platforms. BP,externalandShell,externalboth received more money back from the UK government than they paid in tax every year from 2015 to 2020 (except Shell in 2017). Energy firms have also been able to reduce the amount of windfall tax they pay through certain investment allowances. However, the government has said it will remove some of these allowances from 1 November. Further details on the changes to the windfall levy will be set out in the Budget on 30 October. What might be in the Budget? The industry body Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) said the proposed changes to the windfall taxwill sharply reduce investment in the sector, putting thousands of jobs at risk. OEUK says the expected tax paid by oil and gas producers would ""increase in the very short term"" by Â£2bn, and would later result in a Â£12bn loss. In August, 42 companies wrote to the government toexpress their ""grave concern"" over the changes. The Treasury said the government was committed to a ""constructive dialogue"" with the oil and gas industry about the levy. But it also said it wanted North Sea oil and gas producers ""to contribute their fair share towards our energy transition"" away from fossil fuels. Where does the UK get its energy from?

As she's grilled about her new job, she suddenly seems distracted as she grabs for her mobile phone. ""I've just realised my alarm is going off on my phone,"" says Therese Coffey,live on LBC Radio,external. ""You're getting a bit of Dr Dre."" The unmistakable staccato opening keys of Dr Dre's 1999 hit Still D.R.E. ring out as Ms Coffey chuckles and admits ""it's just an eight o'clock alarm"". She regains her composure and the interview continues. Meet the new health secretary and deputy prime minister - a music and football-loving Tory MP with a reputation for partying as hard as she works. A long-time ally of new Prime Minister Liz Truss, Ms Coffey has been given one of the most challenging briefs in government: fixing the multiple crises afflicting the NHS. In her first speech as prime minister, Ms Truss said putting ""our health service on a firm footing"" was one of her three early priorities. The fact Ms Truss has appointed one of her strongest supporters to that role indicates how seriously the prime minister is taking this particular priority. New cabinet: Who is in Liz Truss's top team? Kwasi Kwarteng: Chancellor who likes a challenge Can Coffey deliver her NHS A, B, C and D? With 6.6 million people in queues for treatment, NHS backlogs - as well growing ambulance waiting times and staff vacancies - will be at the top of her to-do list. Her plan to sort it out? ""My focus is on A, B, C, D,"" Ms Coffey told the BBC. ""That stands for ambulances, backlogs, care and doctors and dentists."" Focusing on social care and freeing up space in hospitals ""is going to be critical"", she said. Given her cabinet experience as work and pensions secretary, Ms Coffey will believe she's up to the task entrusted to her by Ms Truss. Close friends since they were elected as Tory MPs in 2010, Ms Truss and Ms Coffey have risen through the political ranks together. Their friendship has proved fruitful for their political careers. Both attended Oxford University, with Ms Coffey studying chemistry (as former Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher did) and cutting her political teeth in the Oxford Union debating society. Ms Coffey was born in 1971 in Lancashire and educated in Liverpool. She has attributed her Conservative political persuasions to her experiences of growing up in the city during the 1970s and 80s. Speaking tothe BBC's Political Thinking podcastin 2020, Ms Coffey criticised the Labour Militant council of the 1980s and said the rest of the country ""seemed to be getting on rather well"" under the prime minister at the time, Mrs Thatcher. At the start of her professional life, Ms Coffey worked in several roles for confectionary giant Mars and as a finance manager at the BBC. Elected for the safe Tory seat of Suffolk Coastal, her parliamentary career began in 2010. Since then, she has served in the governments of Theresa May, Boris Johnson and now Ms Truss. Before becoming deputy PM, her most prominent role was secretary of state at the Department for Work and Pensions, a post she held from September 2019 until this week. In that role her mettle was tested in September last year, when she defended the scrapping of a Â£20 weekly uplift to Universal Credit payments introduced during the pandemic. In remarks criticised as out of touch, Ms Coffey said benefits recipients could make the money back by working two extra hours a week. This video can not be played Therese Coffey defended the phasing-out of the Universal Credit uplift When she was linked with a senior role in Ms Truss's government, Ms Coffey and her voting record on certain issues came under renewed scrutiny. A practising Catholic, Ms Coffey has previously voted against extending abortion care, saying earlier this year she would ""prefer that people didn't have abortions but I am not going to condemn people that do"". The British Pregnancy Advisory Servicehas called the new health secretary's record on abortion rights ""deeply concerning"". But Ms Coffey told the BBC abortion access already available in England and Wales will continue while she was in post. Similarly controversial was her row with Manchester United star Marcus Rashford last year, after he forced the government to extend its free school meal voucher scheme. On his campaign, Rashford tweeted: ""When you wake up this morning and run your shower, take a second to think about parents who have had their water turned off during lockdown."" In reply, Ms Coffey posted on Twitter: ""Water cannot be disconnected though."" Expressing concern at her response, Rashford urged MPs to ""put rivalries aside"" and help struggling households. Yet Ms Coffey has insisted she doesn't pay much attention to social media. When asked about social media posts circulating about her, the health secretary said: ""I don't tend to look at social media."" Such comments, she said, do not worry her. Ms Coffey seems comfortable with the unconventional political persona she has cultivated. In Westminster, her karaoke nights are the stuff of legend, with Ms Truss known to be a regular attendee in the past. Ms Coffey's enthusiasm for karaoke was on full display at the Tory conference in October last year, when she was filmed belting out a version of (I've Had) The Time Of My Life and other pop anthems. Football - namely Liverpool FC - is another of her passions. She is a regular at Anfield - Liverpool FC's stadium - and even followed the team to Paris to watch their defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League final earlier this year. She was also pictured alongside Ms Truss at Wembley, where they cheered on England's Lionesses in their Women's Euro 2022 victory against Germany. Ms Truss and Ms Coffey were at Wembley to watch the Euro 2022 final Other pictures of Ms Coffey have been less flattering. One, taken at a Spectator magazine party in 2015, showed her toking a large cigar and swilling a glass of champagne. But despite the occasional gaffe, Ms Coffey has been described in glowing terms by her colleagues. Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary, has said ""nothing ever goes wrong"" in a department led by Ms Coffey, and friends in Westminster cite the new deputy PM's tireless work ethic. Unmarried with no children, Ms Coffey is a private person. She's never been shy about showing her loyalty to Ms Truss though. Her tweet marking Ms Truss's elevation to prime minister was a case in point. ""Brilliant news that @trussliz is now our prime minister,"" Ms Coffey wrote. It was a retweet of a post shared by Ms Coffey almost exactly 10 years ago to celebrate the promotion of a friend to a junior ministerial role. The friend was Liz Truss. Allow Twitter content?

"Energy bills have been rising for households across Europe as prices have been driven up by worries about gas and oil supplies after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Individual countries, and the European Union (EU), have announced support schemes for consumers. Here's what they're doing: In 2021, the EU imported 40% of its gas from Russia - so many of its member states are exposed to high energy prices. In response, the EU is introducing: A cap on gas prices if they exceed â¬180 per megawatt hour for three days running, from February 2022. A ""solidarity levy"" - a windfall tax - on excess profits made by oil, gas, coal and refinery companies in 2022. A cap on the revenues of electricity companies which produce energy from wind, solar and nuclear. These revenues have risen as the price of electricity from these sources is linked to soaring gas prices - the cap is expected to raise â¬140 billion (Â£121bn). A mandatory reduction of electricity consumption in peak hours by 5% across the EU, until March 2023. A voluntary reduction of 10% of overall electricity consumption - individual countries will decide how to to this. In October, the German parliament approved a ""defensive shield"" package worth â¬200bn (Â£175bn). It includesa cap on gas and electricity prices for households and some businessesfrom early next year. The government will pay December's monthly gas bill for all households and small-to-medium businesses. In September and October, all taxpayers received a one-off energy payment â¬300. There has been extra help for people on benefits. Public transport tickets are being subsidised. Germany is trying tocut energy consumption,externalby: Heating public buildings to a maximum of 19C, with exceptions for places like hospitals Turning off hot water for washing hands in public buildings Lighting limits for buildings, monuments and advertising A windfall tax on energy companies will be applied from December 2022 to the end of June 2023. In January, the government forced the state-owned energy provider, ÃlectricitÃ© de France (EDF), to cap price rises at 4% for a year. It says it will cap rises in gas and electricity at 15% for 2023, as part of a â¬45bn (Â£39bn) scheme to support households and businesses. France had already announced a one-off â¬100 (Â£84) payment last year to 5.8 million households receiving energy vouchers. The government plans to reduce energy consumption by 10% by: Capping indoor temperatures at 19C for public buildings Cutting the temperature of public sports facilities by 2C and in public swimming pools by 1C Paying civil servants an extra â¬2.88 per day to work from home, if this allows government buildings to close Speed limits on ski lifts and producing less artificial snow The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies in the 2023 budget. France is cutting the temperature in public swimming polls by 1C Italy is expecting to spend about â¬49.5bn (Â£42bn). Its measures include a â¬200 (Â£169) one-off payment to people earning â¬35,000 (Â£29,600) a year or less, and a 20% tax credit for all energy-intensive companies experiencing a 30% rise in prices. The Italian government is also trying to reduce gas consumption by: Asking people to turn central heating down by 1C and turn it off for an extra hour every day Limiting heating in public buildings, with exceptions for hospitals, nurseries and some industries The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies in 2023. Since November, electricity and gas prices for households have been capped at January 2022 levels - up to a certain amount of consumption. Any extra use will be charged at market rates. The government is also offering a discount of â¬190 on energy bills in November and December to all households. There is a one-off energy allowance of â¬1,300 to those on lower incomes. VAT on energy bills and tax on petrol and diesel have also been cut. The Dutch government is also introducing: a higher minimum wage lower income tax higher benefits and allowances (such as child benefit, student grants and tax credits) It is expecting to spend â¬15.5bn (Â£13.5bn) on these measures. The Dutch government isadvising households and business,externalto cut consumption, including by turning down heating by 1C. The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies. Spain has cut VAT on energy bills and reduced tax on electricity. Spain and Portugal have introduced a price cap for gas - which will last for one year and aims to halve gas bills for 40% of customers in the two countries. There is also a one-off payment of â¬200 euros for people in Spain who earn less than â¬14,000 a year and are not already receiving benefits. Spain's measures are expected to cost about â¬27bn (Â£23bn). The government has an energy-saving plan which includes limiting air conditioning in public buildings and shops in the summer and keeping heating to 19C in the winter. It wants shops to close their doors when the heating is on and says they should switch off lights after 22:00. The government is introducing a windfall tax on energy companies and banks over the next two years. It has announced plans for an energy price support package for households, worth 26.8bn zlotys (Â£4.8bn). It incudes freezing energy prices for 2023 at this year's level, with a limit of 2,000 kWh per year for most households. There will be higher thresholds for households with people with disabilities and for families with three or more children. The government has abolished VAT on food, gas and fertilizer and reduced it on petrol, diesel and energy bills. There is also a new mandatory 10% electricity saving for national and local government public administrations. Households that reduce electricity use by 10% in 2023 compared with 2022, will be rewarded with an additional discount. Norway has set a maximum price that households should pay for their energy - anything over this, the government will pay 80% of the bill. A new package of loans and subsidies for businesses was announced in September. This will cover companies that spend more than 3% of revenue on power costs. The government has also proposed new taxes on onshore wind and hydropower energy, to redistribute some of the huge increase in profits over the past year. The UK government has brought in a cap on the price of a unit of energy until April 2023, which will mean the typical household bill for gas and electricity will be Â£2,500 a year. This is being extended to April 2024, but typical bills will be capped at Â£3,000 a year. There will be more support for those on benefits and for pensions households. How does the energy price cap work? What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies? Energy advice: Sunak to expand tips campaign to lower bills The government brought in a windfall tax on UK oil and gas firms' profits which is expected to raise Â£5bn a year. This is being increased and extended. Previously, the government introduced anenergy bill discount of Â£400for every household with some extra support for people on benefits. The UK government launched a public information campaign on how to save energy in November, which was later than other countries in Europe.

"Governments borrow to fund ""day-to-day"" spending, as well as long-term infrastructure projects like the Elizabeth Line The UK government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest. The government gets most of its income from taxes. For example, workers payincome tax and national insurance, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on profits. It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and that sometimes happens. But, if it can't, the government covers the gap by raising taxes, cutting spending or borrowing. Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax. So, governments often decide to borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects, like new railways and roads. How the government raises and spends Â£1 trillion a year The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds. A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments. UK government bonds - known as ""gilts"" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. The government sells short and long-term gilts to let it borrow money over different time periods, with varying interest rates. The amount the government borrows fluctuates from month to month. For instance, it tends to borrow less in January, when many people pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go. So, it is more helpful to look across a whole year, or the year-to-date. In the last full financial year, to March 2024, the government borrowed Â£125.1bn. The most recent monthly figures show thegovernment borrowed Â£11.2bn in November 2024,which was Â£3.4bn lower than in the same month the previous year, and the lowest November figure since 2021. Borrowing since March stands at Â£113.2bn, which is the third highest financial year-to-November borrowing total since monthly records began in 1993. The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about Â£2.8 trillion - or Â£2,800,000,000,000. That is roughly the same asthe value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP. The current level is more than double that seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008. The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up. But, in relation to the size of the economy, UK debt figures are still low compared with much of the last century. They are also less than the equivalent figures for some other leading economies. The larger the national debt, the more interest the government pays. That cost was not as great when interest rates were low during the 2010s, but became more noticeable after the Bank of England started raising interest rates in 2021. The amount of interest the government pays on national debt also varies from month to month. It was Â£3bn in November 2024, the lowest November figure for five years. However, interest rates for long-term borrowing have risen to theirhighest levels this century., with the government paying 5.25% on 30-year gilts. If the government has to set aside more cash for paying debts, it may mean it has less to spend on public services. Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost. Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax in the long run. The increase in long-term interest rates seen in January prompted some economists to warn that the government is ""on course"" to miss its own borrowing targets. Labour decided to stick to a rule followed by the previous government that the total amount of money owed must have fallen as a proportion of the UK economy in five years' time. In October's Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeveschanged the definition of debt that the government would use in the target to enable her to raise more money for investment. It will now track a different, broader measure of debt called public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL). This includes, for example, the money the government gets from people repaying their student loans. Downing Street said there was ""no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability"", and that ""meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable"". The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR)- which monitors the government's financial performance - will present its latest economic forecast to Parliament in late March. It has previously warned that public debt could soar as the population ages and tax income falls. In an ageing population, the proportion of people of working age drops, meaning the government takes less in tax while paying out more in pensions. Budget 2024: Key points at a glance Rachel Reevesâ tax-raising Budget will affect you for years Debtis the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. Thedeficitis the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends. When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus.

"New York state is ending a 28-month-old Covid mandate requiring masks on public transport, Governor Kathy Hochul says. Masks will also no longer be required in airports and ride-share vehicles, she added. The state introduced the mandate in April 2020 as the virus was spreading throughout New York City. But now wearing masks will be optional, the governor said, citing recent guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""We have to restore some normalcy to our lives,"" Ms Hochul said. ""Masks are encouraged but optional."" She added that New York is in a far stronger position as infections and hospitalisations fall. ""It's always been a visible reminder that something is not normal here, and it was there for the right reason. It protected health and now we're in a far different place."" Mask requirements are also being lifted for homeless shelters and prisons, the governor said. However, masks are still required in nursing homes, hospitals and other health-care facilities licensed by the state. In April, President Joe Biden decided to stop enforcing a nationwide mask mandate on public transport after a federal judge in Florida ruled the directive was unlawful, but New York decided to continue with the rule. Many New Yorkers then started ignoring the mandate despite widespread compliance early in the pandemic. US judge throws out Biden's traveller mask mandate 'Like 9/11 every day': A New York paramedic's diary from 2020 United States passes one million Covid deaths Janno Lieber, chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, told a news conference that it had become ""more and more difficult to justify and to enforce a mask requirement as so much of the city and so many other places were opening up"". At one point New York was the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic in the US. There have been more than 6 million cases in New York state and 71,222 people have lost their lives to the virus,according to data from Johns Hopkins University.,external Around 78% of the state's population have been fully vaccinated. By Natalie Sherman, BBC News, New York Whatever the health rationale of her decision, Kathy Hochul's move to end the mask mandate was not surprising given the facts on the ground. Compliance with the rule has been spotty, to put it kindly, for months. Renegades used to receive dirty looks or be given wide berths. But this week - as commuters facing renewed return-to-office calls crammed into subway cars - perhaps half of riders were masked, with people making little differentiation between masked and unmasked. In fact, for some, the biggest surprise of Wednesday's announcement may have been  that the mandate was still in place, when so many others have long since lapsed. Whether people will return to masking voluntarily as winter sets in remains to be seen. But for now, the decision simply formalises a regime that has already been largely in place.

"Prime Minister Liz Truss has appointed her new cabinet, hours after taking over at 10 Downing Street. For the first time none of the ""great offices of state"" is held by a white man, with Suella Braverman as home secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor and James Cleverly as foreign secretary. Here is a guide to the new faces and role changes. Liz Truss became prime minister on 6 September 2022, replacing Boris Johnson who was in post for slightly more than three years. She was not the first choice of Conservative MPs - but she was the clear winner in a ballot of Tory members, who had the final say. Truss has been a government minister since 2012, and held cabinet posts under David Cameron, Theresa May and Johnson, most recently as foreign secretary. A Remain supporter at the 2016 EU referendum, who began her political journey at Oxford University as a Liberal Democrat, she is now an enthusiastic Brexiteer who has vowed to get back to traditional tax-cutting Tory values. Truss, who has two children, was elected to Parliament as MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 after serving as deputy director of think tank Reform. ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey has been appointed health secretary, taking over from Stephen Barclay who had only been in the role for two months, and will also be deputy prime minister. The former work and pensions secretary is a long-time friend of Liz Truss and was closely involved in her leadership campaign. Coffey, who was elected MP for Suffolk Coastal in 2010, previously served in a number of roles including environment minister, Commons deputy leader and assistant whip. A devout Roman Catholic, she was asked about her views on abortion after the recent US Supreme Court ruling and said the law was not going to change in the UK - although she added she would prefer people not to have abortions. The former Mars and BBC employee is a member of the Campaign for Real Ale with a love of karaoke, and lists her interests as watching football, gardening and music. Kwasi Kwarteng was chancellor for 38 days before being asked by the prime minister to stand aside after a turbulent few weeks for the UK economy. The former business secretary is a close friend and ally of Liz Truss, and backed her successful leadership campaign. But his ""mini-budget"" pledging Â£45bn of tax cuts, funded by borrowing, was followed by market turbulence and an intervention from the Bank of England. His departure means he is the second shortest-serving UK chancellor since the Second World War. Kwarteng, who got a scholarship to Eton and studied at Cambridge, worked in finance before his time in politics, and has written a book about the legacy of the British Empire. James Cleverly is the new foreign secretary, taking over Liz Trussâs former department. It wonât be a totally new department for him - heâs been a foreign minister before, for the Middle East and North Africa, and later for Europe and North America. He most recently served as education secretary under Boris Johnson. Cleverly was in the Territorial Army and went to Sandhurst and, outside of work, enjoys painting model soldiers and hanging out with his border terriers. Heâll have a busy brief ahead as foreign secretary with the ongoing war in Ukraine and the UK governmentâs current plans to override parts of the Northern Ireland protocol â part of the Brexit deal agreed with the EU. Suella Braverman has nabbed one of the âgreat offices of stateâ as home secretary, tasked with things like the plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. Sheâs a barrister who was previously the attorney general and ran to be the leader herself in the Tory leadership contest. Her parents emigrated to the UK in the 1960s from Kenya and Mauritius, and both spent time in local politics â with her mother being a councillor for 16 years. She has two children, studied law at Cambridge, and loves sushi. Braverman was the first cabinet minister to take maternity leave â after the law was changed so that cabinet ministers could receive paid maternity leave, having previously been expected to resign their posts. Ben Wallace remains the defence secretary, a post he's held since July 2019. While almost all the other posts have seen a big mix-up, this continuity was anticipated given he's been leading the response to the war in Ukraine. He's popular with Tory members - and was once considered a favourite to replace Boris Johnson - but chose not to stand in the leadership contest. While some of the characters in Truss's new cabinet are more divisive in the Tory party, Wallace is pretty widely respected across the parliamentary party with many colleagues seeing him as a safe pair of hands. During his eight-year spell in the Army, he served in Germany, Cyprus, Belize and Northern Ireland - where he helped thwart an IRA bomb attack. Nadhim Zahawi has been a fast riser in the party - gaining support and public recognition in his role as vaccines minister during the pandemic. As chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster he'll be responsible for running the Cabinet Office, the department that supports the prime minister and basically helps departments work together better on issues that involve more than one. He'll also be the equalities minister. Zahawi was previously chancellor of the exchequer but for only two months - having been promoted when Rishi Sunak resigned - and pretty swiftly afterwards said Boris Johnson should resign. He's a former child refugee who fled Iraq with his parents in the 1970s and co-founded the market research firm YouGov. He is now believed to be one of the richest politicians in the Commons. Simon Clarke has been promoted to the full cabinet as levelling up, housing and communities secretary, taking over from Greg Clark, who replaced Michael Gove in July. He was previously chief secretary to the Treasury but chose to support Liz Truss for the leadership rather than his former boss Rishi Sunak. The MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland was previously a minister in the housing, communities and local government department and describes himself as a lifelong Boro fan. Clarke, who has agoraphobia, is a qualified solicitor who worked as a policy specialist on health and education before being elected in 2017. Jacob Rees-Mogg has been given the role of business (and energy) secretary and his appointment certainly signals the potential direction of travel for this government. One of the Conservative Party's highest profile Brexiteers - previously in cabinet as Brexit opportunities and government efficiency minister - he's very pro-deregulation of business and wants to remove a host of rules and regulations post-Brexit. He's also been a critic in the past of what he's called âclimate alarmismâ and has been very pro-fracking. One of the first MPs to back Liz Truss for the leadership, Rees-Mogg set up his own investment management company in 2007, is a father-of-six, and describes himself as an avid cricket fan. Kemi Badenoch has entered the cabinet as international trade secretary after surprising many by reaching the last four in the leadership contest. The former minister in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and equalities minister, who did not endorse any of her rivals in the leadership race, replaces Anne-Marie Trevelyan. Badenoch, who has been outspoken on issues such as gender-neutral toilets which she opposes, stood on an ""anti-woke"" platform and argued for the state to be slimmed down. The former software engineer worked in banking and later as a director of the Spectator magazine before being elected to the London Assembly. She became MP for Saffron Walden in Essex in 2017, and lists her interests as including engineering and technology, social mobility and integration. Chloe Smith replaces new Health Secretary ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey as work and pensions secretary. She had been a minister in the department since September 2021 and was an early supporter of Liz Trussâs leadership bid. In June 2021 the mother-of-two announced she had been given the all clear from breast cancer after her diagnosis the previous November and says she is now back to full health and full of energy. A keen cyclist, Smith highlights her interest in transport and her work to help reduce youth unemployment in her constituency of Norwich North. Before entering parliament in 2009 - following a by-election sparked by the resignation of the sitting Labour MP after the expenses scandal - she worked for accountancy and professional service firm Deloitte. Alok Sharma will stay on as president for COP26, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, working in the Cabinet Office. This is pretty expected - as the role will expire soon. But what will be interesting to watch is how he leaves when it does. He's previously warned he would ""quit"" if the new prime minister scraps any of the UK's commitments to net zero. The new Business and Energy Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg has previously expressed scepticism at the need to fight climate change, so this new working relationship will be one to watch. Brandon Lewis is in the cabinet for a third time, this time in the role of justice secretary, replacing Dominic Raab. The former Northern Ireland secretary, who resigned in July, initially backed Nadhim Zahawi for the leadership but endorsed Liz Truss at the start of August. He had previously been party chairman and minister without portfolio in Theresa Mayâs cabinet and served as a minister in several departments under May, David Cameron, Boris Johnson. A qualified barrister and former company director, Lewis was a borough councillor in Brentwood for 10 years - five as leader - before entering parliament. The father-of-two, who became Great Yarmouth MP in 2010, took up triathlon the year after he was elected and has completed two London Marathons. Kit Malthouse replaces new Foreign Secretary James Cleverly as education secretary. The former chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, responsible for running the Cabinet Office, did not say who he was supporting in the leadership race. He came to the fore in the Brexit debate, when his name was put to a so-called compromise plan to replace Theresa May's proposed Northern Ireland backstop with ""alternative arrangements"". Malthouse was a deputy mayor of London from 2008, serving under Boris Johnson, and became MP for North West Hampshire in 2015. A chartered accountant who has run a number of small businesses, the father-of-three lists his interests as including gardening, reading and watching modern dance. Ranil Jayawardena has become environment secretary, taking over from George Eustice. He was previously a minister in the international trade department, working for Liz Truss before she became foreign secretary, and was an early supporter of her leadership bid. Jayawardena, who has three children, used to work for Lloyds Bank and was also a councillor in Hampshire. He entered the Commons as MP for North East Hampshire in 2015. Anne-Marie Trevelyan has become transport secretary, replacing Grant Shapps. She had previously been international trade secretary, replacing Liz Truss in the role in 2021, and before that had been international development secretary but lost her place in the cabinet when the department was scrapped. An outspoken Brexiteer who resigned from a previous junior ministerial role in 2018 in protest at Theresa Mayâs Brexit withdrawal deal, she supported Truss in the leadership race. The former chartered accountant entered the Commons as MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed in 2015 and describes herself as having a passion for singing. Chris Heaton-Harris has been promoted to the cabinet as Northern Ireland secretary, replacing Shailesh Vara who only took on the role in July. The former chief whipâs new position was one that initially proved hard to fill, and certainly is regarded by some as a bit of a poisoned chalice right now - the nation is currently without a functioning devolved government. One of his key priorities will be resolving tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol - part of the Brexit deal that Liz Truss wants to override - which the DUP has argued is necessary if it is to re-enter into power sharing in Northern Ireland. The qualified football referee describes himself as a fierce Eurosceptic but may well need to engage with the EU in negotiations about this. Before becoming a politician, Heaton-Harris ran his family's wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New Covent Garden Market. Alister Jack remains secretary of state for Scotland in Liz Trussâs first cabinet, a role he has held since Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019. The former government whip did not reveal who he supported in the leadership contest. Before entering parliament as MP for Dumfries and Galloway in 2017, Jack was a businessman who founded tent-hire and self-storage companies. Jack, who has three grown up children, is also a dairy farmer and grows Christmas trees. Robert Buckland remains secretary of state for Wales, continuing in the role he took on after Simon Hartâs resignation in July. The former barrister had previously been in the cabinet, as justice secretary, between July 2019 and September 2021 and is also a former solicitor general. He previously backed Rishi Sunak for Tory leader, before switching to Liz Truss, which made him some foes among Sunak's camp who accused him privately of serving his own interests. He is Welsh, born in Llanelli, but represents a seat in South Swindon rather than in Wales - which isn't usual practice and could prove controversial. Buckland has twin children and says his interests include music, wine, political history and watching rugby and cricket. Penny Mordaunt has returned to the cabinet as leader of the House of Commons, responsible for delivery of the governmentâs legislative programme, replacing Mark Spencer. She endorsed Liz Truss after nearly beating her into the final two of the Conservative leadership race. Most recently a trade minister, the naval reservist made history when she became the UK's first female defence secretary in 2019 and had also been in cabinet in 2017 as international development secretary. The former magicianâs assistant is perhaps best known outside Westminster for appearing on ITV's celebrity diving show Splash! Before becoming MP for Portsmouth North in 2010 she was a press officer for Kensington and Chelsea Council and the Freight Transport Association, and a director of the Big Lottery Fund and Diabetes UK. Lord True has been named leader of the House of Lords, responsible for delivery of the governmentâs legislative programme in the Upper House. A former Cabinet Office minister, he replaces Baroness Evans who had held the position since 2016. Before being made a life peer in 2010, True had been leader of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and before that had worked in John Majorâs policy unit when he was prime minister. A fluent Italian speaker, who has previously lived and studied in the country, he lists his interests as including history, gardening and sport. Michelle Donelan has been appointed culture secretary, giving her a second chance to make her mark in cabinet following her resignation two days into the job of education secretary in July. The former higher and further education minister replaces Nadine Dorries, having backed Liz Truss after initially supporting her former boss Nadhim Zahawi and then Penny Mordaunt in the leadership race. Previously a government whip, Donelan worked in the media and entertainment industry before entering parliament, including a period as communications manager at professional wrestling firm WWE. The MP for Chippenham, first elected in 2015, says she enjoys walking her dog in her limited spare time. Jake Berry is the new minister without portfolio and Conservative party chairman, replacing Andrew Stephenson. He will be responsible for trying to gear the party up for the next election - Stephenson's predecessor Oliver Dowden resigned after a bruising set of by-elections for the Conservative party earlier this year. Berry will have to engage with Tory associations around the country (some of which weren't particularly happy at Boris Johnson's ousting), and help unite the party after months of infighting. He was previously Northern Powerhouse minister and has been chairman of the Northern Research Group, representing many of the Tory MPs who won seats in traditional Labour heartlands in 2019. The group, and Berry in particular, have pushed the government repeatedly on what it is doing to âlevel upâ and invest in those kinds of areas, which will likely form a big part of any future election strategy of his. Wendy Morton has been appointed chief whip, responsible for party discipline and ensuring Conservative MPs vote along party lines, and will attend cabinet. The former assistant whip backed Liz Truss at the start of the leadership contest and replaces Chris Heaton-Harris in the role. Morton, who has also been a transport and Foreign Office minister, says her interests include walking, cookery, art deco and ceramics. She was first elected MP for the West Midlands constituency of Aldridge-Brownhills in 2015, having missed out to Trussâs rival Rishi Sunak in a bid to become the party candidate for Richmond in 2014. Chris Philp has been appointed chief secretary to the Treasury, attending cabinet, and takes over from new Levelling Up Secretary Simon Clarke. The former digital minister initially backed Sajid Javid in the leadership race but endorsed Liz Truss in July. Philp, who has also held junior roles in the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, has spoken of how the NHS saved the lives of his twins after they were born very prematurely at 25 weeks. He was elected MP for Croydon South in 2015. Michael Ellis has been appointed attorney general - the chief legal adviser to the government - and can attend cabinet. He replaces new Home Secretary Suella Braverman, having previously filled in for her when she went on maternity leave in 2021. A former Cabinet Office minister and paymaster general, Ellis supported Liz Trussâs rival Rishi Sunak in the Conservative leadership race. Ellis worked as a barrister for 17 years before entering parliament and his legal experience has previously led to him getting the role of solicitor general for England and Wales in 2019. He was elected MP for Northampton North in 2010. Edward Argar will attend cabinet after being named paymaster general and Cabinet Office minister, replacing new Attorney General Michael Ellis. The former health minister, who resigned in July, supported Liz Truss in the leadership race after initially backing ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Before entering parliament he worked in management consultancy and communications at various companies including outsourcing firm Serco and was a city councillor in Westminster. He has been MP for Charnwood since 2015 and lists his interests as including gardening, tennis and watching cricket. Vicky Ford has become development minister at the Foreign Office and will attend cabinet. The former MEP and South Cambridgeshire local councillor was an early supporter of Liz Truss in the leadership race. Before entering politics she worked as managing director of an international bank and was involved in raising money for infrastructure projects in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Ford, who has three children, was elected MP for Chelmsford in 2017 and lists her interests as including cricket, fly fishing, gardening and singing. Tom Tugendhat will attend cabinet as security minister in the Home Office, after reaching the final five in the Conservative leadership race. The former Territorial Army officer, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee since 2017 but this is his first ministerial post. His backing of Liz Truss after being eliminated from the leadership race was surprising to many in the Conservative party - given he's always been considered part of the more âcentristâ One Nation group of Tory MPs. Tugendhat will now sit in a government largely skewed to the right-wing of the party. He was highly critical of the withdrawal from Afghanistan by Western forces in 2021, and of Boris Johnson during his premiership, but now he's in a government role his outspoken interventions are likely to be toned down. James Heappey will continue as minister for the armed forces, and take on the veterans brief, in the Ministry of Defence. He'll now attend cabinet too though - the top table of government ministers. He's a former soldier who spent 10 years in the Army, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq and Northern Ireland, and his profile rose significantly during the UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan and more recently the Ukraine war. He's considered a strong communicator and he, like his boss Ben Wallace who is staying on as defence secretary, does seem to bridge divisions across the Tory party factions. Heappey describes himself as a very keen sportsman who also loves to cook. Graham Stuart has become climate minister in the business department and will also attend cabinet. The former Foreign Office and international trade minister, who has also been a government whip, supported Liz Truss in the leadership race. He describes himself as a keen cyclist and says his interests include football, economics, motorcycling and punk rock. Stuart, who set up a publishing business after leaving university, was first elected MP for the East Yorkshire constituency of Beverley and Holderness in 2005. Newcomers includes ministers who did not attend the most recent cabinet. Click hereif you cannot see the Cabinet Guide There was quite a big turnover in Ms Truss's reshuffle, with several high-profile members of the previous cabinet leaving. The replacements include 13 new members who have taken up cabinet roles for the first time. After all the comings and goings, there are now two more women serving in the cabinet than there were under Boris Johnson, taking the total to nine. That makes up 30% overall, which is the same as the first cabinets under Gordon Brown and Theresa May. As for the education of those assembled by Ms Truss, 68% of them went to private schools, up slightly when compared with Mr Johnson's 2019 cabinet and up greatly when compared with Theresa May's in 2016. At 35%, Ms Truss's new cabinet has the lowest proportion of members who were educated at Oxford or Cambridge since Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1997.

"Celia Marsh, who had a severe dairy allergy, died in 2017 after eating a super-veg rainbow flatbread Pret a Manger failed to conduct checks on manufacturers supplying dairy-free products, an inquest has heard. Celia Marsh suffered a fatal allergic reaction in December 2017 after eating a super-veg rainbow flatbread. The 42-year-old, from Wiltshire, had a severe dairy allergy and collapsed after eating the sandwich bought from the chain's store in Bath, Somerset. A trading standards officer said they did not have any evidence of Pret verifying the dairy-free claim. The wrap had contained yoghurt which was supposed to be vegan but was later found to contain traces of dairy protein. The yoghurt was produced by Planet Coconut, which is the UK manufacturer and distributor of products developed by Australia-based yoghurt company CoYo. Ms Marsh's family and her husband (centre) have been attending the inquest Kirsty Langford, a trading standards officer for Bath and North East Somerset Council, told the inquest Pret a Manger had not apparently conducted its own audit of the claims made by Planet Coconut. ""When a dairy-free claim is made on a product you expect some sort of testing to be taking place,"" she said. ""That may not itself be the responsibility of Pret A Manger but it would probably be Pret's responsibility to ensure their supplier was undertaking some sort of testing."" Ms Langford continued: ""When we went back to Planet Coconut we weren't supplied with any test certificate and we weren't sure that Pret had been supplied with any either - we haven't been supplied with any evidence of that. ""That becomes more important when there is a dairy-free claim on the product, that is when you would expect finished product testing to make sure that 'free-from' claim can be verified."" Ms Marsh's husband said his wife ""religiously"" avoided dairy Ms Langford said that ordinarily, a free-from claim on a product would be supported by a risk assessment by the retailer checking all the processes and ingredients in the supply chain. She recounted that Planet Coconut had said it was testing its product for allergens every year and added how often a product should be tested was not enshrined in law. ""With a small supplier like Planet Coconut it would be less often than a bigger (company),"" Ms Langford said. ""I would expect Pret to check that testing was being undertaken through their supplier - there were supplier audits being undertaken (by Pret) but I don't think the audit picked up on the testing of the product."" An investigation revealed the yoghurt contained 'HG1' starch, supplied by Tate and Lyle PLC, that was identified as the possible source of the contamination. The court was told Tate & Lyle had never said the HG1 starch was suitable for a dairy-free claim and alleges it had passed on the information concerning the risk of contamination to Planet Coconut. The court heard that the trace of milk in the flatbread was so small that it would only be expected to have an effect on around 5% of people with the most acute dairy allergy. Mrs Marsh's husband, Andy, said his wife had ""religiously"" avoided dairy after suffering a near-fatal incident a few months previously in which she needed 15 shots of adrenalin. Pret was charged with food safety failures in the wake of Mrs Marsh's death, but the prosecution was later dropped due to lack of evidence. All Pret sandwiches are displayed with a warning stating they are made onsite in a busy kitchen, and that the company cannot guarantee they are suitable for people with allergies.

"Left to right: Olivia Wilde, Chris Pine, Harry Styles and Gemma Chan at the Don't Worry Darling premiere in Venice on Sunday Harry Styles has joked on stage that he ""went to Venice to spit on Chris Pine"", while resuming his US tour at New York's Madison Square Garden. Social media was ablaze on Tuesday after a journalist suggested Styles appeared to spit as he was sitting down next to Pine at the premiere of their new film Don't Worry Darling in Venice. A source close to the English singer-turned-actor had earlier denied it. US actor Pine's representative branded the claim as ""a ridiculous story."" Returning from the film festival, Styles laughed as he told fans on Wednesday evening: ""I just popped very quickly to Venice to spit on Chris Pine... but fret not, we're back."" His words prompted laughter and screams from fans. Videos and online speculation suggested when Styles sat down for Sunday's out-of-competition premiere, he appeared to spit on his co-star, who was seated between him and the film's director Olivia Wilde. Pine stopped clapping and looked down at his lap before smiling. The Star Trek and Wonder Woman actor's spokesperson added earlier this week that it was ""a complete fabrication and the result of an odd online illusion that is clearly deceiving and allows for foolish speculation"". They said: ""There is nothing but respect between these two men and any suggestion otherwise is a blatant attempt to create drama that simply does not exist."" Critics mixed on Harry Styles' latest film It is the latest in a string of controversies surrounding the film. Florence Pugh, who plays Styles' on-screen partner, walked the red carpet at the premiere but was notably absent from the press conference. When asked about reports of a rift by a journalist, Wilde, who is Styles' partner in real life, said she would not contribute to the ""endless tabloid gossip and all the noise out there"", choosing instead to praise Pugh's acting abilities. The English actress posted a belated message on Instagram on Wednesday, alongside a picture of her and co-stars on the Venice red carpet, writing: ""I'm still taking it all in!""

She offered ""a massive congratulations to everyone standing on that carpet"", adding: ""We premiered in Venice! A huge wonderful win in itself. ""I'd never been to Venice Film Festival before.. It was mega! The crowds! The cheers! The energy was incredible."" Don't Worry Darling, set in the 1950s, stars UK actors Harry Styles and Florence Pugh Styles' part opposite Pugh was originally meant to have been played by Shia LaBeouf, who Wilderecently said she had firedbecause his ""process was not conducive to the ethos that I demand in my productions"". But the US actor denied that,,externaltelling Variety he had ""quit the film due to lack of rehearsal time"". LaBeouf stoked the flames of controversy further by sharing a video that Wilde allegedly sent him in 2020, asking him to return to the production, and asking if he and Pugh could ""make peace"". But when a journalist at the same Venice press conference tried to probe further into the topic, it was swiftly shut down by the moderator. Billboard Pop alsoshared a video,externalof Pine apparently zoning out when Styles talked about the film. Don't Worry Darling, which hits UK cinemas later this month, has receivedmixed reviews from critics,with the Guardian calling it an ""unconvincing tale of dystopian suburbia"", while the Telegraph descried it as ""largely fantastic: the sort of juicy but accessible studio production that have all but vanished since the 1990s"".

"Michelle Donelan will be responsible for broadcasting, arts, online and sports policy New UK Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan has eye-catching experience in the worlds of media, sport and entertainment, after a previous job with US wrestling franchise WWE. Now, she is gearing up for political combat over issues ranging from online regulation to the futures of Channel 4 and the BBC. After going to state school in Cheshire and becoming the first in her family to go to university - studying history and politics at York - Ms Donelan began a media career as marketing assistant on Marie Claire and That's Life magazines. That was followed by marketing-executive jobs at the History Channel and World Wrestling Entertainment, and a spell as a marketing freelancer. She moved into politics in 2015, becoming the MP for Chippenham, Wiltshire, before being appointed as a government whip and a minister in the Department for Education. While there, she was known for speaking her mind. As universities minister,she talked about students being ""conned"",externalinto debt by taking degrees that might not be worthwhile. And she often picked up the phone to vice-chancellors to express her forthright views. Michelle Donelan has been Conservative MP for Chippenham since 2015 As Higher and Further Education Minister, Ms Donelan steered the Higher Education Freedom of Speech Bill, which will require universities and student unions to protect freedom of speech. The bill would stop ""intolerant woke bullies"" on campuses,she said,external, making it harder to no-platform speakers or dismiss academics who put forward controversial or unpopular views.BBC Radio 4's Evan Davis highlighted,externalthis would also allow Holocaust deniers to speak. Ms Donelan was promoted to Education Secretary this July but resigned after just two days as part of the mass ministerial walkout leading to then Prime Minister Boris Johnson's resignation. In her new remit, as the11th culture secretary in 10 years, culture wars are raging too, over what is acceptable to say or broadcast. Ms Donelan is unlikely to be shy about speaking up against those who she says want to ""silence their opponents"" and make others conform ""to an increasingly narrow ideology"". In April,the 38-year-old wrote despairingly,external: ""We now see trigger warnings slapped on Harry Potter. We see George Orwell's 1984 branded 'offensive and upsetting' for students to read."" She has also posted,externalabout the ""cultural vandalism"" of award-winning books being ""quietly scrubbed"" from university reading lists because of their challenging content, andobjected to,externalpoets Philip Larkin and Wilfred Owen's removal from a GCSE syllabus in an attempt to make it more diverse. Elsewhere, the futures of Channel 4 and the BBC will be near the top of her in-tray. Ms Donelan's predecessor, Nadine Dorries, was planning to privatise Channel 4, in the face of opposition from the broadcaster itself and much of the media industry. John McVay, chief executive of Pact, a trade body representing independent TV production companies, has asked the new culture secretary to reconsider. ""It was nonsensical enough 18 months ago, now it just seems to be even more nonsensical,"" he said, referring to a predicted economic downturn. The government is also conducting out a mid-term review of the BBC's royal charter, which sets out the framework for the corporation's existence, amid a debate about the future of the licence fee and what might replace it. Nadine Dorries was culture secretary for just over a year Ms Dorries said the fee would not continue when the current BBC charter expired, at the end of 2027. New cabinet: Who is in Liz Truss's top team? In 2019, Ms Donelansaid the ""unfair tax... should be scrapped altogether"",external. She started a petition on her website, opposing the end of free television licences for most over-75s, andwrote to then director general Lord Hall,externalhighlighting: the ""staggering"" number of BBC managers paid more than Â£100,000 a Â£1.7m annual payment for ""one prominent presenter"" making ""just one appearance a week"" - Gary Lineker, who has since taken a pay cut - could pay for 11,000 over-75s Then there is the ""digital"" part of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) brief. Ms Dorries was passionate about the Online Safety Bill, a proposed law seeking to set rules about how internet providers clamp down on harmful content on their sites. In her resignation letter, the outgoing culture secretary wrote she was proud the bill ""will hold tech giants to account and protect the lives of millions of children and young people"". But it is on pause and the Liz Truss government must decide whether to put it back on track. Some critics say it will bring in censorship by the backdoor, because those technology giants will be given too much power to police content, and they could be especially cautious in doing so if big fines or jail are the possible punishments. Sport is a big part of the job, too, with perennial questions about football and rugby club ownership and rescues for those in trouble. Ms Dorries announced plans for an independent football regulator to ensure ""no more Macclesfields, no more Derbys, no more Chelseas"", referring to clubs' financial problems. On the culture side, museums, theatres and other institutions around the country are struggling. Visitor numbers have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, soaring energy bills and inflation, coupled with audience members tightening their purses, are tipping many into financial difficulties. Museums and libraries are being touted as possible ""warm banks"" to act as refuges for people this winter. Some say they might struggle to keep the heating on themselves. But will the new culture secretary and government have the appetite or spare funds for the further bailout of the sector, after the vital rescue packages during Covid? Beyond the policies, what do we know about Ms Donelan's own cultural interests? Not a lot, yet. However, she did post, in June, she was a fan of TV soap opera Neighbours - sadly, though, she was not in her new post in time to persuade Channel 5 to save it. Allow Twitter content?

"Celia Marsh, who had a severe dairy allergy, died in 2017 after eating a super-veg rainbow flatbread Pret a Manger failed to conduct checks on manufacturers supplying dairy-free products, an inquest has heard. Celia Marsh suffered a fatal allergic reaction in December 2017 after eating a super-veg rainbow flatbread. The 42-year-old, from Wiltshire, had a severe dairy allergy and collapsed after eating the sandwich bought from the chain's store in Bath, Somerset. A trading standards officer said they did not have any evidence of Pret verifying the dairy-free claim. The wrap had contained yoghurt which was supposed to be vegan but was later found to contain traces of dairy protein. The yoghurt was produced by Planet Coconut, which is the UK manufacturer and distributor of products developed by Australia-based yoghurt company CoYo. Ms Marsh's family and her husband (centre) have been attending the inquest Kirsty Langford, a trading standards officer for Bath and North East Somerset Council, told the inquest Pret a Manger had not apparently conducted its own audit of the claims made by Planet Coconut. ""When a dairy-free claim is made on a product you expect some sort of testing to be taking place,"" she said. ""That may not itself be the responsibility of Pret A Manger but it would probably be Pret's responsibility to ensure their supplier was undertaking some sort of testing."" Ms Langford continued: ""When we went back to Planet Coconut we weren't supplied with any test certificate and we weren't sure that Pret had been supplied with any either - we haven't been supplied with any evidence of that. ""That becomes more important when there is a dairy-free claim on the product, that is when you would expect finished product testing to make sure that 'free-from' claim can be verified."" Ms Marsh's husband said his wife ""religiously"" avoided dairy Ms Langford said that ordinarily, a free-from claim on a product would be supported by a risk assessment by the retailer checking all the processes and ingredients in the supply chain. She recounted that Planet Coconut had said it was testing its product for allergens every year and added how often a product should be tested was not enshrined in law. ""With a small supplier like Planet Coconut it would be less often than a bigger (company),"" Ms Langford said. ""I would expect Pret to check that testing was being undertaken through their supplier - there were supplier audits being undertaken (by Pret) but I don't think the audit picked up on the testing of the product."" An investigation revealed the yoghurt contained 'HG1' starch, supplied by Tate and Lyle PLC, that was identified as the possible source of the contamination. The court was told Tate & Lyle had never said the HG1 starch was suitable for a dairy-free claim and alleges it had passed on the information concerning the risk of contamination to Planet Coconut. The court heard that the trace of milk in the flatbread was so small that it would only be expected to have an effect on around 5% of people with the most acute dairy allergy. Mrs Marsh's husband, Andy, said his wife had ""religiously"" avoided dairy after suffering a near-fatal incident a few months previously in which she needed 15 shots of adrenalin. Pret was charged with food safety failures in the wake of Mrs Marsh's death, but the prosecution was later dropped due to lack of evidence. All Pret sandwiches are displayed with a warning stating they are made onsite in a busy kitchen, and that the company cannot guarantee they are suitable for people with allergies.

You don't want to give space away against Ajax. I think we gave less away in the second half because we played a little more defensively.

"Ursula von der Leyen said as well as price cap there should be a mandatory target to cut peak electricity use The European Union's executive body has proposed capping the price of Russian gas, within hours of Russia's leader condemning the idea as stupidity. Energy prices have soared in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, forcing the EU's 27 states into action. ""We must cut Russia's revenues which Putin uses to finance this atrocious war,"" said European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. But Mr Putin said Moscow would react to a cap by halting supplies completely. ""We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil - we will not supply anything,"" he said, if it went against Russia's interests. European leaders have accused Moscow of ""weaponising"" its gas exports in response to Western sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses. While the Kremlin denies that is the case, the big Nord Stream 1 pipeline into northern Germany has been shut indefinitely, with Moscow directly blaming sanctions. Last week, the G7 group of nations - announced a price cap for Russian oil - a move it said would reduce both Moscow's revenue for its Ukraine invasion, and inflation in the West. Finnish researchersrecently estimated that Russia has made â¬158bn (Â£136bn),externalfrom surging fossil fuel prices during the six-month invasion - with EU imports accounting for more than half of that. G7 agrees to impose price cap on Russian oil Speaking to an economics forum in the far eastern city of Vladivostok on Wednesday, Russia's leader condemned sanctions as economic aggression, and a ""fever"" posing a threat to the entire world. The quality of life for Europeans was being sacrificed while poorer countries were losing access to food, he argued: ""Now we are seeing how production and jobs in Europe are closing one after another."" Although he acknowledged inflation in Russia was rising, he minimised the effect that sanctions were having on Russian companies: ""I am sure that we have not lost anything and we will not lose anything."" Russian companies have struggled to source much-needed imported parts. But Mr Putin asserted that confidence in the dollar, euro and pound was being lost before people's eyes - while Russia was emerging from the war with its sovereignty strengthened. The Russian leader said Western currencies were falling while Russia was not losing anything Russia launched its invasion on 24 February and now occupies around a fifth of Ukrainian territory. Six months on, it has been pushed back from areas around Kyiv and the north and now faces a Ukrainian counter-offensive in the south and east. Western nations responded to the war with several rounds of sanctions. The European Union has attempted to cut its reliance on Russian gas and oil and Moscow - and on Friday EU energy ministers will try to decide how to protect consumers and businesses from the threat of enormous bills over the winter. Ahead of the meeting, Ursula von der Leyen said Europe had weakened Russia's grip on its gas requirements. Gas storage was already up to 82% and supplies had increased from the US, Norway, Algeria and other countries. Before the invasion, Russia accounted for 40% of the EU's imported gas, but today that proportion was now down to only 9%, she said. As well as a price cap on Russian gas, EU ministers have been looking at how to separate the cost of gas from the price of electricity, which are linked in Europe's market. The Commission president outlined several other plans: A mandatory target for reducing electricity use at peak hours A cap on revenues for companies making unexpected profits from low-cost electricity such as renewable energy A ""solidarity contribution"" from fossil fuel companies Helping struggling energy companies cope with the volatile energy market with ""liquidity"" support The plans will go before energy ministers on Friday, and one diplomat told the BBC he was sceptical: ""Good luck getting that through council complete and intact."" EU toughens visa regime for Russian citizens EU member states have already responded to the crisis with a series of packages to help consumers. At the weekend Sweden and Finland announced liquidity guarantees for power companies, while Germany said it would spend â¬65bn (Â£56.2bn) with help for the vulnerable as well as tax breaks for energy-intensive businesses. In Vladivostok, Mr Putin went on to accuse Europe of cheating the developing world out of Ukrainian grain exports in the wake of a UN-led deal to lift Russia's naval blockade. For months ships were unable to leave Ukraine's three Black Sea ports but shipments resumed last month. Mr Putin told his audience that only two grain ships had since gone to Africa - which is not the case. He said he wanted to discuss revisiting the deal, in remarks rejected by Ukraine as groundless. Other ships have left for Yemen and Sudan while several vessels have gone to ports in Egypt. A UN-chartered ship carrying 23,000 tonnes arrived in Djibouti last week. The grain has now reached Ethiopia in 60 lorries, with the aim of feeding more than one and a half million people in a country blighted by drought and civil war. Under the agreement all cargoes are approved by a joint centre in Turkey.The centre says 2m tonnes have been authorised so far,,externalincluding to Turkey and the Middle East as well as ports in the EU.

"London-based Beavertown has become the latest craft beer brewer to be taken over by a drinks giant. Heineken, which took a Â£40m minority stake in Beavertown in 2018, has now agreed to buy the remaining shares. Beavertown founder Logan Plant will step down as boss and be replaced by Heineken veteran Jochen Van Esch. Other UK craft brands to have been bought out include Camden Town and London Fields breweries. Mr Plant, who is the son of Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, said he began Beavertown in his kitchen 10 years ago, brewing beer in a rice pan. Now the business employs more than 160 people. Beavertown used the money raised from the 2018 share sale to expand the business, which included building a new brewery in Enfield. He said the culture of Beavertown, including its branding and ""drive to brew the very best tasting beers"", will continue. Mr Plant, who was a musician himself before becoming an entrepreneur, told the BBC that the last ten years had been ""immense"". ""People power is what makes Beavertown unique,"" he said, adding that he is not leaving the business, instead ""going back to my roots"", and working with the team on beers and ""innovations"". He said his dad is a ""massive fan"" of the brewery, just as Led Zeppelin is one of his favourite bands, and that he'd had ""a lot of support from family"" with the business venture. Mr Plant said he'd started the brewery because he was ""obsessed"" with beer. His dad ""loves going to the pub"" and he would take him round local pubs in the Midlands when he was 18, and when Mr Plant was a touring musician he would make notes on beers he had tried. His dad supported him in setting up the brewery, which was more about moral support rather than money, he said, adding that he had gained his ""work ethic and determination"" from his parents. Brewery says Brexit has cost it 95% of its exports Mr Van Esch, who has worked for Heineken for 20 years, will become the firm's new managing director, while Mr Plant will have an advisory role. Mr Van Esch said Beavertown ""will not see a huge change because the strategy is right"". ""The brand is in growth, it has a fantastic culture and work ethos and people love the beers. We will support, invest in and grow the company, and I am incredibly excited about the future,"" he said. Mr Plant, pictured left, will step back and be replaced by Mr Van Esch After Heineken took its minority stake, Beavertown almost tripled its sales from Â£12.7m in 2018 to Â£35.2m in the year to 31 March 2020. The firm did this mainly by increasing production capacity, but also through a partnership with Tottenham Hotspur football club, where it opened a microbrewery. The buyout is part of a trend of big drinks firms acquiring craft breweries. In 2015, AB-Inbev, the world's biggest brewing group, bought the London-based Camden Town Brewery in an Â£85m deal, and in 2020 it completed its acquisition of the US-based Craft Brew Alliance. Carlsberg bought the London Fields Brewery in 2017, although it closed the brewery in 2021 and tried to sell the business. Pubs warning: 'My energy bill tripled to Â£35,000' Brewery says Brexit has cost it 95% of its exports UK's 'smallest off-licence' to open in phone box Israel and Hamas reach Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, sources tell BBC UK's Chagos handover on hold to allow Trump to consider the deal Why the small drop in inflation matters to you The new Lockerbie drama provoking fierce criticism from victims' families What happens if TikTok is banned?

"Left to right: Olivia Wilde, Chris Pine, Harry Styles and Gemma Chan at the Don't Worry Darling premiere in Venice on Sunday Harry Styles has joked on stage that he ""went to Venice to spit on Chris Pine"", while resuming his US tour at New York's Madison Square Garden. Social media was ablaze on Tuesday after a journalist suggested Styles appeared to spit as he was sitting down next to Pine at the premiere of their new film Don't Worry Darling in Venice. A source close to the English singer-turned-actor had earlier denied it. US actor Pine's representative branded the claim as ""a ridiculous story."" Returning from the film festival, Styles laughed as he told fans on Wednesday evening: ""I just popped very quickly to Venice to spit on Chris Pine... but fret not, we're back."" His words prompted laughter and screams from fans. Videos and online speculation suggested when Styles sat down for Sunday's out-of-competition premiere, he appeared to spit on his co-star, who was seated between him and the film's director Olivia Wilde. Pine stopped clapping and looked down at his lap before smiling. The Star Trek and Wonder Woman actor's spokesperson added earlier this week that it was ""a complete fabrication and the result of an odd online illusion that is clearly deceiving and allows for foolish speculation"". They said: ""There is nothing but respect between these two men and any suggestion otherwise is a blatant attempt to create drama that simply does not exist."" Critics mixed on Harry Styles' latest film It is the latest in a string of controversies surrounding the film. Florence Pugh, who plays Styles' on-screen partner, walked the red carpet at the premiere but was notably absent from the press conference. When asked about reports of a rift by a journalist, Wilde, who is Styles' partner in real life, said she would not contribute to the ""endless tabloid gossip and all the noise out there"", choosing instead to praise Pugh's acting abilities. The English actress posted a belated message on Instagram on Wednesday, alongside a picture of her and co-stars on the Venice red carpet, writing: ""I'm still taking it all in!""

She offered ""a massive congratulations to everyone standing on that carpet"", adding: ""We premiered in Venice! A huge wonderful win in itself. ""I'd never been to Venice Film Festival before.. It was mega! The crowds! The cheers! The energy was incredible."" Don't Worry Darling, set in the 1950s, stars UK actors Harry Styles and Florence Pugh Styles' part opposite Pugh was originally meant to have been played by Shia LaBeouf, who Wilderecently said she had firedbecause his ""process was not conducive to the ethos that I demand in my productions"". But the US actor denied that,,externaltelling Variety he had ""quit the film due to lack of rehearsal time"". LaBeouf stoked the flames of controversy further by sharing a video that Wilde allegedly sent him in 2020, asking him to return to the production, and asking if he and Pugh could ""make peace"". But when a journalist at the same Venice press conference tried to probe further into the topic, it was swiftly shut down by the moderator. Billboard Pop alsoshared a video,externalof Pine apparently zoning out when Styles talked about the film. Don't Worry Darling, which hits UK cinemas later this month, has receivedmixed reviews from critics,with the Guardian calling it an ""unconvincing tale of dystopian suburbia"", while the Telegraph descried it as ""largely fantastic: the sort of juicy but accessible studio production that have all but vanished since the 1990s"".

Chelsea have sacked manager Thomas Tuchel on the new owners' 100th day in charge after their third defeat of the season. The former Borussia Dortmund and Paris St-Germain boss exits after winning three trophies in 20 months. Owner Todd Boehly has placed Tuchel's coaching staff in temporary charge until a replacement is found. A club statement said the owners believed it was ""the right time"" to bring in a new head coach. 'Chelsea's ruthless reputation for sacking managers continues' The Football News Show: Watch Tuchel sacking reaction on BBC iPlayer BBC Sport understands the decision would have been taken regardless of the1-0 defeat in Chelsea's Champions League opener at Dinamo Zagrebon Tuesday night. It is also understood that Chelsea will make a swift appointment and among the bookmakers' favourites to take over are Brighton manager Graham Potter, former Spurs and PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino, former Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane and current Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers.

""As the new ownership group reaches 100 days since taking over the club, and as it continues its hard work to take the club forward, the new owners believe it is the right time to make this transition,"" a club statement said. ""On behalf of everyone at Chelsea FC, the club would like to place on record its gratitude to Thomas and his staff for all their efforts during their time with the club. Thomas will rightly have a place in Chelsea's history after winning the Champions League, the Super Cup and Club World Cup in his time here."" BBC Sport also understands that Chelsea will now look for a long-term manager who shares their vision for a collaborative culture and focus on development of all players in the squad. New signings - including the deadline day deal forPierre-Emerick Aubameyangfrom Barcelona - were down to collaboration of the board and Tuchel, and it is said he became less involved as time went on. Tuchel was appointed on 26 January 2021, replacing Frank Lampard, and guided the club to their second Champions League title just four months later. He went on to add the Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup later that year.

BBC Sport's Alistair Magowan Sacking Tuchel might come as a surprise to many, but his touchline behaviour has been indicative of a wider malaise at the club under his tutelage. He was tetchy on the pre-season tour in Los Angeles and critical of his players after their United States friendlies. That was repeated after the Dinamo Zagreb defeat where he complained about a lack of intensity from them. In the last 16 Premier League games, from April to the start of this season, Tuchel's win percentage had dropped to 44%. During that same period, Chelsea are eighth in the Premier League form table - behind Brighton, Brentford and Newcastle. Now we are told that he had lost the confidence of his players - which could explain a perceived lack of hunger - and critically, the board. Even though Chelsea have been renowned for their 'hire and fire' approach under former owner Roman Abramovich, the new American ownership, led by Boehly, has been equally decisive. Questions will remain about whether it was a wise move to sack Tuchel after allowing him to take a key part in transfer policy, but sources have said that targets have been a result of a collaborative approach, which Tuchel slowly withdrew from. Buying into that will be key for Tuchel's replacement. Brighton manager Graham Potter has received plaudits for how he works with sporting directors and how he develops players, but there will be many coaches who will want to take over at Stamford Bridge, with the new ownership once again showing they will be aggressive in their pursuit of success. Chelsea had fallen from being top of the Premier League at the start of December 2020 to eighth before Lampard's departure in January 2021 - out of the title race and in danger of missing out on a Champions League spot. Tuchel drew his first match in charge, at home to Wolves, but won his next four, eventually going unbeaten in his first 13 league games - a record for a new Chelsea manager. He secured a fourth-place finish that term, pipping Leicester to the final Champions League place on the final day despite defeat by Aston Villa. Chelsea went on to beat Manchester City in the 2021 Champions League final in Porto as Tuchel repeated the feat of Roberto di Matteo, who led Chelsea to the 2012 Champions League title after taking charge midway through the season.

Despite the ongoing ownership issues, Tuchel managed to guide Chelsea to a third-placed finish in the Premier League last season, as well as the FA Cup and League Cup finals, losing both to Liverpool on penalties.

"London-based Beavertown has become the latest craft beer brewer to be taken over by a drinks giant. Heineken, which took a Â£40m minority stake in Beavertown in 2018, has now agreed to buy the remaining shares. Beavertown founder Logan Plant will step down as boss and be replaced by Heineken veteran Jochen Van Esch. Other UK craft brands to have been bought out include Camden Town and London Fields breweries. Mr Plant, who is the son of Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, said he began Beavertown in his kitchen 10 years ago, brewing beer in a rice pan. Now the business employs more than 160 people. Beavertown used the money raised from the 2018 share sale to expand the business, which included building a new brewery in Enfield. He said the culture of Beavertown, including its branding and ""drive to brew the very best tasting beers"", will continue. Mr Plant, who was a musician himself before becoming an entrepreneur, told the BBC that the last ten years had been ""immense"". ""People power is what makes Beavertown unique,"" he said, adding that he is not leaving the business, instead ""going back to my roots"", and working with the team on beers and ""innovations"". He said his dad is a ""massive fan"" of the brewery, just as Led Zeppelin is one of his favourite bands, and that he'd had ""a lot of support from family"" with the business venture. Mr Plant said he'd started the brewery because he was ""obsessed"" with beer. His dad ""loves going to the pub"" and he would take him round local pubs in the Midlands when he was 18, and when Mr Plant was a touring musician he would make notes on beers he had tried. His dad supported him in setting up the brewery, which was more about moral support rather than money, he said, adding that he had gained his ""work ethic and determination"" from his parents. Brewery says Brexit has cost it 95% of its exports Mr Van Esch, who has worked for Heineken for 20 years, will become the firm's new managing director, while Mr Plant will have an advisory role. Mr Van Esch said Beavertown ""will not see a huge change because the strategy is right"". ""The brand is in growth, it has a fantastic culture and work ethos and people love the beers. We will support, invest in and grow the company, and I am incredibly excited about the future,"" he said. Mr Plant, pictured left, will step back and be replaced by Mr Van Esch After Heineken took its minority stake, Beavertown almost tripled its sales from Â£12.7m in 2018 to Â£35.2m in the year to 31 March 2020. The firm did this mainly by increasing production capacity, but also through a partnership with Tottenham Hotspur football club, where it opened a microbrewery. The buyout is part of a trend of big drinks firms acquiring craft breweries. In 2015, AB-Inbev, the world's biggest brewing group, bought the London-based Camden Town Brewery in an Â£85m deal, and in 2020 it completed its acquisition of the US-based Craft Brew Alliance. Carlsberg bought the London Fields Brewery in 2017, although it closed the brewery in 2021 and tried to sell the business.

"Tens of thousands of businesses are at risk of going under without government support because of soaring energy bills, according to insolvency experts. Red Flag Alert, which monitors the financial health of firms, told the BBC previously profitable companies are experiencing significant losses. Among those that survive, many will be forced to make workers redundant, the consultancy said. Firms are waiting to hear if they will get help with their energy bills. On Thursday the government, led by new Prime Minister Liz Truss,is expected to announce significant financial supportfor households facing an 80% rise in the energy price cap in October. Businesses are not covered by the cap, however, and Red Flag is warning that more than 75,000 larger firms that are high energy users are at risk of insolvency or are likely to lay off staff without government support. The government's plan is expected to include some relief for businesses - but details are not yet known. According to Red Flag, many firms will face a choice between paying wages or paying energy bills. ""Businesses can't absorb these costs and they're going to be forced very quickly into a decision about headcount or being able to pay energy bills,"" said chief economist Nicola Headlam. ""That's going to be the reality and it's coming down the track very quickly."" What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? Liz Truss set to cut energy bills for millions What cost-of-living payments will I get? According to Red Flag Alert, there are 355,000 companies with a turnover higher than Â£1m that are designated as high energy users - industries such as steel, glass, concrete, and paper production. Of those, the company estimates 75,972 are at risk of insolvency, and they estimate 26,720 of them could fail because of energy costs. That is in addition to the 26,000 insolvencies they had already predicted this year. ""That is a colossal number of people whose businesses will fail, without a large-scale support package from the government"", said Ms Headlam. ""That's more than during the pandemic, and more than in any other recession. ""A business turning over a million pounds two years ago would have spent around 8% of that on energy costs and made profits of around Â£90,000. ""If the cost of energy doubles to 16%, that instantly wipes out profitability, and they're straight into a scenario where it threatens the viability of the business within a year."" Beyond the large, energy-intensive companies, smaller companies with turnover under Â£1m, were also at risk of failure, Red Flag Alert said. It highlighted the hospitality sector where firms face a triple threat of increasing energy bills, higher supply and staffing costs, and a fall-off in consumer spending, squeezed by inflation. That is certainly the case for James Greenhalgh, who runs Flamingos Coffee House in Leeds, and a bar in the city too. The combined energy bill for both is due to leap from Â£1,500 to around Â£10,000 from the beginning of October. ""That's more expensive than our wage bill. That's just catastrophic,"" said Mr Greenhalgh. ""It's an extinction event for many businesses like mine,"" said Mr Greenhalgh. ""I've been speaking to so many similar businesses in Leeds and everyone's in the same situation - considering whether to try and battle through, mothball sites over the winter and hope things improve, or whether it's game over."" ""The only thing I can do is wait to see what help the government will give. I can't innovate out of it. I can't put prices up because our customers don't have the money."" Without rapid government help, Mr Greenhalgh said he would have to close one of his sites, and make staff redundant. ""If the government had stepped in two months ago, it would have made a much bigger difference. The delays this summer have slammed customer confidence"", he added. Red Flag Alert calculates businesses overall will need Â£100bn a year in support to tackle the rise in energy bills. While hospitality is not included in that figure, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, restaurateur Martin Williams warned that thousands of smaller firms in the industry were also at risk. The boss of the Gaucho steakhouse chain urged the government to consider energy bills help, as well as VAT cuts and business rates reform. ""There needs to be some confidence and that can only come from government support by the prime minister and the chancellor,"" he said. However the government is already under pressure over how it will finance a promised package of support for households, while sticking to promises to cut taxes. Ms Truss is understood to be planning to borrow up to Â£100bn to to limit the expected sharp rise in energy bills for households and firms. Right now, the annual energy bill for a typical household is Â£1,971. From 1 October, however, that is due to rise 80% - to Â£3,549. It is understood that the plans will see a typical household energy bill rise to Â£2,500 instead - about Â£1,000 less than expected, but still about Â£500 more than at present. As well as households, businesses are also expected to receive some help. Many firms are currently facing even sharper rises than households and many fixed-rate deals for business expire this October, exposing thousands of firms to full costs that could rise by four or five times or more.

"The pound has plummeted to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985. Sterling fell 0.64% to $1.145 on Wednesday afternoon - a level not seen in 37 years. The Bank of England said a weaker outlook for the UK economy as well as a stronger dollar were putting pressure on sterling. Governor Andrew Bailey also warned that little could be done to stop the UK falling into a recession this year as the war in Ukraine continued. He added that it would ""overwhelmingly be caused by the actions of Russia and the impact on energy prices"". The Bank expects the economy to shrink in the last three months of 2022 and keep shrinking until the end of 2023. The warning comes ahead of a government plan to limit a sharp rise in energy bills. It is understood that a typical energy bill could be capped at around Â£2,500,with new Prime Minister Liz Truss set to announce the details on Thursday. Currently, a typical household's gas and electricity bill is due to rise from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 in October. UK will fall into recession this year, warns Bank How high will energy bills go now? Energy prices climbed sharply when lockdown was lifted and the economy started to return to normal. They have increased further as Russia sharply cut its gas supplies to Europe. It has pushed up the price of gas across the continent, including in the UK, having a huge knock-on effect on consumers. Speaking in front of the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday, Mr Bailey said ""sadly"" a recession remained the most likely outcome in the UK. When asked by MPs if there was much that the central bank could do to stop it, he said: ""Insofar as the war is having this huge effect, the answer to that would be no."" Governor Andrew Bailey said a recession would ""overwhelmingly be caused by the actions of Russia and the impact on energy prices"". The Bank predicted a UK recession last month as it raised interest rates by the highest margin in 27 years in a bid to keep soaring prices under control. Higher interest rates can make borrowing more expensive, meaning people have less money to spend and prices will stop rising as quickly. But there is a limit as to how effective UK rate rises can be when inflation is caused by global issues. Defending its recent moves, Mr Bailey added: ""The person going to put the UK in recession is Vladimir Putin, not the MPC [Monetary Policy Committee]."" He said the Bank would take the new prime minister's energy plan announcement ""into account"" when deciding on interest rates next week. During her campaign, Ms Truss hit out at the Bank of England, accusing it of being slow to react to rising prices and protect vulnerable households. But on Wednesday, the new Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng reiterated his ""full support for the independent Bank of England and their mission to control inflation, which is central to tackling cost of living challenges"". He also said he and Mr Bailey would meet twice a week from now on to discuss the cost-of-living crisis. Other economists also expect the UK to fall into a recession despite Ms Truss's energy support plan - albeit a shorter and less severe one. But some suggested on Wednesday that plans to cap energy bills could mean that increases in the cost of living will peak earlier and be ""significantly lower"" than previously forecast. The cost of living is rising at its fastest rate in 40 years, at 10.1%, with food, fuel and energy prices all up. Investment bank Goldman Sachs said a cap on bills for households could see inflation, which tracks how the cost of living changes over time, peak at 10.8% in October, rather than the 14.8% it forecast before. It then expects inflation to slow to 2.4% by December 2023. Deutsche Bank, HSBC and the Bank of England's own chief economist, Huw Pill, also believe the plan could slow price rises. But there is uncertainty around what exactly the plan will look like and what would happen once any cap is lifted. Mr Pill also said it was too soon to say how it might affect interest rates, which have gone up for the last six months in a row as the Bank tries to calm prices. Others say that capping energy prices at their current level would still leave many people struggling. According tothe Office for National Statistics,external, four in 10 adults who pay energy bills are already finding it ""very or somewhat difficult to afford them"". And the End Fuel Poverty Coalition pressure group estimates that if the energy price cap is frozen at Â£2,500 this October, 6.9 million UK households will still be in fuel poverty this winter - up from 4.6 million last winter.

The BBC's Colletta Smith tells you - in a minute - about four discounts and payments that could help There are also concerns about the cost of Ms Truss's plan, with research firm Capital Economics describing the support package as an ""effective but expensive sticking plaster"". Many expect the government to borrow at least Â£100bn, adding to the UK's already-high debt pile. This would come as Ms Truss attempts to push through a promised Â£30bn of tax cuts. On Wednesday, the chancellor said higher borrowing will be ""necessary"" in the short term to help people with bills. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC's Today programme: ""The big question here is: 'Is it going to be Â£100bn? What is the exit strategy from supporting bills?' ""My guess is it might end up being an awful lot more than that unless we react quite quickly to make it a better [energy] system,"" he said, adding that the plan would benefit affluent people more than the less well off. On the other side of the House of Commons just before the PMQs battle, was perhaps the more important Commons appearance. Governor Andrew Bailey and his team, confirming that there was not much they can do to stop a recession, blaming it on the Kremlin, and acknowledging that the UK is facing an historically unprecedented energy shock. It is heading to be three or four times worse for households than the hit to incomes in the 1970s' oil shock. At the same time the Bank welcomed the end of the summer uncertainty over energy bills, and anticipate that it will be big enough to prevent inflation spiralling higher. However Governor Bailey also acknowledged there were specific UK factors driving jittery markets, in addition to the strong dollar, especially the UK's extra reliance on gas. As Chief Economist Huw Pill put it, that dependence is not going to change quickly, so the only real question is ""who covers that cost?"". With sterling falling again today, to a 37 year low against the dollar, there are concerns in the markets that the PM and Chancellor will hope to contain tomorrow.

"The youngest primary school pupils have started getting free school meals, with other year groups set to recieve them by 2024 Young children have started to receive universal free school meals this week, but older children in Wales must wait. Reception pupils, aged four and five, are being offered the meals from this month as part of a phased rollout to all primary school children by 2024. Eight local authorities have said year 1 and 2 pupils will also qualify from the start of term. But the Welsh Conservatives said the plans were ""wrong"" to include the children of ""millionaire families"". All of Wales' approximately 272,000 primary school pupils are set to get free lunches by 2024. It is part of a deal between Plaid Cymru and the Labour Welsh government. Free school meals for all plan starts in September Families choosing between food and kids' sport Rising number of children on free school meals The Welsh government and Plaid Cymru said their joint policy would be extended to around 6,000 nursery-age children. ""It's nice to have something back,"" said Gethin Tomos, the father-of-two pupils at Ysgol Nantgaredig in Carmarthenshire. Gethin Tomos said he understand it isn't possible to roll out free school meals for every child immediately Mr Tomos' youngest has just started in reception class and so is eligible for free school dinners, while his older daughter doesn't qualify yet. ""It's a good idea obviously. It's very important that all children get offered some sort of free meal throughout the week,"" he said. Newport, Ceredigion, Blaenau Gwent, Torfaen, Pembrokeshire, Conwy, Vale of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire councils have all said pupils under the age of seven will get free school meals from this week. In Anglesey, Caerphilly and Gwynedd, reception and year 1 classes will be eligible, with Caerphilly planning to extend provision to year 2 pupils in November. Many councils, including Wrexham, Pembrokeshire and Conwy, are due to extend the provision to all primary school pupils from September 2023, earlier than the Welsh government target of 2024. At Ysgol Nantgaredig, all children in reception and full-time nursery started getting free school meals this week. Catherine Davies has a daughter in year 4, and although she welcomes the scheme, she believes means testing might be a better way to focus the help. ""Dependent on where you are on the scale of how much income [you receive] and how comfortable you are, perhaps it's more help for some than others,"" she said. ""I think [means tested] just makes a bit more sense"". This video can not be played Cook Jane Jones at Ysgol Twm o'r Nant in Denbigh is looking forward to the challenge Headteacher Steffan Griffiths said around two-thirds of the reception class had taken up the offer of a free school meal as well as the majority of the nursery children. While it was ""working fine"" at the moment, he said there would be more challenges as the scheme is expanded. Ysgol Nantgaredig headteacher Steffan Griffiths said it would be a ""huge challenge"" to meet the demand free school meals would bring ""At the moment we're feeding just over a 100 pupils within an hour and 15 minutes during our lunch break with three members of staff,"" he said. ""If you add 20, 30, 40, 50 pupils by next summer to that number it's going to be a huge challenge to do the same within the same period of time with the same number of staff"". Some councils across Wales have had to adapt and extend school kitchens to meet demand, and some have struggled to recruit extra staff. Gwynedd council has written to parents and carers to ask them to help work in schools to ""ensure the success of delivering free school meals"" while also ""earning some money"". Ellie Harwood from the Child Poverty Action Group said she was ""absolutely delighted"" to see the scheme begin. ""It's a wonderful thought thinking of the littlest children starting school this week... knowing that all of them can go down to the dinner hall, sit down and eat together with their friends,"" she said. Ellie Harwood said spending that directly benefits children would help ensure they ""don't suffer unnecessarily in the cost of living crisis"" She said councils and schools should be commended for getting the policy off the ground, despite the ""postcode lottery"" of which year groups are eligible in different areas. ""Targeting additional funding into services that directly benefit children is a really good way of making sure that children don't suffer unnecessarily in the cost of living crisis,"" she added. The policy of universal free school meals for all primary pupils is part of a three-year cooperation agreement between the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru. All primary school pupils in Wales will recieve free school meals by 2024 Marking the beginning of the scheme, Plaid and the Welsh government said free school meals would also be extended to full-time nursery pupils in schools. Some councils including Merthyr Tydfil and Carmarthenshire had already said full-time nursery children would be eligible from the start of this school term. Ministers earmarked Â£35m of funding, on top of Â£25m in the last financial year, to upgrade kitchens and digital systems along with Â£200m over three years for the day-to-day costs. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""Families throughout Wales are under huge pressure because of the cost-of-living crisis and we are doing everything we can to support them. ""Extending free school meals to all primary schools is one of a number of measures we are taking to support families through this difficult time."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the policy would mean ""no child will need to go hungry while they are in class"". Plaid said it ultimately wanted to see free school meals for secondary school pupils too. But the Welsh Conservatives said ""limited resources"" should be focused on the poorest. ""There is a cost-of-living crisis and we need every single penny of public funds to be targeted at where it is most needed, which Labour and Plaid's blanket approach fails to do,"" the party's leader Andrew RT Davies said. The youngest children in England and Scotland already receive universal free school meals with plans to extend it further in Scotland.

"The new PM called the Ukrainian and US presidents on her first day in office Liz Truss has rewarded her key allies with top jobs in a major reshuffle hours after succeeding Boris Johnson as prime minister. Kwasi Kwarteng is made chancellor, James Cleverly becomes foreign secretary and Suella Braverman replaces Priti Patel as home secretary. One of Ms Truss's closest friends, Therese Coffey, is appointed as health secretary and deputy PM. Her new cabinet will meet ahead of her first Prime Minister's Questions later. None of those who backed her defeated rival, Rishi Sunak, will remain in her full cabinet, with Dominic Raab, Grant Shapps, George Eustice and Steve Barclay all returning to the backbenches. But Ms Truss's press secretary said the changes would ""unify"" the Tory Party and pointed to senior roles for five of her leadership rivals: Suella Braverman, Tom Tugendhat as security minister, Kemi Badenoch as trade secretary, Penny Mordaunt as leader of the Commons, and Nadhim Zahawi as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. For the first time, none of the top four ""great offices of state"" - prime minister, chancellor, home secretary and foreign secretary - is held by a white man. Follow live updates New cabinet: Who is in Liz Truss's top team? In pictures: Liz Truss becomes UK's 56th PM Meanwhile, the new PM made her first call to a fellow foreign leader, pledging the UK's ongoing support to Ukraine in a call with President Volodymyr Zelensky. No 10 said Ms Truss was also ""delighted"" to accept an invitation to visit Ukraine. She later spoke to US President Joe Biden, where the pair discussed the importance of the UK reaching an agreement with the EU over post-Brexit trading rules in Northern Ireland. There are a handful of striking things about the composition of Liz Truss's cabinet. There has been a near total purge of those who backed Rishi Sunak. The only one who I can spot is Michael Ellis, the new attorney general for England and Wales. And even he will attend cabinet rather than being a cabinet minister, subtle though that distinction is. This dominance of Truss campaign supporters around the Truss top table is already prompting grumbling among some Tory MPs, although we do await appointments to the more junior ranks in government. The prime minister's desire for loyalty and building a government in her own image runs the risk of provoking rebellion down the track. Read more from Chris here. Ms Truss finished her first tranche of appointments late on Tuesday, with new the Chancellor, Mr Kwarteng, tweeting that getting the job was ""the honour of a lifetime"". He is expected to spend his first day meeting chief executives of various banks to brief them on his outlook. Mr Kwarteng is also understood to be finalisingplans for energy bill supportwhich would see a typical household bill capped at around Â£2,500 a year. But Labour have asked where the money is coming from to fund the bill. ""We really haven't got the detail,"" Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the BBC. ""She is going to freeze bills. Where is the money coming from? ""Is it actually gonna come from consumers - bill payers down the line - or is it going to come from the oil and gas companies who have made huge profits, more than they imagined, and can actually afford to fund it."" Ms Truss has previously said she is not keen on a windfall tax on energy companies' profits. Liz Truss is set to face Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's questions later Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was one of the few senior ministers to retain his job, where he has earned plaudits in his response to the conflict in Ukraine. Nadine Dorries, who backed Ms Truss, said she had been asked by the new PM to stay on as culture secretary but had decided to quit front-line politics. Jacob Rees-Mogg, an early supporter of Ms Truss, was appointed business, energy and industrial strategy secretary. Mr Sunak, the former chancellor whose resignation helped trigger the downfall of Boris Johnson, had already made it clear he did not expect to be offered a new job. But his supporters had urged Ms Truss to appoint an ""inclusive"" cabinet and not simply surround herself with loyalists. Ms Truss was appointed the 56th prime minister of the UK by the Queen, in a ceremony at Balmoral on Tuesday. She returned to a rain-lashed Downing Street, wherein a short speech, she vowed to grow the economy through tax cuts and reform; take action to deal with energy bills and put the health service on ""a firm footing"".

"As Liz Truss traversed the UK racking up the votes to defeat Rishi Sunak, in the same towns where she wooed the membership hustings, including in leafy apparently affluent areas, the size of the challenge she was vying to inherit was getting notably worse. The situation on the ground has deteriorated for ordinary households and businesses, as prices continued to surge yet higher. And at the same time there has been an ominous turn in the markets for British government borrowing and in currency markets. The combination of these two changes alter the reality of the situation she now takes on as prime minister. The question is how much it changes the immediate solutions she has promised as campaigner. From Durham to Derbyshire and Stoke-on-Trent and beyond, the stories we have reported on in many local communities show the real life depths of this cost of living crisis, even at current energy prices. The surge in food prices is breaking the charitable model of food banks and food pantries that have emerged in almost every town and city. Not only has demand surged, turning many of last year's food charity donors into recipients of support, but supplies are now a problem. Many of these projects are reliant on surplus food stocks from supermarket supply chains. But supermarkets facing massive inflationary pressures, trying to avoid passing on all of those price hikes to consumers, have been trimming surplus stock, meaning there is less tinned goods available for donations. Demand up hugely, at a time when supply is a problem. This is just one manifestation of out-of-control inflation. Jo Yendole from Stone Community hub says some people have stopped using hot water We visited a facility in Stone, Staffordshire. Jo Yendole who helps run Stone Community hub said: ""One of the guys who's on licence from prison, sort of struggling to maintain his flat and the cost of his flat actually said he would prefer to go back to prison because it was easier because he just couldn't see how we were going to afford to live. ""And another lady who she was she's talking about the cost of gas and an energy prices said she'd completely turned her boiler off and wasn't using any hot water and was boiling a kettle. The gas price is not even affordable in the summer for her"". Truss vows action on energy ahead of first day as PM Government closes in on energy rescue plan What could be done to combat high energy costs? Seven big questions now facing Liz Truss At a pantry in Matlock, Derbyshire, which offers subsidised food at about a tenth of supermarket prices, Beverley Parker from Rural Action Derbyshire told me people were returning fresh food, because they could not afford refrigeration costs. ""We've heard of people switching off their fridges and freezers because they can't afford the electricity. You're risking your own health and that of your family, by eating food that hasn't been stored correctly. ""A lot of people are choosing to either get rid of their cars or not use them. Public transport in the countryside is limited at best. So we've we've even heard of people walking six miles from the food bank, and then six miles back home, because they can't afford the bus fare."" At another community hub in Peterlee, County Durham, I met dual-income working families who had started to grow their own vegetables and heard the co-ordinators tell of clients pre-emptively cancelling energy bill direct debits. Much of this happened even before the move in prices up to Â£3,549. While the energy companies have tried to pre-empt the arrival of Liz Truss with a ready to go plan to cancel the rise in the energy cap, that might not require upfront borrowing, there are still huge amounts of support being relied upon, even at existing bills. One energy company boss, former government fuel poverty tsar Derek Lickorish who is chairman of Utilita, told me the reality for the poorest customers. A typical Â£50 on prepayment meters which would ordinarily last 12 days in winter, might only last two days from January. ""Liz Truss has said that she intends to solve this problem, and I welcome that. This is a war footing to my mind. It will affect government borrowing. ""If we don't, we're going to have major problems with customers having unaffordable bills. There'll be huge mental health problems, we will see businesses going broke, we'll see people losing their jobs and they want to have disposable income to spend with businesses. It really is Armageddon, if we don't deal with this, and that's what we've got to get on with it"". So as we head towards some version of the energy companies tariff deficit fund being announced imminently by the new prime minister, she faces further pressure from the markets. The dollar has been strong as the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, has indicated a sharper rise in interest rates. But sterling has fallen notably against the dollar and the euro. Long-term borrowing costs for the government have topped 3%, setting the floor for borrowing for mortgages and for businesses. The government will have to work closely with the Bank of England These are jitters rather than a crisis. In that context it was notable to see both Ms Truss and her likely Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, row back from her early campaign rhetoric criticising the Bank of England. The government and Bank will need to work very closely together in the coming months. An important difference with the pandemic bailout is there can be no expectation that the Bank will buy up most of the issuance of extra government borrowing. The Bank has already indicated it will do the opposite soon as part of ""reverse QE"". If the government needs to borrow more, it will have to find buyers for the debt among pension funds, insurers and foreign buyers, and pay a high price. If the PM wants to abide by her campaign promises to make tens of billions of tax cuts, and help launch an energy bailout for both households and businesses, at a time when energy prices in markets could go yet higher, borrowing will have to go up in the first instance. But if she does not help both sectors, disposable income will drain from the economy, and many small businesses will simply go bust, hiking up unemployment too. The new prime minister already faced a very tricky balancing act between inflation and recession. The past month means the room for manoeuvre has got even smaller. Given this hand, Rishi Sunak may not end up regretting his loss.

"Tens of thousands of businesses are at risk of going under without government support because of soaring energy bills, according to insolvency experts. Red Flag Alert, which monitors the financial health of firms, told the BBC previously profitable companies are experiencing significant losses. Among those that survive, many will be forced to make workers redundant, the consultancy said. Firms are waiting to hear if they will get help with their energy bills. On Thursday the government, led by new Prime Minister Liz Truss,is expected to announce significant financial supportfor households facing an 80% rise in the energy price cap in October. Businesses are not covered by the cap, however, and Red Flag is warning that more than 75,000 larger firms that are high energy users are at risk of insolvency or are likely to lay off staff without government support. The government's plan is expected to include some relief for businesses - but details are not yet known. According to Red Flag, many firms will face a choice between paying wages or paying energy bills. ""Businesses can't absorb these costs and they're going to be forced very quickly into a decision about headcount or being able to pay energy bills,"" said chief economist Nicola Headlam. ""That's going to be the reality and it's coming down the track very quickly."" What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? Liz Truss set to cut energy bills for millions What cost-of-living payments will I get? According to Red Flag Alert, there are 355,000 companies with a turnover higher than Â£1m that are designated as high energy users - industries such as steel, glass, concrete, and paper production. Of those, the company estimates 75,972 are at risk of insolvency, and they estimate 26,720 of them could fail because of energy costs. That is in addition to the 26,000 insolvencies they had already predicted this year. ""That is a colossal number of people whose businesses will fail, without a large-scale support package from the government"", said Ms Headlam. ""That's more than during the pandemic, and more than in any other recession. ""A business turning over a million pounds two years ago would have spent around 8% of that on energy costs and made profits of around Â£90,000. ""If the cost of energy doubles to 16%, that instantly wipes out profitability, and they're straight into a scenario where it threatens the viability of the business within a year."" Beyond the large, energy-intensive companies, smaller companies with turnover under Â£1m, were also at risk of failure, Red Flag Alert said. It highlighted the hospitality sector where firms face a triple threat of increasing energy bills, higher supply and staffing costs, and a fall-off in consumer spending, squeezed by inflation. That is certainly the case for James Greenhalgh, who runs Flamingos Coffee House in Leeds, and a bar in the city too. The combined energy bill for both is due to leap from Â£1,500 to around Â£10,000 from the beginning of October. ""That's more expensive than our wage bill. That's just catastrophic,"" said Mr Greenhalgh. ""It's an extinction event for many businesses like mine,"" said Mr Greenhalgh. ""I've been speaking to so many similar businesses in Leeds and everyone's in the same situation - considering whether to try and battle through, mothball sites over the winter and hope things improve, or whether it's game over."" ""The only thing I can do is wait to see what help the government will give. I can't innovate out of it. I can't put prices up because our customers don't have the money."" Without rapid government help, Mr Greenhalgh said he would have to close one of his sites, and make staff redundant. ""If the government had stepped in two months ago, it would have made a much bigger difference. The delays this summer have slammed customer confidence"", he added. Red Flag Alert calculates businesses overall will need Â£100bn a year in support to tackle the rise in energy bills. While hospitality is not included in that figure, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, restaurateur Martin Williams warned that thousands of smaller firms in the industry were also at risk. The boss of the Gaucho steakhouse chain urged the government to consider energy bills help, as well as VAT cuts and business rates reform. ""There needs to be some confidence and that can only come from government support by the prime minister and the chancellor,"" he said. However the government is already under pressure over how it will finance a promised package of support for households, while sticking to promises to cut taxes. Ms Truss is understood to be planning to borrow up to Â£100bn to to limit the expected sharp rise in energy bills for households and firms. Right now, the annual energy bill for a typical household is Â£1,971. From 1 October, however, that is due to rise 80% - to Â£3,549. It is understood that the plans will see a typical household energy bill rise to Â£2,500 instead - about Â£1,000 less than expected, but still about Â£500 more than at present. As well as households, businesses are also expected to receive some help. Many firms are currently facing even sharper rises than households and many fixed-rate deals for business expire this October, exposing thousands of firms to full costs that could rise by four or five times or more. In her victory speech, Ms Truss pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis"".
