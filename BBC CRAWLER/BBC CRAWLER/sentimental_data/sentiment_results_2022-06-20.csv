"This video can not be played Watch: Hong Kong's iconic floating restaurant towed away A floating restaurant that was a famous Hong Kong landmark has sunk, days after it was towed away from the harbour where it operated for nearly 50 years. The Jumbo restaurant capsized in the South China Sea while on its way to an undisclosed location, its parent company said. Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises said it was ""very saddened by the incident"" but that no crew members were injured. The restaurant closed in March 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic hit. More than 3 million guests are believed to have eaten its Cantonese cuisine over the years, including the Queen, Tom Cruise and Richard Branson. It had featured in several films - including a Bond movie - but the pandemic dealt the business a fatal blow as diners turned away. The Jumbo restaurant was an iconic landmark of Hong Kong, however had not been profitable since 2013 Marine engineers had been hired to inspect the floating restaurant before the trip, and ""all relevant approvals"" had been obtained, the owners said. The vessel was due to stay at an undisclosed location while it awaited a new operator. But it sank on Sunday near the Paracel Islands after it ""encountered adverse conditions"" and began to take on water, Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises said.

"The MP for Tottenham is under investigation for breaching the MPs' code of conduct Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy is under investigation for allegedly breaking rules for declaring financial interests. The Parliamentary Standards probe is looking at possible breaches to the MPs' code of conduct. MPs must register changes to their financial interests within 28 days, but Mr Lammy's financial register contained interests recorded after that period. Mr Lammy apologised and said he had put ""revised systems in place"". The investigation was opened on Wednesday by Parliamentary Standards commissioner Kathryn Stone who has been looking at possible breaches in the areas of earnings, gifts and foreign travel. Starmer investigated by standards watchdog over late gift registrations The MP for Tottenham's financial register included a speech in the US on the invasion of Ukraine. It also noted he received Â£3,280 from the Canary Wharf Group for a speech and question-and-answer session on 1 December, but it was not registered until 27 May. A spokesperson for Mr Lammy said: ""David Lammy takes his declaration responsibilities seriously and as soon as this was brought to his attention he wrote to Registrar of Members' Financial Interests to apologise for the administrative errors in his office which led to late declarations in December last year. ""He has assured the registrar that he has put revised systems in place so that declarations are made in a timely manner."" The shadow foreign secretary joins Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer inbeing investigated by the watchdog. Sir Keir has previously insisted he was ""absolutely confident"" he had not broken the rules, and blamed the investigation on ""administrative errors"" in his office.

"Four Tet's best songs include Butterflies, Two Thousand and Seventeen, and Lush Pioneering electronic artist Four Tet has reached a settlement in the legal battle against his former record label. The musician, whose real name is Kieran Hebden, sued Domino Records last year over the royalties he gets paid when his music is downloaded or streamed. He argued that the 13.5% royalty rate he was being offered was unfair, and demanded a 50% split with the label. In a settlement, Domino agreed to the honour the 50% rate and reimbursed the musician for historic underpayments. It was quite a reversal for the indie label, which originally responded to the case by removing several Four Tet albums from streaming services (they were later reinstated). ""It has been a difficult and stressful experience to work my way through this court case and I'm so glad we got this positive result,"" wrote Hebden in a statement announcing the settlement. ""Hopefully I've opened up a constructive dialogue and maybe prompted others to push for a fairer deal on historical contracts, written at a time when the music industry operated entirely differently."" The result could set a legal precedent for contract disputes in the music business; where royalty rates have been subject to heavy scrutiny since last year'sinquiry into the streaming market by MPs on the Culture Select Committee. However, Four Tet's legal challenge was ultimately decided out of court, so any future disputes would not be able to cite a legal judgement. ""Neither the courts, nor the settlement terms, have made any determination as to how streaming should be categorised or streaming income split,"" said Domino Records in a statement, adding it was ""pleased"" that Hebden had chosen to settle the case on ""financial terms first offered to him in November 2021"".

The dispute concerned the recording contract Hebden signed with Domino in 2001, which resulted in four albums: Pause (2001), Rounds (2003), Everything Ecstatic (2005) and There Is Love In You (2010). The deal was signed before the advent of downloads of streams - and his dispute hinged on whether those methods of accessing his music could be defined as a ""sale"" or a ""licence"" under the terms of his contract. The difference is far from academic because most artists receive 50% of the royalties for a licence but a much lower figure, typically between 12% and 22%, for a sale. Historically, the difference was due to the way music was distributed: selling music in the era of CDs, vinyl and cassettes incurred huge costs in manufacturing and distribution, which meant labels needed to cover their overheads. But when music is licensed to movies, television or advertisements, artists generally get a bigger payday, on the understanding that a third party is bearing the relevant costs.

"The drug testing kit, launched in 2019, uses a mouth swab Nearly 400 drug driving cases have been abandoned because of delays in processing forensic tests. Since 2019 police have been able to conduct roadside mouth swabs and request blood samples from drivers suspected of being impaired by drugs. The authorities planned to process 1,000 blood tests a year, but demand has been double that figure. The Scottish Police Authority (SPA) said 386 cases could not proceed as labs struggled to cope. Drug-driving 'could soon exceed' drink-driving Police unveil new roadside drug-driving kits Roadside drug detection kits issued to officers involve DrugWipes - dubbed drugalysers - to check for cannabis or cocaine. Suspected drug drivers can also be taken to a police station where, if a doctor considers driving ability to be impaired, they can be asked for a blood sample and tested for 17 substances including ecstasy, LSD, ketamine and heroin. Director of forensic services Fiona Douglas told the authority: ""Demand for drug-driving toxicology analysis has far outstripped what was estimated when the new offence was introduced in Scotland in 2019. ""To date, more than 5,600 cases have been processed for testing and analysis. We have been working hard to manage a continued demand supported by additional investment from the Scottish government to help increase laboratory capacity and outsource a number of cases."" The 386 cases that could not be pursued by prosecutors had reached the current statutory 12-month time limit. They were primarily low risk cases with no fatality. Three of them involved an injury. Police are able to conduct roadside mouth swabs to test for cannabis and cocaine The Scottish government has already invested about Â£1m to increase capacity by allowing testing to be outsourced to commercial forensic analysis providers. Work has also been done to increase in-house capacity. Scottish Police Authority chairman Martyn Evans said the pressures meant about 7% of cases were not being prosecuted and it was clear that demand for the service had been underestimated. ""We are deeply concerned that 386 drug driving cases cannot be progressed to prosecution due to testing and analysis not being processed within an adequate timeframe. It is a serious failure,"" he said. Police Scotland and the authority's forensic service have been working together since May to find solutions. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams said: ""We are committed to detecting and taking action against those who take drugs and drive. ""Being able to use roadside drug wipes has significantly enhanced our ability to detect those responsible and keep the public safe."" ""Despite the current challenges around testing capacity, Police Scotland's commitment remains unchanged."" The SPA is due to discuss how to address the challenges at a meeting on Thursday.

"Ukraine is usually a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called Africa ""a hostage"" of Russia's war during an address to the African Union (AU) on Monday. Russia's invasion, and its blockade of Ukraine's grain exports, have sparked grain and fertiliser shortages and put millions of people at risk of hunger. The chair of the AU commission said there was an ""urgent need for dialogue"" to restore global stability. Western countries have urged Russia to release Ukraine's vast grain stores. The blockade has sent food prices soaring. ""Africa is actually a hostage... of those who unleashed war against our state"", Mr Zelensky said in his speech. He said his government was engaged in ""complex negotiations"" to unblock grain reserves trapped in Ukraine's Black Sea ports. ""This war may seem very distant to you and your countries,"" he told the AU. ""But the food prices that are catastrophically rising have already brought [the war] to the homes of millions of African families."" Mr Zelensky's AU speech comes nearly 10 weeks after he first asked to address the continental body. The BBC understands that 55 heads of state were invited to the virtual session, but only four attended. The rest of the countries sent representatives. African countries have been divided in their response to Russia's war in Ukraine. In March, 17 African countries abstained in a UN vote to condemn the invasion. But on Monday,AU's chairperson Macky Sall thanked,externalMr Zelensky for addressing the union. Mr Sall said that ""Africa remains committed to respecting the rules of international law, the peaceful resolution of conflicts and freedom of trade"". Initially, the AU did not want to be addressed by Mr Zelensky, and it does not fully agree with what he's saying - they want dialogue to solve the crisis, as they always have. Earlier this month, Mr Sall held talks with Russia President Vladimir Putin. He told Mr Putin that African countries are innocent victims of the war in Ukraine and Russia should help ease their suffering. Is Russia exporting grain from Ukraine? Ukraine calls for safe passage for grain exports Ukraine war: WTO boss warns of global food crisis Food prices across African countries have rocketed, meanwhile millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports Earlier on Monday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said of Russia's blockade: ""This is a real war crime, so I cannot imagine that this will last much longer."" Mr Borrell met EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday to discuss the crisis. He described Moscow's actions as ""a deliberate attempt to create hunger in the world"". He rejected Russia's claim that the current food crisis is a result of EU sanctions, adding that they ""don't forbid"" countries outside the EU from conducting food trade with Russia or other nations. French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said that ""Russia must stop playing with global hunger"" as it seeks leverage over the West. ""Leaving cereals blocked is dangerous for stability in the world,"" she said. The head of the Polish prime minister's office, Michal Dworczyk, spoke with Ukraine's infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov about changes that will speed up checks for trucks on the Polish-Ukrainian border to help export more grain from Ukraine.

"The rail strike is on. Perhaps you're reading this in a long queue for the bus. Or packed on to one of the few trains that is running. The RMT trade union reckons the whole thing has been ""manufactured"" by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Mr Shapps claims it has been ""created by the unions."" So what will happen next, both on the railways and in the wider economy? Rail union says ministers prevented strike deal When is the rail strike and which trains are running? The government insists there is no point it getting directly involved in this dispute, arguing that you have to go back decades to find a cabinet minister involved in negotiations with a trade union. Sources also point out there have been around 60 meetings between the industry and the RMT on the fine details of the dispute, and the transport secretary wouldn't be saying anything different were he involved. As soon as next week we can expect ministers to introduce what is known as secondary legislation, a bolt-on to existing laws, that will allow people with the necessary transferrable skills to fill gaps left by striking workers. The plan from ministers in the longer term is a new law that requires a ""minimum service"" to be provided when there are public transport strikes, a promise the Conservatives made in their last election manifesto. In other words, the government is defiant - and so is the RMT. Labour argues all of this is a sign of government failure, but it finds itself in an awkward spot too. That's because, while the government has condemned the strikes, Labour is more careful in its language. It says it wishes the strikes weren't happening, but doesn't condemn them. Labour's Kate Osborne says she'll defy the leadership by picketing with RMT members And now a row is brewing because a note sent to shadow ministers by the party leadership says: ""Please be reminded that frontbenchers including PPSs should not be on picket lines."" A PPS is a parliamentary private secretary, an assistant to a frontbencher, but someone expected to toe the party line. ""Please speak to all the members of your team to remind them of this and confirm with me that you have done so,"" the note goes on. But Labour MP Kate Osborne, herself a PPS, has tweeted: ""Come what may, I will be on a picket line supporting workers tomorrow."" The general secretary of the Unite union, Sharon Graham, added: ""To instruct Labour MPs not to be on picket lines with workers speaks volumes. It's time to decide whose side you're on."" The context here, on the railways and in the wider economy, is Covid. Passenger numbers are down by a fifth, and an expensive fifth if you are a train operating company. Commuters and business travellers, who pay a premium to travel at peak times, are not travelling as much. For that reason, ministers argue, change is inevitable. But the union says it is absurd that there is full employment and yet falling wages. Which brings us to the bigger picture. Prices are rising at a speed not seen in 40 years. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, has said wages in the private and public sector can't keep up with these price rises, or inflation will get worse. The judgement of ministers, in other words, is the only way this gets better in the medium term is for the majority of people to feel poorer in the short term. That's quite a thing for a senior minister to say: Having less money now is a price worth paying for things getting better sooner. What will Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have to say? AsPaul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies puts it,external, ""the question for government is how to distribute the pain, across people and across time, not how to avoid it altogether.

"Primark is to finally sell its clothes online through a new click-and-collect service for children's products. The High Street retailer said 2,000 goods will be offered through a trial which will run out of 25 shops in the north west of England. Until now, Primark has resisted selling its products online unlike other retailers. As a result, the business was hit hard by Covid restrictions while stores were closed. Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth described Primark's move as a ""very big deal"", adding: ""Covid showed the risk of having a store-only estate"". However, the trial is not part of a wider plan to enable all of company's products to be sold online, according to George Weston, chief executive of Primark's parent company, Associated British Foods (ABF). ""What you will never see is the entire Primark range available for click and collect, nor any of it available for home delivery,"" he told the BBC. ""We are using online selling for click and collecting very selectively,"" he added. ""When they come into their local Primark store if they've purchase online, then we hope they will buy something else while they are in store as well."" Ms Shuttleworth said: ""Primark has been looking for the best way to enter the online market, but if you're late to the party - which it is - you need to do it in the most profitable way possible. ""Click-and-collect is simpler to build into your existing operation of shops, you don't need a logistics partner, and returns come straight back into the store."" Mr Weston said delivering orders to people's homes was complex, not good for the environment and a ""really expensive way of fulfilling someone's order"". ABF recently revamped its UK site to give more details of in-store ranges, so customers can browse the full collection and check availability before coming into stores. Primark's sales bounced back when stores reopened after lockdown eased ABF said its new website, which launched in April, saw online traffic rise by around 60%. It said the trial will allow customers who live nearer a smaller Primark store access to a much wider range of items. ""Our average-size stores are only able to stock a limited range and for these customers the number of options available to them will broadly double, increasing even more for customers of our small stores,"" said ABF. ""This trial will enable us to provide more fashion, licence and lifestyle products to more customers and more often."" The group said Primark sales increased by 81% in the three months to the end of May, when compared with last year. All Primark stores were open during the period, unlike last year when most stores were closed until the middle of April due to lockdown restrictions. The chain, which was founded in 1969, has never had an online store nor offered click-and-collect services for its products until now. The firmhas previously said,externalthis is because it would not be able to keep prices for its clothing as low if it offered home delivery. Selling items online can be costly for retailers, who often cover the costs of deliveries and returns as a way of winning customers from rivals. It also takes longer for warehouse staff to process returned stock. Last week,Asos warned that full-year profits will fall sharplyas customers returned more items, whileZara recently started charging shoppersfor online returns. While Primark suffered from its lack of online presence during the lockdowns,sales quickly recovered when stores reopened in April 2021. A senior executive at the firm recently told the BBC that the pandemic had ""accelerated"" changes that were already taking place between the high street and online. However, John Bason, finance director at Primark's parent company ABF, said he is confident that the High Street does have a future. ""Even though we were closed probably six months for the two main years of the pandemic, our customers have come back to us. That I think is very very striking,"" he added. ""So no, I think the demise of the High Street is way overstated, but it is changing. There's no doubt over it.""

"Millions of people ranging from commuters to people heading to Glastonbury Festival will be affected by this week's rail strikes. Businesses will also be hit, with customers unable to travel or choosing to work from home. ""Since the announcement [of the strikes] we've had cancellations worth more than Â£500,000,"" says Tony Matharu, who owns the Blue Orchid Hotels Group. The chain, which has several hotels in London, serves a mixture of business and leisure travellers, as well as hosting events - with all being hit by cancellations. The strikes on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday will see only one in five services running across England, Scotland and Wales, and there will also be knock-on disruption for the rest of the week. On Tuesday, most London Underground services will also not be running due to strike action. Mr Matharu says the uncertainty caused by the strikes has led customers to cancel - even if their train is still running - with many worried they may not be able to get home again. While some may rebook, others who had been travelling for specific events that are not being rescheduled will not, he adds. Mr Matharu says the hospitality industry can ""ill afford"" such losses after the impact of Covid. ""It could prove fatal for some of those trying to recover after two ruinous years,"" he tells the BBC. Tony Matharu says his hotels have been hit by a wave of cancellations since the strikes were announced The strikes will cost the hospitality sector an estimated Â£540m across the week, with businesses expected to see a 20% drop in sales, according to UKHospitality, which represents the industry. Its chief executive Kate Nicholls says this is a ""huge blow"" to businesses, which are already facing challenges including soaring energy prices and staff shortages as they recover from Covid restrictions. ""Our customers and staff rely heavily on public transport to visit our venues, especially in towns and cities, where recovery is proving most difficult,"" she says. When is the rail strike and which trains are running? Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? Lynsey Harley, who runs Modern Standard Coffee, has already seen her orders take a hit because of the strikes. The company, which is based in Fife, roasts speciality coffee for customers including restaurants and hotels and also has its own cafe in Edinburgh. Ms Harley says customers in London and other city centres are planning for a 50% drop in trade and had cut their orders as a result. ""We've had customers tell us, we're not going to order next week because we just don't think we're going to need the product,"" she tells the BBC. Fortunately some of her losses have been offset by a spike in home orders for coffee this week, with many people now able to work from home as they did during Covid lockdowns. Lynsey Harley is worried about the impact of strikes on wholesale customers Ms Harley thinks her cafe, which is based in a semi-residential area of Edinburgh, could also benefit from increased sales if customers choose to stay at home because of disruption to commuter trains. It's not just businesses and commuters that will be affected by the strikes. Thousands of school pupils are due to sit exams this week, including 18-year-old Seryn, who normally travels by train from Tonbridge to her school in London. But with no services running she's had to book a hotel for three nights - costing around Â£500 - so she can take her A-levels. ""If I went to a friend's house that would be the only other option and I didn't want to do that because me and my parents decided that I wouldn't be able to have a good night's sleep before my exam,"" she tells the BBC. Seryn has two A-level exams this week The BBC has contacted the RMT union, whose members are striking, for comment.

"This video can not be played Watch: Mick Lynch, RMT general-secretary: ""This dispute has been manufactured by Shapps"" Passengers in England, Scotland and Wales face severe disruption after last-ditch talks failed to stop the biggest rail strikes in 30 years. Thousands of staff at Network Rail and 13 rail operators are due to walk out on Tuesday, affecting most major lines. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT rail union, blamed the ""dead hand"" of government, saying ministers did not allow employers to negotiate freely. The transport secretary said ""outdated unions"" were ""opposing progress"". Grant Shapps said about 20% of services were expected to run during the strikes on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, focusing on key workers, main population centres and critical freight routes. Services are expected to be affected from Monday evening, with disruption continuing on non-strike days this week. This video can not be played WATCH: Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps speaking in the House of Commons: ""Strikes created by the unions"" The RMT, which represents rail workers ranging from catering staff to signallers, is calling for a pay rise of at least 7%. The union said employers have only offered 2%, with the possibility of 1% more, on the condition that workers accept proposed job cuts and changes to working practices. Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said ""no strike is inevitable until the moment it begins"", but urged passengers to travel by train only if necessary. Aspecial train timetable,externalfor 20 to 26 June was published on Friday. A strike willalso take place across the London Underground on Tuesday. Live: Train strikes to go ahead after last-ditch talks fail Which lines will be affected by the strike? How much are rail workers paid? Talks were held on Monday afternoon to avert the strikes but the sides remained deadlocked, Mr Lynch said, accusing the government of interfering to prevent a deal. ""What we've come to understand is the dead hand of this Tory government is all over this dispute and the fingerprints of Grant Shapps and the DNA of [chancellor] Rishi Sunak are all over the problems on the railway,"" he said. ""Until they allow these employers to negotiate freely I can't see we're going to get a resolution."" He said staff were faced with thousands of job cuts, reduced pensions, worse terms and conditions, and a cut in real-terms pay as inflation soars. Mr Lynch said there was also a plan to close every ticket office in Britain. The Department for Transport said no final decision had been made, but said it was ""absurd"" to suggest it wanted to close every booking office. 'I'm set to lose hundreds thanks to rail strikes' The transport secretary has denied the government intervened in the dispute, saying ""no minsters have ever been involved directly in these strike negotiations"" and only the employers and union could reach an agreement. In the House of Commons, Mr Shapps said the government could no longer tolerate rail unions using their right to strike ""without any regard for how the rights of others are disrupted"". He said minimum service legislation, which requires train companies to maintain a base level of service even during strikes, was part of the solution. The short answer to this is yes. The transport secretary says he does not want to get involved in a dispute between the RMT on one side and Network Rail and the train operating companies (TOCs) on the other, but the interaction between the two employers means the government has a pivotal role. According to government officials, Network Rail is in theory able to offer a higher pay settlement than the 3% they are currently offering by shuffling their large and complex overall budget. However, the government accepts that any pay offer to Network Rail employees would set the bar for a settlement for the train operating companies. Since the government is now also standing as the financial backstop to the Covid-ravaged train operating companies, that could frustrate its stated ambition of putting the rail industry on a sustainable financial footing given that revenues for the train companies are still languishing just above half their pre-pandemic levels. The government may not be in the room but it is at the table. Mr Shapps told MPs rail unions were preventing the industry from updating ""obsolete working practices"", such as voluntary Sunday working - which he blamed for the cancellation of 170 trains before the Euro 2020 final last year. He said it was ""factually incorrect"" to say the strike is about a pay freeze and said reforms for the railways would include a ""decent annual pay rise"" for staff. ""It's about outdated unions opposing progress, progress that will secure the future of the railway,"" he said. Addressing union members directly, he said: ""Your union bosses have got you striking under false pretences and, rather than protecting your jobs, they are actually endangering them and the railway's future."" Labour said that if the strikes go ahead, they will represent a ""catastrophic failure of leadership"" by ministers. Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said of Mr Shapps: ""Not only has he been boycotting the talks, he's tied the hands of those at the table."" She said Mr Shapps had not given train operating companies ""any mandate to negotiate"" and the talks were ""a sham, because ministers have set them up to fail"". Network Rail says the last trains between many major cities are expected to depart over the course of Monday afternoon, before more than 40,000 rail workers walk out. The strike begins at 00:01 BST on Tuesday. Although ScotRail and Transport for Wales are not involved in the dispute, train services will be disrupted as the railways rely on Network Rail staff. ScotRailsaid 90% of trains will be cancelledduring the three days of strike action. The reduced timetable will be in place until Sunday, with just 20% of usual services running on strike days. Trains that do run will start later and finish much earlier than usual - between 07:30 and 18:30. South Western Railway,externalsaid it will run a ""severely reduced timetable"" on strike days, with significant sections of the network closed and a very limited service between 07:15 and 18:30 BST on some routes for those who have to travel. Great Western Railway,externalwill only operate 30% of its usual timetabled services on strike days and about 50% on non-strike days. West Midlands Railway,external, which will run a limited service on a small number of routes, urged customers to travel only if it is essential and if ""no other transport option is available"". Knock-on disruption is expected on the roads, with motorists being warned to expected a surge in traffic. Motoring group the AA says drivers in Scotland and Wales should expect to face long queues as most railway lines will be closed. The M74, M8 and A9 in Scotland and the M4, A55, A5, and A483 in Wales could see severe traffic, it says. The RAC says major city routes and those serving the home counties are likely to see some of the biggest increases in traffic volumes. The strikes will affect a number of events including school exams and thefirst Glastonbury Festival for three years. Can I get a refund?Yes, if you cannot get your train due to strike action. Season-ticket holders can apply for a refund for the days affected. Find more infohere,external. Do I have to go to work or school?This is up to your individual employer or school, check with them. How can I plan my train journey?Use theNational Rail journey planner,external. Read morehere. Leaders at 13 trade unions and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) have jointly written to Mr Shapps urging him to ""help deliver a fair resolution"". The Labour Party has also called on the government to step in. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said nobody took strike action lightly but argued low-paid rail staff such as caterers and cleaners had been left with ""no other option"". ""It's insulting to ask them to take yet another real-terms pay cut when rail companies took Â£500m in profits during the pandemic,"" she said. Rail Delivery Group chair Steve Montgomery said that passenger numbers were at 80% of pre-pandemic levels and the industry wanted to give ""a fair deal on pay while taking no more than its fair share from taxpayers"". Meanwhile,under new legislation the government is expectedto introduce this week, employers would be able to replace striking workers with agency staff. The new law, which is likely to come into force from mid-July, has been criticised by the Trades Union Congress and the recruitment industry for undermining the right to strike and creating safety risks.

"Rail travel has been disrupted this week by industrial action, including an overtime ban which continues on Friday. Members of the train drivers' union Aslef walked out on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, prompting widespread cancellations. The six-day overtime ban, which started on Bank Holiday Monday and runs until Saturday, will continue to have an impact on some services. Drivers from 16 train operating companies staged walkouts on different days this week. The services affected included LNER, Northern Trains and TransPennine Express, c2c, Greater Anglia, Great Northern, Thameslink, Southeastern, Southern/Gatwick Express, South Western Railway main line and Island Line, Avanti West Coast, Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Great Western Railway and West Midlands Trains. The overtime ban also means drivers have not been accepting any extra shifts, which they say are crucial to the smooth running of the rail network. National Rail said train timetables were likely to be affected. Passengers are advised tocheck before they travel.,external Rail passengers with advance tickets can get refunds if the train they are booked on is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled due to strikes.â¯â¯ If passengers have a return ticket they may also be entitled to a fee-free refund if part of the journey is cancelled. Season ticket holders (flexi, monthly or longer) who cannot travel, canclaim 100% compensation for strike dates,external. Aslef, the train drivers' union, is seeking better pay for its members. It says drivers are being asked to accept worse working conditions in exchange for a wage increase. Strike action began in July 2022 but no formal talks have taken place between the two sides since April 2023, when the most recent pay deal was rejected. The offer, described as ""risible"" by Aslef, included 4% pay rises two years in a row, on the condition drivers accepted changes to training and negotiated new work patterns. Train operators say ways of working need to change for wages to rise, because of the financial challenges they are facing and to ensure fairness to taxpayers. The body which negotiates on behalf of the rail companies, the Rail Delivery Group, says it continues to ""seek a fair agreement"". Unions need to re-ballot members every six months to see if they want to continue with industrial action. Currently, unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. In November last year, RMT members, including guards and ticket office staff,voted to accept a pay offer. This included a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022-23 and job security guarantees. Talks over future pay deals and working practices will continue. A new law meanstrain companies can require enough staff to work on strike daysto run 40% of services. The Department for Transport said it expects employers to use minimum service levels ""if appropriate to do so, and to deliver the best possible service"". PM 'disappointed' as new rail strike law not used However, industry insiders told the BBC that applying the new rules was complicated. One source said it meant co-ordinating a reduced timetable with other operators in a short space of time. The Rail Delivery Group, a membership organisation of Britain's train operating companies, said the minimum services levels law was a potential tool but not a ""silver bullet"". Unions strongly oppose it. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says median pay for ""train and tram drivers"" is just under Â£59,000. Train companies and the government say the offer rejected by Aslef would take average train driver pay to Â£65,000. The average salary of rail workers in 2022 was Â£45,919,according to the ONS.,external If drivers are excluded (because they tend to be members of the Aslef union, not RMT) its estimate is Â£39,518. However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff. Will you be affected by the strikes?

"The government is planning to introduce legislation this week to make it legal for employers to bring in agency staff to replace striking workers. The new law is likely to come into force in mid-July and would not impact train strikes taking place this week. A government source told the BBC the change was needed because ""unions are threatening action across the economy"". However, the Trades Union Congress argue it would undermine the right to strike and create safety risks. The plan has also been opposed by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, which represents the recruitment industry. Speaking to the BBC's World at One, the organisation's head Neil Carberry said many large recruitment companies had signed up to a global commitment not to replace striking workers and that agency workers would not choose ""to cross a picket line"" because they could find work elsewhere. He added that there was ""cold fury"" in the industry because of a lack of consultation about the planned change. Huge rail strike will cause 'misery for millions' How much are rail workers paid? When is the rail strike and which trains are running? Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has previously argued that changing the law would ensure the country was not ""held to ransom"" in the future. Under the government's plan, any employer - public as well as private employers including schools, councils and the NHS - would have flexibility to bring in outside staff to cover striking workers. It would be an employer's choice whether to do so. Paul Nowak, deputy secretary general of the Trades Union Congress - the umbrella body for unions, said: ""Allowing agency staff to replace striking workers would undermine the right to strike and create genuine safety risks for the public and for the workforce. ""Having repeatedly promised a high-wage economy, ministers now seem determined to reduce workers' bargaining power and to make it harder for working people to win fair pay and conditions."" Labour's shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds accused the Conservatives of ""driving down the rights and pay of hard working people"". The Conservatives have also promised to introduce a law which would ""require that a minimum service operates during transport strikes"". However, there is currently no date for this legislation which would affect the railways and other key industries. On Saturday protesters marched in London demanding a pay rise for public sector workers The agency workers announcement comes as barristers - represented by the Criminal Bar Association - voted to take industrial action over pay and conditions. And two teaching unions are also considering asking their members if they want to strike over pay. Prices in the UK are expected to rise by 11% in the next few months and the TUC has argued that workers need to cope with cost increases. However, Treasury Minister Simon Clarke has warned that public sector workers should not expect ""inflation-busting pay increases"" that could risk fuelling the ""evil of inflation"". ""If we give awards which are above inflation in this landscape, then we are in a really difficult place in terms of bringing down inflation, which in turn obviously is driving the cost of living.""

"Five bids have been submitted to create green freeports in Scotland. Ministers want to create two special economic zones north of the border, under a scheme agreed by the Scottish and UK governments. The successful bidders will be able to offer tax incentives and lower tariffs for areas around airports, seaports and rail terminals. The bids received by Monday's deadline came from groups representing various regions. They are: Clyde Green Freeport, Aberdeen City and Peterhead Green Freeport, Opportunity Inverness and Cromarty Firth, Firth of Forth Green Freeport and Orkney Green Freeport. North east Scotland consortium joins green freeport bidders Two green freeports to be established in Scotland What are freeports and where will they be? The bidders must set out how they will regenerate their area, create high-quality jobs and support transition to a net-zero economy. Ministers from both the Scottish and UK governments will have a say in the assessment and selection process. Holyrood Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said: ""We expect green freeports to promote regeneration in the areas selected, create high quality jobs and enhance our decarbonisation plans in the just transition to a net zero economy. ""We will now jointly assess and decide on the winning bids, following the rigorous process set out in the agreed joint prospectus in which each government has an equal say. ""Further details of the successful applicants will be set out in the coming months."" The UK government's Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said: ""UK freeports are a key part of the UK government's Levelling Up strategy - they will bring innovation, high-quality jobs, prosperity and regeneration for the benefit of the whole of Scotland."" Also called free trade zones, they are designated areas where the normal tax and tariff rules of the country in which they are based do not apply. They allow goods to be imported, manufactured and re-exported without being subject to checks, paperwork, or import taxes, known as tariffs. This means raw materials can be imported, then engineered into whole products for export. Typically, companies operating in the zone pay lower taxes, such as reduced VAT and lower rates of employment tax. Critics argue they simply defer the point when import tariffs are paid, which then still need to be paid at some stage. The UK government has committed funding of Â£52m to the project and bidders will have to pledge to reach net zero by 2045. The Scottish government has said that all green freeport applicants would have to stick to their commitments to net-zero targets and fair work. The governments were previously unable to agree plans to establish freeports north of the border,after a number of sites were announced for England. Scottish ministers later saidthey would pursue an alternative ""green freeport"" model, with additional standards around jobs and climate targets. The two winning bids are expected to be announced this summer.

"Primark is to finally sell its clothes online through a new click-and-collect service for children's products. The High Street retailer said 2,000 goods will be offered through a trial which will run out of 25 shops in the north west of England. Until now, Primark has resisted selling its products online unlike other retailers. As a result, the business was hit hard by Covid restrictions while stores were closed. Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth described Primark's move as a ""very big deal"", adding: ""Covid showed the risk of having a store-only estate"". However, the trial is not part of a wider plan to enable all of company's products to be sold online, according to George Weston, chief executive of Primark's parent company, Associated British Foods (ABF). ""What you will never see is the entire Primark range available for click and collect, nor any of it available for home delivery,"" he told the BBC. ""We are using online selling for click and collecting very selectively,"" he added. ""When they come into their local Primark store if they've purchase online, then we hope they will buy something else while they are in store as well."" Ms Shuttleworth said: ""Primark has been looking for the best way to enter the online market, but if you're late to the party - which it is - you need to do it in the most profitable way possible. ""Click-and-collect is simpler to build into your existing operation of shops, you don't need a logistics partner, and returns come straight back into the store."" Mr Weston said delivering orders to people's homes was complex, not good for the environment and a ""really expensive way of fulfilling someone's order"". ABF recently revamped its UK site to give more details of in-store ranges, so customers can browse the full collection and check availability before coming into stores. Primark's sales bounced back when stores reopened after lockdown eased ABF said its new website, which launched in April, saw online traffic rise by around 60%. It said the trial will allow customers who live nearer a smaller Primark store access to a much wider range of items. ""Our average-size stores are only able to stock a limited range and for these customers the number of options available to them will broadly double, increasing even more for customers of our small stores,"" said ABF. ""This trial will enable us to provide more fashion, licence and lifestyle products to more customers and more often."" The group said Primark sales increased by 81% in the three months to the end of May, when compared with last year. All Primark stores were open during the period, unlike last year when most stores were closed until the middle of April due to lockdown restrictions. The chain, which was founded in 1969, has never had an online store nor offered click-and-collect services for its products until now. The firmhas previously said,externalthis is because it would not be able to keep prices for its clothing as low if it offered home delivery. Selling items online can be costly for retailers, who often cover the costs of deliveries and returns as a way of winning customers from rivals. It also takes longer for warehouse staff to process returned stock. Last week,Asos warned that full-year profits will fall sharplyas customers returned more items, whileZara recently started charging shoppersfor online returns. While Primark suffered from its lack of online presence during the lockdowns,sales quickly recovered when stores reopened in April 2021. A senior executive at the firm recently told the BBC that the pandemic had ""accelerated"" changes that were already taking place between the high street and online. However, John Bason, finance director at Primark's parent company ABF, said he is confident that the High Street does have a future. ""Even though we were closed probably six months for the two main years of the pandemic, our customers have come back to us. That I think is very very striking,"" he added. ""So no, I think the demise of the High Street is way overstated, but it is changing. There's no doubt over it.""

"Four Tet's best songs include Butterflies, Two Thousand and Seventeen, and Lush Pioneering electronic artist Four Tet has reached a settlement in the legal battle against his former record label. The musician, whose real name is Kieran Hebden, sued Domino Records last year over the royalties he gets paid when his music is downloaded or streamed. He argued that the 13.5% royalty rate he was being offered was unfair, and demanded a 50% split with the label. In a settlement, Domino agreed to the honour the 50% rate and reimbursed the musician for historic underpayments. It was quite a reversal for the indie label, which originally responded to the case by removing several Four Tet albums from streaming services (they were later reinstated). ""It has been a difficult and stressful experience to work my way through this court case and I'm so glad we got this positive result,"" wrote Hebden in a statement announcing the settlement. ""Hopefully I've opened up a constructive dialogue and maybe prompted others to push for a fairer deal on historical contracts, written at a time when the music industry operated entirely differently."" The result could set a legal precedent for contract disputes in the music business; where royalty rates have been subject to heavy scrutiny since last year'sinquiry into the streaming market by MPs on the Culture Select Committee. However, Four Tet's legal challenge was ultimately decided out of court, so any future disputes would not be able to cite a legal judgement. ""Neither the courts, nor the settlement terms, have made any determination as to how streaming should be categorised or streaming income split,"" said Domino Records in a statement, adding it was ""pleased"" that Hebden had chosen to settle the case on ""financial terms first offered to him in November 2021"".

The dispute concerned the recording contract Hebden signed with Domino in 2001, which resulted in four albums: Pause (2001), Rounds (2003), Everything Ecstatic (2005) and There Is Love In You (2010). The deal was signed before the advent of downloads of streams - and his dispute hinged on whether those methods of accessing his music could be defined as a ""sale"" or a ""licence"" under the terms of his contract. The difference is far from academic because most artists receive 50% of the royalties for a licence but a much lower figure, typically between 12% and 22%, for a sale. Historically, the difference was due to the way music was distributed: selling music in the era of CDs, vinyl and cassettes incurred huge costs in manufacturing and distribution, which meant labels needed to cover their overheads. But when music is licensed to movies, television or advertisements, artists generally get a bigger payday, on the understanding that a third party is bearing the relevant costs. After the advent of iTunes and Spotify, labels often argued that downloads and streams should  be counted as sales. This prompted a flurry of lawsuits, especially in the US. Most famously,the producers who discovered Eminem won a case against Universal Records,externalthat forced the label to pay the higher ""licensing"" rate when his songs were downloaded. Four Tet's case in the UK essentially made the same argument. Domino had argued that digital downloads, including streams, were considered a new technology format and Hebden was only entitled to the 13.5% royalty rate (although they have paid him as much as 18% on a discretionary basis). The case quickly became complicated, with Hebden adding a claim for breach of contract after Domino withdrew his music from streaming services; and Domino saying they may to take the case to the High Court, which Hebden could not afford. However, in a statement posted on social media today, Hebden said he had been offered the 50% rate he had sought in a settlement, the details of which were made public. Allow Twitter content?

""Domino have now agreed to treat streaming and download income as licensing income and will apply the 50% rate to streaming and download income going forward, and have reimbursed Kieran for the underpayment over recent years,"" said his lawyer, Aneesh Patel, in a statement. ""I really hope that my own course of action encourages anyone who might feel intimidated by challenging a record label with substantial means,"" added Hebden. ""Unlike Domino, I didn't work with a big law firm and luckily the case took place in the IPEC [Intellectual Property and Enterprise court] where legal costs are capped, so I was able to stand my ground."" Hebden shared images of the settlement, which showed that he would receive Â£56,921.08 in respect of all historical streaming and download income, dated back to July 2017, in addition to interest calculated at a rate of 5% per year. In a statement to the BBC, Domino added: ""Kieran's claim arose from differing interpretations of specific clauses in a contract entered into by Kieran and Domino in 2001 in the pre-streaming era, and the application of those clauses to streaming income. ""Since 2021 Kieran has added to and pursued his claim despite numerous attempts by Domino to settle the matter.

"Barristers last walked out over Legal Aid in 2014 Criminal barristers have voted to strike in an escalating dispute with the government over funding for trials. The vote by defence barristers is likely to cause chaos in the criminal courts in England and Wales. Eight out of 10 barristers voted for the walkouts amid concerns the government will not improve a proposed increase in criminal Legal Aid. The Legal Aid system is at the heart of justice - ensuring that all defendants get proper and fair representation. An independent review of the future of the system, ordered by the government, told ministers they needed to increase funding by at least 15% to prevent a major crisis in criminal justice. Barristers say much more is needed to stop an exodus from criminal law to other branches of the profession. Over the last decade the number of lawyers working in criminal justice - both barristers who appear before judges in court and solicitors who instruct them - has declined, as many say they cannot make a living anymore. That loss of criminal barristers is reflected in the current court backlogs which show that many prosecutions are being delayed because of a shortage of representatives to make sure hearings can go ahead. Announcing the strike, the Criminal Bar Association said of the 2,055 of its members who had voted, 80% had backed court walkouts from Monday 27 June. In practice, that means that defence barristers will refuse to work - including taking on new cases - meaning judges will be forced to delay hearings and put back trials. Under the plan, the number of days that defence barristers will refuse to work will increase week-on-week until a pause at the end of July - and then a resumption of the action on the same pattern. This video can not be played Two young lawyers share their concerns about the profession In a joint statement, Jo Sidhu QC and Kirsty Brimelow QC, chair and vice chair respectively of the association, said the ""extraordinary"" result ""reflects a recognition amongst criminal barristers at all levels that what is at stake is the survival of a profession of specialist criminal advocates and of the criminal justice system"". ""Without immediate action to halt the exodus of criminal barristers from our ranks, the record backlog that has crippled our courts will continue to inflict misery upon victims and defendants alike, and the public will be betrayed,"" they added. Courts Minister James Cartlidge said the result was ""disappointing"" and the proposed action did not represent a majority of those who had voted. Under the association's ballot, more than 80% backed some form of strike action. The greatest level of support, 43%, was for strikes plus a refusal to take on new Legal Aid work. ""The 15% pay increase we consulted on would mean a typical criminal barrister earning around Â£7,000 extra per year and only last week I confirmed we are moving as quickly as possible to introduce fee rises by the end of September,"" said the minister. ""We encourage the Criminal Bar Association to work with us, rather than escalate to unnecessary strike action, as it will only serve to harm victims as they are forced to wait longer for justice."" The Legal Aid rules set limits on fees For 13 hours, a solicitor would earn around Â£250 - an hourly rate of almost Â£20 When it comes to court, some barristers say the time they spend preparing cases means their hourly earnings are below minimum wage The Law Society hasmapped the loss of criminal solicitors,externalnationwide In comparison, the website Checkatrade says theaverage day rate,externalof a plumber is now almost Â£350 - although there are obviously regional differences Lawyers who work in other areas, such as private corporate law, can expect to earn Â£100,000 a year from very early in their careers. Next Monday will see barristers rally at a number of high-profile courts that manage the most important cases in the country - including the Old Bailey, Birmingham, Manchester and Bristol Crown Courts. Across England and Wales, efforts by the government to reduce court case backlogs from a historic high - caused partly by the pandemic and partly by preceding cuts - have moved slowly. The latest figures, up to April 2022, show there were 358,076 outstanding cases at magistrates' courts and 58,271 at crown courts. However, delays vary hugely depending on the crime - with victims of rape and other serious sexual offenceswaiting the longest for prosecutions to be completed.

"Around 30 flights carrying up to 5,000 passengers have been cancelled at Heathrow Airport due to technical issues affecting baggage. The airport asked airlines to cut 10% of flights from schedules across terminals two and three on Monday. It comes after problems at baggage reclaim areas, with images of luggage being piled up high emerging last week. Elsewhere, EasyJet announced plans to cut 7% of its 160,000 flights scheduled between July and September. The move came after Gatwick, EasyJet's main airport, said itwill reduce the number of flights taking off from its airportduring the peak summer season because of staff shortages. Tens of thousands of passengers have been hit by airport disruption and flight cancellations in recent weeks. The BBC understands some airlines might be able to combine flights at Heathrow meaning some passengers will not have their journeys postponed. Heathrow said cutting the number of flights would ""minimise"" the impact of the technical issues affecting baggage systems. ""We apologise unreservedly for the disruption passengers have faced over the course of this weekend,"" the company said. British Airways, which operates from terminals three and five, told the BBC it had made a ""small number of cancellations"" as a result of the airport's request. It understood BA will be able to re-accommodate the vast majority of customers onto new flights. Hundreds of flights across the UK were cancelled during the week of the Platinum Jubilee and half-term holidays, and concerns have been raised of further travel woes during the summer. The disruption has been caused by several factors, but staff shortages has left the aviation industry struggling to cope with resurgent demand. As well as Gatwick, EasyJet also confirmed there would be flight cancellations at other airports across the airline's network including Amsterdam's Schiphol hub but it has not yet worked out a precise number. Last week, Schiphol said it would cap the number of passengers allowed at the airport over summer, leading to a 16% fall in planned flights. EasyJet said customers would be given advance notice and the potential to rebook onto alternative flights. It added many would be able to rebook on the same day they had originally planned to travel. What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Bags pile up at Heathrow after malfunction It said in recent weeks the sector had experienced an ""unprecedented ramp-up"" in demand for travel, with April and May passenger numbers reaching seven times higher than same months last year. EasyJet's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said the airline would usually operate about 160,000 flights during the summer months. He apologised that the company ""had not been able to deliver the service"" that customers ""have come to expect from us"". ""I can't tell you how many flights will be impacted,"" he said. ""It would be misleading for me to give any numbers today because we simply don't know."" The airline said it was cancelling the flights to build additional resilience in the face of operational issues including staff shortages in ground handling and at airports as well as air traffic control delays. ""Coupled with airport caps, we are taking pre-emptive actions to increase resilience over the balance of summer, including a range of further flight consolidations in the affected airports, giving advance notice to customers and we expect the vast majority to be rebooked on alternative flights within 24 hours,"" Mr Lundgren added. If your flight is cancelled, you have the right to either a full refund, or a replacement flight. ""And that different flight does not need to be with the same carrier - it can be an alternative, as long it flies on the same day,"" says Julia Lo Bue-Said, CEO of Advantage Travel Partnership. If you and the airline can't agree on a new flight, it will refund you. If the flight was cancelled with 14 days or less notice, you may also be entitled to compensation - but only if the airline is at fault. ""If it's a direct result of the airline, you're entitled to compensation, but if it's the airport, your compensation doesn't kick in,"" says Mrs Lo Bue-Said. He said EasyJet was trying to recruit from a tighter labour market, but added the main problem wasn't numbers but the time it was taking identity checks to be processed so people are able to work. ""It's been slow to get people in the system, not so much the fact we have been struggling to recruit,"" he said. However, Mr Lundgren said the company was having to ""turn down EU applications"" for jobs because of Brexit, which had also contributed to the smaller pool of potential workers. ""We turned down 8,000 applicants from the EU,"" he said, which equates to 40% of all people applying for jobs at the airline. ""I'm not blaming... but of course it has an impact. It's just smaller, it's just maths,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said the government was ""committed to building a robust and dependable domestic aviation industry"" and added it launched a skills scheme last year to ""help develop, and hold onto, UK talent"". ""We are absolutely focused on seeing an end to the disruption at airports and will continue to work with industry. But as the Transport Secretary has made clear, it is not obvious that reaching for the lever marked 'more immigration' will solve the problem,"" they added. They also suggested that changes in the law following Brexit had afforded the sector more flexibility when training new employees. Airlines have been blamed in recent weeks for taking more bookings than they can manage following steep staff cuts during the height of Covid when travel ground to a halt. But industry leaders have argued the government could have done more to support the sector during the pandemic. Following a wave of cancellations and delays at airports, the DfT and the Civil Aviation Authority wrote to airlines telling them to review their schedules and to cancel flights that could not be delivered ""at the earliest possibility"".

"Marine Le Pen's party went from eight seats to 89 in Sunday's election They were the big winners of France's elections, tearing apart President Emmanuel Macron's majority. The broad left-wing alliance under Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon and Marine Le Pen's far right were described as a pincer movement from the extremes by our Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield. They are poles apart but have largely the same ambition of opposing the centrist Macron government. For veteran far-left leader Mr MÃ©lenchon the success of the New Ecological and Social Popular Union (Nupes) was in achieving the ""total rout"" of an ""arrogant"" president in less than a month. Winning 131 seats was a substantial achievement and he took his own France Unbowed (LFI) party from 17 seats to 79. But opinion polls had suggested Nupes could win far more and even its leader felt the results were ""rather disappointing"". He had adopted the slogan ""MÃ©lenchon, prime minister"", and there is no chance of that happening now even if he swears he is not leaving politics. He is no longer an elected MP and it is too early to say whether his alliance of mainstream Socialists and Greens with the far-left LFI and Communists will survive in the long term. He has called for Nupes to become a single political grouping in the Assembly, but that's been met with a chorus of derision from the Socialists, Greens and Communists. ""There was never any question of one single group,"" said Socialist MP Pierre Jouvet. The surprise of the elections was the success of Marine Le Pen's far right National Rally, which increased its presence in the Assembly tenfold. A look at the dark blue areas on the map shows how far they have spread from their strongholds in the deep south and Pas de Calais in the north. Their success in 89 seats came even though Ms Le Pen was barely visible on the campaign trail in the two weeks before the vote. And it was unexpected because traditionally her party never does well in Assembly elections due to a so-called republican front - when mainstream voters' parties pull together to stop extreme forces winning. What changed this time was that the far right won more than half of its 108 run-offs with the Macron alliance Ensemble. ""Yesterday the republican front died at a local level,"" said Mathieu Gallard of pollsters Ipsos. Supporters of both left and far right loathed ""Macronism"" so much that they stopped voting against each other, he said. That gives Marine Le Pen an unprecedented chance to influence politics in the National Assembly and, unlike Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon, she has decided to lead the party's biggest ever group of MPs. National Rally MP Laurent Jacobelli said the Assembly had changed its face and would no longer be filled with a team of pro-Macron ""yes-men"" ready to accept his every proposal. ""We will be a determined, constructive opposition,"" he said. Ungovernable? France takes stock after Macron blow Both parties aim to resist the president's programme of reforms, although National Rally has said it may back measures to alleviate the cost of living crisis if their own proposals are adopted. Where the two parties are united is in opposition to the president's bid to raise gradually the retirement age from 62 to 65. The far right wants to keep it as it is, and Nupes wants to bring the pension age down to 60.

"From September, the first primary school children in Wales will begin receiving free school dinners Reception class children in Wales will get free school meals from September - the first in a rollout for all primary school pupils. All the country's approximately272,000 primary school pupils,externalare set to get free lunches by 2024. It ispart of a dealbetween Plaid Cymru and the Labour Welsh government. Because ofthe cost of living crisis, ministers said they were working with local authorities to ensure it was started as quickly as possible. A total of Â£225m has been set aside to pay for it over the next three years. From September, Wales' 22 local authorities will begin receiving the money, with pupils aged four and five the first to get their free lunches. Claire, from Newport, who is mum of seven-year-old Flynn, toldRadio Wales Breakfastthat free meals would be a ""boost"" to many families. Claire said she feels that as children get older some can be singled out for receiving free school meals ""When you look at the child poverty in Wales, I think this initiative is very important,"" she said. ""There are so many families just above the threshold of receiving free school meals at the moment, and I'm sure they will welcome this, any extra money is a godsend in these times."" She added that as children got older, becoming singled out for receiving free school meals was a real problem. ""The peer pressure starts to come with what games consoles they have and what holidays they go on, and then of course school meals will be something they talk about. ""That becomes a topic of conversation, for good and for bad."" Dilys Ellis-Jones, head teacher of Ysgol OM Edwards in Llanuwchllyn, Gwynedd, said: ""We're very pleased with the news. ""Families are facing tough times with everyday costs of living. So for these families to be able to have free school meals is great news. These days no child should go hungry in school or come to school hungry."" The scheme is seen as a key part of helping people during the cost of living crisis Owen Evans, chief executive of the Children in Wales group, added: ""We would always like to see free school meals or payments reach as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. ""But I think within the constraints and the context we are very pleased to see a time-frame put forward that commences this process and makes sure that this financial year some people in Wales will begin benefiting from this policy."" Laura Doel, NAHT Cymru director, supports the policy but said the implementation has been ""quite rushed"" and that some schools are ""struggling with the ambitious timetable"". ""There's been a range of challenges from the supply chain to the infrastructure at the school,"" she added. ""If those conversations had taken place with local authorities before the announcement of a national provision maybe some of those issues could have been ironed out sooner."" Conservatives in the Senedd are opposed to the expansion of free school meals. Education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said the government should ""focus their resources on the students that need it most"". Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, called it an ""extremely welcome development that should go some way towards addressing the extremely high child poverty rates in Wales"". Years 1 and 2 are due to get them from April 2023 ahead of the full implementation in the 2023-24 school year. In England, children from Reception to Year 2 are entitled to a free school meal, but beyond that point it is means-tested. No school dinners if child's debt is 2p, says head Bleak school Christmas lunch photo goes viral ""No child should ever be at school hungry,"" said Education Minister Jeremy Miles. ""Given the pressure so many families are under with the increases in the cost of living we are absolutely committed to taking practical measures to support our children and young people. Free school lunches are part of a deal reached between Labour and Plaid Cymru ""Younger children are more likely to be living in relative income poverty, so we are starting with a decent free school meal for children in reception from September, with most children in Year 1 and Year 2 also getting free school meals by next April."" Plaid Cymru's Sian Gwenllian called it a ""significant intervention"" that would ""make a real difference now and in the future"". ""Not only in terms of tackling child hunger and child poverty, but to progress our wider goals of local food production and supporting local economies,"" she said. ""This ambitious undertaking will be life-changing for many and a significant help to families across the country."" Ms Jones said: ""The priority now should be making sure that young people get back on track with their education following the pandemic, getting pupils back into school as Welsh children had the most missed school days over the last two years. ""The Welsh government also needs to explain how they're going to get Wales off the bottom of the education league tables and end the underfunding of our pupils - where Welsh children are Â£1,000 worse off compared to other parts of the UK.""

"Ukraine is usually a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called Africa ""a hostage"" of Russia's war during an address to the African Union (AU) on Monday. Russia's invasion, and its blockade of Ukraine's grain exports, have sparked grain and fertiliser shortages and put millions of people at risk of hunger. The chair of the AU commission said there was an ""urgent need for dialogue"" to restore global stability. Western countries have urged Russia to release Ukraine's vast grain stores. The blockade has sent food prices soaring. ""Africa is actually a hostage... of those who unleashed war against our state"", Mr Zelensky said in his speech. He said his government was engaged in ""complex negotiations"" to unblock grain reserves trapped in Ukraine's Black Sea ports. ""This war may seem very distant to you and your countries,"" he told the AU. ""But the food prices that are catastrophically rising have already brought [the war] to the homes of millions of African families."" Mr Zelensky's AU speech comes nearly 10 weeks after he first asked to address the continental body. The BBC understands that 55 heads of state were invited to the virtual session, but only four attended. The rest of the countries sent representatives. African countries have been divided in their response to Russia's war in Ukraine. In March, 17 African countries abstained in a UN vote to condemn the invasion. But on Monday,AU's chairperson Macky Sall thanked,externalMr Zelensky for addressing the union. Mr Sall said that ""Africa remains committed to respecting the rules of international law, the peaceful resolution of conflicts and freedom of trade"". Initially, the AU did not want to be addressed by Mr Zelensky, and it does not fully agree with what he's saying - they want dialogue to solve the crisis, as they always have. Earlier this month, Mr Sall held talks with Russia President Vladimir Putin. He told Mr Putin that African countries are innocent victims of the war in Ukraine and Russia should help ease their suffering. Is Russia exporting grain from Ukraine? Ukraine calls for safe passage for grain exports Ukraine war: WTO boss warns of global food crisis Food prices across African countries have rocketed, meanwhile millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports Earlier on Monday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said of Russia's blockade: ""This is a real war crime, so I cannot imagine that this will last much longer."" Mr Borrell met EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday to discuss the crisis. He described Moscow's actions as ""a deliberate attempt to create hunger in the world"". He rejected Russia's claim that the current food crisis is a result of EU sanctions, adding that they ""don't forbid"" countries outside the EU from conducting food trade with Russia or other nations. French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said that ""Russia must stop playing with global hunger"" as it seeks leverage over the West. ""Leaving cereals blocked is dangerous for stability in the world,"" she said. The head of the Polish prime minister's office, Michal Dworczyk, spoke with Ukraine's infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov about changes that will speed up checks for trucks on the Polish-Ukrainian border to help export more grain from Ukraine.

"Barristers last walked out over Legal Aid in 2014 Criminal barristers have voted to strike in an escalating dispute with the government over funding for trials. The vote by defence barristers is likely to cause chaos in the criminal courts in England and Wales. Eight out of 10 barristers voted for the walkouts amid concerns the government will not improve a proposed increase in criminal Legal Aid. The Legal Aid system is at the heart of justice - ensuring that all defendants get proper and fair representation. An independent review of the future of the system, ordered by the government, told ministers they needed to increase funding by at least 15% to prevent a major crisis in criminal justice. Barristers say much more is needed to stop an exodus from criminal law to other branches of the profession. Over the last decade the number of lawyers working in criminal justice - both barristers who appear before judges in court and solicitors who instruct them - has declined, as many say they cannot make a living anymore. That loss of criminal barristers is reflected in the current court backlogs which show that many prosecutions are being delayed because of a shortage of representatives to make sure hearings can go ahead. Announcing the strike, the Criminal Bar Association said of the 2,055 of its members who had voted, 80% had backed court walkouts from Monday 27 June. In practice, that means that defence barristers will refuse to work - including taking on new cases - meaning judges will be forced to delay hearings and put back trials. Under the plan, the number of days that defence barristers will refuse to work will increase week-on-week until a pause at the end of July - and then a resumption of the action on the same pattern. This video can not be played Two young lawyers share their concerns about the profession In a joint statement, Jo Sidhu QC and Kirsty Brimelow QC, chair and vice chair respectively of the association, said the ""extraordinary"" result ""reflects a recognition amongst criminal barristers at all levels that what is at stake is the survival of a profession of specialist criminal advocates and of the criminal justice system"". ""Without immediate action to halt the exodus of criminal barristers from our ranks, the record backlog that has crippled our courts will continue to inflict misery upon victims and defendants alike, and the public will be betrayed,"" they added. Courts Minister James Cartlidge said the result was ""disappointing"" and the proposed action did not represent a majority of those who had voted. Under the association's ballot, more than 80% backed some form of strike action. The greatest level of support, 43%, was for strikes plus a refusal to take on new Legal Aid work. ""The 15% pay increase we consulted on would mean a typical criminal barrister earning around Â£7,000 extra per year and only last week I confirmed we are moving as quickly as possible to introduce fee rises by the end of September,"" said the minister. ""We encourage the Criminal Bar Association to work with us, rather than escalate to unnecessary strike action, as it will only serve to harm victims as they are forced to wait longer for justice."" The Legal Aid rules set limits on fees For 13 hours, a solicitor would earn around Â£250 - an hourly rate of almost Â£20 When it comes to court, some barristers say the time they spend preparing cases means their hourly earnings are below minimum wage The Law Society hasmapped the loss of criminal solicitors,externalnationwide In comparison, the website Checkatrade says theaverage day rate,externalof a plumber is now almost Â£350 - although there are obviously regional differences Lawyers who work in other areas, such as private corporate law, can expect to earn Â£100,000 a year from very early in their careers. Next Monday will see barristers rally at a number of high-profile courts that manage the most important cases in the country - including the Old Bailey, Birmingham, Manchester and Bristol Crown Courts. Across England and Wales, efforts by the government to reduce court case backlogs from a historic high - caused partly by the pandemic and partly by preceding cuts - have moved slowly. The latest figures, up to April 2022, show there were 358,076 outstanding cases at magistrates' courts and 58,271 at crown courts. However, delays vary hugely depending on the crime - with victims of rape and other serious sexual offenceswaiting the longest for prosecutions to be completed.

"Rules on so-called buy now pay later (BNPL) loans will be tightened up, the government says - including new guidelines on advertising and checks to ensure customers can afford to pay. Apple has said it plans to launch a buy now pay later option for users of Apple Pay, initially in the US. But critics say BNPL schemes encourage people to spend beyond their means. The loans - used by 15 million people in the UK in 2021 - are typically spread over a number of payments. Although the instalments are interest free - BNPL companies make money from the retailer, usually taking a cut from sales - there may be additional charges if customers miss payments. The main operators offering the service in the UK are Klarna, Clearpay, Laybuy and PayPal. In September 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) commissioned a review of BNPL schemes, which recommended the industry should be regulated. A recent survey by Citizens Advice suggested many consumers were using credit cards and other forms of debt to make payments. The charity heard from 2,288 people who had used buy now pay later during the past 12 months. It found that 52% made repayments from their current account, but 23% used a credit card, 9% used a bank overdraft and 7% borrowed from friends and family. In March it found that that young people, people in debt and people claiming Universal Credit, were at least twice as likely to have used BNPL to cover essentials such as food and toiletries, than other groups. Under plansset out by the government,external: Lenders will be required to carry out checks to ensure that loans are affordable for consumers, Advertisements must be fair, clear and not misleading. Lenders will need to be approved by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Borrowers will be be able to take complaints about BNPL schemes to the Financial Ombudsman Service. The government said other forms of short-term interest-free credit, such as those used to pay for dental work or larger items like furniture, will be required to comply with the same rules. In a statement accompanying the proposals, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, John Glen said: ""We are protecting consumers and fostering the safe growth of this innovative market in the UK."" But the proposals will not come into force for at least a year, with legislation scheduled for mid-2023, after which the FCA will consult on new rules. Alex Marsh, Head of Klarna UK, said he welcomed the new rules - telling the BBC the company already checked customers could afford to pay - and called for them to be brought in sooner. ""We urge the Government to move quicker than planned to implement regulation which gives additional protections to consumers from both irresponsible, unregulated BNPL providers and traditional banks disguising high interest products as 'BNPL'."" Citizens Advice also called for faster action: ""The buy now pay later sector continues to grow at a meteoric rate, but it could now remain unregulated for years,"" Dame Clare Moriarty, its chief executive wrote. She called on the government to ""turbo-charge"" its plans, and protect consumers sooner.

"This video can not be played Watch: Mick Lynch, RMT general-secretary: ""This dispute has been manufactured by Shapps"" Passengers in England, Scotland and Wales face severe disruption after last-ditch talks failed to stop the biggest rail strikes in 30 years. Thousands of staff at Network Rail and 13 rail operators are due to walk out on Tuesday, affecting most major lines. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT rail union, blamed the ""dead hand"" of government, saying ministers did not allow employers to negotiate freely. The transport secretary said ""outdated unions"" were ""opposing progress"". Grant Shapps said about 20% of services were expected to run during the strikes on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, focusing on key workers, main population centres and critical freight routes. Services are expected to be affected from Monday evening, with disruption continuing on non-strike days this week. This video can not be played WATCH: Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps speaking in the House of Commons: ""Strikes created by the unions"" The RMT, which represents rail workers ranging from catering staff to signallers, is calling for a pay rise of at least 7%. The union said employers have only offered 2%, with the possibility of 1% more, on the condition that workers accept proposed job cuts and changes to working practices. Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said ""no strike is inevitable until the moment it begins"", but urged passengers to travel by train only if necessary. Aspecial train timetable,externalfor 20 to 26 June was published on Friday. A strike willalso take place across the London Underground on Tuesday. Live: Train strikes to go ahead after last-ditch talks fail Which lines will be affected by the strike? How much are rail workers paid? Talks were held on Monday afternoon to avert the strikes but the sides remained deadlocked, Mr Lynch said, accusing the government of interfering to prevent a deal. ""What we've come to understand is the dead hand of this Tory government is all over this dispute and the fingerprints of Grant Shapps and the DNA of [chancellor] Rishi Sunak are all over the problems on the railway,"" he said. ""Until they allow these employers to negotiate freely I can't see we're going to get a resolution."" He said staff were faced with thousands of job cuts, reduced pensions, worse terms and conditions, and a cut in real-terms pay as inflation soars. Mr Lynch said there was also a plan to close every ticket office in Britain. The Department for Transport said no final decision had been made, but said it was ""absurd"" to suggest it wanted to close every booking office. 'I'm set to lose hundreds thanks to rail strikes' The transport secretary has denied the government intervened in the dispute, saying ""no minsters have ever been involved directly in these strike negotiations"" and only the employers and union could reach an agreement. In the House of Commons, Mr Shapps said the government could no longer tolerate rail unions using their right to strike ""without any regard for how the rights of others are disrupted"". He said minimum service legislation, which requires train companies to maintain a base level of service even during strikes, was part of the solution. The short answer to this is yes. The transport secretary says he does not want to get involved in a dispute between the RMT on one side and Network Rail and the train operating companies (TOCs) on the other, but the interaction between the two employers means the government has a pivotal role. According to government officials, Network Rail is in theory able to offer a higher pay settlement than the 3% they are currently offering by shuffling their large and complex overall budget. However, the government accepts that any pay offer to Network Rail employees would set the bar for a settlement for the train operating companies. Since the government is now also standing as the financial backstop to the Covid-ravaged train operating companies, that could frustrate its stated ambition of putting the rail industry on a sustainable financial footing given that revenues for the train companies are still languishing just above half their pre-pandemic levels. The government may not be in the room but it is at the table. Mr Shapps told MPs rail unions were preventing the industry from updating ""obsolete working practices"", such as voluntary Sunday working - which he blamed for the cancellation of 170 trains before the Euro 2020 final last year. He said it was ""factually incorrect"" to say the strike is about a pay freeze and said reforms for the railways would include a ""decent annual pay rise"" for staff. ""It's about outdated unions opposing progress, progress that will secure the future of the railway,"" he said. Addressing union members directly, he said: ""Your union bosses have got you striking under false pretences and, rather than protecting your jobs, they are actually endangering them and the railway's future."" Labour said that if the strikes go ahead, they will represent a ""catastrophic failure of leadership"" by ministers. Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said of Mr Shapps: ""Not only has he been boycotting the talks, he's tied the hands of those at the table."" She said Mr Shapps had not given train operating companies ""any mandate to negotiate"" and the talks were ""a sham, because ministers have set them up to fail"". Network Rail says the last trains between many major cities are expected to depart over the course of Monday afternoon, before more than 40,000 rail workers walk out. The strike begins at 00:01 BST on Tuesday. Although ScotRail and Transport for Wales are not involved in the dispute, train services will be disrupted as the railways rely on Network Rail staff. ScotRailsaid 90% of trains will be cancelledduring the three days of strike action. The reduced timetable will be in place until Sunday, with just 20% of usual services running on strike days. Trains that do run will start later and finish much earlier than usual - between 07:30 and 18:30. South Western Railway,externalsaid it will run a ""severely reduced timetable"" on strike days, with significant sections of the network closed and a very limited service between 07:15 and 18:30 BST on some routes for those who have to travel. Great Western Railway,externalwill only operate 30% of its usual timetabled services on strike days and about 50% on non-strike days. West Midlands Railway,external, which will run a limited service on a small number of routes, urged customers to travel only if it is essential and if ""no other transport option is available"". Knock-on disruption is expected on the roads, with motorists being warned to expected a surge in traffic. Motoring group the AA says drivers in Scotland and Wales should expect to face long queues as most railway lines will be closed. The M74, M8 and A9 in Scotland and the M4, A55, A5, and A483 in Wales could see severe traffic, it says. The RAC says major city routes and those serving the home counties are likely to see some of the biggest increases in traffic volumes. The strikes will affect a number of events including school exams and thefirst Glastonbury Festival for three years. Can I get a refund?Yes, if you cannot get your train due to strike action. Season-ticket holders can apply for a refund for the days affected. Find more infohere,external. Do I have to go to work or school?This is up to your individual employer or school, check with them. How can I plan my train journey?Use theNational Rail journey planner,external. Read morehere. Leaders at 13 trade unions and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) have jointly written to Mr Shapps urging him to ""help deliver a fair resolution"". The Labour Party has also called on the government to step in. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said nobody took strike action lightly but argued low-paid rail staff such as caterers and cleaners had been left with ""no other option"". ""It's insulting to ask them to take yet another real-terms pay cut when rail companies took Â£500m in profits during the pandemic,"" she said. Rail Delivery Group chair Steve Montgomery said that passenger numbers were at 80% of pre-pandemic levels and the industry wanted to give ""a fair deal on pay while taking no more than its fair share from taxpayers"". Meanwhile,under new legislation the government is expectedto introduce this week, employers would be able to replace striking workers with agency staff. The new law, which is likely to come into force from mid-July, has been criticised by the Trades Union Congress and the recruitment industry for undermining the right to strike and creating safety risks.

"The UK's energy regulator has announced plans to better protect customers who pay their bills through direct debit. Ofgem accused some firms of using customers' accumulated credit like an ""interest-free company credit card"". Proposals include tightening the rules on the level of direct debits that suppliers can charge to ""ensure credit balances do not become excessive"". Ofgem also wants to protect credit balances when suppliers fail so the costs are not picked up by customers. It come after a string of high profile closures linked to high wholesale oil and gas costs, made worse by the war in Ukraine. Around 30 energy companies have stopped trading in the UKsince August last year, including Bulb which had 1.7 million customers. Ofgem said it wanted to ""prevent the kind of energy supplier failures we saw last year and to better protect consumers' money if they do fail."" When will we get the Â£400 energy grant? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Ofgem added that the closures ""put unfair and unnecessary costs and worry onto consumers"", as thousands scrambled to find out who would fill the gap left by their supplier. Improving the financial health of energy suppliers over autumn and winter would help reduce the risk of failures, Ofgem added. The cost of moving customers to new suppliers since September 2021, including buying extra gas at short notice while prices were at record highs, as well as replacing lost customer credit balances and green levy payments, was Â£94 per household, according to the regulator. Under current rules the new supplier does not get customer credit balances from the failed supplier, so the costs of replacing these balances are shared across all customer bills. The new plans, which still need to be finalised through a consultation, would mean energy companies must protect their customers' money if they go bust and pass on the funds from accounts which are in credit to the replacement supplier. Ofgem said it hoped the measures stopped ""risky behaviour"" from energy firms. Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, said: ""Today's proposals will make sure that customers' hard-earned money is properly protected so that a company must foot the bill if it fails, rather than consumers picking up the tab."" He told the BBC that ""without a doubt"" some companies were using credit balances in ways they should not have last winter. ""We want to tighten those rules to make sure that's not happening,"" he added. Millions of domestic gas and electricity customers cover their bills with an identical direct debit payment every month. When they've paid for more energy than they've actually used, a credit balance builds up. About 30 companies have gone bust in the last year. Their customers were automatically transferred to new suppliers. But, while their credit balances were honoured, the cost of doing so was covered by increasing everyone's bill. Now Ofgem is proposing that companies hold more capital so credit balances are better protected, and the tab isn't picked up by all billpayers if that supplier collapses. High credit balances have been a source of long-term frustration to customers, many of whom feel they simply provide a free loan to their supplier. The regulator says these proposals should prevent excessive overpayments from ever building up. Citizens Advice said it was correct for Ofgem to tighten the rules which, up to now, had left customers picking up the cost of companies' failures. ""Ofgem has previously allowed energy suppliers to run risky business models. We're glad that it has listened to our warnings and is taking necessary steps to tackle some of the root causes of these issues,"" said Gillian Cooper, the charity's head of energy policy. Chris O'Shea, chief executive Centrica - the owner of British Gas, said his company had already voluntarily ring-fenced customers' credit balances, and said regulation needed to be faster. ""We welcome this consultation but we are worried at the length of time it is taking to make the changes necessary and we urge Ofgem to work with greater urgency to protect customers fully and to prevent the events of last year ever happening again,"" he said. The proposals mark the next step in Ofgem's wider plan to curb energy failures, which already include stricter entry requirements for new suppliers, and carrying out regular ""stress tests"" - to ensure companies are financially fit to run. Prices for oil and gas have soared in recent months, fuelled by the lifting of lockdowns and the Ukraine war. Food and fuel costs are also rising, with consumer prices increasing at their fastest rate in 40 years. The typical UK energy billis set to see a further rise of Â£800 in October, when the energy price cap - the maximum price which suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales - increases again. Energy firms' collapse hits 1.5 million customers How much are energy bills going up?

"Dr Emma Houghton, a GP at Laurencekirk Healthcare Centre in Aberdeenshire, is seeing patient demand soar Social care shortages are leaving community health services overwhelmed, doctors have warned. Increased demand and staff shortages mean at-home and care home services across Scotland are overstretched. One GP working in a project to prevent vulnerable people from going to hospital unnecessarily said ""things are becoming potentially unsafe"". The Scottish government said it was making record levels of investment in social care. A lack of available social care support in the community has been one of the drivers for an increase in so-called bed blocking, where patients are not able to be discharged from hospital despite being fit to leave. Bed blocking: Five years in hospital 'is like dad being stolen' NHS Scotland's 'biggest crisis' in five charts More than 550,000 on Scottish hospital waiting lists BBC Scotland spent time with an initiative in the town of Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire, which aims to reduce bed blocking. Known as a ""virtual community ward"", every day at Laurencekirk health centre a meeting takes place to discuss vulnerable patients who may need additional help and are at risk of being admitted to hospital. The group - which includes GPs, nurses,  physiotherapists and social workers - can each draw attention to patients they're concerned about and then assign the right people to follow up and take action. Prior to the pandemic, the group was preventing 600 hospital admissions a year but it is getting harder according to Dr Emma Houghton, a GP at Laurencekirk Healthcare Centre. She said: ""I think the satisfaction of doing the best that you can for a patient - that's why we all came into this job. ""It's the frustrations when you can't because the system pressures is difficult. ""That's what we're struggling with at the moment as a profession, where things are becoming potentially unsafe, because we're overwhelmed."" This video can not be played Elsie Johnston, 95, says being able to stay in her own home is very important to her Elsie Johnston has lived in the same house in Laurencekirk for more than 40 years but she couldn't stay there without the help of her carers. The 95-year-old needs four visits a day given her complex needs, but is grateful for the fact it keeps her in her own home. ""Carers get me up in the morning and put me down to bed at night,"" she said. ""It's very important, people come in to see me here when they wouldn't come to a hospital."" The experts in the virtual community ward project also agree it is important to keep Elsie at home. ""She has the maximum amount of care that we can provide and so far it's working at keeping her at home,"" explained district nurse Jackie Kirk. ""A hospital setting is not the right setting for Elsie. Being at home with friends and family is hugely important."" District Nurse, Jackie Kirk, says hospital is not the right setting for Elsie But it's more than that for Elsie according to healthcare assistant, Wendy Craig. She said: ""She gets frightened if she thinks she has got to be admitted to hospital. ""Elsie grew up in the area where I live, so she always asks me about it. She lived on a farm there. I'm a link with her past. ""She just likes to chat because then it's maybe a few hours before she sees anybody again."" Recent NHS figures show there's been an increase in the number of people facing a delay in being discharged from Scotland's hospitals. In April there were 53,604 days spent in hospital by people whose discharge was delayed. This is an increase of 64% compared with the number of delayed days in April last year. Cameron Matthew, divisional general manager of surgical services for NHS Grampian, sees the impact of this every day at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, which operates at about 95% capacity most days. He said: ""In any given day, there'll be 50 patients who are delayed transfers of care. So that's a ward and a bit, and that will have an impact on our ability to do planned care. ""I think the biggest challenge we have is access to care packages out in the community, access to care home beds and access to community hospital beds. That gap of unavailability of care packages for these patients slows down the whole of the system. ""I will say I've not seen it like this in my career. I've had about 30 years of working in the NHS and I've not seen us have as many patients backed up in ambulances and having to cancel operations to the same extent."" The Scottish government said it was already taking action to ease the pressures on social care services. Kevin Stewart, the minister for social care, said the government was committed to establishing a National Care Service. ""We have committed to increasing social care funding by Â£800m by the end of the parliament,"" he added. ""We are investing in social care workers, increasing the minimum hourly rate of pay to Â£10.50 per hour. And we are working to establish clearer options for a career pathway  for staff."" We are seeing a steady increase in the number of hospital beds taken up by patients who are medically ready to go home, but also a significant increase in the length of time they are staying. This is an indication of how much pressure community health services are facing. Sometimes it's because care packages are complex and there are shortages of district nurses, social work staff, occupational therapists and physios to put them in place. In some places it is capacity in care homes or in rehabilitation facilities. But the biggest issue is a huge shortage of carers who ensure people have their basic needs met. The Scottish government has plans to improve social care and will introduce legislation for a new National Care Service by this summer. But this will take time to deliver. In the meantime demand is soaring with an acute shortage of people to deliver care now.

"This video can not be played Aysha Aljaf learned English at a sewing group in Paisley For the first 10 years of her life in the UK, Aysha Aljaf relied on an interpreter. She arrived in England in 2008 on a spouse's visa, having fled her home in Kurdistan, in northern Iraq - her husband had already gone through the UK's asylum process. The mother of two went on to learn some English through college, but did not have the confidence to tackle conversations on her own. That was until she moved to Scotland and discovered a group of refugee women, who met in a small church in Renfrewshire to share their sewing skills and talk amongst friends. ""When I came here, for more than nine years I was living in the UK - I can't speak,"" Aysha told the BBC. ""Everywhere I went I took an interpreter with me. ""I came to see [the sewing group], it was really fabulous. I'm so happy I found it. I came for a few days and they asked me to start teaching. I've been coming now for three and a half years. I've learned more English than in college. ""I speak because face-to-face you can talk about everything, there's more learning. My [vocabulary] is much better than before because I meet with a lot of ladies and very nice families."" Aysha went on to volunteer with the group, demonstrating how to sew toys and decorations Sewing2Gether was founded in 2018 by freelance sewing tutor Gabi Cullen, who runs workshops from the Mossvale Community Church in Paisley. Funded by Renfrewshire Council, the group teaches participants about textile upcycling, helping them turn unwanted or discarded fabric into clothes, toys and gifts. It began with just one attendee for the first few months - but now more than 40 refugee women come along to sew, make friends and develop their conversational English. Aysha said the network of women has not only improved her language skills but has been willing to help her fill in forms. Now a British citizen, she has volunteered as a sewing tutor with the group and went on to secure work as a self employed seamstress. Co-founder of Sewing2Gether Corinne Watt (left) and volunteer (right) Sewing2Gether, she said, is one of the most important things in her life. ""It's more important than my house,"" she said. ""Because hereâ¦ I see family, friends and everyone. ""Everyone has an open heart for you each in a different way, which is why I think it's more important than everything for me - not just for me, for every refugee lady."" The group has so far worked with women from 25 countries, speaking 17 different languages. Flash cards with common phrases in English are incorporated into workshops, and people can chat over a hot drink and are given a lunch. Gabi Cullen founded Sewing2Gether in 2018 Speaking to the BBC, founder Gabi Cullen said: ""One of our members said with this group, we can talk and laugh together and forget about our past. She said, just sharing the moment with good people, that's what makes it special. ""We have a library and we do travel empowerment. So if we have a member who is a bit afraid to access public transport - maybe not being able to speak English or read it or just the confidence to travel alone. We help with that, we also do a bit of advocacy work as well."" This year, refugee women in the group are producing an exhibition of hand-sewn ""Millie dolls"" as part of theRefugee Festival Scotland programme,external, from 22-25 June. The fabric dolls represent the textile heritage of Paisley, and the tens of thousands of linen mill workers - known as 'Millies' - who worked in the industry at the peak of trading in the 20th century. The dolls are also intended to reflect the legacy of women who pass sewing skills through generations. Millie dolls made by women at the Sewing2Gether group ""We liked what Millie represented,"" said Gabi. ""She represents a mill worker - a strong, resilient women, and we just thought that was a good connection for us. ""It's great to be able to take part in the exhibition at the Refugee Festival. ""Many of our ladies, for various reasons, cannot be photographed or filmed, so it's great to have a doll that they've made that represents them."" Aysha added: ""The festival is important because it opens our voice - you say 'we are here, not just sitting in our homes, we have a voice,' the same as each other.""

"The biggest rail strikes in 30 years will go ahead this week after last ditch talks failed, the RMT union says RMT leader Mick Lynch says the union has ""no choice"" but to take industrial action, blaming government cuts for ""hobbling the industry"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the government is doing its ""utmost"" to stop the strikes but negotiations are a matter for the union and rail companies But Labour's shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh says the strikes would ""represent a catastrophic failure of leadership"" Train services across England, Scotland and Wales are running on a severely reduced timetable from this evening ahead of the national strike tomorrow The three-day walkout - on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday - is expected to cause disruption across the week, including for people attending Glastonbury festival A strike will also take place on the London Underground on Tuesday, with effects felt into Wednesday morning Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for joining our live coverage of the day's events. We're closing our coverage shortly - but first, here's a recap:  We'll be back with more updates tomorrow morning. Today's coverage was brought to you by Rob Corp, Jeremy Gahagan, Marita Moloney, Chris Giles, Catherine Evans, James Clarke, Heather Sharp, Sam Hancock, Aoife Walsh, Claire Heald and James FitzGerald. There will be very little or no service on the London Underground tomorrow when a strike takes place on the Tube, as well as on rail services, says Andy Lord, chief operating officer of Transport for London. ""Additionally, services which are not subject to industrial action, such as the London Overground and the Elizabeth Line, will also have reduced service because they are reliant on the national rail infrastructure,"" he says. He says there will be a normal service on the Docklands Light Railway, buses and the tram network but they will all be extraordinarily busy. The bus network should be running on time, Lord says, but increased congestion caused by the strikes could impact that. ""We will continue to do whatever we can at a tactical level to keep buses flowing freely,"" he says. After the strike, Tube services are likely to still be affected until mid-morning on Wednesday, so he advises people not to travel before 08:00 BST if possible. Wherever the row over pay and conditions is at, there will be fewer trains on Tuesday, and Network Rail is advising passengers to plan ahead and avoid trying to travel by train. In a tweet,external, Network Rail chief executive, Andrew Haines, says: ""Disruption tomorrow is guaranteed so weâre asking passengers to plan ahead and only travel by train if necessary. The RMT is striking over job cuts, pay and conditions, and says it wants a deal reflecting the increased cost of living. If you're finding yourself feeling a little confused by some of this story, it might be because we're hearing a lot of contradictory claims. The Department for Transport has just sent journalists a list of responses to some of the things RMT leader Mick Lynch said in the press conference we covered this afternoon. Here are just a few of them: We've been reporting on the beginnings of this week's rail strikes - and it's safe to say a lot of statements have been made by a lot of competing figures. Let's recall some of the key claims we've heard today. Who spoke? The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, RMT for short. What was said?  Who spoke? Transport Secretary Grant Shapps What was said?  Who spoke? Louise Haigh, Labour's shadow transport secretary What was said?  Who spoke? Network Rail What was said?  Who spoke? Transport for London, or TfL What was said? As people scramble to plan alternative travel arrangements ahead of Tuesday's rail strikes, taxi firm Uber says it is expecting a ""significant"" increase in demand. Uber says it has informed drivers the firm expects to be busy, to ""help ensure there are enough cars out on the road"". Travellers will likely see a surge in Uber's pricing due to demand - although the company caps prices during periods of significant disruption. National Express says coaches are also in high demand and reports a big rise in bookings across its UK-wide scheduled network. However, the coach operator warns it's not possible for the firm to match the demand of the rail network. ""There are only limited seats still available,"" a spokesman says. ""We do expect and are prepared to be busy but also recommend that customers allow plenty of time when planning their journey."" Katy AustinReporting from Portsmouth Iâve been speaking to pub manager Josh Ogden, who is worried about the impact of
Portsmouth having no trains tomorrow, Thursday or Saturday. He
takes the train to work himself, travelling in from Chichester. âGiven the
price of fuel having gone up, given issues with parking, itâs far easier and
quicker for me to get onto the island with trainsâ. But
heâll have to find another option this week. Some days he can do meetings from
home, others he will have to drive. Josh, who works at the Brewhouse & Kitchen, Portsmouth, also thinks the business will feel the hit, another blow after two tough
years. He
is planning on trade being 30% down this week, as usual commuter customers -
like council workers and university lecturers - work from home. Because
heâs expecting fewer punters, he will give fewer shifts to part time workers,
mainly students. âWe
wonât need to have such a big team deployed for those days. Especially on
Saturday, a massive day for us.â We're starting to build a picture of how each day of action this week could cause knock-on effects on subsequent days. Parts of the railway network in Kent, for example, are expected to be closed until ""well into the afternoon"" on Wednesday, says Network Rail. It explains there are ""unique"" challenges in the county due to staffing issues at a key electrical control office. Affected routes include the parts of the Sheerness and Medway lines, all stations between Westenhanger and Ramsgate, and all stations between Faversham and Ramsgate. So although the walkouts themselves are on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, it looks like many Kent commuters can expect disruption throughout the week. And even if the causes aren't exactly the same, prolonged disruption could happen elsewhere too. More now from the chair of the Transport Select Committee. Rail workers do deserve a pay rise - but they also need to
accept âefficiency savingsâ, Conservative MP Huw Merriman tells the BBC. Questioned whether this would inevitably mean job cuts, he
says âthere will be some natural wastage in the systemâ, but he expects this
could be covered with voluntary redundancies. Merriman argues the rail industry has been too slow to reform,
adding that âthe industry doesnât pay for itself as it used to, the taxpayer
doesâ as a result of dwindling passenger numbers post-Covid. Asked whether the government should intervene in
last-ditch talks aimed at averting strikes, Merriman says he would ârather take
the politics out of itâ. We're hearing from people who stand to be affected by rail strikes which begin at midnight. Graham Benton says he's having to fork out Â£165 on a taxi journey from his home in Portsmouth to central London, in order to attend a heart operation tomorrow. He tells the BBC his train has been cancelled. The planned procedure is ""very stressful"", says the 48-year-old, who explains that his father and uncle both died of heart attacks at a similar age. Graham adds that he has ""no idea"" how he will get home again, but says he may have to make the same expensive journey in reverse if he's discharged from the hospital on another strike day. Read more:The passengers set to miss life events Transport expert Prof Andrew Potter, from Cardiff University, says finding new ways of growing revenue could be a long-term answer to making rail transport work as an industry and be financially sustainable. ""Ultimately it comes down to what the government financially wants from the railways. They're the main supply of funds that come into the railway apart from the passenger,"" he says. Since the pandemic, passenger numbers are about 25% lower than they were. Potter says although revenue and passenger numbers are down ""they have been growing particularly in the leisure market and that's perhaps why revenue hasn't kept up with passenger numbers quite so much"".

A mother who lives in the north-east of England, and is a rail worker, questions why she should have to ""suck up the pay freeze and ... choose between heating my house or feeding my child this winter"".

The government plans tointroduce legislation this week to make it legal for employers to bring in agency staffto replace striking workers. But these plans have been criticised by the Trades Union Congress and the Recruitment & Employment Confederation as ""unworkable"" and they say they ""will only prolong the conflict between employers and their staff"". Under the government's plan, any employer - public as well as private, including schools, councils and the NHS - would have flexibility to bring in outside staff to cover striking workers.

Haigh tells the transport secretary to get around the negotiating table and ""do your job"". This video can not be played Grant Shapps: Train strikes are 'full responsibility of the unions' Transport Secretary Grant Shapps addressed MPs in the House of Commons earlier, ahead of this week's rail strikes. He says this week's rail strikes are ""created by the unions, organised by the unions... the full responsibility of the unions"". His comments came after Mick Lynch, the RMT general-secretary, earlier said the dispute had been ""manufactured by Shapps and by government policy"". Union leaders are calling for urgent talks with the government over the future of rail ticket offices. Earlier this afternoon, RMT leader Mick Lynch mentioned unions had learned of plans to close every ticket office in Britain. Now, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps should ""come clean"" about any closure plans. General secretary Manuel Cortes says in a letter to the minister: ""Closing ticket offices and moving to online-only sales would badly impact millions of elderly, disabled and disadvantaged people who are unable, or far less able, to use online services, yet still need to access public transport. ""With trust at rock bottom between rail workers and bosses, what you are doing, in effect, is further entrenching our dispute with you which is not only about jobs, pay and conditions but the future wellbeing of our rail network."" The Department for Transport says no final decision has been taken on ticket offices, but says it's ""absurd"" to suggest it wants to see them all closed. It says staff will always be available to provide face-to-face help for customers who need support or cannot use contactless or mobile tickets. But it adds: ""The reality is that ticket offices have seen a significant decline in passenger use over the last decade, yet numbers have not substantially changed since then."" We've been hearing how train services may start to wind down earlier than normal this evening ahead of tomorrow's strikes - but at the moment it still looks as though most services around the country are running ok. TheNational Rail Enquiries service indicator,externalsuggests most train operators are still offering passengers a good service - and where there are problems, they don't seem to be strike-related. A fault with the signalling system between Eastbourne and Hastings in East Sussex means trains between these stations are being replaced by buses and disruption is due to last for the rest of the day. There are also short delays on a number of routes because of signal problems in Yorkshire - between York and Doncaster. And there are delays on South Western services in south London - but those have been caused by a faulty train in Teddington and the emergency services dealing with an incident between Clapham Junction and Richmond. TransPennine Express is operating a reduced, amended timetable due to a shortage of train crew and it suggests that's due to staff sickness. And repairs to a defect next to the track are taking place between Kilmarnock and Troon, meaning no trains can run on the route between Kilmarnock and Ayr until next weekend. But other operators say they are still offering a good service, so it seems the strike is not having an impact yet. The dispute - between the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) union and the companies which run Britain's railway - centres on pay, job losses and changes to workers' terms and conditions. The RMT says plans by Network Rail - the body which owns stations, track and signals - to cut 2,500 jobs, will put safety at risk. But the industry says it has to modernise and safety will not be compromised. The Rail Delivery Group - which represents train firms - says the Covid pandemic has led to a decline in passenger numbers and while it wants to offer a pay rise to staff, the way the network operates has to change. But the RMT says it is prepared to take industrial action ""for as long as it takes to get a settlement"" and warned strikes could take place for the next six months. It says train operators have now made an offer, but there is no further offer from Network Rail, after one was rejected last Friday.
General secretary Mick Lynch said: ""The RMT National Executive Committee has now found both sets of proposals to be unacceptable and it is now confirmed that the strike action scheduled this week will go ahead."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, whose department oversees the operation of the network, described calls by the RMT for ministers to intervene as a ""stunt"" and accused the union of ""gunning"" for industrial action. He said the strike was orchestrated by ""union barons"" and will cause misery and chaos to millions of commuters. Helen CattPolitical correspondent The focus of debate in Westminster has been on what ministers should - or should not -  be doing. The government is keen to paint this strike as an issue that is strictly between the unions, the rail companies and Network Rail. Grant Shapps hasn't exactly tried to smooth the waters though, portraying the unions as anti-progress. Labour's argument is that he should be showing 'leadership' by getting all sides round the table, trying to sort the issue out. For now though all sides are accusing each other of stoking division; agreement doesn't seem close. We reported earlier thatmore than half of the trains from London to Glastonburyhave been cancelled due to strike action. Let's get more on that now... Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, the chief executive of UK Music, says the three days of rail strikes ""risk misery"" for hundreds of music fans who are ""desperate"" to get back to the world-famous festival after Covid forced organisers to cancel it twice. ""These strikes come at a crucial time for the live music industry and music businesses, which are just getting back on their feet post-pandemic,"" Mr Njoku-Goodwin tells the PA news agency. ""It's vital that all sides get around the table to bring these strikes to an end to deliver a much-needed financial boost to the music industry."" Sujeong Yoo, who is travelling all the way from Seoul in South Korea to the festival - via a flight to Heathrow Airport, a bus to Bristol and finally a train to Somerset - says she is very worried after getting a message from Great Western Railway (GWR) warning against rail travel. ""I have been to Glasto every time since 2015 except 2018. It means a lot to me... not just the festival, I feel like I am genuinely alive there,"" she says when asked about the potential delays.

"This video can not be played Watch: Mick Lynch, RMT general-secretary: ""This dispute has been manufactured by Shapps"" Passengers in England, Scotland and Wales face severe disruption after last-ditch talks failed to stop the biggest rail strikes in 30 years. Thousands of staff at Network Rail and 13 rail operators are due to walk out on Tuesday, affecting most major lines. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT rail union, blamed the ""dead hand"" of government, saying ministers did not allow employers to negotiate freely. The transport secretary said ""outdated unions"" were ""opposing progress"". Grant Shapps said about 20% of services were expected to run during the strikes on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, focusing on key workers, main population centres and critical freight routes. Services are expected to be affected from Monday evening, with disruption continuing on non-strike days this week. This video can not be played WATCH: Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps speaking in the House of Commons: ""Strikes created by the unions"" The RMT, which represents rail workers ranging from catering staff to signallers, is calling for a pay rise of at least 7%. The union said employers have only offered 2%, with the possibility of 1% more, on the condition that workers accept proposed job cuts and changes to working practices. Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said ""no strike is inevitable until the moment it begins"", but urged passengers to travel by train only if necessary. Aspecial train timetable,externalfor 20 to 26 June was published on Friday. A strike willalso take place across the London Underground on Tuesday. Live: Train strikes to go ahead after last-ditch talks fail Which lines will be affected by the strike? How much are rail workers paid? Talks were held on Monday afternoon to avert the strikes but the sides remained deadlocked, Mr Lynch said, accusing the government of interfering to prevent a deal. ""What we've come to understand is the dead hand of this Tory government is all over this dispute and the fingerprints of Grant Shapps and the DNA of [chancellor] Rishi Sunak are all over the problems on the railway,"" he said. ""Until they allow these employers to negotiate freely I can't see we're going to get a resolution."" He said staff were faced with thousands of job cuts, reduced pensions, worse terms and conditions, and a cut in real-terms pay as inflation soars. Mr Lynch said there was also a plan to close every ticket office in Britain. The Department for Transport said no final decision had been made, but said it was ""absurd"" to suggest it wanted to close every booking office. 'I'm set to lose hundreds thanks to rail strikes' The transport secretary has denied the government intervened in the dispute, saying ""no minsters have ever been involved directly in these strike negotiations"" and only the employers and union could reach an agreement. In the House of Commons, Mr Shapps said the government could no longer tolerate rail unions using their right to strike ""without any regard for how the rights of others are disrupted"". He said minimum service legislation, which requires train companies to maintain a base level of service even during strikes, was part of the solution. The short answer to this is yes. The transport secretary says he does not want to get involved in a dispute between the RMT on one side and Network Rail and the train operating companies (TOCs) on the other, but the interaction between the two employers means the government has a pivotal role. According to government officials, Network Rail is in theory able to offer a higher pay settlement than the 3% they are currently offering by shuffling their large and complex overall budget. However, the government accepts that any pay offer to Network Rail employees would set the bar for a settlement for the train operating companies. Since the government is now also standing as the financial backstop to the Covid-ravaged train operating companies, that could frustrate its stated ambition of putting the rail industry on a sustainable financial footing given that revenues for the train companies are still languishing just above half their pre-pandemic levels. The government may not be in the room but it is at the table. Mr Shapps told MPs rail unions were preventing the industry from updating ""obsolete working practices"", such as voluntary Sunday working - which he blamed for the cancellation of 170 trains before the Euro 2020 final last year. He said it was ""factually incorrect"" to say the strike is about a pay freeze and said reforms for the railways would include a ""decent annual pay rise"" for staff. ""It's about outdated unions opposing progress, progress that will secure the future of the railway,"" he said. Addressing union members directly, he said: ""Your union bosses have got you striking under false pretences and, rather than protecting your jobs, they are actually endangering them and the railway's future."" Labour said that if the strikes go ahead, they will represent a ""catastrophic failure of leadership"" by ministers. Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said of Mr Shapps: ""Not only has he been boycotting the talks, he's tied the hands of those at the table."" She said Mr Shapps had not given train operating companies ""any mandate to negotiate"" and the talks were ""a sham, because ministers have set them up to fail"". Network Rail says the last trains between many major cities are expected to depart over the course of Monday afternoon, before more than 40,000 rail workers walk out. The strike begins at 00:01 BST on Tuesday. Although ScotRail and Transport for Wales are not involved in the dispute, train services will be disrupted as the railways rely on Network Rail staff. ScotRailsaid 90% of trains will be cancelledduring the three days of strike action. The reduced timetable will be in place until Sunday, with just 20% of usual services running on strike days. Trains that do run will start later and finish much earlier than usual - between 07:30 and 18:30. South Western Railway,externalsaid it will run a ""severely reduced timetable"" on strike days, with significant sections of the network closed and a very limited service between 07:15 and 18:30 BST on some routes for those who have to travel. Great Western Railway,externalwill only operate 30% of its usual timetabled services on strike days and about 50% on non-strike days. West Midlands Railway,external, which will run a limited service on a small number of routes, urged customers to travel only if it is essential and if ""no other transport option is available"". Knock-on disruption is expected on the roads, with motorists being warned to expected a surge in traffic. Motoring group the AA says drivers in Scotland and Wales should expect to face long queues as most railway lines will be closed. The M74, M8 and A9 in Scotland and the M4, A55, A5, and A483 in Wales could see severe traffic, it says. The RAC says major city routes and those serving the home counties are likely to see some of the biggest increases in traffic volumes. The strikes will affect a number of events including school exams and thefirst Glastonbury Festival for three years. Can I get a refund?Yes, if you cannot get your train due to strike action. Season-ticket holders can apply for a refund for the days affected. Find more infohere,external. Do I have to go to work or school?This is up to your individual employer or school, check with them. How can I plan my train journey?Use theNational Rail journey planner,external. Read morehere. Leaders at 13 trade unions and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) have jointly written to Mr Shapps urging him to ""help deliver a fair resolution"". The Labour Party has also called on the government to step in. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said nobody took strike action lightly but argued low-paid rail staff such as caterers and cleaners had been left with ""no other option"". ""It's insulting to ask them to take yet another real-terms pay cut when rail companies took Â£500m in profits during the pandemic,"" she said. Rail Delivery Group chair Steve Montgomery said that passenger numbers were at 80% of pre-pandemic levels and the industry wanted to give ""a fair deal on pay while taking no more than its fair share from taxpayers"". Meanwhile,under new legislation the government is expectedto introduce this week, employers would be able to replace striking workers with agency staff. The new law, which is likely to come into force from mid-July, has been criticised by the Trades Union Congress and the recruitment industry for undermining the right to strike and creating safety risks.

"The biggest rail strikes in 30 years will go ahead this week after last ditch talks failed, the RMT union says RMT leader Mick Lynch says the union has ""no choice"" but to take industrial action, blaming government cuts for ""hobbling the industry"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the government is doing its ""utmost"" to stop the strikes but negotiations are a matter for the union and rail companies But Labour's shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh says the strikes would ""represent a catastrophic failure of leadership"" Train services across England, Scotland and Wales are running on a severely reduced timetable from this evening ahead of the national strike tomorrow The three-day walkout - on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday - is expected to cause disruption across the week, including for people attending Glastonbury festival A strike will also take place on the London Underground on Tuesday, with effects felt into Wednesday morning Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for joining our live coverage of the day's events. We're closing our coverage shortly - but first, here's a recap:  We'll be back with more updates tomorrow morning. Today's coverage was brought to you by Rob Corp, Jeremy Gahagan, Marita Moloney, Chris Giles, Catherine Evans, James Clarke, Heather Sharp, Sam Hancock, Aoife Walsh, Claire Heald and James FitzGerald. There will be very little or no service on the London Underground tomorrow when a strike takes place on the Tube, as well as on rail services, says Andy Lord, chief operating officer of Transport for London. ""Additionally, services which are not subject to industrial action, such as the London Overground and the Elizabeth Line, will also have reduced service because they are reliant on the national rail infrastructure,"" he says. He says there will be a normal service on the Docklands Light Railway, buses and the tram network but they will all be extraordinarily busy. The bus network should be running on time, Lord says, but increased congestion caused by the strikes could impact that. ""We will continue to do whatever we can at a tactical level to keep buses flowing freely,"" he says. After the strike, Tube services are likely to still be affected until mid-morning on Wednesday, so he advises people not to travel before 08:00 BST if possible. Wherever the row over pay and conditions is at, there will be fewer trains on Tuesday, and Network Rail is advising passengers to plan ahead and avoid trying to travel by train. In a tweet,external, Network Rail chief executive, Andrew Haines, says: ""Disruption tomorrow is guaranteed so weâre asking passengers to plan ahead and only travel by train if necessary. The RMT is striking over job cuts, pay and conditions, and says it wants a deal reflecting the increased cost of living. If you're finding yourself feeling a little confused by some of this story, it might be because we're hearing a lot of contradictory claims. The Department for Transport has just sent journalists a list of responses to some of the things RMT leader Mick Lynch said in the press conference we covered this afternoon. Here are just a few of them: We've been reporting on the beginnings of this week's rail strikes - and it's safe to say a lot of statements have been made by a lot of competing figures. Let's recall some of the key claims we've heard today. Who spoke? The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, RMT for short. What was said?  Who spoke? Transport Secretary Grant Shapps What was said?  Who spoke? Louise Haigh, Labour's shadow transport secretary What was said?  Who spoke? Network Rail What was said?  Who spoke? Transport for London, or TfL What was said? As people scramble to plan alternative travel arrangements ahead of Tuesday's rail strikes, taxi firm Uber says it is expecting a ""significant"" increase in demand. Uber says it has informed drivers the firm expects to be busy, to ""help ensure there are enough cars out on the road"". Travellers will likely see a surge in Uber's pricing due to demand - although the company caps prices during periods of significant disruption. National Express says coaches are also in high demand and reports a big rise in bookings across its UK-wide scheduled network. However, the coach operator warns it's not possible for the firm to match the demand of the rail network. ""There are only limited seats still available,"" a spokesman says. ""We do expect and are prepared to be busy but also recommend that customers allow plenty of time when planning their journey."" Katy AustinReporting from Portsmouth Iâve been speaking to pub manager Josh Ogden, who is worried about the impact of
Portsmouth having no trains tomorrow, Thursday or Saturday. He
takes the train to work himself, travelling in from Chichester. âGiven the
price of fuel having gone up, given issues with parking, itâs far easier and
quicker for me to get onto the island with trainsâ. But
heâll have to find another option this week. Some days he can do meetings from
home, others he will have to drive. Josh, who works at the Brewhouse & Kitchen, Portsmouth, also thinks the business will feel the hit, another blow after two tough
years. He
is planning on trade being 30% down this week, as usual commuter customers -
like council workers and university lecturers - work from home. Because
heâs expecting fewer punters, he will give fewer shifts to part time workers,
mainly students. âWe
wonât need to have such a big team deployed for those days. Especially on
Saturday, a massive day for us.â We're starting to build a picture of how each day of action this week could cause knock-on effects on subsequent days. Parts of the railway network in Kent, for example, are expected to be closed until ""well into the afternoon"" on Wednesday, says Network Rail. It explains there are ""unique"" challenges in the county due to staffing issues at a key electrical control office. Affected routes include the parts of the Sheerness and Medway lines, all stations between Westenhanger and Ramsgate, and all stations between Faversham and Ramsgate. So although the walkouts themselves are on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, it looks like many Kent commuters can expect disruption throughout the week. And even if the causes aren't exactly the same, prolonged disruption could happen elsewhere too. More now from the chair of the Transport Select Committee. Rail workers do deserve a pay rise - but they also need to
accept âefficiency savingsâ, Conservative MP Huw Merriman tells the BBC. Questioned whether this would inevitably mean job cuts, he
says âthere will be some natural wastage in the systemâ, but he expects this
could be covered with voluntary redundancies. Merriman argues the rail industry has been too slow to reform,
adding that âthe industry doesnât pay for itself as it used to, the taxpayer
doesâ as a result of dwindling passenger numbers post-Covid. Asked whether the government should intervene in
last-ditch talks aimed at averting strikes, Merriman says he would ârather take
the politics out of itâ. We're hearing from people who stand to be affected by rail strikes which begin at midnight. Graham Benton says he's having to fork out Â£165 on a taxi journey from his home in Portsmouth to central London, in order to attend a heart operation tomorrow. He tells the BBC his train has been cancelled. The planned procedure is ""very stressful"", says the 48-year-old, who explains that his father and uncle both died of heart attacks at a similar age. Graham adds that he has ""no idea"" how he will get home again, but says he may have to make the same expensive journey in reverse if he's discharged from the hospital on another strike day. Read more:The passengers set to miss life events Transport expert Prof Andrew Potter, from Cardiff University, says finding new ways of growing revenue could be a long-term answer to making rail transport work as an industry and be financially sustainable. ""Ultimately it comes down to what the government financially wants from the railways. They're the main supply of funds that come into the railway apart from the passenger,"" he says. Since the pandemic, passenger numbers are about 25% lower than they were. Potter says although revenue and passenger numbers are down ""they have been growing particularly in the leisure market and that's perhaps why revenue hasn't kept up with passenger numbers quite so much"". He adds: ""There might be some need to discuss job roles but it's also that avoiding of cutting everything simply because we've got to cut costs. ""It might be that growing revenue is a way of going forward, finding new ways of doing that could also be a way of going forward."" A mother who lives in the north-east of England, and is a rail worker, questions why she should have to ""suck up the pay freeze and ... choose between heating my house or feeding my child this winter"". In a statement on Twitter, Jessica Leather said she decided to strike because of the unseen pressures people in her industry face - and the unfair treatment they get from employers in return.

Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, the chief executive of UK Music, says the three days of rail strikes ""risk misery"" for hundreds of music fans who are ""desperate"" to get back to the world-famous festival after Covid forced organisers to cancel it twice. ""These strikes come at a crucial time for the live music industry and music businesses, which are just getting back on their feet post-pandemic,"" Mr Njoku-Goodwin tells the PA news agency. ""It's vital that all sides get around the table to bring these strikes to an end to deliver a much-needed financial boost to the music industry."" Sujeong Yoo, who is travelling all the way from Seoul in South Korea to the festival - via a flight to Heathrow Airport, a bus to Bristol and finally a train to Somerset - says she is very worried after getting a message from Great Western Railway (GWR) warning against rail travel. ""I have been to Glasto every time since 2015 except 2018. It means a lot to me... not just the festival, I feel like I am genuinely alive there,"" she says when asked about the potential delays.

"Olly Stephens It was only after Olly Stephens was murdered, in a field outside his home in Reading, that his mum and dad realised the violent and disturbing world their son had been exposed to through his phone. For BBC Panorama, reporter Marianna Spring investigates the role social media played in his death and exposes how a 13-year-old's social media accounts can be recommended violent videos and knives for sale. Last January, Amanda and Stuart Stephens watched their son from separate windows as he left home, not realising it would be the last time. Olly wandered over to a field, Bugs Bottom, opposite their house - sliders on his feet, his phone in hand. Fifteen minutes later, he had been murdered. That phone he was holding would provide the answers to what had happened. Olly was stabbed to death by two teenage boys in a field behind his house, after they recruited a girl online to lure him there. The entire attack had been planned on social media and triggered by a dispute in a social media chat group. His parents were shocked to discover the murky world of violence and hate that their son and his friends had inhabited through their phones. I decided to investigate the role social media played in what happened to Olly - and what 13-year-olds like him are being exposed to. ""They hunted him, tracked him and executed him through social media,"" Stuart tells me as we sit together on their sofa in their home in Reading. ""Social media is not guilty of the murder, but it did nothing to protect him, and without it he'd still be here."" Olly with his dad, Stuart Olly with his mum, Amanda Thames Valley Police say Olly's story stands out because of the huge role social media played in the case. And they fear that the evidence of bullying, and violent videos featuring knives found on the killers' phones, is just ""the tip of a very large iceberg"". I set out to uncover what young teenagers are seeing on social media by creating a fake account as a 13-year-old on five social media sites popular with that age group. Using an AI-generated photograph, we set up accounts for a 13-year-old boy, consulting one of Olly's friends and public accounts belonging to young teenagers in Reading. We wanted to see what a 13-year-old engaging with popular topics for his age - from sport and gaming to drill music and anti-knife crime content - would be exposed to and recommended. We also wanted to test whether social media sites moderate videos and images of knives similar to those shared by the children convicted of murdering Olly. After running our dummy account experiment for two weeks, with it liking and following content suggested across the social media sites, as well as his original interests - the results were striking: On Instagram, YouTube and Facebook, our 13-year-old account was recommended content such as people showing off knives, knives for sale and posts glorifying violence When we used our profile to actively look for anti-knife crime content, the 13-year-old's account was exposed to pro-knife groups, videos and pages on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube No action was taken against a post showing off a knife on 13-year-old's account on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat. Tik Tok, however, did remove the content for violating its guidelines on dangerous acts, and the account was warned it was close to being suspended When Olly left the house that day he reassured Amanda he had his phone location switched on, so she'd know where he was. It was the Sunday after Christmas, and the family were preparing to go back to work and school the next day. Amanda expected Olly back before dark. But shortly after he left home there was a knock on the door. It was a boy Olly knew. Amanda couldn't quite take in what he was saying. ""I thought, 'Did he just say Olly's been stabbed?'"" Stuart and Olly's older sister dashed out to the field opposite their home, where Olly was lying in a pool of blood. Amanda followed after them. ""I just held his hand and asked him not to leave me,"" Stuart says. Friends, neighbours, dog walkers all tried to help, but it was too late. He died in that field. ""I still look for his feet in the morning at the end of the bed because they would hang over the end,"" Stuart says. Not seeing them there hits him every time. Olly's bed is still made up with his favourite duvet cover. Amanda still buys him sweets, and when she vacuums Olly's room - something he used to hate - she still mutters, ""I'll only be a minute."" Olly's bedroom is filled with cards from well-wishers - his teddy Tarzan is on his bed Just before he was murdered, Olly had been diagnosed with autism and, at that time, he most enjoyed gaming and listening to music in his bedroom. The night after his murder, looking through social media posts about Olly and screengrabs his friends shared with their daughter, Stuart and Amanda began to realise the role social media had played in what happened. ""It's this secret world where you can do and say exactly what you want,"" Amanda says. ""It was a world that we had no idea existed [and] that he was being attacked by it."" Amanda, who would normally use the tracker on Olly's phone to make sure he made it home safely, now found herself using it to check his phone made it into the hands of the police. She followed the signal as it travelled with Olly's body to hospital and then again when it was taken to Thames Valley police station. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Howard was tasked with investigating the world inside that phone. It's a case he describes as unprecedented because 90% of the evidence at Olly's murder trial came from mobile phones - and no child witnesses had to take the stand. ""We were really taken aback by the amount of digital evidence,"" he explains. There was enough to convict two boys - aged 13 and 14 at the time - of murder last November. The 13-year-old girl who led him to the park was convicted of manslaughter. WatchPanorama - A Social Media Murder: Olly's Storyat 8pm on BBC One What struck the police initially about the mountain of videos, photos and screengrabs they began to sift through was the persona that 13- and 14-year-olds linked to the case were presenting online, so at odds with the suburban reality they were living. There were images shared on Instagram of people holding knives, with balaclavas on and hoods up. The police also found videos of knives being flicked and shown off, and of boys linked to Olly's murder attacking one another, which DCI Howard told Panorama he believes were being shared ""openly and very regularly"" on Instagram and Snapchat. ""There is certainly a very unhealthy attraction to filming, recording, acts of really quite serious violence,"" DCI Andy Howard says. It was a video posted on Snapchat showing an attack called ""patterning"" that was the catalyst in a chain of events that led to Olly losing his life. Thames Valley Police explained that patterning is the humiliation of a young person which is filmed or photographed and then shared on social media. It's forwarded on and on, shared across different social media sites, multiplying the embarrassment for the victim. In the weeks before he was killed, Olly had seen an image of a younger boy being humiliated and tried to alert the boy's older brother by forwarding it on to him. When two boys who were in a Snapchat group with Olly became aware he had passed it on, they were furious. DCI Howard says those boys thought Olly had been ""snitching, grassing on them"", and that led to the fallout. Police also found hundreds of Snapchat voice notes from the two boys who fell out with Olly. In them, they discuss attacking Olly and try to recruit a girl to set him up. The 13-year-old girl who agreed to do this knew Olly in real life, and had met the two boys involved online. Although they all lived locally, they met for the first time on the day of the murder. The language those convicted used in the voice notes is shocking, with comments like, ""You're going to die tomorrow Olly,"" and ""I'll just give him bangs [hit him] or stab him."" What's also chilling is their casual and cold tone. In one voice note, the girl says, ""[Male 2] wants me to set him up so then [Male 2] is gonna bang him and pattern him and shit. I'm so excited you don't understand."" None of these voice notes appear to have been picked up by Snapchat - and under the social media app's own policy, it's not possible to report a private message or voice note like this to the site, only the account sending it. The evidence gathered by the police is just the information required to prosecute - but DCI Andy Howard fears they have only scratched the surface in this case. In his view, it's likely those involved were regularly exposed to violent content - and desensitised to it. A recent study by the Huddersfield University's Applied Criminology and Policing Centre backs up that idea, finding that social media was a key factor in almost a quarter of crimes committed by under-18s. Most of these were acts of violence that started with confrontation online. In our own investigation, within two weeks of following the kind of content 13-year-olds in Reading follow on their accounts, our imaginary teenager was recommended posts of people showing off knives, knives for sale and videos glorifying violence. That happened on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube - while on TikTok and Snapchat, the accounts were not recommended this kind of content. All of these social media sites say that they protect teenage users. Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, says it restricts what under-18s can see of ""content that attempts to buy or sell bladed weapons"". YouTube says it ""may add an age restriction"" to content that includes ""harmful or dangerous acts that minors could imitate"". Our account only encountered one video with an age restriction. Some of the images and videos of knives were similar to those found on the phones of Olly's killers. We wanted to test what happens when a 13-year-old shares a post like that on social media. Our fake accounts were private, so as not to expose anyone else to this image and video of a knife. No action was taken against the post showing off a knife that was shared on the 13-year-old's account on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat. Tik Tok, however, did remove the post for violating its guidelines on dangerous acts - and the account was warned that it was close to being suspended. That suggests it is possible to detect and remove this type of content shared by a profile under 18. We have now deactivated the accounts. Our experiment revealed something else striking. Some adverts being promoted to the account on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram were based on his interests and, at times, age-appropriate. That seems to suggest that data from young teenage users can be used to target them - but then isn't being used to protect them from harmful content showing knives and violence. I wanted to know if the posts pushed to the 13-year-old's account were typical of what teenagers would see so I met up with Olly's friends Poppy, Patrick, Izzy, Jacob and Ben at Olly's memorial bench, metres from where he was stabbed. Ben had helped me set up the fake account. He and Olly's other friends told me they started using social media long before they turned 13, the age you have to be to sign up to most of the platforms. They all say there were no attempts to verify their ages. Olly's parents say he, too, joined them before he was 13. Ben, Jacob, Marianna, Poppy, Izzy and Patrick on Olly's memorial bench I showed them several screen grabs from the accounts, without exposing them to too much of the content we've been recommended. But the children weren't shocked by the results at all - and admitted they all see knives and violence regularly on their social media feeds. ""I've seen bigger knives to be honest,"" Jacob says of his own social media accounts. ""We get exposed more to people kind of showing [them] off,"" Poppy explains, talking about the image people her age try to portray mainly on Instagram, as well as Snapchat. Ben has seen Rambo knives, and Izzy butterfly blades, which she thinks people share because they are colourful and more appealing. They all also describe being exposed to cyberbullying on a regular basis - including ""patterning"" - humiliation videos like the one that triggered the dispute between Olly and the boys who killed him. All of the social media sites expressed their sympathies to Olly's family. Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, says that they ""don't allow content that threatens, encourages or coordinates violence"" and that they have ""a well-established process to support police investigations"" as they did in Olly's case. They ""will urgently investigate the examples raised in this investigation"". YouTube says it has ""strict existing policies in place to ensure that our platform is not used to incite violence"". TikTok says ""There is no such thing as 'job done' when it comes to protecting our users, particularly young people"" and it will ""continue to build policies and tools"" to help teens and their parents stay safe online. Snapchat says they ""strictly prohibit bullying, harassment and any illegal activity"" and ""provide confidential in-app reporting tools"" on the site. Amanda and Stuart want answers - and solutions - to protect other 13-year-olds on social media, and they want legislators to listen. Stuart and Amanda Stephens feel more should be done to protect teenagers like Olly on social media The online safety bill is currently passing through Parliament. ""This bill is about keeping children and young people safe,"" Secretary of State Nadine Dorries tells me. She wasn't shocked to see the results of our experiment. ""These platforms know that knife content is being sent to young people's social media feeds,"" she says. ""They can actually put what is wrong right now."" Stuart and Amanda fear that the bill in its current form wouldn't have saved Olly. They want to see more done to verify the age of young users and to limit their exposure to harmful posts - even if the content might be legal, like the violent videos and images of knives our dummy account was recommended. Dorries says exactly what is considered harmful but legal will be specified soon. But how exactly could the bill force social media sites to address this? ""I think it's probably easier to keep to the core principle of the bill,"" Dorries says. ""The UK has to be the safest country in the world for children and young people to be online."" The Government is promising harsh penalties if companies don't comply. ""We will have the power to issue multi-billion pound fines and make sure that people within those organisations are criminally liable,"" says Dorries. Meanwhile, Amanda says she feels social media companies are not facing up to the reality of what's happening. ""Forget your profits, kids are killing each other,"" Stuart says.

"Around 30 flights carrying up to 5,000 passengers have been cancelled at Heathrow Airport due to technical issues affecting baggage. The airport asked airlines to cut 10% of flights from schedules across terminals two and three on Monday. It comes after problems at baggage reclaim areas, with images of luggage being piled up high emerging last week. Elsewhere, EasyJet announced plans to cut 7% of its 160,000 flights scheduled between July and September. The move came after Gatwick, EasyJet's main airport, said itwill reduce the number of flights taking off from its airportduring the peak summer season because of staff shortages. Tens of thousands of passengers have been hit by airport disruption and flight cancellations in recent weeks. The BBC understands some airlines might be able to combine flights at Heathrow meaning some passengers will not have their journeys postponed. Heathrow said cutting the number of flights would ""minimise"" the impact of the technical issues affecting baggage systems. ""We apologise unreservedly for the disruption passengers have faced over the course of this weekend,"" the company said. British Airways, which operates from terminals three and five, told the BBC it had made a ""small number of cancellations"" as a result of the airport's request. It understood BA will be able to re-accommodate the vast majority of customers onto new flights. Hundreds of flights across the UK were cancelled during the week of the Platinum Jubilee and half-term holidays, and concerns have been raised of further travel woes during the summer. The disruption has been caused by several factors, but staff shortages has left the aviation industry struggling to cope with resurgent demand. As well as Gatwick, EasyJet also confirmed there would be flight cancellations at other airports across the airline's network including Amsterdam's Schiphol hub but it has not yet worked out a precise number. Last week, Schiphol said it would cap the number of passengers allowed at the airport over summer, leading to a 16% fall in planned flights. EasyJet said customers would be given advance notice and the potential to rebook onto alternative flights. It added many would be able to rebook on the same day they had originally planned to travel. What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Bags pile up at Heathrow after malfunction It said in recent weeks the sector had experienced an ""unprecedented ramp-up"" in demand for travel, with April and May passenger numbers reaching seven times higher than same months last year. EasyJet's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said the airline would usually operate about 160,000 flights during the summer months. He apologised that the company ""had not been able to deliver the service"" that customers ""have come to expect from us"". ""I can't tell you how many flights will be impacted,"" he said. ""It would be misleading for me to give any numbers today because we simply don't know."" The airline said it was cancelling the flights to build additional resilience in the face of operational issues including staff shortages in ground handling and at airports as well as air traffic control delays. ""Coupled with airport caps, we are taking pre-emptive actions to increase resilience over the balance of summer, including a range of further flight consolidations in the affected airports, giving advance notice to customers and we expect the vast majority to be rebooked on alternative flights within 24 hours,"" Mr Lundgren added. If your flight is cancelled, you have the right to either a full refund, or a replacement flight. ""And that different flight does not need to be with the same carrier - it can be an alternative, as long it flies on the same day,"" says Julia Lo Bue-Said, CEO of Advantage Travel Partnership. If you and the airline can't agree on a new flight, it will refund you. If the flight was cancelled with 14 days or less notice, you may also be entitled to compensation - but only if the airline is at fault. ""If it's a direct result of the airline, you're entitled to compensation, but if it's the airport, your compensation doesn't kick in,"" says Mrs Lo Bue-Said. He said EasyJet was trying to recruit from a tighter labour market, but added the main problem wasn't numbers but the time it was taking identity checks to be processed so people are able to work. ""It's been slow to get people in the system, not so much the fact we have been struggling to recruit,"" he said. However, Mr Lundgren said the company was having to ""turn down EU applications"" for jobs because of Brexit, which had also contributed to the smaller pool of potential workers. ""We turned down 8,000 applicants from the EU,"" he said, which equates to 40% of all people applying for jobs at the airline. ""I'm not blaming... but of course it has an impact. It's just smaller, it's just maths,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said the government was ""committed to building a robust and dependable domestic aviation industry"" and added it launched a skills scheme last year to ""help develop, and hold onto, UK talent"". ""We are absolutely focused on seeing an end to the disruption at airports and will continue to work with industry. But as the Transport Secretary has made clear, it is not obvious that reaching for the lever marked 'more immigration' will solve the problem,"" they added. They also suggested that changes in the law following Brexit had afforded the sector more flexibility when training new employees. Airlines have been blamed in recent weeks for taking more bookings than they can manage following steep staff cuts during the height of Covid when travel ground to a halt. But industry leaders have argued the government could have done more to support the sector during the pandemic. Following a wave of cancellations and delays at airports, the DfT and the Civil Aviation Authority wrote to airlines telling them to review their schedules and to cancel flights that could not be delivered ""at the earliest possibility"".

"The UK's energy regulator has announced plans to better protect customers who pay their bills through direct debit. Ofgem accused some firms of using customers' accumulated credit like an ""interest-free company credit card"". Proposals include tightening the rules on the level of direct debits that suppliers can charge to ""ensure credit balances do not become excessive"". Ofgem also wants to protect credit balances when suppliers fail so the costs are not picked up by customers. It come after a string of high profile closures linked to high wholesale oil and gas costs, made worse by the war in Ukraine. Around 30 energy companies have stopped trading in the UKsince August last year, including Bulb which had 1.7 million customers. Ofgem said it wanted to ""prevent the kind of energy supplier failures we saw last year and to better protect consumers' money if they do fail."" When will we get the Â£400 energy grant? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Ofgem added that the closures ""put unfair and unnecessary costs and worry onto consumers"", as thousands scrambled to find out who would fill the gap left by their supplier. Improving the financial health of energy suppliers over autumn and winter would help reduce the risk of failures, Ofgem added. The cost of moving customers to new suppliers since September 2021, including buying extra gas at short notice while prices were at record highs, as well as replacing lost customer credit balances and green levy payments, was Â£94 per household, according to the regulator. Under current rules the new supplier does not get customer credit balances from the failed supplier, so the costs of replacing these balances are shared across all customer bills. The new plans, which still need to be finalised through a consultation, would mean energy companies must protect their customers' money if they go bust and pass on the funds from accounts which are in credit to the replacement supplier. Ofgem said it hoped the measures stopped ""risky behaviour"" from energy firms. Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, said: ""Today's proposals will make sure that customers' hard-earned money is properly protected so that a company must foot the bill if it fails, rather than consumers picking up the tab."" He told the BBC that ""without a doubt"" some companies were using credit balances in ways they should not have last winter. ""We want to tighten those rules to make sure that's not happening,"" he added. Millions of domestic gas and electricity customers cover their bills with an identical direct debit payment every month. When they've paid for more energy than they've actually used, a credit balance builds up. About 30 companies have gone bust in the last year. Their customers were automatically transferred to new suppliers. But, while their credit balances were honoured, the cost of doing so was covered by increasing everyone's bill. Now Ofgem is proposing that companies hold more capital so credit balances are better protected, and the tab isn't picked up by all billpayers if that supplier collapses. High credit balances have been a source of long-term frustration to customers, many of whom feel they simply provide a free loan to their supplier. The regulator says these proposals should prevent excessive overpayments from ever building up. Citizens Advice said it was correct for Ofgem to tighten the rules which, up to now, had left customers picking up the cost of companies' failures. ""Ofgem has previously allowed energy suppliers to run risky business models. We're glad that it has listened to our warnings and is taking necessary steps to tackle some of the root causes of these issues,"" said Gillian Cooper, the charity's head of energy policy. Chris O'Shea, chief executive Centrica - the owner of British Gas, said his company had already voluntarily ring-fenced customers' credit balances, and said regulation needed to be faster. ""We welcome this consultation but we are worried at the length of time it is taking to make the changes necessary and we urge Ofgem to work with greater urgency to protect customers fully and to prevent the events of last year ever happening again,"" he said. The proposals mark the next step in Ofgem's wider plan to curb energy failures, which already include stricter entry requirements for new suppliers, and carrying out regular ""stress tests"" - to ensure companies are financially fit to run. Prices for oil and gas have soared in recent months, fuelled by the lifting of lockdowns and the Ukraine war. Food and fuel costs are also rising, with consumer prices increasing at their fastest rate in 40 years. The typical UK energy billis set to see a further rise of Â£800 in October, when the energy price cap - the maximum price which suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales - increases again.

"Gustavo Petro is a former guerrilla and mayor of the capital city of Bogota Gustavo Petro, the former mayor of Bogota and ex-rebel fighter, has become Colombia's first left-wing president. Mr Petro, a current senator, defeated the right-wing construction magnate Rodolfo HernÃ¡ndez in Sunday's run-off election. Figures show he took 50.5% of votes, defeating his millionaire rival by a close margin of around 700,000 ballots. The result marks a major change for the country, which for decades has been led by moderates and conservatives. The vote was held amid widespread discontent at the way the country has been run, and there were anti-government protests last year in which dozens of people died. The 62-year-old Mr Petro hailed what he called a ""victory for God and for the people"". ""May so much suffering be cushioned by the joy that today floods the heart of the homeland,"" Mr Petro wrote on Twitter. ""Today is the day of the streets and squares."" His running mate Francia Marquez, a single mother and former housekeeper, will become the country's first black woman vice-president. Supporters of Gustavo Petro celebrated his victory In a video posted to social media, Mr Hernandez, whoran a non-traditional campaign that relied heavily on TikTok and other social media,conceded to Mr Petro. ""I accept the results of this election,"" he said. ""I hope that Mr Gustavo Petro knows how to run the country and is faithful to his discourse against corruption,"" he added. President Ivan Duque, who was barred from seeking re-election by Colombia's term limits, said on Twitter that he had called Mr Petro to congratulate him. He added that they had ""agreed to meet in the coming days to initiate a harmonious, institutional and transparent transition"". Mr Petro was a member of the now disbanded M-19 movement in the 1980s. The rebel left-wing group was one of many guerrilla organisations that waged war against the state. He spent time in jail for illegal arms possession, before joining the political opposition where he served as both a senator and congressman as well as mayor of Bogota. Mr Petro ran on a radical manifesto and pledged during the campaign to fight inequality by providing free university education, pension reforms and high taxes on unproductive land. He also pledged to fully implement a 2016 peace deal that ended a 50-year long conflict with the communist guerrilla group, Farc, and to seek negotiations with the still-active ELN rebels. At Gustavo's results party, the atmosphere is electric. On stage, and in the crowds, people here are dancing salsa - enjoying every moment of an election like no other. In a country that experienced decades of civil conflict, Gustavo Petro's critics highlighted his role as a former rebel, arguing his economic plans would spell disaster for the country. But his promises of inclusion and addressing poverty resonated with this deeply unequal country. For Ana Beatriz Acevedo, who represents displaced Afro-Colombian women, the election marks a major change for the country. ""One of the problems this country has is inequality - in black and indigenous communities, among women,"" she said. ""And they (Petro and Marquez) represent that difference - one is mixed race, one is black - and both believe in inclusion."" It's often a clichÃ© to call elections historic but these really are - it's a huge departure for this conservative country and says a lot about how much the country has changed. Now Colombia will have its first ever leftist leader and alongside him, the first ever black vice-president - and that speaks volumes about the desire for a different political path. The campaign marked Mr Petro's third run for the presidency. He finished fourth in 2010, and was comfortably defeated in a run-off by Mr Duque in 2018. While some of his proposals have startled investors - including a planned ban on new oil projects - many voters said they voted for him to tackle some of Colombia's intractable problems, such as corruption, widespread poverty and a surge in political violence. But Mr Petro will face challenges from a fragmented congress, which includes representatives of more than a dozen parties. ""Given current levels of polarisation and existing political, economic, social and humanitarian crises, the Petro government will face significant challenges,"" Prof Arlene Tickner, an international relations lecturer at Universidad del Rosario in BogotÃ¡, told the BBC. ""An important first step that has already been taken by the president-elect is to initiate efforts to build a broad national coalition in order to enhance his governability.""

"Ed Sheeran has been the UK's most-played artist every year since 2018, except for 2020, when Dua Lipa briefly replaced him Ed Sheeran was the most-played artist in the UK last year, according to new data from music licensing body PPL. The star also had the most-played song of the year with Bad Habits. It's the fourth time in five years that Sheeran has been named the UK's most-played artist, calculated by plays on radio, TV, pubs, clubs and shops. The singer last topped the most-played song chart in 2017 with Shape Of You, over which he recently won aHigh Court copyright case. Sheeran's continued success is ""a testament to the quality of his output [and] the strength of UK music at a time when the global music landscape is more competitive than ever,"" said PPL chief executive Peter Leatham. The 21 best albums and songs of 2021 Ed Sheeran tickets cancelled for NHS staff But Bedford-born singer Tom Grennan could coming for Sheeran's crown. The singer, who wasrecently hospitalised after being attacked in New York, had the second and third most-played songs of 2021. His Calvin Harris collaboration, By Your Side, took the runner-up spot, with his solo single Little Bit of Love in third place. The Weeknd's Blinding Lights was the fourth most-played track of 2021, even though it was originally released in November 2019. The song, which has sold three million copies in the UK, was also recently named thebiggest hit of all time,externalon the US Billboard charts, overtaking Chubby Checker's 1960 single The Twist. Another long-in-the-tooth chartmaker was Miley Cyrus's Midnight Sky - a modern riff on Stevie Nicks' Edge Of Seventeen - which took ninth place on the UK chart. French DJ David Guetta also had two tracks in the top 10: Heartbreak Anthem, a collaboration with Little Mix; and Bed, which was recorded with Raye and Joel Corry. The feat helped him become the second most-played artist of 2021; while Dua Lipa took third place. Little Mix, who announced an indefinite hiatus last year, also made the top 10 for the fifth year in a row. Pink appeared at number 10, illustrating the enduring popularity of her back catalogue on UK radio. Last year, the PPL named the US star the UK's most-played female artist of the 21st century. The organisation announced its charts to coincide with its annual report. It said it had collected a total revenue of Â£252.8m, the proceeds of which were shared between 147,000 performers and rightsholders.

"This video can not be played A bereaved family are searching for answers around their father's asbestos-related death A bereaved family are calling for more awareness of the risks of asbestos exposure. Asbestos was used in building materials until it was discovered that inhalation of fibres could cause cancers. It can still be found in any building built before the year 2000 but is only considered dangerous when moved or disturbed. There were more than 800 asbestos-related deaths in NI between 2009 and 2020. The latest figures come as BBC News NI has spoken to a family from County Down who are still searching for answers around their father's death from cancer linked to asbestos exposure. It has also emerged that the number of asbestos deaths increased by almost 60% in Northern Ireland in 2020 compared to 2019. The Public Health Agency said the higher number of asbestos deaths in 2020 is due to natural variation in the data. Annual asbestos deaths have been increasing over the past 50 years, largely as a result of asbestos exposure prior to 1980. The Health and Safety Executive said asbestos-related diseases could take years to develop and ""current figures reflect the legacy of past working conditions"". A spokesperson added that deaths ""should decrease from the end of the decade"" because two types of asbestos were banned in 1986 and the last type was banned in 1999. Northern Ireland's coroner believes improvements in methods of diagnosing could also be leading to more asbestos-related diseases being listed on death certificates. Meanwhile a professor of public health at Ulster University said the Covid-19 pandemic may have had an impact on the number of deaths. Long-term, high-level exposure is needed to cause asbestosis and long-term, low-level inhalation exposure may cause lung disorders, mesothelioma or lung cancer. Health authorities say mesothelioma has such a strong relationship with asbestos exposure that annual deaths give a particularly clear view of the effect of past exposures. It is almost always fatal and the symptoms can take decades to develop and cases are often diagnosed late in the development of the disease. Niall McGonigle, a thoracic consultant and member of the clinical expert panel of Mesothelioma UK Niall McGonigle, a thoracic consultant in the Belfast Trust and member of the clinical expert panel of Mesothelioma UK, said the condition is ""a devastating diagnosis"" and that it is common for people to not know when they were exposed to asbestos. ""The lag period is the problem because the diseases related to asbestos can take 30 or 40 years to become apparent, unfortunately it's why some patients are left wondering where and when exposure occurred,"" he said. Tony Rodgers had worked as a social worker all his life and trained Labradors as a hobby. In July 2017, at the age of 60, he began experiencing shortness of breath while out on walks. He was diagnosed with mesothelioma. Tony Rodgers had worked as a social worker all his life His daughter Niamh Rodgers was shocked when she found out that this type of cancer was almost always caused by exposure to asbestos. She said: ""It was awful, it was just life shattering. We didn't know how process it. ""With daddy's job as a social worker, it wasn't something where you would expect him to have come into contact with asbestos, although he was based in a number of old buildings down the years. ""Daddy said he had also worked on an old building site for about two months over a summer period back when he was a student at university, but there just wasn't enough information for doctors to pinpoint exposure."" Tony Rodgers passed away on New Year's Day 2022. Niamh Rogers and her family are still searching for answers His family want to raise awareness about the risks associated with asbestos. Niamh added: ""We don't know where daddy might have been exposed and that does make us angry because it could have been something that could have been prevented. ""But he was an incredible daddy and we just hope that by raising awareness - he would be proud that we're trying to help other families."" A public awareness campaign,externalby the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI) in recent years has highlighted the need for construction workers to ask for the asbestos register before doing any work on the fabric of a building. Earlier this year MPs called for a40-year deadline for all asbestos to be removed from public and commercial buildings. The charity Mesothelioma UK said the risk to public health was only likely to increase as buildings were adapted with the move to net zero. Figures for Northern Ireland show that cases where asbestos-related illnesses were the primary or secondary cause of death increased from 63 in 2019 to 99 in 2020. Northern Ireland's Coroner Joe McCrisken said: ""It is not possible to say with certainty, but the increase in reported deaths could be as a result of more accurate clinical information before death because of an increase in clinical expertise and the use of modern diagnostic equipment. ""It is also likely to be linked to historic working practices and widespread use of asbestos in the building trade before 1980 with little awareness of the long-term health implications."" The 2020 figures for Great Britain are not yet available. But the number of asbestos deaths across Great Britain decreased from 2,960 in 2018 to 2,859 in 2019. Mark Tully, professor of public health at Ulster University's school of medicine, believes the increase in asbestosis and mesothelioma deaths in 2020 could be connected to the pandemic. ""We know people with chronic lung conditions, such as lung cancers, had a higher risk of mortality from Covid-19, so it stands to reason this would impact asbestos patients,"" he said. He added: ""Also remember the health service was under considerable strain during the pandemic and a number of cancer services had to be re-organised. ""The NHS has been under-resourced for many years and Covid put it under even further pressure. So the treatment of asbestos patients, like others, will have been impacted."" The PHA said: ""If you have, or develop, respiratory symptoms that you feel may be related to asbestos exposure, you should seek medical advice.""

"The biggest rail strikes in 30 years will go ahead this week after last ditch talks failed, the RMT union says RMT leader Mick Lynch says the union has ""no choice"" but to take industrial action, blaming government cuts for ""hobbling the industry"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the government is doing its ""utmost"" to stop the strikes but negotiations are a matter for the union and rail companies But Labour's shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh says the strikes would ""represent a catastrophic failure of leadership"" Train services across England, Scotland and Wales are running on a severely reduced timetable from this evening ahead of the national strike tomorrow The three-day walkout - on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday - is expected to cause disruption across the week, including for people attending Glastonbury festival A strike will also take place on the London Underground on Tuesday, with effects felt into Wednesday morning Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for joining our live coverage of the day's events. We're closing our coverage shortly - but first, here's a recap:  We'll be back with more updates tomorrow morning. Today's coverage was brought to you by Rob Corp, Jeremy Gahagan, Marita Moloney, Chris Giles, Catherine Evans, James Clarke, Heather Sharp, Sam Hancock, Aoife Walsh, Claire Heald and James FitzGerald. There will be very little or no service on the London Underground tomorrow when a strike takes place on the Tube, as well as on rail services, says Andy Lord, chief operating officer of Transport for London. ""Additionally, services which are not subject to industrial action, such as the London Overground and the Elizabeth Line, will also have reduced service because they are reliant on the national rail infrastructure,"" he says. He says there will be a normal service on the Docklands Light Railway, buses and the tram network but they will all be extraordinarily busy. The bus network should be running on time, Lord says, but increased congestion caused by the strikes could impact that. ""We will continue to do whatever we can at a tactical level to keep buses flowing freely,"" he says. After the strike, Tube services are likely to still be affected until mid-morning on Wednesday, so he advises people not to travel before 08:00 BST if possible. Wherever the row over pay and conditions is at, there will be fewer trains on Tuesday, and Network Rail is advising passengers to plan ahead and avoid trying to travel by train. In a tweet,external, Network Rail chief executive, Andrew Haines, says: ""Disruption tomorrow is guaranteed so weâre asking passengers to plan ahead and only travel by train if necessary. The RMT is striking over job cuts, pay and conditions, and says it wants a deal reflecting the increased cost of living. If you're finding yourself feeling a little confused by some of this story, it might be because we're hearing a lot of contradictory claims. The Department for Transport has just sent journalists a list of responses to some of the things RMT leader Mick Lynch said in the press conference we covered this afternoon. Here are just a few of them: We've been reporting on the beginnings of this week's rail strikes - and it's safe to say a lot of statements have been made by a lot of competing figures. Let's recall some of the key claims we've heard today. Who spoke? The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, RMT for short. What was said?  Who spoke? Transport Secretary Grant Shapps What was said?  Who spoke? Louise Haigh, Labour's shadow transport secretary What was said?  Who spoke? Network Rail What was said?  Who spoke? Transport for London, or TfL What was said? As people scramble to plan alternative travel arrangements ahead of Tuesday's rail strikes, taxi firm Uber says it is expecting a ""significant"" increase in demand. Uber says it has informed drivers the firm expects to be busy, to ""help ensure there are enough cars out on the road"". Travellers will likely see a surge in Uber's pricing due to demand - although the company caps prices during periods of significant disruption. National Express says coaches are also in high demand and reports a big rise in bookings across its UK-wide scheduled network. However, the coach operator warns it's not possible for the firm to match the demand of the rail network. ""There are only limited seats still available,"" a spokesman says. ""We do expect and are prepared to be busy but also recommend that customers allow plenty of time when planning their journey."" Katy AustinReporting from Portsmouth Iâve been speaking to pub manager Josh Ogden, who is worried about the impact of
Portsmouth having no trains tomorrow, Thursday or Saturday. He
takes the train to work himself, travelling in from Chichester. âGiven the
price of fuel having gone up, given issues with parking, itâs far easier and
quicker for me to get onto the island with trainsâ. But
heâll have to find another option this week. Some days he can do meetings from
home, others he will have to drive. Josh, who works at the Brewhouse & Kitchen, Portsmouth, also thinks the business will feel the hit, another blow after two tough
years. He
is planning on trade being 30% down this week, as usual commuter customers -
like council workers and university lecturers - work from home. Because
heâs expecting fewer punters, he will give fewer shifts to part time workers,
mainly students. âWe
wonât need to have such a big team deployed for those days. Especially on
Saturday, a massive day for us.â We're starting to build a picture of how each day of action this week could cause knock-on effects on subsequent days. Parts of the railway network in Kent, for example, are expected to be closed until ""well into the afternoon"" on Wednesday, says Network Rail. It explains there are ""unique"" challenges in the county due to staffing issues at a key electrical control office. Affected routes include the parts of the Sheerness and Medway lines, all stations between Westenhanger and Ramsgate, and all stations between Faversham and Ramsgate. So although the walkouts themselves are on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, it looks like many Kent commuters can expect disruption throughout the week. And even if the causes aren't exactly the same, prolonged disruption could happen elsewhere too. More now from the chair of the Transport Select Committee. Rail workers do deserve a pay rise - but they also need to
accept âefficiency savingsâ, Conservative MP Huw Merriman tells the BBC. Questioned whether this would inevitably mean job cuts, he
says âthere will be some natural wastage in the systemâ, but he expects this
could be covered with voluntary redundancies. Merriman argues the rail industry has been too slow to reform,
adding that âthe industry doesnât pay for itself as it used to, the taxpayer
doesâ as a result of dwindling passenger numbers post-Covid. Asked whether the government should intervene in
last-ditch talks aimed at averting strikes, Merriman says he would ârather take
the politics out of itâ. We're hearing from people who stand to be affected by rail strikes which begin at midnight. Graham Benton says he's having to fork out Â£165 on a taxi journey from his home in Portsmouth to central London, in order to attend a heart operation tomorrow. He tells the BBC his train has been cancelled. The planned procedure is ""very stressful"", says the 48-year-old, who explains that his father and uncle both died of heart attacks at a similar age. Graham adds that he has ""no idea"" how he will get home again, but says he may have to make the same expensive journey in reverse if he's discharged from the hospital on another strike day. Read more:The passengers set to miss life events Transport expert Prof Andrew Potter, from Cardiff University, says finding new ways of growing revenue could be a long-term answer to making rail transport work as an industry and be financially sustainable. ""Ultimately it comes down to what the government financially wants from the railways. They're the main supply of funds that come into the railway apart from the passenger,"" he says. Since the pandemic, passenger numbers are about 25% lower than they were. Potter says although revenue and passenger numbers are down ""they have been growing particularly in the leisure market and that's perhaps why revenue hasn't kept up with passenger numbers quite so much"". He adds: ""There might be some need to discuss job roles but it's also that avoiding of cutting everything simply because we've got to cut costs. ""It might be that growing revenue is a way of going forward, finding new ways of doing that could also be a way of going forward."" A mother who lives in the north-east of England, and is a rail worker, questions why she should have to ""suck up the pay freeze and ... choose between heating my house or feeding my child this winter"". In a statement on Twitter, Jessica Leather said she decided to strike because of the unseen pressures people in her industry face - and the unfair treatment they get from employers in return.

The government plans tointroduce legislation this week to make it legal for employers to bring in agency staffto replace striking workers. But these plans have been criticised by the Trades Union Congress and the Recruitment & Employment Confederation as ""unworkable"" and they say they ""will only prolong the conflict between employers and their staff"". Under the government's plan, any employer - public as well as private, including schools, councils and the NHS - would have flexibility to bring in outside staff to cover striking workers. This would be made legal by repealing a law that's been in place in the UK for almost half a century. The TUC and REC - which represent unions and the agency sector respectively - say they oppose the move ""in the strongest possible terms"". The current ban should be kept in place ""as a key element of a sustainable national employment relations framework"", they say. They also say the plan is not practical because there are 1.3 million job vacancies and data shows the number of people available to fill them is falling. ""In this tight labour market, agency workers are in high demand and can pick and choose the jobs they take. Agency staff are very unlikely to choose a role that requires them to cross a picket line versus one that doesnât,"" the organisations say. This video can not be played In response to Grant Shapps, Labour's shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said her party does not want rail strikes this week to go ahead either. But, she told him: ""Rail workers are not the enemy. They are people that showed real bravery during the pandemic to keep our country going."" Haigh tells the transport secretary to get around the negotiating table and ""do your job"". This video can not be played Grant Shapps: Train strikes are 'full responsibility of the unions' Transport Secretary Grant Shapps addressed MPs in the House of Commons earlier, ahead of this week's rail strikes. He says this week's rail strikes are ""created by the unions, organised by the unions... the full responsibility of the unions"". His comments came after Mick Lynch, the RMT general-secretary, earlier said the dispute had been ""manufactured by Shapps and by government policy"". Union leaders are calling for urgent talks with the government over the future of rail ticket offices. Earlier this afternoon, RMT leader Mick Lynch mentioned unions had learned of plans to close every ticket office in Britain. Now, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps should ""come clean"" about any closure plans. General secretary Manuel Cortes says in a letter to the minister: ""Closing ticket offices and moving to online-only sales would badly impact millions of elderly, disabled and disadvantaged people who are unable, or far less able, to use online services, yet still need to access public transport. ""With trust at rock bottom between rail workers and bosses, what you are doing, in effect, is further entrenching our dispute with you which is not only about jobs, pay and conditions but the future wellbeing of our rail network."" The Department for Transport says no final decision has been taken on ticket offices, but says it's ""absurd"" to suggest it wants to see them all closed. It says staff will always be available to provide face-to-face help for customers who need support or cannot use contactless or mobile tickets. But it adds: ""The reality is that ticket offices have seen a significant decline in passenger use over the last decade, yet numbers have not substantially changed since then."" We've been hearing how train services may start to wind down earlier than normal this evening ahead of tomorrow's strikes - but at the moment it still looks as though most services around the country are running ok. TheNational Rail Enquiries service indicator,externalsuggests most train operators are still offering passengers a good service - and where there are problems, they don't seem to be strike-related. A fault with the signalling system between Eastbourne and Hastings in East Sussex means trains between these stations are being replaced by buses and disruption is due to last for the rest of the day. There are also short delays on a number of routes because of signal problems in Yorkshire - between York and Doncaster. And there are delays on South Western services in south London - but those have been caused by a faulty train in Teddington and the emergency services dealing with an incident between Clapham Junction and Richmond. TransPennine Express is operating a reduced, amended timetable due to a shortage of train crew and it suggests that's due to staff sickness. And repairs to a defect next to the track are taking place between Kilmarnock and Troon, meaning no trains can run on the route between Kilmarnock and Ayr until next weekend. But other operators say they are still offering a good service, so it seems the strike is not having an impact yet. The dispute - between the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) union and the companies which run Britain's railway - centres on pay, job losses and changes to workers' terms and conditions. The RMT says plans by Network Rail - the body which owns stations, track and signals - to cut 2,500 jobs, will put safety at risk. But the industry says it has to modernise and safety will not be compromised. The Rail Delivery Group - which represents train firms - says the Covid pandemic has led to a decline in passenger numbers and while it wants to offer a pay rise to staff, the way the network operates has to change. But the RMT says it is prepared to take industrial action ""for as long as it takes to get a settlement"" and warned strikes could take place for the next six months. It says train operators have now made an offer, but there is no further offer from Network Rail, after one was rejected last Friday.
General secretary Mick Lynch said: ""The RMT National Executive Committee has now found both sets of proposals to be unacceptable and it is now confirmed that the strike action scheduled this week will go ahead."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, whose department oversees the operation of the network, described calls by the RMT for ministers to intervene as a ""stunt"" and accused the union of ""gunning"" for industrial action. He said the strike was orchestrated by ""union barons"" and will cause misery and chaos to millions of commuters. Helen CattPolitical correspondent The focus of debate in Westminster has been on what ministers should - or should not -  be doing. The government is keen to paint this strike as an issue that is strictly between the unions, the rail companies and Network Rail. Grant Shapps hasn't exactly tried to smooth the waters though, portraying the unions as anti-progress. Labour's argument is that he should be showing 'leadership' by getting all sides round the table, trying to sort the issue out. For now though all sides are accusing each other of stoking division; agreement doesn't seem close. We reported earlier thatmore than half of the trains from London to Glastonburyhave been cancelled due to strike action. Let's get more on that now... Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, the chief executive of UK Music, says the three days of rail strikes ""risk misery"" for hundreds of music fans who are ""desperate"" to get back to the world-famous festival after Covid forced organisers to cancel it twice. ""These strikes come at a crucial time for the live music industry and music businesses, which are just getting back on their feet post-pandemic,"" Mr Njoku-Goodwin tells the PA news agency. ""It's vital that all sides get around the table to bring these strikes to an end to deliver a much-needed financial boost to the music industry."" Sujeong Yoo, who is travelling all the way from Seoul in South Korea to the festival - via a flight to Heathrow Airport, a bus to Bristol and finally a train to Somerset - says she is very worried after getting a message from Great Western Railway (GWR) warning against rail travel. ""I have been to Glasto every time since 2015 except 2018. It means a lot to me... not just the festival, I feel like I am genuinely alive there,"" she says when asked about the potential delays.

"The ban will not apply to Russian composers who died before the collapse of the Soviet Union Ukraine's parliament has voted in favour of banning some Russian music in media and public spaces.

"The biggest rail strikes in 30 years will go ahead this week after last ditch talks failed, the RMT union says RMT leader Mick Lynch says the union has ""no choice"" but to take industrial action, blaming government cuts for ""hobbling the industry"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the government is doing its ""utmost"" to stop the strikes but negotiations are a matter for the union and rail companies But Labour's shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh says the strikes would ""represent a catastrophic failure of leadership"" Train services across England, Scotland and Wales are running on a severely reduced timetable from this evening ahead of the national strike tomorrow The three-day walkout - on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday - is expected to cause disruption across the week, including for people attending Glastonbury festival A strike will also take place on the London Underground on Tuesday, with effects felt into Wednesday morning Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for joining our live coverage of the day's events. We're closing our coverage shortly - but first, here's a recap:  We'll be back with more updates tomorrow morning. Today's coverage was brought to you by Rob Corp, Jeremy Gahagan, Marita Moloney, Chris Giles, Catherine Evans, James Clarke, Heather Sharp, Sam Hancock, Aoife Walsh, Claire Heald and James FitzGerald. There will be very little or no service on the London Underground tomorrow when a strike takes place on the Tube, as well as on rail services, says Andy Lord, chief operating officer of Transport for London. ""Additionally, services which are not subject to industrial action, such as the London Overground and the Elizabeth Line, will also have reduced service because they are reliant on the national rail infrastructure,"" he says. He says there will be a normal service on the Docklands Light Railway, buses and the tram network but they will all be extraordinarily busy. The bus network should be running on time, Lord says, but increased congestion caused by the strikes could impact that. ""We will continue to do whatever we can at a tactical level to keep buses flowing freely,"" he says. After the strike, Tube services are likely to still be affected until mid-morning on Wednesday, so he advises people not to travel before 08:00 BST if possible. Wherever the row over pay and conditions is at, there will be fewer trains on Tuesday, and Network Rail is advising passengers to plan ahead and avoid trying to travel by train. In a tweet,external, Network Rail chief executive, Andrew Haines, says: ""Disruption tomorrow is guaranteed so weâre asking passengers to plan ahead and only travel by train if necessary. The RMT is striking over job cuts, pay and conditions, and says it wants a deal reflecting the increased cost of living. If you're finding yourself feeling a little confused by some of this story, it might be because we're hearing a lot of contradictory claims. The Department for Transport has just sent journalists a list of responses to some of the things RMT leader Mick Lynch said in the press conference we covered this afternoon. Here are just a few of them: We've been reporting on the beginnings of this week's rail strikes - and it's safe to say a lot of statements have been made by a lot of competing figures. Let's recall some of the key claims we've heard today. Who spoke? The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, RMT for short. What was said?  Who spoke? Transport Secretary Grant Shapps What was said?  Who spoke? Louise Haigh, Labour's shadow transport secretary What was said?  Who spoke? Network Rail What was said?  Who spoke? Transport for London, or TfL What was said? As people scramble to plan alternative travel arrangements ahead of Tuesday's rail strikes, taxi firm Uber says it is expecting a ""significant"" increase in demand. Uber says it has informed drivers the firm expects to be busy, to ""help ensure there are enough cars out on the road"". Travellers will likely see a surge in Uber's pricing due to demand - although the company caps prices during periods of significant disruption. National Express says coaches are also in high demand and reports a big rise in bookings across its UK-wide scheduled network. However, the coach operator warns it's not possible for the firm to match the demand of the rail network. ""There are only limited seats still available,"" a spokesman says. ""We do expect and are prepared to be busy but also recommend that customers allow plenty of time when planning their journey."" Katy AustinReporting from Portsmouth Iâve been speaking to pub manager Josh Ogden, who is worried about the impact of
Portsmouth having no trains tomorrow, Thursday or Saturday. He
takes the train to work himself, travelling in from Chichester. âGiven the
price of fuel having gone up, given issues with parking, itâs far easier and
quicker for me to get onto the island with trainsâ. But
heâll have to find another option this week. Some days he can do meetings from
home, others he will have to drive. Josh, who works at the Brewhouse & Kitchen, Portsmouth, also thinks the business will feel the hit, another blow after two tough
years. He
is planning on trade being 30% down this week, as usual commuter customers -
like council workers and university lecturers - work from home. Because
heâs expecting fewer punters, he will give fewer shifts to part time workers,
mainly students. âWe
wonât need to have such a big team deployed for those days. Especially on
Saturday, a massive day for us.â We're starting to build a picture of how each day of action this week could cause knock-on effects on subsequent days. Parts of the railway network in Kent, for example, are expected to be closed until ""well into the afternoon"" on Wednesday, says Network Rail. It explains there are ""unique"" challenges in the county due to staffing issues at a key electrical control office. Affected routes include the parts of the Sheerness and Medway lines, all stations between Westenhanger and Ramsgate, and all stations between Faversham and Ramsgate. So although the walkouts themselves are on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, it looks like many Kent commuters can expect disruption throughout the week. And even if the causes aren't exactly the same, prolonged disruption could happen elsewhere too. More now from the chair of the Transport Select Committee. Rail workers do deserve a pay rise - but they also need to
accept âefficiency savingsâ, Conservative MP Huw Merriman tells the BBC. Questioned whether this would inevitably mean job cuts, he
says âthere will be some natural wastage in the systemâ, but he expects this
could be covered with voluntary redundancies. Merriman argues the rail industry has been too slow to reform,
adding that âthe industry doesnât pay for itself as it used to, the taxpayer
doesâ as a result of dwindling passenger numbers post-Covid. Asked whether the government should intervene in
last-ditch talks aimed at averting strikes, Merriman says he would ârather take
the politics out of itâ. We're hearing from people who stand to be affected by rail strikes which begin at midnight. Graham Benton says he's having to fork out Â£165 on a taxi journey from his home in Portsmouth to central London, in order to attend a heart operation tomorrow. He tells the BBC his train has been cancelled. The planned procedure is ""very stressful"", says the 48-year-old, who explains that his father and uncle both died of heart attacks at a similar age. Graham adds that he has ""no idea"" how he will get home again, but says he may have to make the same expensive journey in reverse if he's discharged from the hospital on another strike day. Read more:The passengers set to miss life events Transport expert Prof Andrew Potter, from Cardiff University, says finding new ways of growing revenue could be a long-term answer to making rail transport work as an industry and be financially sustainable. ""Ultimately it comes down to what the government financially wants from the railways. They're the main supply of funds that come into the railway apart from the passenger,"" he says. Since the pandemic, passenger numbers are about 25% lower than they were. Potter says although revenue and passenger numbers are down ""they have been growing particularly in the leisure market and that's perhaps why revenue hasn't kept up with passenger numbers quite so much"". He adds: ""There might be some need to discuss job roles but it's also that avoiding of cutting everything simply because we've got to cut costs. ""It might be that growing revenue is a way of going forward, finding new ways of doing that could also be a way of going forward."" A mother who lives in the north-east of England, and is a rail worker, questions why she should have to ""suck up the pay freeze and ... choose between heating my house or feeding my child this winter"". In a statement on Twitter, Jessica Leather said she decided to strike because of the unseen pressures people in her industry face - and the unfair treatment they get from employers in return.

The government plans tointroduce legislation this week to make it legal for employers to bring in agency staffto replace striking workers. But these plans have been criticised by the Trades Union Congress and the Recruitment & Employment Confederation as ""unworkable"" and they say they ""will only prolong the conflict between employers and their staff"". Under the government's plan, any employer - public as well as private, including schools, councils and the NHS - would have flexibility to bring in outside staff to cover striking workers. This would be made legal by repealing a law that's been in place in the UK for almost half a century. The TUC and REC - which represent unions and the agency sector respectively - say they oppose the move ""in the strongest possible terms"". The current ban should be kept in place ""as a key element of a sustainable national employment relations framework"", they say. They also say the plan is not practical because there are 1.3 million job vacancies and data shows the number of people available to fill them is falling. ""In this tight labour market, agency workers are in high demand and can pick and choose the jobs they take. Agency staff are very unlikely to choose a role that requires them to cross a picket line versus one that doesnât,"" the organisations say. This video can not be played In response to Grant Shapps, Labour's shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said her party does not want rail strikes this week to go ahead either. But, she told him: ""Rail workers are not the enemy. They are people that showed real bravery during the pandemic to keep our country going."" Haigh tells the transport secretary to get around the negotiating table and ""do your job"". This video can not be played Grant Shapps: Train strikes are 'full responsibility of the unions' Transport Secretary Grant Shapps addressed MPs in the House of Commons earlier, ahead of this week's rail strikes. He says this week's rail strikes are ""created by the unions, organised by the unions... the full responsibility of the unions"". His comments came after Mick Lynch, the RMT general-secretary, earlier said the dispute had been ""manufactured by Shapps and by government policy"". Union leaders are calling for urgent talks with the government over the future of rail ticket offices. Earlier this afternoon, RMT leader Mick Lynch mentioned unions had learned of plans to close every ticket office in Britain. Now, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps should ""come clean"" about any closure plans. General secretary Manuel Cortes says in a letter to the minister: ""Closing ticket offices and moving to online-only sales would badly impact millions of elderly, disabled and disadvantaged people who are unable, or far less able, to use online services, yet still need to access public transport. ""With trust at rock bottom between rail workers and bosses, what you are doing, in effect, is further entrenching our dispute with you which is not only about jobs, pay and conditions but the future wellbeing of our rail network."" The Department for Transport says no final decision has been taken on ticket offices, but says it's ""absurd"" to suggest it wants to see them all closed. It says staff will always be available to provide face-to-face help for customers who need support or cannot use contactless or mobile tickets. But it adds: ""The reality is that ticket offices have seen a significant decline in passenger use over the last decade, yet numbers have not substantially changed since then."" We've been hearing how train services may start to wind down earlier than normal this evening ahead of tomorrow's strikes - but at the moment it still looks as though most services around the country are running ok. TheNational Rail Enquiries service indicator,externalsuggests most train operators are still offering passengers a good service - and where there are problems, they don't seem to be strike-related. A fault with the signalling system between Eastbourne and Hastings in East Sussex means trains between these stations are being replaced by buses and disruption is due to last for the rest of the day. There are also short delays on a number of routes because of signal problems in Yorkshire - between York and Doncaster. And there are delays on South Western services in south London - but those have been caused by a faulty train in Teddington and the emergency services dealing with an incident between Clapham Junction and Richmond. TransPennine Express is operating a reduced, amended timetable due to a shortage of train crew and it suggests that's due to staff sickness. And repairs to a defect next to the track are taking place between Kilmarnock and Troon, meaning no trains can run on the route between Kilmarnock and Ayr until next weekend. But other operators say they are still offering a good service, so it seems the strike is not having an impact yet.

"This video can not be played Watch: Mick Lynch, RMT general-secretary: ""This dispute has been manufactured by Shapps"" Passengers in England, Scotland and Wales face severe disruption after last-ditch talks failed to stop the biggest rail strikes in 30 years. Thousands of staff at Network Rail and 13 rail operators are due to walk out on Tuesday, affecting most major lines. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT rail union, blamed the ""dead hand"" of government, saying ministers did not allow employers to negotiate freely. The transport secretary said ""outdated unions"" were ""opposing progress"". Grant Shapps said about 20% of services were expected to run during the strikes on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, focusing on key workers, main population centres and critical freight routes. Services are expected to be affected from Monday evening, with disruption continuing on non-strike days this week. This video can not be played WATCH: Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps speaking in the House of Commons: ""Strikes created by the unions"" The RMT, which represents rail workers ranging from catering staff to signallers, is calling for a pay rise of at least 7%. The union said employers have only offered 2%, with the possibility of 1% more, on the condition that workers accept proposed job cuts and changes to working practices. Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said ""no strike is inevitable until the moment it begins"", but urged passengers to travel by train only if necessary. Aspecial train timetable,externalfor 20 to 26 June was published on Friday. A strike willalso take place across the London Underground on Tuesday. Live: Train strikes to go ahead after last-ditch talks fail Which lines will be affected by the strike? How much are rail workers paid? Talks were held on Monday afternoon to avert the strikes but the sides remained deadlocked, Mr Lynch said, accusing the government of interfering to prevent a deal. ""What we've come to understand is the dead hand of this Tory government is all over this dispute and the fingerprints of Grant Shapps and the DNA of [chancellor] Rishi Sunak are all over the problems on the railway,"" he said. ""Until they allow these employers to negotiate freely I can't see we're going to get a resolution."" He said staff were faced with thousands of job cuts, reduced pensions, worse terms and conditions, and a cut in real-terms pay as inflation soars. Mr Lynch said there was also a plan to close every ticket office in Britain. The Department for Transport said no final decision had been made, but said it was ""absurd"" to suggest it wanted to close every booking office. 'I'm set to lose hundreds thanks to rail strikes' The transport secretary has denied the government intervened in the dispute, saying ""no minsters have ever been involved directly in these strike negotiations"" and only the employers and union could reach an agreement. In the House of Commons, Mr Shapps said the government could no longer tolerate rail unions using their right to strike ""without any regard for how the rights of others are disrupted"". He said minimum service legislation, which requires train companies to maintain a base level of service even during strikes, was part of the solution. The short answer to this is yes. The transport secretary says he does not want to get involved in a dispute between the RMT on one side and Network Rail and the train operating companies (TOCs) on the other, but the interaction between the two employers means the government has a pivotal role. According to government officials, Network Rail is in theory able to offer a higher pay settlement than the 3% they are currently offering by shuffling their large and complex overall budget. However, the government accepts that any pay offer to Network Rail employees would set the bar for a settlement for the train operating companies. Since the government is now also standing as the financial backstop to the Covid-ravaged train operating companies, that could frustrate its stated ambition of putting the rail industry on a sustainable financial footing given that revenues for the train companies are still languishing just above half their pre-pandemic levels. The government may not be in the room but it is at the table. Mr Shapps told MPs rail unions were preventing the industry from updating ""obsolete working practices"", such as voluntary Sunday working - which he blamed for the cancellation of 170 trains before the Euro 2020 final last year. He said it was ""factually incorrect"" to say the strike is about a pay freeze and said reforms for the railways would include a ""decent annual pay rise"" for staff. ""It's about outdated unions opposing progress, progress that will secure the future of the railway,"" he said. Addressing union members directly, he said: ""Your union bosses have got you striking under false pretences and, rather than protecting your jobs, they are actually endangering them and the railway's future."" Labour said that if the strikes go ahead, they will represent a ""catastrophic failure of leadership"" by ministers. Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said of Mr Shapps: ""Not only has he been boycotting the talks, he's tied the hands of those at the table."" She said Mr Shapps had not given train operating companies ""any mandate to negotiate"" and the talks were ""a sham, because ministers have set them up to fail"". Network Rail says the last trains between many major cities are expected to depart over the course of Monday afternoon, before more than 40,000 rail workers walk out. The strike begins at 00:01 BST on Tuesday. Although ScotRail and Transport for Wales are not involved in the dispute, train services will be disrupted as the railways rely on Network Rail staff. ScotRailsaid 90% of trains will be cancelledduring the three days of strike action. The reduced timetable will be in place until Sunday, with just 20% of usual services running on strike days. Trains that do run will start later and finish much earlier than usual - between 07:30 and 18:30. South Western Railway,externalsaid it will run a ""severely reduced timetable"" on strike days, with significant sections of the network closed and a very limited service between 07:15 and 18:30 BST on some routes for those who have to travel. Great Western Railway,externalwill only operate 30% of its usual timetabled services on strike days and about 50% on non-strike days. West Midlands Railway,external, which will run a limited service on a small number of routes, urged customers to travel only if it is essential and if ""no other transport option is available"". Knock-on disruption is expected on the roads, with motorists being warned to expected a surge in traffic. Motoring group the AA says drivers in Scotland and Wales should expect to face long queues as most railway lines will be closed. The M74, M8 and A9 in Scotland and the M4, A55, A5, and A483 in Wales could see severe traffic, it says. The RAC says major city routes and those serving the home counties are likely to see some of the biggest increases in traffic volumes. The strikes will affect a number of events including school exams and thefirst Glastonbury Festival for three years. Can I get a refund?Yes, if you cannot get your train due to strike action.

Leaders at 13 trade unions and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) have jointly written to Mr Shapps urging him to ""help deliver a fair resolution"". The Labour Party has also called on the government to step in. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said nobody took strike action lightly but argued low-paid rail staff such as caterers and cleaners had been left with ""no other option"". ""It's insulting to ask them to take yet another real-terms pay cut when rail companies took Â£500m in profits during the pandemic,"" she said. Rail Delivery Group chair Steve Montgomery said that passenger numbers were at 80% of pre-pandemic levels and the industry wanted to give ""a fair deal on pay while taking no more than its fair share from taxpayers"". Meanwhile,under new legislation the government is expectedto introduce this week, employers would be able to replace striking workers with agency staff. The new law, which is likely to come into force from mid-July, has been criticised by the Trades Union Congress and the recruitment industry for undermining the right to strike and creating safety risks.

"This video can not be played A bereaved family are searching for answers around their father's asbestos-related death A bereaved family are calling for more awareness of the risks of asbestos exposure. Asbestos was used in building materials until it was discovered that inhalation of fibres could cause cancers. It can still be found in any building built before the year 2000 but is only considered dangerous when moved or disturbed. There were more than 800 asbestos-related deaths in NI between 2009 and 2020. The latest figures come as BBC News NI has spoken to a family from County Down who are still searching for answers around their father's death from cancer linked to asbestos exposure. It has also emerged that the number of asbestos deaths increased by almost 60% in Northern Ireland in 2020 compared to 2019. The Public Health Agency said the higher number of asbestos deaths in 2020 is due to natural variation in the data. Annual asbestos deaths have been increasing over the past 50 years, largely as a result of asbestos exposure prior to 1980. The Health and Safety Executive said asbestos-related diseases could take years to develop and ""current figures reflect the legacy of past working conditions"". A spokesperson added that deaths ""should decrease from the end of the decade"" because two types of asbestos were banned in 1986 and the last type was banned in 1999. Northern Ireland's coroner believes improvements in methods of diagnosing could also be leading to more asbestos-related diseases being listed on death certificates. Meanwhile a professor of public health at Ulster University said the Covid-19 pandemic may have had an impact on the number of deaths. Long-term, high-level exposure is needed to cause asbestosis and long-term, low-level inhalation exposure may cause lung disorders, mesothelioma or lung cancer. Health authorities say mesothelioma has such a strong relationship with asbestos exposure that annual deaths give a particularly clear view of the effect of past exposures. It is almost always fatal and the symptoms can take decades to develop and cases are often diagnosed late in the development of the disease. Niall McGonigle, a thoracic consultant and member of the clinical expert panel of Mesothelioma UK Niall McGonigle, a thoracic consultant in the Belfast Trust and member of the clinical expert panel of Mesothelioma UK, said the condition is ""a devastating diagnosis"" and that it is common for people to not know when they were exposed to asbestos. ""The lag period is the problem because the diseases related to asbestos can take 30 or 40 years to become apparent, unfortunately it's why some patients are left wondering where and when exposure occurred,"" he said. Tony Rodgers had worked as a social worker all his life and trained Labradors as a hobby. In July 2017, at the age of 60, he began experiencing shortness of breath while out on walks. He was diagnosed with mesothelioma. Tony Rodgers had worked as a social worker all his life His daughter Niamh Rodgers was shocked when she found out that this type of cancer was almost always caused by exposure to asbestos. She said: ""It was awful, it was just life shattering. We didn't know how process it. ""With daddy's job as a social worker, it wasn't something where you would expect him to have come into contact with asbestos, although he was based in a number of old buildings down the years. ""Daddy said he had also worked on an old building site for about two months over a summer period back when he was a student at university, but there just wasn't enough information for doctors to pinpoint exposure."" Tony Rodgers passed away on New Year's Day 2022. Niamh Rogers and her family are still searching for answers His family want to raise awareness about the risks associated with asbestos. Niamh added: ""We don't know where daddy might have been exposed and that does make us angry because it could have been something that could have been prevented. ""But he was an incredible daddy and we just hope that by raising awareness - he would be proud that we're trying to help other families."" A public awareness campaign,externalby the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI) in recent years has highlighted the need for construction workers to ask for the asbestos register before doing any work on the fabric of a building. Earlier this year MPs called for a40-year deadline for all asbestos to be removed from public and commercial buildings. The charity Mesothelioma UK said the risk to public health was only likely to increase as buildings were adapted with the move to net zero. Figures for Northern Ireland show that cases where asbestos-related illnesses were the primary or secondary cause of death increased from 63 in 2019 to 99 in 2020. Northern Ireland's Coroner Joe McCrisken said: ""It is not possible to say with certainty, but the increase in reported deaths could be as a result of more accurate clinical information before death because of an increase in clinical expertise and the use of modern diagnostic equipment. ""It is also likely to be linked to historic working practices and widespread use of asbestos in the building trade before 1980 with little awareness of the long-term health implications."" The 2020 figures for Great Britain are not yet available. But the number of asbestos deaths across Great Britain decreased from 2,960 in 2018 to 2,859 in 2019. Mark Tully, professor of public health at Ulster University's school of medicine, believes the increase in asbestosis and mesothelioma deaths in 2020 could be connected to the pandemic. ""We know people with chronic lung conditions, such as lung cancers, had a higher risk of mortality from Covid-19, so it stands to reason this would impact asbestos patients,"" he said. He added: ""Also remember the health service was under considerable strain during the pandemic and a number of cancer services had to be re-organised. ""The NHS has been under-resourced for many years and Covid put it under even further pressure. So the treatment of asbestos patients, like others, will have been impacted."" The PHA said: ""If you have, or develop, respiratory symptoms that you feel may be related to asbestos exposure, you should seek medical advice.""

"The UK's energy regulator has announced plans to better protect customers who pay their bills through direct debit. Ofgem accused some firms of using customers' accumulated credit like an ""interest-free company credit card"". Proposals include tightening the rules on the level of direct debits that suppliers can charge to ""ensure credit balances do not become excessive"". Ofgem also wants to protect credit balances when suppliers fail so the costs are not picked up by customers. It come after a string of high profile closures linked to high wholesale oil and gas costs, made worse by the war in Ukraine. Around 30 energy companies have stopped trading in the UKsince August last year, including Bulb which had 1.7 million customers. Ofgem said it wanted to ""prevent the kind of energy supplier failures we saw last year and to better protect consumers' money if they do fail."" When will we get the Â£400 energy grant? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Ofgem added that the closures ""put unfair and unnecessary costs and worry onto consumers"", as thousands scrambled to find out who would fill the gap left by their supplier. Improving the financial health of energy suppliers over autumn and winter would help reduce the risk of failures, Ofgem added. The cost of moving customers to new suppliers since September 2021, including buying extra gas at short notice while prices were at record highs, as well as replacing lost customer credit balances and green levy payments, was Â£94 per household, according to the regulator. Under current rules the new supplier does not get customer credit balances from the failed supplier, so the costs of replacing these balances are shared across all customer bills. The new plans, which still need to be finalised through a consultation, would mean energy companies must protect their customers' money if they go bust and pass on the funds from accounts which are in credit to the replacement supplier. Ofgem said it hoped the measures stopped ""risky behaviour"" from energy firms. Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, said: ""Today's proposals will make sure that customers' hard-earned money is properly protected so that a company must foot the bill if it fails, rather than consumers picking up the tab."" He told the BBC that ""without a doubt"" some companies were using credit balances in ways they should not have last winter. ""We want to tighten those rules to make sure that's not happening,"" he added. Millions of domestic gas and electricity customers cover their bills with an identical direct debit payment every month. When they've paid for more energy than they've actually used, a credit balance builds up. About 30 companies have gone bust in the last year. Their customers were automatically transferred to new suppliers. But, while their credit balances were honoured, the cost of doing so was covered by increasing everyone's bill. Now Ofgem is proposing that companies hold more capital so credit balances are better protected, and the tab isn't picked up by all billpayers if that supplier collapses. High credit balances have been a source of long-term frustration to customers, many of whom feel they simply provide a free loan to their supplier. The regulator says these proposals should prevent excessive overpayments from ever building up. Citizens Advice said it was correct for Ofgem to tighten the rules which, up to now, had left customers picking up the cost of companies' failures. ""Ofgem has previously allowed energy suppliers to run risky business models. We're glad that it has listened to our warnings and is taking necessary steps to tackle some of the root causes of these issues,"" said Gillian Cooper, the charity's head of energy policy. Chris O'Shea, chief executive Centrica - the owner of British Gas, said his company had already voluntarily ring-fenced customers' credit balances, and said regulation needed to be faster. ""We welcome this consultation but we are worried at the length of time it is taking to make the changes necessary and we urge Ofgem to work with greater urgency to protect customers fully and to prevent the events of last year ever happening again,"" he said. The proposals mark the next step in Ofgem's wider plan to curb energy failures, which already include stricter entry requirements for new suppliers, and carrying out regular ""stress tests"" - to ensure companies are financially fit to run. Prices for oil and gas have soared in recent months, fuelled by the lifting of lockdowns and the Ukraine war. Food and fuel costs are also rising, with consumer prices increasing at their fastest rate in 40 years. The typical UK energy billis set to see a further rise of Â£800 in October, when the energy price cap - the maximum price which suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales - increases again.

"Gustavo Petro is a former guerrilla and mayor of the capital city of Bogota Gustavo Petro, the former mayor of Bogota and ex-rebel fighter, has become Colombia's first left-wing president. Mr Petro, a current senator, defeated the right-wing construction magnate Rodolfo HernÃ¡ndez in Sunday's run-off election. Figures show he took 50.5% of votes, defeating his millionaire rival by a close margin of around 700,000 ballots. The result marks a major change for the country, which for decades has been led by moderates and conservatives. The vote was held amid widespread discontent at the way the country has been run, and there were anti-government protests last year in which dozens of people died. The 62-year-old Mr Petro hailed what he called a ""victory for God and for the people"". ""May so much suffering be cushioned by the joy that today floods the heart of the homeland,"" Mr Petro wrote on Twitter. ""Today is the day of the streets and squares."" His running mate Francia Marquez, a single mother and former housekeeper, will become the country's first black woman vice-president. Supporters of Gustavo Petro celebrated his victory In a video posted to social media, Mr Hernandez, whoran a non-traditional campaign that relied heavily on TikTok and other social media,conceded to Mr Petro. ""I accept the results of this election,"" he said. ""I hope that Mr Gustavo Petro knows how to run the country and is faithful to his discourse against corruption,"" he added. President Ivan Duque, who was barred from seeking re-election by Colombia's term limits, said on Twitter that he had called Mr Petro to congratulate him. He added that they had ""agreed to meet in the coming days to initiate a harmonious, institutional and transparent transition"". Mr Petro was a member of the now disbanded M-19 movement in the 1980s. The rebel left-wing group was one of many guerrilla organisations that waged war against the state. He spent time in jail for illegal arms possession, before joining the political opposition where he served as both a senator and congressman as well as mayor of Bogota. Mr Petro ran on a radical manifesto and pledged during the campaign to fight inequality by providing free university education, pension reforms and high taxes on unproductive land. He also pledged to fully implement a 2016 peace deal that ended a 50-year long conflict with the communist guerrilla group, Farc, and to seek negotiations with the still-active ELN rebels. At Gustavo's results party, the atmosphere is electric. On stage, and in the crowds, people here are dancing salsa - enjoying every moment of an election like no other. In a country that experienced decades of civil conflict, Gustavo Petro's critics highlighted his role as a former rebel, arguing his economic plans would spell disaster for the country. But his promises of inclusion and addressing poverty resonated with this deeply unequal country. For Ana Beatriz Acevedo, who represents displaced Afro-Colombian women, the election marks a major change for the country. ""One of the problems this country has is inequality - in black and indigenous communities, among women,"" she said. ""And they (Petro and Marquez) represent that difference - one is mixed race, one is black - and both believe in inclusion."" It's often a clichÃ© to call elections historic but these really are - it's a huge departure for this conservative country and says a lot about how much the country has changed. Now Colombia will have its first ever leftist leader and alongside him, the first ever black vice-president - and that speaks volumes about the desire for a different political path. The campaign marked Mr Petro's third run for the presidency. He finished fourth in 2010, and was comfortably defeated in a run-off by Mr Duque in 2018. While some of his proposals have startled investors - including a planned ban on new oil projects - many voters said they voted for him to tackle some of Colombia's intractable problems, such as corruption, widespread poverty and a surge in political violence. But Mr Petro will face challenges from a fragmented congress, which includes representatives of more than a dozen parties. ""Given current levels of polarisation and existing political, economic, social and humanitarian crises, the Petro government will face significant challenges,"" Prof Arlene Tickner, an international relations lecturer at Universidad del Rosario in BogotÃ¡, told the BBC. ""An important first step that has already been taken by the president-elect is to initiate efforts to build a broad national coalition in order to enhance his governability.""

"Olly Stephens It was only after Olly Stephens was murdered, in a field outside his home in Reading, that his mum and dad realised the violent and disturbing world their son had been exposed to through his phone. For BBC Panorama, reporter Marianna Spring investigates the role social media played in his death and exposes how a 13-year-old's social media accounts can be recommended violent videos and knives for sale. Last January, Amanda and Stuart Stephens watched their son from separate windows as he left home, not realising it would be the last time. Olly wandered over to a field, Bugs Bottom, opposite their house - sliders on his feet, his phone in hand. Fifteen minutes later, he had been murdered. That phone he was holding would provide the answers to what had happened. Olly was stabbed to death by two teenage boys in a field behind his house, after they recruited a girl online to lure him there. The entire attack had been planned on social media and triggered by a dispute in a social media chat group. His parents were shocked to discover the murky world of violence and hate that their son and his friends had inhabited through their phones. I decided to investigate the role social media played in what happened to Olly - and what 13-year-olds like him are being exposed to. ""They hunted him, tracked him and executed him through social media,"" Stuart tells me as we sit together on their sofa in their home in Reading. ""Social media is not guilty of the murder, but it did nothing to protect him, and without it he'd still be here."" Olly with his dad, Stuart Olly with his mum, Amanda Thames Valley Police say Olly's story stands out because of the huge role social media played in the case. And they fear that the evidence of bullying, and violent videos featuring knives found on the killers' phones, is just ""the tip of a very large iceberg"". I set out to uncover what young teenagers are seeing on social media by creating a fake account as a 13-year-old on five social media sites popular with that age group. Using an AI-generated photograph, we set up accounts for a 13-year-old boy, consulting one of Olly's friends and public accounts belonging to young teenagers in Reading. We wanted to see what a 13-year-old engaging with popular topics for his age - from sport and gaming to drill music and anti-knife crime content - would be exposed to and recommended. We also wanted to test whether social media sites moderate videos and images of knives similar to those shared by the children convicted of murdering Olly. After running our dummy account experiment for two weeks, with it liking and following content suggested across the social media sites, as well as his original interests - the results were striking: On Instagram, YouTube and Facebook, our 13-year-old account was recommended content such as people showing off knives, knives for sale and posts glorifying violence When we used our profile to actively look for anti-knife crime content, the 13-year-old's account was exposed to pro-knife groups, videos and pages on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube No action was taken against a post showing off a knife on 13-year-old's account on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat. Tik Tok, however, did remove the content for violating its guidelines on dangerous acts, and the account was warned it was close to being suspended When Olly left the house that day he reassured Amanda he had his phone location switched on, so she'd know where he was. It was the Sunday after Christmas, and the family were preparing to go back to work and school the next day. Amanda expected Olly back before dark. But shortly after he left home there was a knock on the door. It was a boy Olly knew. Amanda couldn't quite take in what he was saying. ""I thought, 'Did he just say Olly's been stabbed?'"" Stuart and Olly's older sister dashed out to the field opposite their home, where Olly was lying in a pool of blood. Amanda followed after them. ""I just held his hand and asked him not to leave me,"" Stuart says. Friends, neighbours, dog walkers all tried to help, but it was too late. He died in that field. ""I still look for his feet in the morning at the end of the bed because they would hang over the end,"" Stuart says. Not seeing them there hits him every time. Olly's bed is still made up with his favourite duvet cover. Amanda still buys him sweets, and when she vacuums Olly's room - something he used to hate - she still mutters, ""I'll only be a minute."" Olly's bedroom is filled with cards from well-wishers - his teddy Tarzan is on his bed Just before he was murdered, Olly had been diagnosed with autism and, at that time, he most enjoyed gaming and listening to music in his bedroom. The night after his murder, looking through social media posts about Olly and screengrabs his friends shared with their daughter, Stuart and Amanda began to realise the role social media had played in what happened. ""It's this secret world where you can do and say exactly what you want,"" Amanda says. ""It was a world that we had no idea existed [and] that he was being attacked by it."" Amanda, who would normally use the tracker on Olly's phone to make sure he made it home safely, now found herself using it to check his phone made it into the hands of the police. She followed the signal as it travelled with Olly's body to hospital and then again when it was taken to Thames Valley police station. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Howard was tasked with investigating the world inside that phone. It's a case he describes as unprecedented because 90% of the evidence at Olly's murder trial came from mobile phones - and no child witnesses had to take the stand. ""We were really taken aback by the amount of digital evidence,"" he explains. There was enough to convict two boys - aged 13 and 14 at the time - of murder last November. The 13-year-old girl who led him to the park was convicted of manslaughter. WatchPanorama - A Social Media Murder: Olly's Storyat 8pm on BBC One What struck the police initially about the mountain of videos, photos and screengrabs they began to sift through was the persona that 13- and 14-year-olds linked to the case were presenting online, so at odds with the suburban reality they were living. There were images shared on Instagram of people holding knives, with balaclavas on and hoods up. The police also found videos of knives being flicked and shown off, and of boys linked to Olly's murder attacking one another, which DCI Howard told Panorama he believes were being shared ""openly and very regularly"" on Instagram and Snapchat. ""There is certainly a very unhealthy attraction to filming, recording, acts of really quite serious violence,"" DCI Andy Howard says. It was a video posted on Snapchat showing an attack called ""patterning"" that was the catalyst in a chain of events that led to Olly losing his life. Thames Valley Police explained that patterning is the humiliation of a young person which is filmed or photographed and then shared on social media. It's forwarded on and on, shared across different social media sites, multiplying the embarrassment for the victim. In the weeks before he was killed, Olly had seen an image of a younger boy being humiliated and tried to alert the boy's older brother by forwarding it on to him. When two boys who were in a Snapchat group with Olly became aware he had passed it on, they were furious. DCI Howard says those boys thought Olly had been ""snitching, grassing on them"", and that led to the fallout. Police also found hundreds of Snapchat voice notes from the two boys who fell out with Olly. In them, they discuss attacking Olly and try to recruit a girl to set him up. The 13-year-old girl who agreed to do this knew Olly in real life, and had met the two boys involved online. Although they all lived locally, they met for the first time on the day of the murder. The language those convicted used in the voice notes is shocking, with comments like, ""You're going to die tomorrow Olly,"" and ""I'll just give him bangs [hit him] or stab him."" What's also chilling is their casual and cold tone. In one voice note, the girl says, ""[Male 2] wants me to set him up so then [Male 2] is gonna bang him and pattern him and shit. I'm so excited you don't understand."" None of these voice notes appear to have been picked up by Snapchat - and under the social media app's own policy, it's not possible to report a private message or voice note like this to the site, only the account sending it. The evidence gathered by the police is just the information required to prosecute - but DCI Andy Howard fears they have only scratched the surface in this case. In his view, it's likely those involved were regularly exposed to violent content - and desensitised to it. A recent study by the Huddersfield University's Applied Criminology and Policing Centre backs up that idea, finding that social media was a key factor in almost a quarter of crimes committed by under-18s. Most of these were acts of violence that started with confrontation online. In our own investigation, within two weeks of following the kind of content 13-year-olds in Reading follow on their accounts, our imaginary teenager was recommended posts of people showing off knives, knives for sale and videos glorifying violence. That happened on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube - while on TikTok and Snapchat, the accounts were not recommended this kind of content. All of these social media sites say that they protect teenage users. Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, says it restricts what under-18s can see of ""content that attempts to buy or sell bladed weapons"". YouTube says it ""may add an age restriction"" to content that includes ""harmful or dangerous acts that minors could imitate"". Our account only encountered one video with an age restriction. Some of the images and videos of knives were similar to those found on the phones of Olly's killers. We wanted to test what happens when a 13-year-old shares a post like that on social media. Our fake accounts were private, so as not to expose anyone else to this image and video of a knife. No action was taken against the post showing off a knife that was shared on the 13-year-old's account on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat. Tik Tok, however, did remove the post for violating its guidelines on dangerous acts - and the account was warned that it was close to being suspended. That suggests it is possible to detect and remove this type of content shared by a profile under 18. We have now deactivated the accounts. Our experiment revealed something else striking. Some adverts being promoted to the account on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram were based on his interests and, at times, age-appropriate. That seems to suggest that data from young teenage users can be used to target them - but then isn't being used to protect them from harmful content showing knives and violence. I wanted to know if the posts pushed to the 13-year-old's account were typical of what teenagers would see so I met up with Olly's friends Poppy, Patrick, Izzy, Jacob and Ben at Olly's memorial bench, metres from where he was stabbed. Ben had helped me set up the fake account. He and Olly's other friends told me they started using social media long before they turned 13, the age you have to be to sign up to most of the platforms. They all say there were no attempts to verify their ages. Olly's parents say he, too, joined them before he was 13. Ben, Jacob, Marianna, Poppy, Izzy and Patrick on Olly's memorial bench I showed them several screen grabs from the accounts, without exposing them to too much of the content we've been recommended. But the children weren't shocked by the results at all - and admitted they all see knives and violence regularly on their social media feeds. ""I've seen bigger knives to be honest,"" Jacob says of his own social media accounts. ""We get exposed more to people kind of showing [them] off,"" Poppy explains, talking about the image people her age try to portray mainly on Instagram, as well as Snapchat. Ben has seen Rambo knives, and Izzy butterfly blades, which she thinks people share because they are colourful and more appealing. They all also describe being exposed to cyberbullying on a regular basis - including ""patterning"" - humiliation videos like the one that triggered the dispute between Olly and the boys who killed him. All of the social media sites expressed their sympathies to Olly's family. Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, says that they ""don't allow content that threatens, encourages or coordinates violence"" and that they have ""a well-established process to support police investigations"" as they did in Olly's case. They ""will urgently investigate the examples raised in this investigation"". YouTube says it has ""strict existing policies in place to ensure that our platform is not used to incite violence"". TikTok says ""There is no such thing as 'job done' when it comes to protecting our users, particularly young people"" and it will ""continue to build policies and tools"" to help teens and their parents stay safe online. Snapchat says they ""strictly prohibit bullying, harassment and any illegal activity"" and ""provide confidential in-app reporting tools"" on the site. Amanda and Stuart want answers - and solutions - to protect other 13-year-olds on social media, and they want legislators to listen. Stuart and Amanda Stephens feel more should be done to protect teenagers like Olly on social media The online safety bill is currently passing through Parliament. ""This bill is about keeping children and young people safe,"" Secretary of State Nadine Dorries tells me. She wasn't shocked to see the results of our experiment. ""These platforms know that knife content is being sent to young people's social media feeds,"" she says. ""They can actually put what is wrong right now."" Stuart and Amanda fear that the bill in its current form wouldn't have saved Olly. They want to see more done to verify the age of young users and to limit their exposure to harmful posts - even if the content might be legal, like the violent videos and images of knives our dummy account was recommended. Dorries says exactly what is considered harmful but legal will be specified soon. But how exactly could the bill force social media sites to address this? ""I think it's probably easier to keep to the core principle of the bill,"" Dorries says. ""The UK has to be the safest country in the world for children and young people to be online."" The Government is promising harsh penalties if companies don't comply. ""We will have the power to issue multi-billion pound fines and make sure that people within those organisations are criminally liable,"" says Dorries. Meanwhile, Amanda says she feels social media companies are not facing up to the reality of what's happening. ""Forget your profits, kids are killing each other,"" Stuart says.

"Dr Emma Houghton, a GP at Laurencekirk Healthcare Centre in Aberdeenshire, is seeing patient demand soar Social care shortages are leaving community health services overwhelmed, doctors have warned. Increased demand and staff shortages mean at-home and care home services across Scotland are overstretched. One GP working in a project to prevent vulnerable people from going to hospital unnecessarily said ""things are becoming potentially unsafe"". The Scottish government said it was making record levels of investment in social care. A lack of available social care support in the community has been one of the drivers for an increase in so-called bed blocking, where patients are not able to be discharged from hospital despite being fit to leave. Bed blocking: Five years in hospital 'is like dad being stolen' NHS Scotland's 'biggest crisis' in five charts More than 550,000 on Scottish hospital waiting lists BBC Scotland spent time with an initiative in the town of Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire, which aims to reduce bed blocking. Known as a ""virtual community ward"", every day at Laurencekirk health centre a meeting takes place to discuss vulnerable patients who may need additional help and are at risk of being admitted to hospital. The group - which includes GPs, nurses,  physiotherapists and social workers - can each draw attention to patients they're concerned about and then assign the right people to follow up and take action. Prior to the pandemic, the group was preventing 600 hospital admissions a year but it is getting harder according to Dr Emma Houghton, a GP at Laurencekirk Healthcare Centre. She said: ""I think the satisfaction of doing the best that you can for a patient - that's why we all came into this job. ""It's the frustrations when you can't because the system pressures is difficult. ""That's what we're struggling with at the moment as a profession, where things are becoming potentially unsafe, because we're overwhelmed."" This video can not be played Elsie Johnston, 95, says being able to stay in her own home is very important to her Elsie Johnston has lived in the same house in Laurencekirk for more than 40 years but she couldn't stay there without the help of her carers. The 95-year-old needs four visits a day given her complex needs, but is grateful for the fact it keeps her in her own home. ""Carers get me up in the morning and put me down to bed at night,"" she said. ""It's very important, people come in to see me here when they wouldn't come to a hospital."" The experts in the virtual community ward project also agree it is important to keep Elsie at home. ""She has the maximum amount of care that we can provide and so far it's working at keeping her at home,"" explained district nurse Jackie Kirk. ""A hospital setting is not the right setting for Elsie. Being at home with friends and family is hugely important."" District Nurse, Jackie Kirk, says hospital is not the right setting for Elsie But it's more than that for Elsie according to healthcare assistant, Wendy Craig. She said: ""She gets frightened if she thinks she has got to be admitted to hospital. ""Elsie grew up in the area where I live, so she always asks me about it. She lived on a farm there. I'm a link with her past. ""She just likes to chat because then it's maybe a few hours before she sees anybody again."" Recent NHS figures show there's been an increase in the number of people facing a delay in being discharged from Scotland's hospitals. In April there were 53,604 days spent in hospital by people whose discharge was delayed. This is an increase of 64% compared with the number of delayed days in April last year. Cameron Matthew, divisional general manager of surgical services for NHS Grampian, sees the impact of this every day at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, which operates at about 95% capacity most days. He said: ""In any given day, there'll be 50 patients who are delayed transfers of care. So that's a ward and a bit, and that will have an impact on our ability to do planned care. ""I think the biggest challenge we have is access to care packages out in the community, access to care home beds and access to community hospital beds. That gap of unavailability of care packages for these patients slows down the whole of the system. ""I will say I've not seen it like this in my career. I've had about 30 years of working in the NHS and I've not seen us have as many patients backed up in ambulances and having to cancel operations to the same extent."" The Scottish government said it was already taking action to ease the pressures on social care services. Kevin Stewart, the minister for social care, said the government was committed to establishing a National Care Service. ""We have committed to increasing social care funding by Â£800m by the end of the parliament,"" he added. ""We are investing in social care workers, increasing the minimum hourly rate of pay to Â£10.50 per hour. And we are working to establish clearer options for a career pathway  for staff."" We are seeing a steady increase in the number of hospital beds taken up by patients who are medically ready to go home, but also a significant increase in the length of time they are staying. This is an indication of how much pressure community health services are facing. Sometimes it's because care packages are complex and there are shortages of district nurses, social work staff, occupational therapists and physios to put them in place. In some places it is capacity in care homes or in rehabilitation facilities. But the biggest issue is a huge shortage of carers who ensure people have their basic needs met. The Scottish government has plans to improve social care and will introduce legislation for a new National Care Service by this summer. But this will take time to deliver. In the meantime demand is soaring with an acute shortage of people to deliver care now.

"Gustavo Petro is a former guerrilla and mayor of the capital city of Bogota Gustavo Petro, the former mayor of Bogota and ex-rebel fighter, has become Colombia's first left-wing president. Mr Petro, a current senator, defeated the right-wing construction magnate Rodolfo HernÃ¡ndez in Sunday's run-off election. Figures show he took 50.5% of votes, defeating his millionaire rival by a close margin of around 700,000 ballots. The result marks a major change for the country, which for decades has been led by moderates and conservatives. The vote was held amid widespread discontent at the way the country has been run, and there were anti-government protests last year in which dozens of people died. The 62-year-old Mr Petro hailed what he called a ""victory for God and for the people"". ""May so much suffering be cushioned by the joy that today floods the heart of the homeland,"" Mr Petro wrote on Twitter. ""Today is the day of the streets and squares."" His running mate Francia Marquez, a single mother and former housekeeper, will become the country's first black woman vice-president. Supporters of Gustavo Petro celebrated his victory In a video posted to social media, Mr Hernandez, whoran a non-traditional campaign that relied heavily on TikTok and other social media,conceded to Mr Petro. ""I accept the results of this election,"" he said. ""I hope that Mr Gustavo Petro knows how to run the country and is faithful to his discourse against corruption,"" he added. President Ivan Duque, who was barred from seeking re-election by Colombia's term limits, said on Twitter that he had called Mr Petro to congratulate him. He added that they had ""agreed to meet in the coming days to initiate a harmonious, institutional and transparent transition"". Mr Petro was a member of the now disbanded M-19 movement in the 1980s. The rebel left-wing group was one of many guerrilla organisations that waged war against the state. He spent time in jail for illegal arms possession, before joining the political opposition where he served as both a senator and congressman as well as mayor of Bogota. Mr Petro ran on a radical manifesto and pledged during the campaign to fight inequality by providing free university education, pension reforms and high taxes on unproductive land. He also pledged to fully implement a 2016 peace deal that ended a 50-year long conflict with the communist guerrilla group, Farc, and to seek negotiations with the still-active ELN rebels. At Gustavo's results party, the atmosphere is electric. On stage, and in the crowds, people here are dancing salsa - enjoying every moment of an election like no other. In a country that experienced decades of civil conflict, Gustavo Petro's critics highlighted his role as a former rebel, arguing his economic plans would spell disaster for the country. But his promises of inclusion and addressing poverty resonated with this deeply unequal country. For Ana Beatriz Acevedo, who represents displaced Afro-Colombian women, the election marks a major change for the country. ""One of the problems this country has is inequality - in black and indigenous communities, among women,"" she said. ""And they (Petro and Marquez) represent that difference - one is mixed race, one is black - and both believe in inclusion."" It's often a clichÃ© to call elections historic but these really are - it's a huge departure for this conservative country and says a lot about how much the country has changed. Now Colombia will have its first ever leftist leader and alongside him, the first ever black vice-president - and that speaks volumes about the desire for a different political path. The campaign marked Mr Petro's third run for the presidency. He finished fourth in 2010, and was comfortably defeated in a run-off by Mr Duque in 2018. While some of his proposals have startled investors - including a planned ban on new oil projects - many voters said they voted for him to tackle some of Colombia's intractable problems, such as corruption, widespread poverty and a surge in political violence. But Mr Petro will face challenges from a fragmented congress, which includes representatives of more than a dozen parties. ""Given current levels of polarisation and existing political, economic, social and humanitarian crises, the Petro government will face significant challenges,"" Prof Arlene Tickner, an international relations lecturer at Universidad del Rosario in BogotÃ¡, told the BBC. ""An important first step that has already been taken by the president-elect is to initiate efforts to build a broad national coalition in order to enhance his governability.""

"Colin Furze has been making the tunnel for about a year A YouTuber has won retrospective planning permission to burrow a tunnel between his house and shed. Colin Furze spent three years digging the passage by hand under his Lincolnshire garden without permission. The subterranean structure lies 1.2m (4ft) beneath the surface and could eventually also connect to a special underground bunker he has built. Mr Furze, from Stamford, said he wanted to do it because he thought ""it would be cool"". Planning documents from South Kesteven District Council show the bunker was granted permission eight years ago. However, tunnels to connect his house, shed and bunker did not have permission. ""The proposal is partially retrospective with a large portion of the tunnelling works having been carried out,"" the document stated. Mr Furze has been documenting his progress to his 12 million YouTube followers after beginning the tunnelling project in November 2018. Initially, the tunnel was a secret but millions have since watched his exploits, with the tunnel currently connecting his kitchen pantry with his shed. He said the response had been positive, adding: ""If you ask people about tunnels, they love them"". The tunnel has been supported using steel and concrete Mr Furze said he built his bunker in 2015and turned it into the ""ultimate man cave"" with a flat-screen TV, drum kit and several video consoles, which was a childhood dream of his. ""I thought wouldn't it be amazing if I could get to the bunker without having to walk down the path outside?"" he said. He said the next part of his plans will see a digger used to connect the shed with the bunker - a distance of about 15m (49 ft) - providing further planning permission is granted. A track system was installed to help move soil away as he dug his tunnel The tunnel has been built in stages which has included lighting, ventilation shafts and a track to help move soil away. A planning inspector visited after the plans were shared widely on Facebook, bringing the project to the attention of the council. The parish council strongly objected to the plans which it said would cause concern regarding health and safety and subsidence. A condition was added to the granting of permission that further work was subject to the ""ground and constructions structural integrity being investigated"".

"Sara Duterte took the oath standing beside her parents, including her father President Rodrigo Duterte The eldest daughter of outgoing Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has been sworn in as vice-president. Sara Duterte vowed to unite the Philippines at a ceremony in Davao. It was there that the 44-year-old took over from her father as the city's mayor over a decade ago - before pursuing a career in national politics. She took the oath beside her running mate, Ferdinand Marcos Junior, who will soon replace her father as president. ""The days ahead may be full of challenges that call for us to be more united as a nation,"" Ms Duterte said. Her six-year term in office alongside Ferdinand Marcos Junior will formally begin on 30 June. As candidates in May's elections the pair shored up historic landslide victories by forging a powerful alliance and running on a message of unity that helped many of their allies win power elsewhere in government too. In the Philippines, the president and vice-president are elected separately. Mr Duterte is a controversial ""strongman"" figure who came to power in 2016 promising to reduce crime and fix the country's drug crisis. But critics say that during his five years in power, Mr Duterte has encouraged police to carry out thousands of extrajudicial killings of suspects in what he has called his ""war on drugs"". The International Criminal Court has called for a formal probeinto the thousands of killings that happened during the deadly crackdown. Mr Duterte had initially said he would stand as vice-president, before changing his mind last month andannouncing his retirement from politics. On Sunday he stood beside his daughter as she was sworn in to the new role. Ferdinand Marcos Junior - known by the nickname Bongbong - also attended the ceremony. Like his future vice-president, he too is the son of a former Philippines leader. His disgraced father, with whom he shares a name, was driven from power as the country's dictator in a 1986 uprising. What a Marcos revival means for the Philippines The man attempting to revive a corrupt dynasty Bongbong's election means that the Marcos family will now return after 36 years to power at the MalacaÃ±ang - or presidential palace. The Marcos family has never apologised for the abuses of the old dictatorship, nor given back much of the treasure they are accused of stealing from the national purse.
