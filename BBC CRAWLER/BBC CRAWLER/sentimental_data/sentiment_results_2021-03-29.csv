"A French drug maker has been found guilty of aggravated deceit and involuntary manslaughter over a weight loss pill at the centre of a major health scandal. The drug Mediator was developed for use in overweight diabetics and was on the market for 33 years. It was eventually withdrawn in 2009 over concerns it could cause serious heart problems. Hundreds of people are believed to have died as a result of the drug. Around five million people were prescribed the medicine over the course of three decades, despite various warnings over its side effects. French trial on fatal weight-loss drug begins France braced for drug scandal report France pledges drug system reform Thousands of plaintiffs were involved in the trial, which began in 2019. Drug maker Servier had denied any knowledge of Mediator's side effects but a court on Monday issued it with a fine of  â¬2.7m (Â£2.3m, $3.2m). ""Although they knew about the risks for many years... they never took the necessary measures,"" judge Sylvie Daunis said. The company's former deputy chairman, Jean-Philippe Seta, was also given a four-year suspended prison sentence. France's medical regulator, meanwhile, was fined more than â¬300,000 for its role in the scandal. The judge found the body had ""seriously failed"" in its duties, according to the AFP news agency. Ahead of Monday's verdict, French pulmonologist Dr IrÃ¨ne Frachon, who is credited with exposing the drug's side effects, told AFP that she hoped the ruling would ""give us the tools to understand how such deceit could have gone on for so long"". A number of other European countries, including Italy and Spain, banned Mediator in the early 2000s. In France, however, it continued to be offered to diabetics and other patients as an appetite suppressant. One study concluded that 500 deaths could be linked to Mediator between 1976 and 2009. A second one put the figure at 2,000.

"David Cameron stepped down as PM after the Brexit referendum in 2016 Labour has called on a standards watchdog to investigate the extent of government access offered to financial services firm Greensill Capital. The party wants the Committee on Standards in Public Life to examine the role played by the firm's founder in David Cameron's coalition government. The Sunday Times claimed Lex Greensill had been given ""privileged access"" to Whitehall departments under the ex-PM. Neither Mr Greensill nor Mr Cameron has commented on the matter. Minister defends Cameron as 'a man of integrity' Labour seeks probe over Cameron Greensill lobbying Ex-PM Cameron cleared by lobbying watchdog Labour said the reports raised questions about transparency rules. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was ""no suggestion"" the former prime minister ""could not pursue another career after politics"". He added that he did not think Mr Cameron ""did anything wrong"", but the government was ""always reviewing the rules"" and ""looking at new circumstances... trying to improve the existing rules and improve the system"". In its letter, Labour asked the committee to examine Mr Cameron's reported role in lobbying the government on behalf of the firm after he left office. It has previously been reported that Mr Cameron, who became an adviser to Greensill in 2018, unsuccessfully tried to increase the specialist bank's involvement in a scheme offering government-backed loans to companies struggling due to the Covid pandemic. Greensill, which went bust recently, wasaccredited to supply,externallending under the government's Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS). Mr Cameron wascleared this weekby a lobbying watchdog, which looked at whether he should have declared himself on the register of consultant lobbyists over work he had done for the firm since leaving Downing Street. Over the weekend, the Sunday Times reported that Greensill's founder, Lex Greensill, was given access to various government departments during Mr Cameron's time in No 10. The newspaper said Mr Greensill had been promoting a financial product for pharmacists. The Pharmacy Early Payment Scheme, announced in 2012, saw banks swiftly reimburse pharmacists for providing NHS prescriptions, for a fee, before recovering the money from the government. Greensill Capital went on to provide funds for the scheme. Labour said the reports raised ""serious questions about the level of extensive access to ministers and departments he was granted and the role Mr Cameron played in securing it"". In a letter to its chair, independent peer Lord Evans, the party said the Committee on Standards in Public Life should ask why Mr Greensill's role promoting the scheme had not been ""announced internally or publicly"". Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds, who co-wrote Labour's letter along with shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves, also called on the committee to look into the decision to accredit Greensill to the CLBILS loan scheme. The pair suggested the committee should look at ""whether proper due diligence was undertaken on the firm's financial health by government"". They added that taxpayers ""deserve to know the true extent of access to this current Conservative government that was afforded to Greensill Capital through the former prime minister"". Replying to their letter, Lord Evans said his committee ""is an advisory body and does not have a remit to investigate individual cases"". But he added the committee would welcome suggestions from the party on improving transparency rules as part of an existing inquiry due to report in the autumn. A government spokesman said Mr Greensill had previously acted as a supply-chain finance adviser and crown representative - adding the appointment had been unpaid and was approved in the normal manner.

"This video can not be played (29 March 2021) The stranded container ship is seen finally on the move and no longer blocking the canal Traffic has resumed in Egypt's Suez Canal after a stranded container ship blocking it for nearly a week was finally freed by salvage crews. Tug boats honked their horns in celebration as the 400m-long (1,300ft) Ever Given was dislodged on Monday with the help of dredgers. Hundreds of ships are waiting to pass through the canal which links the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. It is one of the world's busiest trade routes. The cost of the Suez Canal blockage How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal Peter Berdowski, CEO of Dutch salvage company Boskalis, said the Ever Given had been refloated at 15:05 (13:05 GMT) on Monday, ""thereby making free passage through the Suez Canal possible again"". Egyptian officials say the backlog of ships waiting to transit through should be cleared in around three days, but experts believe the knock-on effect on global shipping could take weeks or even months to resolve. The Ever Given on the move on Monday Salvage teams had faced a daunting challenge after the 200,000-tonne ship ran aground last Tuesday morning in high winds and a sandstorm which reduced visibility. A Dutch specialist team, SMIT, oversaw a flotilla of 13 tugs, small but powerful vessels that can shift large ships, as they tried to dislodge the Ever Given. Dredgers were brought in and dug 30,000 cubic metres of mud and sand from beneath the ends of the ship. Over the weekend, it was feared that some of the ship's cargo of some 18,000 containers would have to be removed in order to lighten the load. But high tides helped the tugs and dredgers in their work and early on Monday, the stern (rear of the ship) was freed and the great ship swung across the canal, to shouts of celebration. Hours later, the bow (front) too came unstuck, and the Ever Given was able to move out. The vessel was towed to the Great Bitter Lake, which sits between two sections of the canal to the north of the salvage site, where it will undergo safety checks. A marine source told Reuters news agency on Monday evening that ships were travelling southwards towards the Red Sea while canal services provider Leth Agencies said vessels had resumed transit from the Great Bitter Lake. Some ships have already left the region, preferring to take an alternative, longer route around the southern tip of Africa. Inevitably, cargoes will be reaching their destination much later than planned. There may be congestion when they arrive in port, while future sailing schedules have been thrown into disarray, The cost of shipping goods to Europe is expected to rise as a result, BBC Business Correspondent Theo Leggett reports. Shipping group Maersk saidthe ""ripple effects on global capacity and equipment"" were significant,external. ""There'll be an investigation, clearly, because this has had such a big impact and exactly what's happened here, I think, will be debated for some time,"" Marcus Baker, global head of marine and cargo at Marsh Inc, told Reuters. ""What do we do going forward to ensure it doesn't happen again? Again, I would leave that to the competent authorities that are in Egypt to decide how they want to make sure that traffic transits safely through the canal because, look, it's in their interest to do that."" By Sally Nabil, BBC Arabic bilingual correspondent, Port of Suez Spirits here are quite high. There's a strong sense of achievement. Some experts had warned that it might take weeks to free the Ever Given. But the high tide, as well as the specialist equipment brought in, all helped the rescue operation. Now the authorities will have to address another challenge - congestion. The head of the Suez Canal Authority said that hundreds of stranded vessels would be allowed through the canal on a first-come-first-served basis, though there might be some exceptions to specific ships, based on the types of goods on board. The blockage put the authorities under immense pressure, given the major impact it had on global trade. For Egyptians, the canal is not only a source of national pride, but it also provides the economy with much needed foreign currency. A couple of days ago, I asked Osama Rabie, the head of the Suez Canal Authority, whether he was concerned that some shipping companies might be discouraged from sending such giant ships through the canal in the future. He replied that there was no alternative to the Suez Canal, which he said was fast and safe. So, it's not just about time here, but also about security. It will now undergo a full inspection at the Great Bitter Lake, the vessel's technical managers, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said. It said there had been no reports of pollution or cargo damage, and initial investigations had ruled out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding last week. The ship's Indian crew of 25 remaining aboard the vessel are safe and in good health, BSM said, adding: ""Their hard work and tireless professionalism are greatly appreciated."" The ship's containers are carrying a huge variety of items and the insured value of the cargo is believed to amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We're building up our own long-term UK manufacturing capabilities"" Tens of millions of doses of the Novavax vaccine will now be produced and packaged in north-east England, the prime minister has announced. Boris Johnson said a deal had been agreed with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to bottle 60 million doses at its facility in Barnard Castle, County Durham. GSK said it hoped the ""fill and finish"" process can begin as early as May. In January, it was announced the vaccine would bemanufactured at the Fujifilm plant in Billingham. Novavax is currently being assessed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The biotech company behind it, also called Novavax, recently announced its vaccine was 86% effective against the Kent variant of Covid-19 and 96% effective in preventing cases caused by the original strain. Mr Johnson said: ""I'm delighted by GSK's investment, which shows the strength of UK manufacturing, and will further boost our vaccine rollout. ""The Vaccines Taskforce has worked hand in glove with business to successfully deliver vaccines to the whole of the UK, and this agreement will continue to support our approach. ""We remain on track to offer a first jab to all over 50s by 15 April, and all adults by the end of July, and I want to once again encourage everyone to come forward for a vaccine when you're called."" The news that the Novavax vaccine is going to go through a process known as fill and finish in the UK is an interesting development. Fill and finish is the process by which vaccines are packaged up in vials, ready to be sent out to vaccination clinics. The original plan was for this to be done in Europe once the vaccine product was manufactured by plants in the north east. But a deal has been struck with drug firm GSK to do that here. Officially, the government is saying that it is all part of their investment in the British life science industry. But given the threats from Europe about restricting exports of vaccines, it begs all sorts of other questions too. The north east plants have already started manufacturing the 60m doses ordered by the government. If it gets approval by the regulator - expected in the coming weeks - supplies could be available in June. Roger Connor, president of GSK vaccines, said: ""GSK is delighted to support Novavax and the UK Vaccines Taskforce with this manufacturing arrangement for the UK and our Barnard Castle facility is now undertaking the rapid preparation work required to manufacture up to 60 million doses of this vaccine. ""We have ensured that we can deliver these volumes without impacting supply of our other vital medicines and vaccines, and without disruption to the other Covid-19 collaborations GSK is engaged in globally.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We're building up our own long-term UK manufacturing capabilities"" Tens of millions of doses of the Novavax vaccine will now be produced and packaged in north-east England, the prime minister has announced. Boris Johnson said a deal had been agreed with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to bottle 60 million doses at its facility in Barnard Castle, County Durham. GSK said it hoped the ""fill and finish"" process can begin as early as May. In January, it was announced the vaccine would bemanufactured at the Fujifilm plant in Billingham. Novavax is currently being assessed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The biotech company behind it, also called Novavax, recently announced its vaccine was 86% effective against the Kent variant of Covid-19 and 96% effective in preventing cases caused by the original strain. Mr Johnson said: ""I'm delighted by GSK's investment, which shows the strength of UK manufacturing, and will further boost our vaccine rollout. ""The Vaccines Taskforce has worked hand in glove with business to successfully deliver vaccines to the whole of the UK, and this agreement will continue to support our approach. ""We remain on track to offer a first jab to all over 50s by 15 April, and all adults by the end of July, and I want to once again encourage everyone to come forward for a vaccine when you're called."" The news that the Novavax vaccine is going to go through a process known as fill and finish in the UK is an interesting development. Fill and finish is the process by which vaccines are packaged up in vials, ready to be sent out to vaccination clinics. The original plan was for this to be done in Europe once the vaccine product was manufactured by plants in the north east. But a deal has been struck with drug firm GSK to do that here. Officially, the government is saying that it is all part of their investment in the British life science industry. But given the threats from Europe about restricting exports of vaccines, it begs all sorts of other questions too. The north east plants have already started manufacturing the 60m doses ordered by the government. If it gets approval by the regulator - expected in the coming weeks - supplies could be available in June. Roger Connor, president of GSK vaccines, said: ""GSK is delighted to support Novavax and the UK Vaccines Taskforce with this manufacturing arrangement for the UK and our Barnard Castle facility is now undertaking the rapid preparation work required to manufacture up to 60 million doses of this vaccine. ""We have ensured that we can deliver these volumes without impacting supply of our other vital medicines and vaccines, and without disruption to the other Covid-19 collaborations GSK is engaged in globally.""

"The US has warned it could put tariffs of up to 25% on a host of UK exports in retaliation for a UK tax on tech firms. Ceramics, make-up, overcoats, games consoles and furniture,externalcould all be hit, according to a list published by the Biden administration. The duties are designed to raise $325m (Â£235.8m), the amount the US believes the UK will raise from US tech firms. A UK government spokesperson said it wanted to ""make sure tech firms pay their fair share of tax"". They added: ""Should the US proceed to implement these measures, we would consider all options to defend UK interests and industry."" Washington is pressing ahead with the action, initiated under President Donald Trump, and has scheduled hearings on the list. It argues the recently introduced digital services tax - which taxes tech firms on their revenues - has ""unreasonable, discriminatory, and burdensome attributes"". US suspends tariffs on single malt Scotch whisky Sunak urges US to back digital services tax Facebook agrees to pay France â¬106m in back taxes Such actions have proceeded against similar taxes in India, Austria and Spain, but action against the European Union as a whole was dropped. The US Section 301 action is designed to apply domestic political pressure within the UK and other countries over the imposition of such taxes. The UK and US held talks about the digital services tax on 4 December, and UK government sources stressed that the tariff list was being seen as procedural, rather than an escalation. The tariffs are now subject to a consultation in the US over the next few weeks. Burberry's famous trench coats would be affected UK ceramics are on the US Trade Representative's list, including certain tiles, bathroom ware like sinks and bidets, as well as ceramics for laboratory uses. About Â£17m of these products were exported to the US in 2020, and Â£24m in 2019 before Covid. Trade group the British Ceramic Confederation said it was ""monitoring developments closely, working with UK officials"". Meanwhile Adam Mansell, head of the UK Fashion & Textile Association (UKFT), called the threat to UK-made overcoats ""hugely disappointing"", noting the US had only removed separate tariffs on other types of fashion goods, such as British cashmere last month. ""At a time when we are trying to start discussions over a UK-US trade deal, it is extremely important that both governments get around the table to remove this threat as soon as possible,"" he said. ""With the industry still struggling with the impact of Covid-19 and understanding the new trade arrangements with the EU, an additional burden on our exports couldn't come at a worse time."" At the Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility calculated the digital services tax would raise Â£300m in the current financial year, and as much as Â£700m in future years. Brought in last April it taxes at 2% the revenues - not profits - of search engines, social media services and online marketplaces which derive value from UK users. It followed years of claims in Europe and elsewhere that big tech firms do not pay enough tax in the countries where they operate. Last August, Facebook agreed to pay the French government â¬106m (Â£95.7m) in back taxes to settle a dispute over revenues earned in the country. Earlier that year, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerbergsaid he recognised the public's frustration over the amount of tax paid by tech giants. A UK government spokesperson said: ""Like many countries around the world, we want to make sure tech firms pay their fair share of tax. Our digital services tax (DST) is reasonable, proportionate and non-discriminatory. ""It's also temporary. We're working positively with the US and other international partners to find a global solution to this problem and will remove the DST when that is in place."" There are signs the Biden administration wants a more conciliatory relationship on trade with the UK than Donald Trump did. Last month, Washington agreed to suspend tariffs on UK goods, including single malt whiskies, that were imposed in retaliation over subsidies to aircraft maker Airbus. However, the UK is still lobbying the US to drop duties on British steel brought in in 2018.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We're building up our own long-term UK manufacturing capabilities"" The UK does not know ""exactly how strong"" its defences against another wave of Covid will be despite the ""impressive"" vaccine rollout, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He said cases were still rising in Europe and people ""must proceed with caution"" as lockdown eases. The PM was speaking as the stay-at-home rule came to an end in England, allowing groups to meet outdoors. He warned more deaths, infections and hospitalisations were inevitable. European countries have seen a rising number of cases in recent weeks amid a slower vaccine rollout than in the UK. Mr Johnson told a Downing Street press conference the relaxation of restrictions would be ""prized"" by people and that it was ""only because of months of sacrifice and effort that we can take this small step toward freedom"". What can I do from Monday... and what comes next? How many people can I meet now? Swimmers and golfers enjoy new freedoms Deal reached for 60m UK-made Novavax doses He added: ""The vaccine rollout has been very impressive... but what we don't know is exactly how strong our fortifications now are, how robust our defences are against another wave. ""What we need to do is to continue flat out to build the immunity of our population, build our defences against that wave when it comes."" The prime minister said: ""That's why I stress the importance of everybody maintaining the discipline people have shown for so long."" The message was loud and clear - a rise in infections is inevitable as the UK unlocks. But what is uncertain is when this will happen and what impact it will have on serious illness and deaths. A surge now would be the worst outcome. The vaccination rollout has gone very well, but people are still in the process of building up immunity and not everyone in the most at-risk groups has come forward for a jab. The vaccines, while good, are not 100% effective.  It is why ministers and their advisers are urging caution. UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says if people stick to the rules any increase could be modest. The seasons may also help - respiratory viruses thrive more in the colder months. The lower estimates of modelling done for the government suggests there could be 30,000 deaths by summer 2022. That would be in line with a bad flu winter. But it could also be much, much worse. If there is one thing we have learnt, nothing can be taken for granted with Covid. Along with England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty and the Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, Mr Johnson stressed the importance of people who had a first dose of a vaccine getting a second jab. Prof Whitty said the ""wall of vaccination"" will get stronger once people receive their second doses. But he said ""it is not a complete wall"" and highlighted risks for the UK from rising cases elsewhere - the chance of importing infections and the ""much bigger"" concern of variants which could reduce a vaccine's effectiveness. Prof Whitty said: ""If you get a very big wave, that would obviously lead to a significant impact. So that's the reason why the prime minister and ministers have been absolutely determined that this is a slow and steady unlocking, looking at data between each step."" The briefing was held for the first time from the media suite built at Downing Street at a cost of Â£2.6m. Mr Johnson announced the government had agreed adeal with UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKlinethat will see the final stage of the manufacture of up to 60 million doses of its yet-to-be approved Novavax vaccine completed in north-east England. He said Novavax, which is to beproduced at the Fujifilm plant in Stockton-on-Tees,will be finished and bottled by GSK at its facility in Barnard Castle. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? A further 4,654 Covid cases were recorded in the UK on Monday, compared with 5,342 cases a week ago. There were another 23 deaths of people within 28 days of a positive test, compared with 17 on the same day last week. The latest figures show 293,542 UK adults received a first dose of the vaccine on Sunday, taking the overall number to 30,444,829 - with 146,785 having their second dose, bringing that total to 3,674,266. People were out enjoying the spring weather in the grounds of Wollaton Hall in Nottingham Outdoor sports facilities were able to open again on Monday Two households or groups of up to six people are now able to meet outside in England after thelatest easing of the lockdown rules. Outdoor sport facilities, including swimming pools, tennis courts and golf courses, have reopened, and organised outdoor sports resumed. Weddings are also on again,attended by up to six people. The next stage in the relaxation of the rules in England will take place no earlier than 12 April with non-essential retail reopening, and restaurants and pubs allowed to serve outdoors. The prime minister told the briefing he could not ""see anything in the data right now that would cause us to deviate from the roadmap"". In Wales, the ""stay local"" rule was lifted on Saturday, with six people allowed to meet outside and stay in self-contained holiday accommodation. The stay home order in Scotland will end on Friday, and from Thursday in Northern Ireland up to six people, or two households, will be able to meet outdoors.

"This video can not be played (29 March 2021) The stranded container ship is seen finally on the move and no longer blocking the canal Traffic has resumed in Egypt's Suez Canal after a stranded container ship blocking it for nearly a week was finally freed by salvage crews. Tug boats honked their horns in celebration as the 400m-long (1,300ft) Ever Given was dislodged on Monday with the help of dredgers. Hundreds of ships are waiting to pass through the canal which links the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. It is one of the world's busiest trade routes. The cost of the Suez Canal blockage How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal Peter Berdowski, CEO of Dutch salvage company Boskalis, said the Ever Given had been refloated at 15:05 (13:05 GMT) on Monday, ""thereby making free passage through the Suez Canal possible again"". Egyptian officials say the backlog of ships waiting to transit through should be cleared in around three days, but experts believe the knock-on effect on global shipping could take weeks or even months to resolve. The Ever Given on the move on Monday Salvage teams had faced a daunting challenge after the 200,000-tonne ship ran aground last Tuesday morning in high winds and a sandstorm which reduced visibility. A Dutch specialist team, SMIT, oversaw a flotilla of 13 tugs, small but powerful vessels that can shift large ships, as they tried to dislodge the Ever Given. Dredgers were brought in and dug 30,000 cubic metres of mud and sand from beneath the ends of the ship. Over the weekend, it was feared that some of the ship's cargo of some 18,000 containers would have to be removed in order to lighten the load. But high tides helped the tugs and dredgers in their work and early on Monday, the stern (rear of the ship) was freed and the great ship swung across the canal, to shouts of celebration. Hours later, the bow (front) too came unstuck, and the Ever Given was able to move out. The vessel was towed to the Great Bitter Lake, which sits between two sections of the canal to the north of the salvage site, where it will undergo safety checks. A marine source told Reuters news agency on Monday evening that ships were travelling southwards towards the Red Sea while canal services provider Leth Agencies said vessels had resumed transit from the Great Bitter Lake. Some ships have already left the region, preferring to take an alternative, longer route around the southern tip of Africa. Inevitably, cargoes will be reaching their destination much later than planned. There may be congestion when they arrive in port, while future sailing schedules have been thrown into disarray, The cost of shipping goods to Europe is expected to rise as a result, BBC Business Correspondent Theo Leggett reports. Shipping group Maersk saidthe ""ripple effects on global capacity and equipment"" were significant,external. ""There'll be an investigation, clearly, because this has had such a big impact and exactly what's happened here, I think, will be debated for some time,"" Marcus Baker, global head of marine and cargo at Marsh Inc, told Reuters. ""What do we do going forward to ensure it doesn't happen again? Again, I would leave that to the competent authorities that are in Egypt to decide how they want to make sure that traffic transits safely through the canal because, look, it's in their interest to do that."" By Sally Nabil, BBC Arabic bilingual correspondent, Port of Suez Spirits here are quite high. There's a strong sense of achievement. Some experts had warned that it might take weeks to free the Ever Given. But the high tide, as well as the specialist equipment brought in, all helped the rescue operation. Now the authorities will have to address another challenge - congestion. The head of the Suez Canal Authority said that hundreds of stranded vessels would be allowed through the canal on a first-come-first-served basis, though there might be some exceptions to specific ships, based on the types of goods on board. The blockage put the authorities under immense pressure, given the major impact it had on global trade. For Egyptians, the canal is not only a source of national pride, but it also provides the economy with much needed foreign currency. A couple of days ago, I asked Osama Rabie, the head of the Suez Canal Authority, whether he was concerned that some shipping companies might be discouraged from sending such giant ships through the canal in the future. He replied that there was no alternative to the Suez Canal, which he said was fast and safe. So, it's not just about time here, but also about security. It will now undergo a full inspection at the Great Bitter Lake, the vessel's technical managers, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said. It said there had been no reports of pollution or cargo damage, and initial investigations had ruled out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding last week. The ship's Indian crew of 25 remaining aboard the vessel are safe and in good health, BSM said, adding: ""Their hard work and tireless professionalism are greatly appreciated."" The ship's containers are carrying a huge variety of items and the insured value of the cargo is believed to amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.

"This video can not be played (29 March 2021) The stranded container ship is seen finally on the move and no longer blocking the canal Traffic has resumed in Egypt's Suez Canal after a stranded container ship blocking it for nearly a week was finally freed by salvage crews. Tug boats honked their horns in celebration as the 400m-long (1,300ft) Ever Given was dislodged on Monday with the help of dredgers. Hundreds of ships are waiting to pass through the canal which links the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. It is one of the world's busiest trade routes. The cost of the Suez Canal blockage How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal Peter Berdowski, CEO of Dutch salvage company Boskalis, said the Ever Given had been refloated at 15:05 (13:05 GMT) on Monday, ""thereby making free passage through the Suez Canal possible again"". Egyptian officials say the backlog of ships waiting to transit through should be cleared in around three days, but experts believe the knock-on effect on global shipping could take weeks or even months to resolve. The Ever Given on the move on Monday Salvage teams had faced a daunting challenge after the 200,000-tonne ship ran aground last Tuesday morning in high winds and a sandstorm which reduced visibility. A Dutch specialist team, SMIT, oversaw a flotilla of 13 tugs, small but powerful vessels that can shift large ships, as they tried to dislodge the Ever Given. Dredgers were brought in and dug 30,000 cubic metres of mud and sand from beneath the ends of the ship. Over the weekend, it was feared that some of the ship's cargo of some 18,000 containers would have to be removed in order to lighten the load. But high tides helped the tugs and dredgers in their work and early on Monday, the stern (rear of the ship) was freed and the great ship swung across the canal, to shouts of celebration. Hours later, the bow (front) too came unstuck, and the Ever Given was able to move out. The vessel was towed to the Great Bitter Lake, which sits between two sections of the canal to the north of the salvage site, where it will undergo safety checks. A marine source told Reuters news agency on Monday evening that ships were travelling southwards towards the Red Sea while canal services provider Leth Agencies said vessels had resumed transit from the Great Bitter Lake. Some ships have already left the region, preferring to take an alternative, longer route around the southern tip of Africa. Inevitably, cargoes will be reaching their destination much later than planned. There may be congestion when they arrive in port, while future sailing schedules have been thrown into disarray, The cost of shipping goods to Europe is expected to rise as a result, BBC Business Correspondent Theo Leggett reports. Shipping group Maersk saidthe ""ripple effects on global capacity and equipment"" were significant,external. ""There'll be an investigation, clearly, because this has had such a big impact and exactly what's happened here, I think, will be debated for some time,"" Marcus Baker, global head of marine and cargo at Marsh Inc, told Reuters. ""What do we do going forward to ensure it doesn't happen again? Again, I would leave that to the competent authorities that are in Egypt to decide how they want to make sure that traffic transits safely through the canal because, look, it's in their interest to do that."" By Sally Nabil, BBC Arabic bilingual correspondent, Port of Suez Spirits here are quite high. There's a strong sense of achievement. Some experts had warned that it might take weeks to free the Ever Given. But the high tide, as well as the specialist equipment brought in, all helped the rescue operation. Now the authorities will have to address another challenge - congestion. The head of the Suez Canal Authority said that hundreds of stranded vessels would be allowed through the canal on a first-come-first-served basis, though there might be some exceptions to specific ships, based on the types of goods on board. The blockage put the authorities under immense pressure, given the major impact it had on global trade. For Egyptians, the canal is not only a source of national pride, but it also provides the economy with much needed foreign currency. A couple of days ago, I asked Osama Rabie, the head of the Suez Canal Authority, whether he was concerned that some shipping companies might be discouraged from sending such giant ships through the canal in the future. He replied that there was no alternative to the Suez Canal, which he said was fast and safe. So, it's not just about time here, but also about security. It will now undergo a full inspection at the Great Bitter Lake, the vessel's technical managers, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said. It said there had been no reports of pollution or cargo damage, and initial investigations had ruled out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding last week. The ship's Indian crew of 25 remaining aboard the vessel are safe and in good health, BSM said, adding: ""Their hard work and tireless professionalism are greatly appreciated."" The ship's containers are carrying a huge variety of items and the insured value of the cargo is believed to amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.

"The tortoises seized at the airport are thought to be less than three months old Customs officials in Ecuador discovered 185 baby tortoises packed inside a suitcase that was being sent from the GalÃ¡pagos Islands to the mainland on Sunday. The reptiles had been wrapped in plastic and were found during a routine inspection at the main airport on the island of Baltra. Ten of them had died, officials said. One of the biggest threats to GalÃ¡pagos tortoises is illegal trading for animal collectors and exotic pet markets. The tortoises seized at the airport on Baltra are thought to be less than three months old. Officials combatting wildlife trafficking say hatchling-sized juveniles can fetch sums of more than $5,000 (Â£3,600) per animal. It is believed the smugglers wrapped the tortoises in plastic to immobilise them but the X-ray machine's operator at the airport nevertheless grew suspicious. An X-ray machine operator grew suspicious and the suitcase was searched Staff from the GalÃ¡pagos National Park are helping with the care of the seized tortoises The suitcase had been posted at the airport by a transport firm and was said to contain ""souvenirs"", a statement from the airport said. No arrests have been made so far but employees of the transport firm who had checked in the suitcase were held for questioning, according to the statement. Dozens of smuggled chameleons found in suitcase Smuggled reptiles found stitched inside dolls Illicit wildlife products 'slipping through net' Ecuador's environment minister, Marcelo Mata, described the incident as a crime against the country's wild fauna and natural heritage. Many plants and animals found on the GalÃ¡pagos are unique to the islands, which lie in the Pacific Ocean about 1,000km (600 miles) off the coast of Ecuador. Among the most famous are the GalÃ¡pagos giant tortoises, which are thought to have arrived on the volcanic islands between three and four million years ago. The sentence for smuggling animals from the GalÃ¡pagos is one to three years in prison.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We're building up our own long-term UK manufacturing capabilities"" The UK does not know ""exactly how strong"" its defences against another wave of Covid will be despite the ""impressive"" vaccine rollout, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He said cases were still rising in Europe and people ""must proceed with caution"" as lockdown eases. The PM was speaking as the stay-at-home rule came to an end in England, allowing groups to meet outdoors. He warned more deaths, infections and hospitalisations were inevitable. European countries have seen a rising number of cases in recent weeks amid a slower vaccine rollout than in the UK. Mr Johnson told a Downing Street press conference the relaxation of restrictions would be ""prized"" by people and that it was ""only because of months of sacrifice and effort that we can take this small step toward freedom"". What can I do from Monday... and what comes next? How many people can I meet now? Swimmers and golfers enjoy new freedoms Deal reached for 60m UK-made Novavax doses He added: ""The vaccine rollout has been very impressive... but what we don't know is exactly how strong our fortifications now are, how robust our defences are against another wave. ""What we need to do is to continue flat out to build the immunity of our population, build our defences against that wave when it comes."" The prime minister said: ""That's why I stress the importance of everybody maintaining the discipline people have shown for so long."" The message was loud and clear - a rise in infections is inevitable as the UK unlocks. But what is uncertain is when this will happen and what impact it will have on serious illness and deaths. A surge now would be the worst outcome. The vaccination rollout has gone very well, but people are still in the process of building up immunity and not everyone in the most at-risk groups has come forward for a jab. The vaccines, while good, are not 100% effective.  It is why ministers and their advisers are urging caution. UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says if people stick to the rules any increase could be modest. The seasons may also help - respiratory viruses thrive more in the colder months. The lower estimates of modelling done for the government suggests there could be 30,000 deaths by summer 2022. That would be in line with a bad flu winter. But it could also be much, much worse. If there is one thing we have learnt, nothing can be taken for granted with Covid. Along with England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty and the Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, Mr Johnson stressed the importance of people who had a first dose of a vaccine getting a second jab. Prof Whitty said the ""wall of vaccination"" will get stronger once people receive their second doses. But he said ""it is not a complete wall"" and highlighted risks for the UK from rising cases elsewhere - the chance of importing infections and the ""much bigger"" concern of variants which could reduce a vaccine's effectiveness. Prof Whitty said: ""If you get a very big wave, that would obviously lead to a significant impact. So that's the reason why the prime minister and ministers have been absolutely determined that this is a slow and steady unlocking, looking at data between each step."" The briefing was held for the first time from the media suite built at Downing Street at a cost of Â£2.6m. Mr Johnson announced the government had agreed adeal with UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKlinethat will see the final stage of the manufacture of up to 60 million doses of its yet-to-be approved Novavax vaccine completed in north-east England. He said Novavax, which is to beproduced at the Fujifilm plant in Stockton-on-Tees,will be finished and bottled by GSK at its facility in Barnard Castle. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

The latest figures show 293,542 UK adults received a first dose of the vaccine on Sunday, taking the overall number to 30,444,829 - with 146,785 having their second dose, bringing that total to 3,674,266.

"People living in the same household as adults with weakened immune systems should be offered a Covid vaccine, says the UK's vaccine committee. This will help to stop the spread of the virus to vulnerable people in the same house, after recent evidence suggested they may not respond as well as others to a vaccine. Household contacts of those with blood cancer or HIV are included. Children under 16 are not part of the new advice. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advised the government to prioritise people for a Covid vaccine who are over 16, and living with adults who have weakened immune systems. Health secretary Matt Hancock has now asked NHS England to implement the advice, which has been shared with the four other nations of the UK. Adults with weakened immune systems, or who are immuno-suppressed, are less able to fight off infections naturally. They include people receiving chemotherapy or radical radiotherapy for cancer and those with serious immune disorders. Recent studiessuggest they do not receive as much protection from Covid vaccines as other people. Prof Wei Shen Lim, chair of Covid-19 immunisation at the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said the new advice ""will help reduce the risk of infection in those who may not be able to fully benefit from being vaccinated themselves"". Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: ""Our surveillance systems and research studies are showing that the Covid-19 vaccines can reduce asymptomatic infection and limit transmission of the virus. ""By vaccinating those who live with adults who are immuno-suppressed, we can further help protect vulnerable people."" Household contacts to be prioritised only include those aged over 16 who share living accommodation with adults who have weakened immune systems. Most people in this group are already likely to have been told they are clinically extremely vulnerable. They include: patients having chemotherapy leading to immuno-suppression, patients undergoing radical radiotherapy people who have received solid organ transplants bone marrow or stem cell transplant recipients people with HIV infection at all stages those with multiple myeloma or genetic disorders affecting the immune system anyone with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis who may require long-term immuno-suppressive treatments Covid jab: Cancer patients 'lack same protection' One jab halts bulk of Covid care home infections Ethnic Covid-jab gap 'not due to area or education' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"Tug boats working on the Ever Given on Saturday night A huge container ship that has been wedged in the Suez Canal since Tuesday has finally been freed from the shoreline. Peter Berdowski, chief executive of Dutch salvage company Boskalis, saidthe Ever Given had been refloated at 15:05 (13:05 GMT) on Monday, ""thereby making free passage through the Suez Canal possible again"". However, it is not clear yet when full traffic in the canal can resume. The blockage has been the source of much worry and frustration for the global shipping industry. We take a look at the key numbers that have been involved in the operation. The Ever Given is 400m-long (1,312ft) and weighs 200,000 tonnes, with a maximum capacity of 20,000 containers. It is currently carrying 18,300 containers. The ship is operated by Taiwanese transport company Evergreen Marine and is one of the world's largest container vessels. It became stranded on Tuesday, after running aground and becoming lodged sideways across the waterway. At firsta gust of wind was thought to be to blame. 'Our customers are worried about the Suez blockage' Extra tugs join effort to dislodge Suez Canal ship How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? The wind speed at the time was recorded at 40 knots, but the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) told reporters that this was not the only reason for the ship becoming stranded. An investigation would be needed to determine whether technical or human errors occurred, the authority added. As of Sunday, there were 369 ships stuck in a tailback waiting to pass through the 193km (120-mile) canal on either side of the blockage. Meanwhile, there have been more than 145,200 social interactions on Twitter using the#SuezBLOCKED,externalhashtag and at least 133,000 shares, according to real-time analysis by brand monitoring platform BrandMentions. Over the weekend, 14 tugboats pulled and pushed the Ever Given at high tide to try to dislodge it and were able to move the ship ""30 degrees from left and right"". âThen on Monday morning, after several reports that the ship had been partially refloated, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) issued a statement saying that the Ever Given had been ""successfully refloated"". Suez Canal Authority chief Osama Rabie said the bloackage was costing the route $14m-$15m The SCA said it would resume manoeuvres later on Monday high tide, ""allowing for the full restoration of the vessel's direction so it is positioned in the middle of the navigable waterway"". Then at 13:05 GMT the Ever Given was finally fully freed. However, it could take a while to clear the backlog of ships waiting to use the canal. Richard Mead, managing editor of shipping journal Lloyd's List, told the BBC's Today Programme:  ""We're looking at about 450 ships still waiting to transit the canal. It's going to be a lengthy process clearing that backlog."" About 12% of global trade, around one million barrels of oil and roughly 8% of liquefied natural gas pass through the canal each day. SCA chairman Osama Rabie on Saturday that the Canal's revenues were taking a $14m-$15m (Â£10.2m-Â£10.9m) hit for each day of the blockage. Prior to the pandemic, trade passing through the Suez Canal contributed to 2% of Egypt's GDP, according to Moody's. Separately, data from Lloyd's List showed the stranded ship washolding up an estimated $9.6bn of tradealong the waterway each day. That equates to $400m and 3.3 million tonnes of cargo an hour, or  $6.7m a minute. Looking at the bigger picture, German insurer Allianz said on Friday its analysis showed the blockage could cost global trade between $6bn to $10bn a week and reduce annual trade growth by 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points. Shipping broker Braemar ACM told theWall Street Journal,externalthat the cost of renting some vessels to ship cargo to and from Asia and the Middle East had jumped 47% to $2.2m. Some vessels have been rerouted to avoid the Suez Canal. That is adding around eight days to their total journeys. The Suez Canal blockage doesn't just affect the global shipping industry or the Egyptian economy - countless businesses, from domestic transport providers to retailers, supermarkets and manufacturers are also impacted.  1869waterway first opened 2015canal expanded to include a 22 mile parallel channel 120miles long 205m wide 24m deep The true damage and cost is difficult to evaluate until the ship is fully freed and trade resumes. British firms told the BBC on Fridaythat they were still waiting to find out when goods were likely to arrive. One UK company, Seaport Freight Services, said it had 20 containers of goods stranded on the Ever Given ""We're waiting on food goods like coconut milk and syrups, some spare parts for motors, we've got some fork lift trucks, some Amazon goods on there, all sorts,"" the company said. There were concerns that if the blockage at the Suez Canal continued, some firms will have to pay to order more goods and have them sent over by air freight, which costs at least three times more.

"On a day some lockdown measures in England are eased, the PM says being cautious is the way to get the results we want Boris Johnson tells a Downing Street briefing the UK is ""building up our own long-term UK manufacturing capabilities"" for vaccines He says Novavax is going to make a vaccine and GlaxoSmithKline will also finish and bottle vaccines - both in the North East That will provide between 50 and 60 million UK-made vaccines, the PM says Two households or groups of up to six people are now able to meet outside in England as the stay-at-home Covid restrictions order ends Weddings have been taking place in England but only with six people attending and outdoor sports have resumed Johnson says it's only because of months of sacrifice and effort we've been able to take these steps Most Covid transmissions are now among young people who have not yet been vaccinated, chief medical officer Chris Whitty says People living with those who have weakened immune systems should be able to get their vaccine, says the JCVI, the UK's official vaccination body WHO experts conclude that Covid-19 most likely passed to humans from a bat through another animal Edited by James Clarke and Sarah Collerton Thanks for joining us for live coronavirus news. Updates were brought to you by Emma Harrison, Francesca Gillett, George Bowden, Georgina Rannard, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Sarah Collerton and Sinead Wilson. Jess Warren-Basham and Jonny Cope cut their wedding list from 180 to six ... and here's the main UK headlines: We're pausing our coverage shortly - here's the main headlines about the pandemic around the world:  We told you earlier today about a couple who met online during the pandemic getting married today - as soon as Covid restrictions were relaxed. Dwain Daley and Nyasha Pitt said theyhad spent only four days apart since meeting in July. The couple tied the knot at Coventry Register Office and said they were already thinking of sharing their moment when rules are further relaxed. ""[We] cannot wait to start planning for the party now in the summer, when hopefully everyone is going to be allowed out to celebrate with us,"" Nyasha said. Hear more from them here: This video can not be played A refreshing dip on a spring day was the way some people chose to celebrate the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions. In the latest step onthe government's unlocking ""road map"", outdoor pools for exercise are once again allowed to open. The Jubilee Park outdoor swimming pool in Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire was one of those that reopened today. Joe Stanhope, from the pool, said the phone had been ringing ""off the hook"" with people trying to book their space. He added: ""People are really excited to come back and it's been a real pleasure listening to them all and getting them all back in."" This video can not be played We reported earlier that the World Health Organization has concluded thatCovid-19 most likely passed to humans from a bat through another animal. The findings came in a highly anticipated report, which has been seen by our correspondent Imogen Foulkes. The report, officially due out tomorrow, says that the theory that the virus emerged in a laboratory is ""extremely unlikely"". Its findings don't differ from what the WHO team said at the conclusion of its mission to Wuhan, China, Foulkes explains. But it does urge more research, in particular into the possible intermediary host, and into exactly when and where the virus first began to circulate. Although the Huanan food market was initially thought to be where the outbreak began, WHO and Chinese scientists found evidence the virus could have been circulating for at least some weeks before December 2019, and that some of those infected had no connection with the market. The team judged the laboratory incident to be unlikely because ""there is no record of viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes the Covid-19 disease) in any laboratory before December 2019."" It believes an unknown animal passed the virus to humans because the virus found in bats is ""evolutionarily distant"" from the SARS-CoV-2 found in humans. This interpretation would support the WHO teamâs conclusion that it is extremely important to identify the intermediate host of the virus. Last year's FA Cup final was among the games to have been played in front of an empty Wembley during lockdown Next month's FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley will be among the pilot events to trial the return of large crowds to UK venues. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has told BBC sports editor Dan Roan the games on 17 and 18 April will be part of the trial programme. The FA Cup final and the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield are also on the schedule. ""We want to get as many people back as safely as possible,"" says Dowden. But he refused to be drawn on how many spectators would be permitted to attend the Wembley semi-finals. The semi-final between Chelsea and Manchester City will beshown live on BBC Oneand the BBC iPlayer on Saturday 17 April, with Leicester v Southampton played the following day. Dowden also said more pilot events will be announced later this week after confirmation from the government that the next stage of the planned easing of restrictions on 12 April is on track.

The issue of vaccine passports is becoming increasingly high-profile as governments and people want to open up socialising in places like restaurants, musuems or concerts, as well as travel. The White House has today said that it will not pass a law requiring all citizens to hold a vaccine passport. Instead, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a press briefing, it expects private businesses will take the lead and decide if it something they require. US President Joe Biden's administration said it will be issuing recommendations on the issue soon. Boris Johnson earlier announced that a further 50 to 60 million new coronavirus vaccines are going to be made in the UK - here are some more details on the plan. The vaccines are being made by Novavax and the protein antigen element of the jab is called NVX-CoV2373. The vaccine will be produced at the Fujifilm plant in Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) will ""fill and finish"" the jabs, which means preparing vials of the final vaccine and packaging them for distribution from its facility at nearby Barnard Castle. The market town found itself at the centre of a furore last year when the PM's then most senior aideDominic Cummingswent there during lockdown. Novavax was the first coronavirus vaccine toshow efficacy against the new UK variant in clinical trials, the BBC's medical editor Fergus Walsh said. Find out more here. These charts show the number of coronavirus cases in the UK is levelling off and the death rate is falling steadily. More than 30 million people - or half of all UK adults - have now received a first dose of a vaccine and more than three million people have had a second: Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter France is one
of the most vaccine-sceptical countries in the world - fertile ground for
anti-vaccine activists spreading online misinformation. One of these is Gilles, a
science-fiction fan who helps to run a
conspiracy-themed French-language Facebook group with 50,000 members, many of
whom spread falsehoods about coronavirus. This group is
just one example of a larger trend - an increase in French-language
anti-vaccine content on social media over the past year. These pages
aren't seeking answers to legitimate medical questions. Instead, they're run by those who've firmly made up
their minds against vaccinations, and who spread false rumours about vaccines
killing millions, containing tracking devices, or altering our DNA. Iâve been speaking to some of these sceptics and asking
experts why their views are so widespread in France in particular -you can read more about it here. Secret filming at one of the biggest UK Covid testing labs has found evidence of potential contamination, discarded tests and pressure to hit targets. A BBC reporter working as a lab technician filmed staff cutting corners and processing samples in a way that could cause contamination. This means some people who had taken a test via NHS Test and Trace may have received no result or a wrong result. Read the full investigation by BBC Panorama. A technician pushes a swab back into its sample tube, causing potential contamination Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The message was loud and clear - a rise in infections is
inevitable as the UK unlocks. But what is uncertain is when this will happen and what
impact it will have on serious illness and deaths. A surge now would be the worst outcome. The UK's vaccination rollout has gone very well, but people are
still in the process of building up immunity and not everyone in the most
at-risk groups has come forward for a jab. The vaccines, while good, are not 100% effective. It is why ministers and their advisers are urging caution. England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty says if people
stick to the rules any increase could be modest. The seasons may also help - respiratory viruses thrive more
in the colder months. The lower estimates of modelling done for the government suggests
there could be 30,000 more deaths by summer 2022. That would be in line with a bad flu winter. But it could
also be much, much worse. If there is one thing we have learnt, nothing can be taken
for granted with Covid. Pakistan's President Arif Alvi has tweeted that he has tested positive for Covid-19. Alvi, who is 71, says he has taken the first dose of a Covid vaccine but is awaiting the second. It is still possible to contract coronavirus after being vaccinated but the jabs protect most people against serious complications of the disease. A second dose also offers greater protection. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan tested positive earlier this month. Cases in Pakistan are on the rise, with about 4,000 cases a day reported in the past week. Allow Twitter content?

Reality Check During the briefing earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked about enforcement of coronavirus regulations and said he thought the police have ""handed out about 70,000 fines - at least - for various breaches of one kind or another"". According to the latest figures from the National Police Chiefsâ Council, police in England issued 85,975 fixed penalty notices for breaching Covid-19 rules between 27 March 2020 and 14 March 2021. The figure rises to 94,368 once police fines in Wales are included. The ""vast majority"" of the fines overall were for breaking restrictions on movement, and the rate of fines has increased during the third lockdown - with two-thirds of all penalties handed out since 21 December. You can read more about Covid-19 fines and how crime in general has changedover the course of the pandemic here. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The news that the Novavax vaccine is going to go through a
process known as fill and finish in the UK is an interesting development. Fill and finish is the process by which vaccines are
packaged up in vials, ready to be sent out to vaccination clinics. The original plan was for this to be done in Europe once the
vaccine product was manufactured by plants in the North East of England. But a deal has been struck with drug firm GSK to do that
here. Officially, the government is saying that it is all part of
their investment in the British life science industry. But given the threats from Europe about restricting exports
of vaccines, it begs all sorts of other questions too. The north-east plants have already started manufacturing the
60 million doses ordered by the government. If it gets approval from the regulator - expected in the coming weeks - supplies could be available in June.  In case you missed this at the briefing earlier, here is the PM announcing that the UK will make more vaccine doses in the North East of England: This video can not be played Reality Check The PM said that, when it comes coronavirus transmission, ""outdoors is generally much safer than indoors"". Researchers say that the chances of catching Covid outdoors
are massively reduced compared with indoors - although infections can still
happen. This is mainly down to three reasons: Even so, there are a handful of cases where it's believed
that infections did happen outside. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent This was a news conference where excitement was cloaked in caution. A splash of the giddy with a reference to the al fresco front crawlers at Hillingdon Lido in London. Admiration for the nocturnal peddlers of Ilkeston Cycle Club in Derbyshire, whose love of lycra lured them out at midnight, the moment it was legal to do so. But all the way through, from all three of the contributors, were reminders of the need to be careful. ""We don't know how strong our defences are against a new wave,"" said the prime minister. There is a ""high likelihood of some uptick"" in cases, warned Professor Chris Whitty, given the unlocking measures starting today. A high proportion of those who will catch and transmit the virus have not been vaccinated yet, we were told. Sophia Sleigh of the Evening Standard asks the PM if he can categorically rule out a full lockdown? The PM says ""yes but with at least two very important provisos"". Those are if everybody continues to follow the guidance and if the vaccine rollout continues and the vaccines continue to be as effective as it looks as though they are, he says. He says: ""I'm hopeful. I don't see anything in the data right now that would cause us to deviate from the roadmap but we need to remain humble in the face of nature and be prepared to do whatever it takes to protect the British public."" Sleigh says a report by the Evening Standard reveals care home staff in London are the least likely to take up the vaccine. She asks Whitty if he is shocked by this and asks if it offers enough protection for care home residents He says: ""The great majority of care home staff nationally have had the vaccine and as have an even greater proportion of our health care staff."" He says there are three things it's important to stress to people, firstly ""this vaccine will protect you and your family"", he says. He says ""there is unfortunately some misinformation about vaccines"" so it's important to go to reliable sources that can lay out the facts. Lastly, he says: ""I do consider people who are looking after people who are vulnerable have a professional responsibility to get vaccinated."" And that marks the end of the briefing. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played (29 March 2021) The stranded container ship is seen finally on the move and no longer blocking the canal Traffic has resumed in Egypt's Suez Canal after a stranded container ship blocking it for nearly a week was finally freed by salvage crews. Tug boats honked their horns in celebration as the 400m-long (1,300ft) Ever Given was dislodged on Monday with the help of dredgers. Hundreds of ships are waiting to pass through the canal which links the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. It is one of the world's busiest trade routes. The cost of the Suez Canal blockage How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal Peter Berdowski, CEO of Dutch salvage company Boskalis, said the Ever Given had been refloated at 15:05 (13:05 GMT) on Monday, ""thereby making free passage through the Suez Canal possible again"". Egyptian officials say the backlog of ships waiting to transit through should be cleared in around three days, but experts believe the knock-on effect on global shipping could take weeks or even months to resolve. The Ever Given on the move on Monday Salvage teams had faced a daunting challenge after the 200,000-tonne ship ran aground last Tuesday morning in high winds and a sandstorm which reduced visibility. A Dutch specialist team, SMIT, oversaw a flotilla of 13 tugs, small but powerful vessels that can shift large ships, as they tried to dislodge the Ever Given. Dredgers were brought in and dug 30,000 cubic metres of mud and sand from beneath the ends of the ship. Over the weekend, it was feared that some of the ship's cargo of some 18,000 containers would have to be removed in order to lighten the load. But high tides helped the tugs and dredgers in their work and early on Monday, the stern (rear of the ship) was freed and the great ship swung across the canal, to shouts of celebration. Hours later, the bow (front) too came unstuck, and the Ever Given was able to move out. The vessel was towed to the Great Bitter Lake, which sits between two sections of the canal to the north of the salvage site, where it will undergo safety checks. A marine source told Reuters news agency on Monday evening that ships were travelling southwards towards the Red Sea while canal services provider Leth Agencies said vessels had resumed transit from the Great Bitter Lake. Some ships have already left the region, preferring to take an alternative, longer route around the southern tip of Africa. Inevitably, cargoes will be reaching their destination much later than planned. There may be congestion when they arrive in port, while future sailing schedules have been thrown into disarray, The cost of shipping goods to Europe is expected to rise as a result, BBC Business Correspondent Theo Leggett reports. Shipping group Maersk saidthe ""ripple effects on global capacity and equipment"" were significant,external. ""There'll be an investigation, clearly, because this has had such a big impact and exactly what's happened here, I think, will be debated for some time,"" Marcus Baker, global head of marine and cargo at Marsh Inc, told Reuters. ""What do we do going forward to ensure it doesn't happen again? Again, I would leave that to the competent authorities that are in Egypt to decide how they want to make sure that traffic transits safely through the canal because, look, it's in their interest to do that."" By Sally Nabil, BBC Arabic bilingual correspondent, Port of Suez Spirits here are quite high. There's a strong sense of achievement. Some experts had warned that it might take weeks to free the Ever Given. But the high tide, as well as the specialist equipment brought in, all helped the rescue operation. Now the authorities will have to address another challenge - congestion. The head of the Suez Canal Authority said that hundreds of stranded vessels would be allowed through the canal on a first-come-first-served basis, though there might be some exceptions to specific ships, based on the types of goods on board. The blockage put the authorities under immense pressure, given the major impact it had on global trade. For Egyptians, the canal is not only a source of national pride, but it also provides the economy with much needed foreign currency. A couple of days ago, I asked Osama Rabie, the head of the Suez Canal Authority, whether he was concerned that some shipping companies might be discouraged from sending such giant ships through the canal in the future. He replied that there was no alternative to the Suez Canal, which he said was fast and safe. So, it's not just about time here, but also about security. It will now undergo a full inspection at the Great Bitter Lake, the vessel's technical managers, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said. It said there had been no reports of pollution or cargo damage, and initial investigations had ruled out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding last week. The ship's Indian crew of 25 remaining aboard the vessel are safe and in good health, BSM said, adding: ""Their hard work and tireless professionalism are greatly appreciated."" The ship's containers are carrying a huge variety of items and the insured value of the cargo is believed to amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.

"Steve Parks says he has 20 containers of goods stuck on the Ever Given British businesses are getting worried as Egypt's Suez Canal continues to be blocked by a Taiwanese mega-container ship for the fourth day in a row. Seaport Freight Services, a shipping and freight-forwarding company based at the Port of Felixstowe, has 20 containers of goods stranded on the Ever Given. ""We're waiting on food goods like coconut milk and syrups, some spare parts for motors, we've got some fork lift trucks, some Amazon goods on there, all sorts,"" Steve Parks, director of Seaport Freight Services, tells the BBC. ""All our customers are hearing about it, and they're phoning us to ask when it will be resolved."" The 400m-long (1,312ft) ship Ever Given, operated by Taiwanese transport company Evergreen Marine, is one of the world's largest container vessels. The Suez Canal blockage in numbers Suez blockage is holding up $9.6bn of goods a day Egypt's Suez Canal blocked by huge container ship How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? It weighs 200,000 tonnes, with a maximum capacity of 20,000 containers. The ship ran aground and became lodged sideways across the waterway on Tuesday after a gust of wind blew it off course. It is blocking one of the world's busiest trade routes, causing a huge tailback of other ships trying to pass through the Suez Canal, which separates Africa from the Middle East and Asia. There are more than 160 vessels waiting at either end of the canal, according to tracking data from Lloyd's List. The Ever Given ship, viewed from satellite, remains stuck in the Suez Canal At the moment, Mr Park says there is only one way to get goods through - go round the Horn of Africa, which will add another seven days to the journey. ""We've had supply problems from the Far East, we've had Covid, we've had the Brexit changes. You couldn't really make it up,"" he says. ""Things were just starting to get better. We were just starting to get over the shortage of containers, the shortage of vessels, and then this happens."" Mirical Emblems is a firm specialising in heat-applied print transfers for clothing and uniforms, based in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. It has a shipment of raw material stuck on a boat in the Red Sea that is trying to get into the Suez Canal. The cost of the goods and the cost to ship them comes to Â£16,000. The shipment is already delayed due to the pandemic, as the original ship it was meant to travel on was rerouted, and had to wait for the next vessel bound for the UK. The ship with the raw material shipment is meant to dock at the Port of Southampton on 9 April. But if the delivery continues to be delayed, Mirical Emblems will have to pay for a second shipment of the raw material and have it flown over from South Korea for three times the shipping cost - roughly Â£21,000 - because the firm can't afford to upset its clients and affect their supply chains too. ""We're about to run out of stock, and this is just another cost we could do without,"" says Mirical Emblems' managing director Jonathan Dul. ""The pandemic has caused our turnover to fall by 20%. We've increased costs due to Brexit and now we're having delayed shipments and having to potentially buy materials twice."" Thomas O'Brien is managing director of Boxer Gifts, a toy manufacturer based in Leeds. Toy manufacturer Thomas O'Brien says shipping is current ""difficult, long and expensive"" His products are made in China, and he has six containers on ships now queuing up to get through the Suez Canal, each containing around 50,000 toys. ""It means longer shipping times, less stock availability, more money tied up on goods at sea, rather than in our warehouses, and it means more stress,"" he tells the BBC. He says it will also impact his customers - retailers, who will have to wait a little longer to get their stock. Plus, Mr O'Brien recently heard that it is likely his firm will have to pay some additional charges in order to receive the outstanding shipments, due to the ongoing situation at the Suez Canal. 'It's another addition to the long list of reasons why shipping is difficult, long and expensive at the moment, "" he says. ""The Suez Canal situation is yet another spanner in the works that makes dealing with international shipping a hell of a lot harder."" Logistics UK, which represents freight businesses, says that a lot of the goods currently bound for the UK are likely to be for retailers who are stocking their shelves ready for the summer. Egyptian officials inspect the operation to refloat the Ever Given ship There is a risk that some goods, such as perishable foods, could arrive too late to be sold, due to ships either waiting to go through the canal, or having to be re-routed round the southern tip of Africa, warns Alex Veitch, general manager of policy at Logistics UK. And while the current industry trend for extraordinarily large vessels means more goods can be transported in one go, the impact is much greater when things go wrong. ""When they turn up late or at the wrong time, it puts a lot of pressure on ports to offload them very quickly so that they can go off to the next stop,"" he says. ""That then puts pressure on domestic transport operations to get them to the shops in time, so it really does show how easy it can be to disrupt almost and invisible network of moving goods from source to the shop.""

"The US has warned it could put tariffs of up to 25% on a host of UK exports in retaliation for a UK tax on tech firms. Ceramics, make-up, overcoats, games consoles and furniture,externalcould all be hit, according to a list published by the Biden administration. The duties are designed to raise $325m (Â£235.8m), the amount the US believes the UK will raise from US tech firms. A UK government spokesperson said it wanted to ""make sure tech firms pay their fair share of tax"". They added: ""Should the US proceed to implement these measures, we would consider all options to defend UK interests and industry."" Washington is pressing ahead with the action, initiated under President Donald Trump, and has scheduled hearings on the list. It argues the recently introduced digital services tax - which taxes tech firms on their revenues - has ""unreasonable, discriminatory, and burdensome attributes"". US suspends tariffs on single malt Scotch whisky Sunak urges US to back digital services tax Facebook agrees to pay France â¬106m in back taxes Such actions have proceeded against similar taxes in India, Austria and Spain, but action against the European Union as a whole was dropped. The US Section 301 action is designed to apply domestic political pressure within the UK and other countries over the imposition of such taxes. The UK and US held talks about the digital services tax on 4 December, and UK government sources stressed that the tariff list was being seen as procedural, rather than an escalation. The tariffs are now subject to a consultation in the US over the next few weeks. Burberry's famous trench coats would be affected UK ceramics are on the US Trade Representative's list, including certain tiles, bathroom ware like sinks and bidets, as well as ceramics for laboratory uses. About Â£17m of these products were exported to the US in 2020, and Â£24m in 2019 before Covid. Trade group the British Ceramic Confederation said it was ""monitoring developments closely, working with UK officials"". Meanwhile Adam Mansell, head of the UK Fashion & Textile Association (UKFT), called the threat to UK-made overcoats ""hugely disappointing"", noting the US had only removed separate tariffs on other types of fashion goods, such as British cashmere last month. ""At a time when we are trying to start discussions over a UK-US trade deal, it is extremely important that both governments get around the table to remove this threat as soon as possible,"" he said. ""With the industry still struggling with the impact of Covid-19 and understanding the new trade arrangements with the EU, an additional burden on our exports couldn't come at a worse time."" At the Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility calculated the digital services tax would raise Â£300m in the current financial year, and as much as Â£700m in future years. Brought in last April it taxes at 2% the revenues - not profits - of search engines, social media services and online marketplaces which derive value from UK users. It followed years of claims in Europe and elsewhere that big tech firms do not pay enough tax in the countries where they operate. Last August, Facebook agreed to pay the French government â¬106m (Â£95.7m) in back taxes to settle a dispute over revenues earned in the country. Earlier that year, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerbergsaid he recognised the public's frustration over the amount of tax paid by tech giants. A UK government spokesperson said: ""Like many countries around the world, we want to make sure tech firms pay their fair share of tax. Our digital services tax (DST) is reasonable, proportionate and non-discriminatory. ""It's also temporary. We're working positively with the US and other international partners to find a global solution to this problem and will remove the DST when that is in place."" There are signs the Biden administration wants a more conciliatory relationship on trade with the UK than Donald Trump did. Last month, Washington agreed to suspend tariffs on UK goods, including single malt whiskies, that were imposed in retaliation over subsidies to aircraft maker Airbus. However, the UK is still lobbying the US to drop duties on British steel brought in in 2018.

"Rescue rabbit Tulip has now been rehomed The Scottish SPCA says its centres across Scotland have hit capacity as a result of the fallout from Covid. The animal welfare charity said last year its frontline team attended an average of 214 incidents every day. More than 3,000 animals were rehomed and more than 7,000 were taken into care. A rise in demand for puppies also led to an increase in the number of raids and seizures of dogs from low-welfare puppy farms and dealers. Calls about unwanted pets rise by more than 130% Illegal puppy trade warning as sales boom The charity recorded a dramatic increase in the number of calls to its helpline about unwanted animals, with more than 136,000 calls received in 2020. Chief superintendent Mike Flynn said: ""In many cases, neglect is not deliberate. Even people who love their animals can find themselves in a position where they are unable to continue to provide them with the care they need. The demand for puppies during lockdown has led to more raids on puppy farms ""This could be a change in personal circumstance or an accident. The decision can be heartbreaking, but ultimately it is the right one for the welfare of that animal. It is admirable to put an animal's needs first. ""Our centres have hit capacity and we desperately need the support of the animal-loving Scottish public so that they don't let animals suffer.""

"The massive fire broke out just after midnight on Monday Firefighters in Indonesia are working to put out a massive fire that has broken out at one of the largest oil refineries in the country. The fire broke out at the Balongan refinery, run by state oil firm Pertamina, at 00:45 local time on Monday (17:45 GMT Sunday). At least five people are injured and around 950 residents have been evacuated to safety. A handful of people have been reported missing. The cause of the fire remains unclear. TV footage and videos on social media showed the fire still raging on Monday morning with a plume of smoke rising high above the refinery, located in West Java province. This video can not be played Residents near Indonesian oil refinery react in shock to massive fireball ""We smelled a strong fuel scent first, so strong that my nose hurt, while we heard lightning strikes,"" one nearby resident told local news outlet Metro TV, according to a Reuters report. According to the regional disaster management agency, five people were being treated in hospital for serious burns with another 15 with minor burns. Smoke rising from the refinery The injured are both nearby residents and people who were on a road near the refinery when the fire broke out. Jerome Wirawan, BBC News Indonesia The Balongan Refinery is one of Indonesia's largest refineries and also one of its most crucial, as it feeds fuel and petrochemicals to the greater Jakarta area. Questions have now been raised on how this incident will affect plastics and chemicals businesses and factories, though Pertamina has told the public that ""fuel delivery to the public is undisturbed and currently still ongoing"". Already many are demanding answers on how such a disastrous incident could happen to a state-owned refinery. One politician, Kurtubi, pointed out in a TV interview that Balongan refinery, which has been in operation since 1994, is relatively new compared with other Pertamina refineries. Mr Kurtubi, who is a member of the House of Representatives' commission for energy affairs, also demanded an evaluation of the distances between oil refineries and residential zones. On social media, there were calls for a thorough investigation. ""Was there sabotage or is this a genuine accident?"" asked one Indonesian netizen. Others questioned whether standard operating procedure had been followed. ""Otherwise, the person who caused this must be taken to court,"" said another netizen. Residents from a nearby village have been evacuated to several different camps with the relief efforts further complicated by Covid-19 measures. Pertamina said the cause of the fire was unknown, but that it started during heavy rain and lightning. In a press conference later on Monday, the firm said the fire had not damaged the refinery's processing capabilities and that operations could hopefully return to normal in the next five days. The fire was focused on the refinery tanks, with no damage to the processing plant, said Reuters, citing Pertamina Chief Executive Officer Nicke Widyawati. The refinery is about 200km (125 miles) east of Jakarta The oil firm also said it was shutting down the refinery and conducting ""oil flow control"" to prevent any further spread. The Balongan refinery, which is located approximately 200km (125 miles) east of the capital Jakarta and measures at least 340 hectares, can process 125,000 barrels per day.

"Andrea Burley and her dog Baxter in front of the kennel Normally, at this time of year, Andrea Burley would be looking after 40 dogs, as their owners jet off for the Easter holidays. But this year Holmewood Kennel is home to just one. With holidays and weddings cancelled, and with many working from home, people have not had much need for dog care. A year ago she thought her insurance policy would help cover some of the losses, at what was once a Â£200,000-a-year business. But so far she has received nothing. Instead she used her own savings to keep the business afloat. Had she not, the kennel would have gone under, and Ms Burley would have lost her home, which is tied to the business. But with loans falling due, Ms Burley says it is now ""do or die"" for her company. When the UK first went into lockdown in March last year, Ms Burley was one of thousands of business owners who turned to their insurers for help. Those with business interruption policies were confident that their insurers would pay out if they had to close their doors because of the pandemic. Business interruption policies are designed to cover financial losses if a firm cannot operate. Thousands of businesses have failed due to the pandemic But a year later the vast majority are still waiting for their money. That's because, shortly after the first lockdown came into effect, insurers - including Ms Burley's insurer MS Amlin - began issuing documents flatly refusing to pay, arguing that their policies were not designed to cover losses from events like pandemics. Typically, insurance contracts contain exclusion clauses, for events that were explicitly not intended to be covered under the policy. But a number of insurers didn't exclude events like pandemics from their cover and, indeed, their policies read as though losses caused by an event like the coronavirus outbreak should be paid. Ms Burley said her policy didn't exclude pandemics. In fact, it explicitly covered any losses as a result of someone falling ill with a disease that was notified to the authorities within 25 miles of her kennel. Her local hospital is two miles away. Insurers to pay many small firms for Covid losses âMy business could go bust if insurers donât payâ 'We've spent Â£10,000 on invalid virus insurance' Because so many insurers were rejecting claims like Ms Burley's, the city regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), took the unusual step of launching legal proceedings against a number of insurers. It asked a judge to decide whether the losses of 370,000 businesses across the country would be covered. The court found that some of those insurers, including MS Amlin, should have paid out on some claims. However the insurers again refused and appealed to the Supreme Court, which, at the beginning of this year, also found in favour of the small businesses. Since then the insurers involved in the case have begun paying claims, but some more promptly than others. New data from the FCA shows that five weeks after the Supreme Court judgement was issued on 15 January, MS Amlin hadn't decided to pay any of the more than 3,700 claims that had been made by its policyholders. Since then, the company said, it has ""made progress in settling claims and providing interim payments to eligible policyholders"" although it refused to say how many businesses had received a pay-out. The Supreme Court found largely in favour of small businesses when it handed down its decision on 15 January Another insurer, Hiscox, had only handed money to 151 of its customers by 3 March - almost seven weeks after the Supreme Court ruling. The numbers from the regulator showed it was still deciding whether to pay another more than 4,500 claims. The data implied that, on average, only around three claims a day were paid during that period. And even though some of those claims are worth up to Â£100,000, which is make-or-break money to businesses like Ms Burley's, insurers are not always offering to pay the full value of those claims. In fact, in at least 24 cases, Hiscox agreed the claim was covered, but said it decided the value of the claim was Â£0, according to Mark Killick. Mr Killick set up the Hiscox Action Group to pressure the insurer to pay claims after his PR agency Media Zoo was refused a payout from the insurer. ""Even when they're forced to pay out, they are dragging their feet extraordinarily with these sort of tactics,"" he said. ""Hiscox don't want to pay."" ""They've made a mockery of 'my word is my bond',"" he said. A source close to Hiscox said it had since revised some of its Â£0 offers but would not confirm how many were made. And in a statement the company said: ""We are paying claims as quickly as possible in line with the Supreme Court judgment."" Hiscox said both the number of claims it had accepted and payments had ""increased significantly"" since the beginning of this month, although it did not say how much it had paid out. But Richard Leedham, a partner at Mishcon de Reya, which represents some of the businesses taking legal action against Hiscox, described the insurer's lack of speed as ""shocking"". While most insurers were beginning to pay, Mr Leedham said, data from the FCA suggested neither Hiscox nor Amlin were moving very quickly. Hiscox said: ""These are complicated claims that require comprehensive financial information and discussions with customers in order to settle them fairly. ""In total, we expect to pay out $475m (Â£345m) in Covid-19 claims, including for business interruption."" The FCA data shows that, so far, more than 10,000 policyholders have received some money, and insurers have already paid out more than Â£470m. But more than 50,000 are still waiting. Total pay-outs could exceed Â£1bn. The FCA will continue to publish data monitoring progress of payments, a spokesperson said. ""It is critical that the momentum seen leading to the Supreme Court judgment is maintained and that all businesses with valid business interruption claims receive the final settlements due to them as soon as possible."" âMy business could go bust if insurers donât payâ 'We've spent Â£10,000 on invalid virus insurance' Insurers to pay many small firms for Covid losses Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

Updates were brought to you by Emma Harrison, Francesca Gillett, George Bowden, Georgina Rannard, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Sarah Collerton and Sinead Wilson. Jess Warren-Basham and Jonny Cope cut their wedding list from 180 to six ... and here's the main UK headlines: We're pausing our coverage shortly - here's the main headlines about the pandemic around the world:  We told you earlier today about a couple who met online during the pandemic getting married today - as soon as Covid restrictions were relaxed. Dwain Daley and Nyasha Pitt said theyhad spent only four days apart since meeting in July. The couple tied the knot at Coventry Register Office and said they were already thinking of sharing their moment when rules are further relaxed. ""[We] cannot wait to start planning for the party now in the summer, when hopefully everyone is going to be allowed out to celebrate with us,"" Nyasha said. Hear more from them here: This video can not be played A refreshing dip on a spring day was the way some people chose to celebrate the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions. In the latest step onthe government's unlocking ""road map"", outdoor pools for exercise are once again allowed to open. The Jubilee Park outdoor swimming pool in Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire was one of those that reopened today. Joe Stanhope, from the pool, said the phone had been ringing ""off the hook"" with people trying to book their space. He added: ""People are really excited to come back and it's been a real pleasure listening to them all and getting them all back in."" This video can not be played We reported earlier that the World Health Organization has concluded thatCovid-19 most likely passed to humans from a bat through another animal. The findings came in a highly anticipated report, which has been seen by our correspondent Imogen Foulkes. The report, officially due out tomorrow, says that the theory that the virus emerged in a laboratory is ""extremely unlikely"". Its findings don't differ from what the WHO team said at the conclusion of its mission to Wuhan, China, Foulkes explains. But it does urge more research, in particular into the possible intermediary host, and into exactly when and where the virus first began to circulate. Although the Huanan food market was initially thought to be where the outbreak began, WHO and Chinese scientists found evidence the virus could have been circulating for at least some weeks before December 2019, and that some of those infected had no connection with the market. The team judged the laboratory incident to be unlikely because ""there is no record of viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes the Covid-19 disease) in any laboratory before December 2019."" It believes an unknown animal passed the virus to humans because the virus found in bats is ""evolutionarily distant"" from the SARS-CoV-2 found in humans. This interpretation would support the WHO teamâs conclusion that it is extremely important to identify the intermediate host of the virus. Last year's FA Cup final was among the games to have been played in front of an empty Wembley during lockdown Next month's FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley will be among the pilot events to trial the return of large crowds to UK venues. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has told BBC sports editor Dan Roan the games on 17 and 18 April will be part of the trial programme. The FA Cup final and the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield are also on the schedule. ""We want to get as many people back as safely as possible,"" says Dowden. But he refused to be drawn on how many spectators would be permitted to attend the Wembley semi-finals. The semi-final between Chelsea and Manchester City will beshown live on BBC Oneand the BBC iPlayer on Saturday 17 April, with Leicester v Southampton played the following day. Dowden also said more pilot events will be announced later this week after confirmation from the government that the next stage of the planned easing of restrictions on 12 April is on track.

The issue of vaccine passports is becoming increasingly high-profile as governments and people want to open up socialising in places like restaurants, musuems or concerts, as well as travel. The White House has today said that it will not pass a law requiring all citizens to hold a vaccine passport. Instead, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a press briefing, it expects private businesses will take the lead and decide if it something they require. US President Joe Biden's administration said it will be issuing recommendations on the issue soon. Boris Johnson earlier announced that a further 50 to 60 million new coronavirus vaccines are going to be made in the UK - here are some more details on the plan. The vaccines are being made by Novavax and the protein antigen element of the jab is called NVX-CoV2373. The vaccine will be produced at the Fujifilm plant in Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) will ""fill and finish"" the jabs, which means preparing vials of the final vaccine and packaging them for distribution from its facility at nearby Barnard Castle. The market town found itself at the centre of a furore last year when the PM's then most senior aideDominic Cummingswent there during lockdown. Novavax was the first coronavirus vaccine toshow efficacy against the new UK variant in clinical trials, the BBC's medical editor Fergus Walsh said. Find out more here.

at-risk groups has come forward for a jab. The vaccines, while good, are not 100% effective. It is why ministers and their advisers are urging caution. England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty says if people
stick to the rules any increase could be modest. The seasons may also help - respiratory viruses thrive more
in the colder months. The lower estimates of modelling done for the government suggests
there could be 30,000 more deaths by summer 2022. That would be in line with a bad flu winter. But it could
also be much, much worse. If there is one thing we have learnt, nothing can be taken
for granted with Covid. Pakistan's President Arif Alvi has tweeted that he has tested positive for Covid-19. Alvi, who is 71, says he has taken the first dose of a Covid vaccine but is awaiting the second. It is still possible to contract coronavirus after being vaccinated but the jabs protect most people against serious complications of the disease. A second dose also offers greater protection. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan tested positive earlier this month. Cases in Pakistan are on the rise, with about 4,000 cases a day reported in the past week. Allow Twitter content?

Reality Check During the briefing earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked about enforcement of coronavirus regulations and said he thought the police have ""handed out about 70,000 fines - at least - for various breaches of one kind or another"". According to the latest figures from the National Police Chiefsâ Council, police in England issued 85,975 fixed penalty notices for breaching Covid-19 rules between 27 March 2020 and 14 March 2021. The figure rises to 94,368 once police fines in Wales are included. The ""vast majority"" of the fines overall were for breaking restrictions on movement, and the rate of fines has increased during the third lockdown - with two-thirds of all penalties handed out since 21 December. You can read more about Covid-19 fines and how crime in general has changedover the course of the pandemic here. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The news that the Novavax vaccine is going to go through a
process known as fill and finish in the UK is an interesting development. Fill and finish is the process by which vaccines are
packaged up in vials, ready to be sent out to vaccination clinics. The original plan was for this to be done in Europe once the
vaccine product was manufactured by plants in the North East of England. But a deal has been struck with drug firm GSK to do that
here. Officially, the government is saying that it is all part of
their investment in the British life science industry. But given the threats from Europe about restricting exports
of vaccines, it begs all sorts of other questions too. The north-east plants have already started manufacturing the
60 million doses ordered by the government. If it gets approval from the regulator - expected in the coming weeks - supplies could be available in June.  In case you missed this at the briefing earlier, here is the PM announcing that the UK will make more vaccine doses in the North East of England: This video can not be played Reality Check The PM said that, when it comes coronavirus transmission, ""outdoors is generally much safer than indoors"". Researchers say that the chances of catching Covid outdoors
are massively reduced compared with indoors - although infections can still
happen. This is mainly down to three reasons: Even so, there are a handful of cases where it's believed
that infections did happen outside. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent This was a news conference where excitement was cloaked in caution. A splash of the giddy with a reference to the al fresco front crawlers at Hillingdon Lido in London. Admiration for the nocturnal peddlers of Ilkeston Cycle Club in Derbyshire, whose love of lycra lured them out at midnight, the moment it was legal to do so. But all the way through, from all three of the contributors, were reminders of the need to be careful. ""We don't know how strong our defences are against a new wave,"" said the prime minister. There is a ""high likelihood of some uptick"" in cases, warned Professor Chris Whitty, given the unlocking measures starting today. A high proportion of those who will catch and transmit the virus have not been vaccinated yet, we were told. Sophia Sleigh of the Evening Standard asks the PM if he can categorically rule out a full lockdown? The PM says ""yes but with at least two very important provisos"". Those are if everybody continues to follow the guidance and if the vaccine rollout continues and the vaccines continue to be as effective as it looks as though they are, he says. He says: ""I'm hopeful. I don't see anything in the data right now that would cause us to deviate from the roadmap but we need to remain humble in the face of nature and be prepared to do whatever it takes to protect the British public."" Sleigh says a report by the Evening Standard reveals care home staff in London are the least likely to take up the vaccine. She asks Whitty if he is shocked by this and asks if it offers enough protection for care home residents He says: ""The great majority of care home staff nationally have had the vaccine and as have an even greater proportion of our health care staff."" He says there are three things it's important to stress to people, firstly ""this vaccine will protect you and your family"", he says. He says ""there is unfortunately some misinformation about vaccines"" so it's important to go to reliable sources that can lay out the facts. Lastly, he says: ""I do consider people who are looking after people who are vulnerable have a professional responsibility to get vaccinated."" And that marks the end of the briefing. Â© 2025 BBC.

"On a day some lockdown measures in England are eased, the PM says being cautious is the way to get the results we want Boris Johnson tells a Downing Street briefing the UK is ""building up our own long-term UK manufacturing capabilities"" for vaccines He says Novavax is going to make a vaccine and GlaxoSmithKline will also finish and bottle vaccines - both in the North East That will provide between 50 and 60 million UK-made vaccines, the PM says Two households or groups of up to six people are now able to meet outside in England as the stay-at-home Covid restrictions order ends Weddings have been taking place in England but only with six people attending and outdoor sports have resumed Johnson says it's only because of months of sacrifice and effort we've been able to take these steps Most Covid transmissions are now among young people who have not yet been vaccinated, chief medical officer Chris Whitty says People living with those who have weakened immune systems should be able to get their vaccine, says the JCVI, the UK's official vaccination body WHO experts conclude that Covid-19 most likely passed to humans from a bat through another animal Edited by James Clarke and Sarah Collerton Thanks for joining us for live coronavirus news. Updates were brought to you by Emma Harrison, Francesca Gillett, George Bowden, Georgina Rannard, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Sarah Collerton and Sinead Wilson. Jess Warren-Basham and Jonny Cope cut their wedding list from 180 to six ... and here's the main UK headlines: We're pausing our coverage shortly - here's the main headlines about the pandemic around the world:  We told you earlier today about a couple who met online during the pandemic getting married today - as soon as Covid restrictions were relaxed. Dwain Daley and Nyasha Pitt said theyhad spent only four days apart since meeting in July. The couple tied the knot at Coventry Register Office and said they were already thinking of sharing their moment when rules are further relaxed. ""[We] cannot wait to start planning for the party now in the summer, when hopefully everyone is going to be allowed out to celebrate with us,"" Nyasha said. Hear more from them here: This video can not be played A refreshing dip on a spring day was the way some people chose to celebrate the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions. In the latest step onthe government's unlocking ""road map"", outdoor pools for exercise are once again allowed to open. The Jubilee Park outdoor swimming pool in Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire was one of those that reopened today. Joe Stanhope, from the pool, said the phone had been ringing ""off the hook"" with people trying to book their space. He added: ""People are really excited to come back and it's been a real pleasure listening to them all and getting them all back in."" This video can not be played We reported earlier that the World Health Organization has concluded thatCovid-19 most likely passed to humans from a bat through another animal. The findings came in a highly anticipated report, which has been seen by our correspondent Imogen Foulkes. The report, officially due out tomorrow, says that the theory that the virus emerged in a laboratory is ""extremely unlikely"". Its findings don't differ from what the WHO team said at the conclusion of its mission to Wuhan, China, Foulkes explains. But it does urge more research, in particular into the possible intermediary host, and into exactly when and where the virus first began to circulate. Although the Huanan food market was initially thought to be where the outbreak began, WHO and Chinese scientists found evidence the virus could have been circulating for at least some weeks before December 2019, and that some of those infected had no connection with the market. The team judged the laboratory incident to be unlikely because ""there is no record of viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes the Covid-19 disease) in any laboratory before December 2019."" It believes an unknown animal passed the virus to humans because the virus found in bats is ""evolutionarily distant"" from the SARS-CoV-2 found in humans. This interpretation would support the WHO teamâs conclusion that it is extremely important to identify the intermediate host of the virus. Last year's FA Cup final was among the games to have been played in front of an empty Wembley during lockdown Next month's FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley will be among the pilot events to trial the return of large crowds to UK venues. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has told BBC sports editor Dan Roan the games on 17 and 18 April will be part of the trial programme. The FA Cup final and the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield are also on the schedule. ""We want to get as many people back as safely as possible,"" says Dowden. But he refused to be drawn on how many spectators would be permitted to attend the Wembley semi-finals. The semi-final between Chelsea and Manchester City will beshown live on BBC Oneand the BBC iPlayer on Saturday 17 April, with Leicester v Southampton played the following day. Dowden also said more pilot events will be announced later this week after confirmation from the government that the next stage of the planned easing of restrictions on 12 April is on track.

The issue of vaccine passports is becoming increasingly high-profile as governments and people want to open up socialising in places like restaurants, musuems or concerts, as well as travel. The White House has today said that it will not pass a law requiring all citizens to hold a vaccine passport. Instead, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a press briefing, it expects private businesses will take the lead and decide if it something they require. US President Joe Biden's administration said it will be issuing recommendations on the issue soon. Boris Johnson earlier announced that a further 50 to 60 million new coronavirus vaccines are going to be made in the UK - here are some more details on the plan. The vaccines are being made by Novavax and the protein antigen element of the jab is called NVX-CoV2373. The vaccine will be produced at the Fujifilm plant in Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) will ""fill and finish"" the jabs, which means preparing vials of the final vaccine and packaging them for distribution from its facility at nearby Barnard Castle. The market town found itself at the centre of a furore last year when the PM's then most senior aideDominic Cummingswent there during lockdown. Novavax was the first coronavirus vaccine toshow efficacy against the new UK variant in clinical trials, the BBC's medical editor Fergus Walsh said. Find out more here. These charts show the number of coronavirus cases in the UK is levelling off and the death rate is falling steadily. More than 30 million people - or half of all UK adults - have now received a first dose of a vaccine and more than three million people have had a second: Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter France is one
of the most vaccine-sceptical countries in the world - fertile ground for
anti-vaccine activists spreading online misinformation. One of these is Gilles, a
science-fiction fan who helps to run a
conspiracy-themed French-language Facebook group with 50,000 members, many of
whom spread falsehoods about coronavirus. This group is
just one example of a larger trend - an increase in French-language
anti-vaccine content on social media over the past year. These pages
aren't seeking answers to legitimate medical questions. Instead, they're run by those who've firmly made up
their minds against vaccinations, and who spread false rumours about vaccines

Secret filming at one of the biggest UK Covid testing labs has found evidence of potential contamination, discarded tests and pressure to hit targets.

"This video can not be played Rescue workers used tug boats to wrench the ship's stern from the canal bank The stern of a huge container ship that has been wedged across the Suez Canal for almost a week has been freed from the shoreline, officials say. The course of the 400m-long (1,300ft) Ever Given has been corrected by 80%, according to the Suez Canal Authority. It added that further efforts to move the boat would resume later on Monday. But the head of a company involved in the rescue efforts urged caution, warning that completing the operation would not be ""a piece of cake"". The Ever Given has been blocking one of the world's busiest trade routes, forcing companies to reroute ships and causing long tailbacks of hundreds of vessels. The reports that the ship had been partially freed raised hopes that traffic along the canal could resume within hours, clearing the way for an estimated $9.6bn (Â£7bn) of goods being held up each day. How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal The cost of the Suez Canal blockage Rescue workers from the authority and the Dutch company Smit Salvage used tug boats to wrench the rear of the ship from the canal bank. Alongside the tugs, dredgers have been digging out sand and mud from under the bow of the vessel. The stern, which had been 4m from the shore, was now 102m clear, the Suez Canal Authority said, adding that the boat had been fully refloated. Efforts to move the boat resumed at 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) when the tide was due to rise. In a statement, the Suez Canal Authority said that once the tide had reached 2m, rescue workers would aim to fully restore ""the vessel's direction so it is positioned in the middle of the navigable waterway"". Traffic would resume once the ship was moved to a waiting area in a wider section of the canal, the authority said. A total of 367 vessels are waiting to pass through, and officials have said it will take three and a half days to clear the traffic jam. ""We will not waste one second,"" Suez Canal Authority Chairman Osama Rabie told Egyptian state television. The CEO of the salvage company involved in the rescue efforts told Dutch public radio that the operation was far from complete. ""We have movement, which is good news. But I wouldn't say it's a piece of cake now,"" Peter Berdowski said. He explained that high-pressure water would be used to try and remove sand and clay from underneath the bow of the ship, but if that failed, then containers would have to be lifted in an operation that could take some time. ""The bow is still stuck rock-solid at the moment in the slightly sandy clay,"" he said. Officials are waiting for high tide in order to move the ship to a wider section of the canal The 200,000-tonne Ever Given ran aground on Tuesday morning amid high winds and a sandstorm that affected visibility. Specialist salvage companies were brought in to help refloat the ship. On Sunday, canal officials began preparing to remove some of roughly 18,000 containers on board in order to lighten the load. The containers are carrying a huge variety of items and the insured value of the cargo is believed to amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. Last week, one freight operator in the UK told the BBC they were waiting for 20 boxes containing ""coconut milk and syrups, some spare parts for motors... some fork lift trucks [and] some Amazon goods"". The canal, which separates Africa from the Middle East and Asia, is one of the busiest trade routes in the world with about 12% of total global trade moving through it. It provides the shortest link between Asia and Europe. An alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, can take two weeks longer. According to data from Lloyd's List, the blockage is holding up an estimated $9.6bn of goods each day - or $400m an hour. How was the Suez Canal ship freed?

"Steve Parks says he has 20 containers of goods stuck on the Ever Given British businesses are getting worried as Egypt's Suez Canal continues to be blocked by a Taiwanese mega-container ship for the fourth day in a row. Seaport Freight Services, a shipping and freight-forwarding company based at the Port of Felixstowe, has 20 containers of goods stranded on the Ever Given. ""We're waiting on food goods like coconut milk and syrups, some spare parts for motors, we've got some fork lift trucks, some Amazon goods on there, all sorts,"" Steve Parks, director of Seaport Freight Services, tells the BBC. ""All our customers are hearing about it, and they're phoning us to ask when it will be resolved."" The 400m-long (1,312ft) ship Ever Given, operated by Taiwanese transport company Evergreen Marine, is one of the world's largest container vessels. The Suez Canal blockage in numbers Suez blockage is holding up $9.6bn of goods a day Egypt's Suez Canal blocked by huge container ship How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? It weighs 200,000 tonnes, with a maximum capacity of 20,000 containers. The ship ran aground and became lodged sideways across the waterway on Tuesday after a gust of wind blew it off course. It is blocking one of the world's busiest trade routes, causing a huge tailback of other ships trying to pass through the Suez Canal, which separates Africa from the Middle East and Asia. There are more than 160 vessels waiting at either end of the canal, according to tracking data from Lloyd's List. The Ever Given ship, viewed from satellite, remains stuck in the Suez Canal At the moment, Mr Park says there is only one way to get goods through - go round the Horn of Africa, which will add another seven days to the journey. ""We've had supply problems from the Far East, we've had Covid, we've had the Brexit changes. You couldn't really make it up,"" he says. ""Things were just starting to get better. We were just starting to get over the shortage of containers, the shortage of vessels, and then this happens."" Mirical Emblems is a firm specialising in heat-applied print transfers for clothing and uniforms, based in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. It has a shipment of raw material stuck on a boat in the Red Sea that is trying to get into the Suez Canal. The cost of the goods and the cost to ship them comes to Â£16,000. The shipment is already delayed due to the pandemic, as the original ship it was meant to travel on was rerouted, and had to wait for the next vessel bound for the UK. The ship with the raw material shipment is meant to dock at the Port of Southampton on 9 April. But if the delivery continues to be delayed, Mirical Emblems will have to pay for a second shipment of the raw material and have it flown over from South Korea for three times the shipping cost - roughly Â£21,000 - because the firm can't afford to upset its clients and affect their supply chains too. ""We're about to run out of stock, and this is just another cost we could do without,"" says Mirical Emblems' managing director Jonathan Dul. ""The pandemic has caused our turnover to fall by 20%. We've increased costs due to Brexit and now we're having delayed shipments and having to potentially buy materials twice."" Thomas O'Brien is managing director of Boxer Gifts, a toy manufacturer based in Leeds. Toy manufacturer Thomas O'Brien says shipping is current ""difficult, long and expensive"" His products are made in China, and he has six containers on ships now queuing up to get through the Suez Canal, each containing around 50,000 toys. ""It means longer shipping times, less stock availability, more money tied up on goods at sea, rather than in our warehouses, and it means more stress,"" he tells the BBC. He says it will also impact his customers - retailers, who will have to wait a little longer to get their stock. Plus, Mr O'Brien recently heard that it is likely his firm will have to pay some additional charges in order to receive the outstanding shipments, due to the ongoing situation at the Suez Canal. 'It's another addition to the long list of reasons why shipping is difficult, long and expensive at the moment, "" he says. ""The Suez Canal situation is yet another spanner in the works that makes dealing with international shipping a hell of a lot harder."" Logistics UK, which represents freight businesses, says that a lot of the goods currently bound for the UK are likely to be for retailers who are stocking their shelves ready for the summer. Egyptian officials inspect the operation to refloat the Ever Given ship There is a risk that some goods, such as perishable foods, could arrive too late to be sold, due to ships either waiting to go through the canal, or having to be re-routed round the southern tip of Africa, warns Alex Veitch, general manager of policy at Logistics UK. And while the current industry trend for extraordinarily large vessels means more goods can be transported in one go, the impact is much greater when things go wrong. ""When they turn up late or at the wrong time, it puts a lot of pressure on ports to offload them very quickly so that they can go off to the next stop,"" he says. ""That then puts pressure on domestic transport operations to get them to the shops in time, so it really does show how easy it can be to disrupt almost and invisible network of moving goods from source to the shop.""

"Shares of Chinese video platform Bilibili have slumped at their launch on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The shares opened at HKD$790 ($101.6 ; Â£73.7), which is 2.2% below their issue price, before slipping another 4%. Bilibili is similar to YouTube, but the company hopes to increase revenues through Netflix-style subscriptions. The listing is the latest in a large number of ""homecomings"" for US-listed Chinese companies. The Chinese firms have sought out secondary listings in Hong Kong due to increased scrutiny from US regulators, which began under President Donald Trump. Baidu shares flat on its Hong Kong 'homecoming' Kuaishou share price surges on market launch Why our ageing social networks may need TikTok In part, the listings are insurance against being kicked off US exchanges, a process which has already started for three Chinese telecommunications companies. In January, The New York Stock Exchange suspended state-backed telcos China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile. ""Homecoming"" listings have not always generated the same level of excitement from investors as some other tech listings. Shares of the internet search giant Baidu only edged slightly higher when they listed in Hong Kong last week, while ecommerce giant JD.com also had a lacklustre secondary launch last year. After pricing shares at $104 each last week, Bilibili raised $2.6bn, which was short of the $3bn it had anticipated. The company's launch is the weakest major share market offering in Hong Kong since Yum China Holdings shares shed 6.3% on debut in September last year, according to Refinitiv data. Currently, Bilibili is a loss-making company, although its prospectus says its revenues have nearly tripled since 2018.

"Shares of Chinese video platform Bilibili have slumped at their launch on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The shares opened at HKD$790 ($101.6 ; Â£73.7), which is 2.2% below their issue price, before slipping another 4%. Bilibili is similar to YouTube, but the company hopes to increase revenues through Netflix-style subscriptions. The listing is the latest in a large number of ""homecomings"" for US-listed Chinese companies. The Chinese firms have sought out secondary listings in Hong Kong due to increased scrutiny from US regulators, which began under President Donald Trump. Baidu shares flat on its Hong Kong 'homecoming' Kuaishou share price surges on market launch Why our ageing social networks may need TikTok In part, the listings are insurance against being kicked off US exchanges, a process which has already started for three Chinese telecommunications companies. In January, The New York Stock Exchange suspended state-backed telcos China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile. ""Homecoming"" listings have not always generated the same level of excitement from investors as some other tech listings. Shares of the internet search giant Baidu only edged slightly higher when they listed in Hong Kong last week, while ecommerce giant JD.com also had a lacklustre secondary launch last year. After pricing shares at $104 each last week, Bilibili raised $2.6bn, which was short of the $3bn it had anticipated. The company's launch is the weakest major share market offering in Hong Kong since Yum China Holdings shares shed 6.3% on debut in September last year, according to Refinitiv data. Currently, Bilibili is a loss-making company, although its prospectus says its revenues have nearly tripled since 2018. According to the prospectus, the video platform had 202 million monthly average users in the last quarter of 2020, an increase of 55% over the same quarter in 2019.

"This video can not be played Rescue workers used tug boats to wrench the ship's stern from the canal bank The stern of a huge container ship that has been wedged across the Suez Canal for almost a week has been freed from the shoreline, officials say. The course of the 400m-long (1,300ft) Ever Given has been corrected by 80%, according to the Suez Canal Authority. It added that further efforts to move the boat would resume later on Monday. But the head of a company involved in the rescue efforts urged caution, warning that completing the operation would not be ""a piece of cake"". The Ever Given has been blocking one of the world's busiest trade routes, forcing companies to reroute ships and causing long tailbacks of hundreds of vessels. The reports that the ship had been partially freed raised hopes that traffic along the canal could resume within hours, clearing the way for an estimated $9.6bn (Â£7bn) of goods being held up each day. How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal The cost of the Suez Canal blockage Rescue workers from the authority and the Dutch company Smit Salvage used tug boats to wrench the rear of the ship from the canal bank. Alongside the tugs, dredgers have been digging out sand and mud from under the bow of the vessel. The stern, which had been 4m from the shore, was now 102m clear, the Suez Canal Authority said, adding that the boat had been fully refloated. Efforts to move the boat resumed at 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) when the tide was due to rise. In a statement, the Suez Canal Authority said that once the tide had reached 2m, rescue workers would aim to fully restore ""the vessel's direction so it is positioned in the middle of the navigable waterway"". Traffic would resume once the ship was moved to a waiting area in a wider section of the canal, the authority said. A total of 367 vessels are waiting to pass through, and officials have said it will take three and a half days to clear the traffic jam. ""We will not waste one second,"" Suez Canal Authority Chairman Osama Rabie told Egyptian state television. The CEO of the salvage company involved in the rescue efforts told Dutch public radio that the operation was far from complete. ""We have movement, which is good news. But I wouldn't say it's a piece of cake now,"" Peter Berdowski said. He explained that high-pressure water would be used to try and remove sand and clay from underneath the bow of the ship, but if that failed, then containers would have to be lifted in an operation that could take some time. ""The bow is still stuck rock-solid at the moment in the slightly sandy clay,"" he said. Officials are waiting for high tide in order to move the ship to a wider section of the canal The 200,000-tonne Ever Given ran aground on Tuesday morning amid high winds and a sandstorm that affected visibility. Specialist salvage companies were brought in to help refloat the ship. On Sunday, canal officials began preparing to remove some of roughly 18,000 containers on board in order to lighten the load. The containers are carrying a huge variety of items and the insured value of the cargo is believed to amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. Last week, one freight operator in the UK told the BBC they were waiting for 20 boxes containing ""coconut milk and syrups, some spare parts for motors... some fork lift trucks [and] some Amazon goods"". The canal, which separates Africa from the Middle East and Asia, is one of the busiest trade routes in the world with about 12% of total global trade moving through it. It provides the shortest link between Asia and Europe. An alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, can take two weeks longer. According to data from Lloyd's List, the blockage is holding up an estimated $9.6bn of goods each day - or $400m an hour. How was the Suez Canal ship freed?

"Almost 60% of 50-year-olds in Wales, more than 270,000 people, have had a first Covid jab Second Covid vaccine doses will be prioritised during the expected supply slowdown of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, Wales' chief pharmacist has said. Covid,externalin April and Wales expects to have250,000 fewer Oxford-AstraZeneca jab doses. Andrew Evans said Wales' overall position was good with more than 13% of the population fully vaccinated. Mr Evans said the shipping delay will not affect Wales hitting its targets. He said Wales aims to vaccinate its priority groups by mid-April and offer all adults a jab by the end of July. More than 30m people in UK receive first Covid jab How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? Q&A: When will I get my Covid-19 vaccine? Wales has fully vaccinated a higher percentage of its population than any other UK nation, with 412,663 people already having the full course, while almost 1.4m people - or 44% of the population - have had their first dose. A delay in shipping five million doses of the Oxford vaccine to the UK was announced earlier this month, withNHS England warning of an expected disruption in supply in April. No vaccine appointments are expected to be cancelled as a result, Wales' chief pharmaceutical officer said, adding that ""significant"" stocks were still available while the shipment from India was held up. ""We had an accelerated amount of vaccine coming into Wales in the early part of March,"" said Mr Evans. ""We have been getting through those, and there remain a significant amount of vaccine doses available to the NHS over the next couple of weeks. ""But we are seeing a slight slowdown over the period after that, in the early part of April, where there will be slightly fewer doses available than we had anticipated."" A previous reduction in supplies in February led to a focus on administering second doses and second doses will be prioritised again while the Oxford-AstraZeneca shipment is delayed. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains why the Oxford vaccine matters But Mr Evans said first doses would be ""accelerating"" at the end of April and into May. ""We have been prioritising second doses since the last slowdown at the beginning of February,"" he said. ""That has meant we are in a really good position because we have got through almost 400,000 second doses, particularly with the Pfizer vaccine. ""But we will now see a slowdown in first doses of AstraZeneca vaccine. That's because we need to prioritise some of that stock for people who are now due for their second dose. ""But we have been taking action to make sure that as many people continue to get a first dose as possible, even during that slowdown. ""The action we have taken on the Pfizer vaccine to get through those second doses means that the vaccines available to us in early April can all go back into new patients getting first doses. So that is a really good position to be in."" More than 30m people in the UK have now had their first Covid jab dose. The UK ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - enough to vaccinate 50 million people. But next month the first Moderna vaccines are due to arrive in the UK and is the third vaccine of seven ordered with the UK lined up to receive 17 million doses. Like the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford jabs which are already in use, the Moderna jab is given in two doses several weeks apart. ""We will also see the Moderna vaccine coming on in the early part of April - in small quantities, but nevertheless allowing us to get to more people with a first dose by that middle of April point,"" added Mr Evans. Wales' chief pharmaceutical officer Andrew Evans is confident vaccine targets will be met ""Overall supply to general practice will continue to be high, it will continue to be high to vaccination centres, but there will be much more of a focus on second doses than on new first doses just because of this slight delay and slow-down in supply."" Mr Evans was confident that targets would be met to vaccinate priority groups by the middle of April and to offer all adults at least one jab by the end of July. ""I fully expect us to have offered that vaccine to the vast majority of people in those groups very shortly,"" he added. ""Certainly by the middle of April even with the slowdown in supply. ""Because this is just a delay it doesn't affect our ability to offer a first dose of vaccine to every adult in Wales by the end of July.""

"Cuts to addiction services for young people with drug and alcohol problems in England mean many are missing out on specialist help, according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists. It says eight out of nine regions in England have made real terms reductions in funding since 2014, and 37% overall. The situation has only been made worse by the pandemic, which has badly disrupted services. A plan to support people with mental health issues has been announced. The government aims to train up more mental health staff and target specific groups affected by the pandemic, including young people, frontline staff and those with severe mental illness. Earlier this month, it confirmedÂ£79m would be allocated to support children and young people's mental healthin schools and the community. But without specialist help for drug and alcohol dependency, mental health doctors say some young people are at risk of a lifetime of addiction, poor health or early death. The vast majority of young people seeking help for addiction do so because of problems around cannabis use or alcohol. Alcohol deaths hit record high during pandemic 'He drinks six bottles of wine a day' Cautious welcome for child mental health support How has coronavirus affected mental health? But with funding reduced by Â£26m between 2014 and 2020, and the number of young people accessing treatment down by 40%, psychiatrists say more money is urgently needed for youth addiction services. Services in the North West, the West Midlands and London have been hardest hit by cuts, the college's analysis found. Dr Emily Finch, vice-chairwoman of the addictions faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the cuts were ""completely unsustainable and unbelievably short-sighted"". ""We need to wake-up to the fact that money spent on addiction services saves the NHS a whole lot more in the long run, whether that's in A&E or in other mental health services,"" she said. ""On top of all this, the pandemic has made a dire situation even worse, as even more young people have been left unable to access services."" In 2018, 88% of young people accessing services said they had a problem with cannabis use - a drug that has become stronger and more harmful since then. The second most common problem in nearly half of young people was with alcohol. There were more than 40,000 alcohol-related admissions among the under-24s in 2019, and a quarter of those were for mental and behavioural disorders due to the use of alcohol. Dr Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""More young people will continue to have their lives blighted by the harms of drugs and alcohol unless the government acts now and commits to substantial investment in public health, including youth addictions services. ""Addictions services do have a cost, but the cost of addiction to society is far greater."" The college is calling for Â£43m to be invested in youth addiction services. A government spokesperson said: ""We are determined to confront the harms caused by drugs across the UK, and deliver for the public by making our streets safer and protecting the most vulnerable.""

"Andrea Burley and her dog Baxter in front of the kennel Normally, at this time of year, Andrea Burley would be looking after 40 dogs, as their owners jet off for the Easter holidays. But this year Holmewood Kennel is home to just one. With holidays and weddings cancelled, and with many working from home, people have not had much need for dog care. A year ago she thought her insurance policy would help cover some of the losses, at what was once a Â£200,000-a-year business. But so far she has received nothing. Instead she used her own savings to keep the business afloat. Had she not, the kennel would have gone under, and Ms Burley would have lost her home, which is tied to the business. But with loans falling due, Ms Burley says it is now ""do or die"" for her company. When the UK first went into lockdown in March last year, Ms Burley was one of thousands of business owners who turned to their insurers for help. Those with business interruption policies were confident that their insurers would pay out if they had to close their doors because of the pandemic. Business interruption policies are designed to cover financial losses if a firm cannot operate. Thousands of businesses have failed due to the pandemic But a year later the vast majority are still waiting for their money. That's because, shortly after the first lockdown came into effect, insurers - including Ms Burley's insurer MS Amlin - began issuing documents flatly refusing to pay, arguing that their policies were not designed to cover losses from events like pandemics. Typically, insurance contracts contain exclusion clauses, for events that were explicitly not intended to be covered under the policy. But a number of insurers didn't exclude events like pandemics from their cover and, indeed, their policies read as though losses caused by an event like the coronavirus outbreak should be paid. Ms Burley said her policy didn't exclude pandemics. In fact, it explicitly covered any losses as a result of someone falling ill with a disease that was notified to the authorities within 25 miles of her kennel. Her local hospital is two miles away. Insurers to pay many small firms for Covid losses âMy business could go bust if insurers donât payâ 'We've spent Â£10,000 on invalid virus insurance' Because so many insurers were rejecting claims like Ms Burley's, the city regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), took the unusual step of launching legal proceedings against a number of insurers. It asked a judge to decide whether the losses of 370,000 businesses across the country would be covered. The court found that some of those insurers, including MS Amlin, should have paid out on some claims. However the insurers again refused and appealed to the Supreme Court, which, at the beginning of this year, also found in favour of the small businesses. Since then the insurers involved in the case have begun paying claims, but some more promptly than others. New data from the FCA shows that five weeks after the Supreme Court judgement was issued on 15 January, MS Amlin hadn't decided to pay any of the more than 3,700 claims that had been made by its policyholders. Since then, the company said, it has ""made progress in settling claims and providing interim payments to eligible policyholders"" although it refused to say how many businesses had received a pay-out. The Supreme Court found largely in favour of small businesses when it handed down its decision on 15 January Another insurer, Hiscox, had only handed money to 151 of its customers by 3 March - almost seven weeks after the Supreme Court ruling. The numbers from the regulator showed it was still deciding whether to pay another more than 4,500 claims. The data implied that, on average, only around three claims a day were paid during that period. And even though some of those claims are worth up to Â£100,000, which is make-or-break money to businesses like Ms Burley's, insurers are not always offering to pay the full value of those claims. In fact, in at least 24 cases, Hiscox agreed the claim was covered, but said it decided the value of the claim was Â£0, according to Mark Killick. Mr Killick set up the Hiscox Action Group to pressure the insurer to pay claims after his PR agency Media Zoo was refused a payout from the insurer. ""Even when they're forced to pay out, they are dragging their feet extraordinarily with these sort of tactics,"" he said. ""Hiscox don't want to pay."" ""They've made a mockery of 'my word is my bond',"" he said. A source close to Hiscox said it had since revised some of its Â£0 offers but would not confirm how many were made. And in a statement the company said: ""We are paying claims as quickly as possible in line with the Supreme Court judgment."" Hiscox said both the number of claims it had accepted and payments had ""increased significantly"" since the beginning of this month, although it did not say how much it had paid out. But Richard Leedham, a partner at Mishcon de Reya, which represents some of the businesses taking legal action against Hiscox, described the insurer's lack of speed as ""shocking"". While most insurers were beginning to pay, Mr Leedham said, data from the FCA suggested neither Hiscox nor Amlin were moving very quickly. Hiscox said: ""These are complicated claims that require comprehensive financial information and discussions with customers in order to settle them fairly. ""In total, we expect to pay out $475m (Â£345m) in Covid-19 claims, including for business interruption."" The FCA data shows that, so far, more than 10,000 policyholders have received some money, and insurers have already paid out more than Â£470m. But more than 50,000 are still waiting. Total pay-outs could exceed Â£1bn. The FCA will continue to publish data monitoring progress of payments, a spokesperson said. ""It is critical that the momentum seen leading to the Supreme Court judgment is maintained and that all businesses with valid business interruption claims receive the final settlements due to them as soon as possible."" âMy business could go bust if insurers donât payâ 'We've spent Â£10,000 on invalid virus insurance' Insurers to pay many small firms for Covid losses Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?
