"New Zealand is facing a housing affordability crisis New Zealand's parliament has banned many foreigners from buying existing homes in the country - a move aimed at making properties more affordable. The ban only applies to non-residents. Australians and Singaporeans are exempt because of free-trade deals. New Zealand is facing a housing affordability crisis which has left home ownership out of reach for many. Low interest rates, limited housing stock and immigration have driven up prices in recent years. US applications for New Zealand citizenship jump 70% after election The lure of New Zealand for jaded Americans China's New Zealand farm-buying runs into opposition No, only non-residents are affected by the Overseas Investment Amendment Bill, which was passed in a 63-57 vote on Wednesday. They are now banned from purchasing most types of homes - but they will be able to make limited investments in new apartments in large developments. Foreigners with residency status in New Zealand - as well as non-resident Australian and Singaporean nationals - are not affected by the ban. This video can not be played David Parker: ""It's the right of people who live permanently in our country... to buy our homes"" New Zealand's Trade and Economic Development Minister David Parker described the passage of the bill as a ""significant milestone"". ""This government believes that New Zealanders should not be outbid by wealthier foreign buyers,"" he said. ""Whether it's a beautiful lakeside or ocean-front estate, or a modest suburban house, this law ensures that the market for our homes is set in New Zealand, not on the international market."" But opponents said the ban was unnecessary and would not fix any problem. Foreign ownership and a housing shortage in New Zealand's bigger cities were prominent issues in the run-up tolast year's election, which saw the end of nine years of rule by the conservative National Party. New Zealand now has a centre-left coalition government led by Labour's Jacinda Ardern, the country's youngest female leader. The ban follows fears that overseas buyers of homes were putting too much pressure on infrastructure and house prices. Many foreigners are drawn to New Zealand's natural attractions such as Mount Cook Chinese investors have been among the biggest and most active offshore buyers of property in the New Zealand market. Also, some wealthy Americans - like Silicon Valley tech billionaire Peter Thiel - have become New Zealand citizens or have bought property in the country. Average prices in New Zealand have risen more than 60% in the past 10 years, while in Auckland - the country's largest city - they have almost doubled. However, the housing market has somewhat cooled in recent months. In July, the median price for residential property nationwide was NZ$550,000 ($360,500; Â£284,000),according to data from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand.,external In June, about 82% of houses were bought by New Zealand's citizens or residents, with fewer than 3% of homes going to foreigners.

"This video can not be played The air ambulance was called after a horse bolted at Pembrokeshire County Show Five people, including a 12-year-old boy and 83-year old man, have been taken to hospital after a horse bolted during a farming show. The horse, which was in competition at the Pembrokeshire County Show, threw its rider and broke loose into the crowd before it went ""on a rampage"". Eight people were injured after being knocked to the ground at the show in Withybush, near Haverfordwest. Organisers said there would be a full review into the incident. The air ambulance was also sent to the scene but was not required. Parts of the showground were closed off as a result of the incident on the second day of this year's event. The horse has since been captured. Speaking soon after the emergency services arrived at the scene, Jonathan Twigg, who witnessed the event, said: ""A horse, presumably a show jumping horse, seemed to break free from the area it was being held and just went on a rampage. ""It bolted up the avenue through the crowds here and took maybe a dozen people out of the way as it just ran straight into them."" An air ambulance was called to the scene after the horse bolted The annual show, which attracts around 100,000 visitors a year, was first held in 1784. Mike Davies, chairman of the Pembrokeshire Agricultural Society's Trustees, which organisers the event, said: ""At the moment our thoughts are with those who were injured. ""We also want to thank the emergency services who were on the scene very quickly and assisted the injured."" Emergency services were sent to the scene One eyewitness, who did not want to be named, said: ""The horse was out of control, jumped out of the ring, through the crowd and in between some of the stands. ""I've been showing horses for 35 years, and I've never seen anything like this before. Everyone's in shock."" Another eyewitness said he was surprised more people were not hurt. ""The huge horse ran through a really crowded part of the show, and hit six people,"" he added. ""It was a show jumping horse, it ran through right past where I was standing. It was quite scary.""

"Cipriani joined Gloucester from Wasps in the summer England rugby international Danny Cipriani has been charged with common assault after an incident at a Jersey nightclub. The Gloucester fly-half was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday on Mulcaster Street in St Helier.

"The procedure was carried out in May 2017 by 11 surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio Katie Stubblefield was only 18 when she was severely injured by a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Her life was saved in hospital, but the young woman had life-changing injuries and had lost most of her face. Now 22, the youngest US recipient of a face transplant hasshared the results of several years of exhaustive reconstructive surgery with National Geographic magazine,external. The publication was given unprecedented access by an Ohio clinic which operated on Katie when she was just 21. A journalist and photographers followed her preparation and the results from the invasive 31-hour procedure. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The Story of a Face is on the cover of the magazine's September issue, and Katie's story is also told in a documentary online. There have only been 40 recipients of a face transplant throughout the world.The first full-face procedure was successfully carried out by Spanish doctors in 2010,external. But because surgery is still considered experimental, it is not covered by US insurance providers. Katie's surgery was eventually funded by the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine, which wants to improve treatment of military personnel who are injured at war. Katie, now 22, was deemed a good candidate because of her age and the nature of the injuries she had sustained. The transplanted face came from 31-year-old Adrea Schneider, who died from a drug overdose in 2017. First double face transplant 'well' Transplant patient 'overwhelmed' by result What's it like living with a face transplant? She was already an organ donor, but the decision to donate her face came from her grandmother, Sandra Bennington, who has since met Katie following the surgery. Adrea's grandmother said she recognised some features of her granddaughter (L) in Katie now Katie says she cannot remember much about the period before her suicide attempt, but family say she had been struggling emotionally with moving around, a failed relationship and chronic gastrointestinal health problems throughout her teens. The bullet wound destroyed much of her face - including her nose, some of her forehead and jawbone. She also had brain injuries and significant damage to her eyes. After being initially treated in Mississippi, she was transferred to Tennessee before ending up at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio - a facility already performing pioneering transplant procedures. Before the transplant, Katie had already undergone 22 reconstructive surgeries, including using her thigh and 3D printing to help reconstruct her jaw. She and her family say they did not even know what the procedure entailed when they were notified she could be eligible. ""I had no clue what a face transplant was,"" Katie said. ""When my parents helped explain everything to me, I was very excited to get a face again and to have function again."" After a year on the transplant list and having two donors fall through, she eventually underwent the procedure in May 2017. Her mother Alesia (R) said her daughter wanted the surgery to not be stared at in public Initially it was supposed to be a more partial procedure, but the decision was taken to use more of the donor's face to improve the match. Since the operation, she has had three revision surgeries. More operations are likely in order to improve appearance and functionality of the face. Katie still has difficulty speaking because of the damage done to her mouth. She will have to take medication for the rest of her life to reduce the risk of transplant rejection. The young woman told National Geographic she hopes to go to college and eventually go into counselling. She has also expressed an interest in speaking to teenagers about suicide and the value of life. ""So many people have helped me; now I want to help other people,"" she said. Dr Brian Gastman, a plastic surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic, said Katie had received the ""ultimate second chance"",externalthrough the procedure, CNN reports. ""My first wish for Katie is to be happy,"" Mr Gastman said. ""That's number one, but beyond that, I'd like her to have some level of normalcy. ""Then, she can do all that and become a spokeswoman for so many aspects - for how to be strong in the face of adversity and not to make a singular decision dictate who you are.""

"The boat capsized around 750km north of the capital Khartoum At least 24 children on their way to school and a health worker have drowned when their boat sank in northern Sudan. More than 40 children were on the boat, whose engine failed in a strong current as it crossed a 2.5km (1.6m) flooded area near the River Nile. The children, who were between the ages of seven and 16, began to panic, leaned to one side and the boat overturned, the school's headmaster told the BBC. Only two bodies have been found. Africa Live: More updates on this and other stories Why the Nile could see a 'water war' Why the end of US sanctions hasn't helped Sudan Ab el-Khayr Adam Yunis, the headmaster of the Kenba High School, said the pupils usually go to school on foot, but have been using a boat for the past week due to flooding after heavy rain. ""Those who died were mostly girls,"" he told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme. ""One family lost five daughters, and another three families lost two children each, and two families lost three children each."" The telephone network was down due to the rains, making it difficult for the headmaster to report the accident. As soon as the phones started working, they contacted all the big towns nearby - Abu Hamad, Karima and Ed-Damer - but were still waiting for help after five hours, he said. The area's residents are mostly from the Manaseer tribe. They have long raised concerns about the flooding of their land due to the construction of a controversial dam, the BBC's Mohanad Hashim reports.

"Shares in Tesla have fallen 4% on reports that US regulators are seeking to question executives at the firm about its privatisation plans. Fox News tweeted that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had sent subpoenas to the electric carmaker and was ""ramping up"" its investigation. Last week, boss Elon Musk said he was considering taking Tesla private, but some have questioned his intentions. Both Tesla and the SEC declined to comment on the Fox report. Allow Twitter content?

On Tuesday, Tesla's board of directors said it had not received a formal proposal from Mr Musk. This is despite the fact that the firm has created a special committee of three directors to evaluate any such proposal. Elon Musk is playing a dangerous game While US companies are allowed to make announcements via social media, typically they also make a simultaneous regulatory filing. Mr Musk's tweet may have violated US securities law if it turns out to be untrue, lawyers said. Tesla's Model S (left) and Model X are both priced at more than $70,000 Mr Musk announced on Twitter on 7 August that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 (Â£330) a share, and that ""funding [is] secured"". On Monday, he said financing for the deal had been discussed with Saudi Arabia. The colourful entrepreneur says he wants to de-list the struggling carmaker to take it out of the glare of Wall Street. If the plan goes ahead, it will be the biggest deal of its kind, valuing the company at $70bn (Â£55bn). However, his comments - which caused shares in Tesla to jump 11% before falling back - have landed him a lawsuit from unhappy investors. Short-sellers, who bet on share price falls, allege he misled the market. Mr Musk, who owns a fifth of the company, has complained previously about ""negative propaganda"" from short-sellers. The plaintiff in the case, Kalman Isaacs, alleges the announcement was aimed at ""completely decimating"" short-sellers. Mr Musk, who also founded satellite launching company SpaceX, is no stranger to controversy. Only last month he was forced to apologise for insulting a British diver involved in rescuing a youth football team from a cave in northern Thailand.

"Florin Ghinea, 43, faces extradition to Romania to face criminal charges The suspected head of a Romanian organised crime network is facing extradition after he was arrested in Hertfordshire. Florin Ghinea, 43, listed as one of Europol's most wanted men, was detained as he left a gym in Watford on Tuesday. Ghinea, nicknamed ""Ghenosu"", is wanted by the Romanian authorities on human trafficking, conspiracy to murder, blackmail and money laundering charges. He will appear in court for an extradition hearing on 25 September. Ghinea was arrested on Tuesday by officers from the National Crime Agency's Armed Operations Unit (NCA) in an operation supported by Hertfordshire Police.

"This video can not be played The air ambulance was called after a horse bolted at Pembrokeshire County Show Five people, including a 12-year-old boy and 83-year old man, have been taken to hospital after a horse bolted during a farming show. The horse, which was in competition at the Pembrokeshire County Show, threw its rider and broke loose into the crowd before it went ""on a rampage"". Eight people were injured after being knocked to the ground at the show in Withybush, near Haverfordwest. Organisers said there would be a full review into the incident. The air ambulance was also sent to the scene but was not required. Parts of the showground were closed off as a result of the incident on the second day of this year's event. The horse has since been captured. Speaking soon after the emergency services arrived at the scene, Jonathan Twigg, who witnessed the event, said: ""A horse, presumably a show jumping horse, seemed to break free from the area it was being held and just went on a rampage. ""It bolted up the avenue through the crowds here and took maybe a dozen people out of the way as it just ran straight into them."" An air ambulance was called to the scene after the horse bolted The annual show, which attracts around 100,000 visitors a year, was first held in 1784. Mike Davies, chairman of the Pembrokeshire Agricultural Society's Trustees, which organisers the event, said: ""At the moment our thoughts are with those who were injured. ""We also want to thank the emergency services who were on the scene very quickly and assisted the injured."" Emergency services were sent to the scene One eyewitness, who did not want to be named, said: ""The horse was out of control, jumped out of the ring, through the crowd and in between some of the stands. ""I've been showing horses for 35 years, and I've never seen anything like this before. Everyone's in shock."" Another eyewitness said he was surprised more people were not hurt. ""The huge horse ran through a really crowded part of the show, and hit six people,"" he added. ""It was a show jumping horse, it ran through right past where I was standing. It was quite scary.""

"The US says it does not know what the satellite is or why it is behaving strangely A mysterious Russian satellite displaying ""very abnormal behaviour"" has raised alarm in the US, according to a State Department official. ""We don't know for certain what it is and there is no way to verify it,""said assistant secretary Yleem Poblete at a conference,externalin Switzerland on 14 August. She voiced fears that it was impossible to say if the object may be a weapon. Russia has dismissed the comments as ""unfounded, slanderous accusations based on suspicions"". The satellite in question was launched in October last year. ""[The satellite's] behaviour on-orbit was inconsistent with anything seen before from on-orbit inspection or space situational awareness capabilities, including other Russian inspection satellite activities,"" Ms Poblete told the conference on disarmament in Switzerland. ""Russian intentions with respect to this satellite are unclear and are obviously a very troubling development,"" she added, citing recent comments made by the commander of Russia's Space Forces, who said adopting ""new prototypes of weapons"" was a key objective for the force. Ms Poblete said that the US had ""serious concerns"" that Russia was developing anti-satellite weapons. Alexander Deyneko, a senior Russian diplomat, told the Reuters news agency that the comments were ""the same unfounded, slanderous accusations based on suspicions, on suppositions and so on"". He called on the US to contribute to a Russian-Chinese treaty that seeks to prevent an arms race in space. Space weapons may be designed to cause damage in more subtle ways than traditional weapons like guns, which could cause a lot of debris in orbit, explained Alexandra Stickings, a space security expert at the Royal United Services Institute. ""[Such weapons may include] lasers or microwave frequencies that could just stop [a satellite] working for a time, either disable it permanently without destroying it or disrupt it via jamming,"" she said. But it was difficult to know what technology is available because so much information on space-based capabilities is classified, she added. She also said it would be very difficult to prove that any event causing interference in space was an intentional, hostile action by a specific nation state. Ms Poblete's comments were particularly interesting in light of President Donald Trump's decision to launcha sixth branch of the US armed forces named Space Force, added Ms Stickings. ""The narrative coming from the US is, 'space was really peaceful, now look at what the Russians and Chinese are doing' - ignoring the fact that the US has developed its own capabilities."" A spokesman for the UK's Ministry of Defence said he could neither confirm nor deny any tracking of Russian satellites. ""There are a range of threats and hazards to all space capabilities in what is an increasingly contested domain,"" he said. ""These include the development of counter-space weapons by a number of nations. ""The UK is working closely with international allies, including the US, to re-enforce responsible and safe behaviours in space and to build knowledge, understanding and resilience.""

"Teaching was under way when the bomb went off Forty-eight people have been killed and 67 injured in a bomb explosion at an education centre in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, officials say. Police say a suicide bomber walked into the centre while teaching was under way and detonated his bomb belt. Many of those killed were teenagers who were getting extra tuition as they prepared for university entrance exams. In the northern province of Baghlan, an attack killed at least nine policemen and 35 soldiers, officials say. Taliban militants denied involvement in the Kabul attack, in a mostly Shia Muslim area. The Shia community in Afghanistan has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni Muslim extremists of the Islamic State group, which views the Shia practice of Islam as heretical. On the same day,the Taliban said it could no longer guarantee safe passage for Red Cross staff working in Afghanistan, amid a row over the treatment of Taliban prisoners in a jail in Kabul. The attack on the education centre took place at about 16:00 local time (11:30 GMT). Video: The Afghan girls returning to school Tough school? War, illiteracy and hope in Afghanistan BBC reporter's terrifying days amid Taliban assault ""We can confirm the attack was caused by a suicide bomber on foot. The bomber detonated himself inside the education centre,"" police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. The bombing comes at a time of renewed unrest in Afghanistan ""Most of the boys at the educational centre have been killed,"" Sayed Ali, who witnessed the blast, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""It was horrific and many of the students were torn to pieces."" Another man, who gave his name as Assadullah, told AFP news agency how he had run toward the blast scene to try and rescue his 17-year-old brother inside. ""He was a smart and energetic boy, top of his class,"" he said. ""Now... I am not sure he will survive."" Relatives pictured next to the coffins of policeman who were killed in the Baghlan attack Afghanistan has seen a recent upsurge in militant violence, including a major Taliban assault on the eastern city of Ghazni. At least 100 members of the security forces were killed in the fighting at Ghazni, officials have said. The UN has warned that as many as 150 civilians may have also been killed. Tadamichi Yamamoto, the UN's Special Representative for Afghanistan, made an appeal on Wednesday for violence to end. ""The extreme human suffering caused by the fighting in Ghazni highlights the urgent need for the war in Afghanistan to end,"" he said in a statement.

"Cipriani joined Gloucester from Wasps in the summer England rugby international Danny Cipriani has been charged with common assault after an incident at a Jersey nightclub. The Gloucester fly-half was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday on Mulcaster Street in St Helier. Police said he had been charged with common assault, larceny, assault on police, resisting arrest and being disorderly on licensed premises. The 30-year-old has been remanded in custody until a hearing on Thursday. He had been on the island with his club during a pre-season tour. Gloucester Rugby Club said they were ""aware of the incident"" and would make a further announcement in due course. Cipriani, who moved to Gloucester from fellow Premiership club Wasps in the summer, was due to make his debut with the team on Saturday. He has played 16 times for England since his international debut in 2008. Two of those caps came during England's tour of South Africa in June, with Cipriani making his first Test start for almost 10 years in the final match of the series.

"London mayor Sadiq Khan says the increase in minicabs needs to be halted to improve air quality and combat congestion The mayor of London has urged the government to follow New York's example and allow a cap on the number of minicabs in the capital. Sadiq Khan said an increase in private hire cabs needed to be halted to combat congestion and improve air quality. But the Licensed Private Hire Car Association (LPHCA) accused him of trying to protect the black cab industry. The Department for Transport is considering the proposal. The letter was sent to Mr Grayling on Tuesday evening Last week,New York became the first major US city to approve a cap on ride-hail car licences- which includes app-based services such as Uber. In a letter to transport secretary Chris Grayling, Mr Khan said: ""Unlike New York, I don't have the power to cap the number of private hire vehicles in London. ""I am writing to again urge the Government to grant me that power as the mayor of London - alongside appropriate restrictions on cross-border hiring, to enable Londoners, like New Yorkers, to breathe better air and live in a less congested city."" A spokesman for City Hall said the mayor's office has been raising the proposal for a limit over several years as part of an on-going conversation. The New York decision, he added, shows it was something that ""can definitely be done"". In 2010-11,TfL counted 61,200 private hire drivers and 50,663 private hire licensed vehicles in London,external. This went up to 113,645 drivers and 87,921 vehicles in 2017-18 - an increase Mr Khan described as ""massive"" and ""unsustainable"". There are currently 87,921 licensed private hire vehicles in London But Steve Wright, chairman of the LPHCA, said a cap would only push up prices, make it harder for companies to recruit drivers and leave minicab users stranded. He added: ""This is a ridiculous proposal. It's just a draconian thing from years gone by. It's protecting the black cab industry and will be detrimental to consumers."" Uber said it was ""committed to helping address congestion and air pollution"". The DfT is considering a report bya group,externalcommissioned to look into handing extra powers to City Hall regarding private hire cars. The group's report is due to be published next month.

"The BBC will not challenge a ruling over its coverage of a police raid at Sir Cliff Richard's home in 2014 at the Court of Appeal. A High Court judge ruled the BBC had infringed the singer's privacy,awarding him Â£210,000 in damages in July, and refused leave to appeal. The corporation will now seek advice from the attorney general over the ruling's impact on future reporting. ""There is a fundamental principle of press freedom at stake,"" the BBC said. A spokesperson for Sir Cliff said he welcomed the BBC's decision, adding that he ""hopes that outstanding issues can be resolved quickly"". David Jordan, the BBC's director of editorial policy and standards, said the full cost of the case to the BBC was not yet known, but Â£1.9m had so far been spent. Sir Cliff was never arrested or charged during the police investigation. It followed an allegation made by a man who claimed he was sexually assaulted as a child by Sir Cliff at an event at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane stadium in 1985. The BBC has apologised to Sir Cliff for the distress caused by its coverage, but originally wanted permission to appeal, arguing the court judgement could threaten press freedom. After considering the rejection of its High Court appeal application, the broadcaster has decided not to go directly to the Court of Appeal. The BBC said appealing would be ""an expensive legal cul-de-sac and one that would simply prolong Sir Cliff's distress"". However, it iswriting to ask the attorney general,externalto ""consider a review of the law in this important area to protect the right to properly and fairly report criminal investigations, and to name the person under investigation"". Reaction to the Sir Cliff case BBC bosses 'should carry the can' 'Tough questions' over BBC appeal decision In the letter, the BBC's director-general Tony Hall writes: ""The BBC has decided not to seek permission from the Court of Appeal to appeal against that judgment - even though we are advised and believe that the judge erred in law in finding that broadcasters and journalists, when reporting on matters in the public interest, normally have no right to publish the name of a person who is the subject of a criminal investigation."" Lord Hall added that it was his understanding the Court of Appeal would say that it was for Parliament, not the judiciary, to set out ""in detail the balance between competing public interests"". But the attorney general's office has since told BBC News that a legal review would not fall under its remit and that Mr Hall should re-direct his letter. A government spokesperson said it was aware of the BBC's concerns and would respond to the letter ""in due course"". This video can not be played Oliver Duff, editor of the i newspaper, says the ruling is a dangerous change to the law Last month, Mr Justice Mann ruled in favour of Sir Cliff, 77, following the trial in London. The judge's findings included that Sir Cliff had a right to privacy while he was a suspect in the South Yorkshire Police investigation - trumping the broadcaster's right to freedom of expression to publish his name and cover the raid. He concluded that the BBC's coverage - which involved a helicopter filming the search at Sir Cliff's Berkshire home - had been a ""very serious"" invasion of privacy. Oliver Duff, editor of the i newspaper, said this ruling tipped the balance toward secrecy. ""Yes, it will help innocent people like Sir Cliff, but it will also hurt countless victims of crime and it will make it much harder to get convictions in some cases,"" he told the BBC. ""There can be a domino effect when news of an investigation breaks and other witnesses come forward."" Analysis by BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman Many will ask why the BBC has decided not to seek permission to appeal against a judgment its director of news and current affairs felt represented a dramatic shift against press freedom and reduced scrutiny of the police. And why, if it was the right thing to do to run the original story, to vigorously contest Sir Cliff's legal action in court and to remain bullish about the possible justification for an appeal following the judgment, is it now the right thing not to try to appeal through the courts? The BBC's answer is that it has been told that it would not win an appeal. While many in the media felt strongly that the judgment restricted press freedom and the BBC received support among newspapers that are often critical of it, a significant section of the public did not agree with the BBC position. They supported Sir Cliff and did not like the way he had been treated by the BBC. The BBC's statement does not mention public opinion. However, in the battle between a national treasure and the national broadcaster, it is difficult not to conclude that the opinion of the public, who pay the licence fee that funds the BBC, may well have been a significant factor. Read more from Clive Coleman In an email sent to BBC staff on Wednesday, Lord Hall said: ""With hindsight, there are some things we could have done differently: the use of the helicopter; the tone of some emails, which were inappropriate; and, in retrospect the awards submission was insensitive."" ""We tried hard to explore a settlement before this came to court, but it would only have been possible to do so if we had conceded that it was unlawful to identify Sir Cliff in our reports. We couldn't do that,"" he added. Both the News Media Association and the Society of Editors have said they too will make representations to government. ""Parliament should now urgently consider whether such a step towards individual privacy against the protection of society's overall liberties is acceptable,"" said executive director of the society, Ian Murray. ""The society recognises that the sympathies of the public may well be strongly with Sir Cliff on this issue and in this particular case, but there are bigger issues at stake that, if unchallenged, will affect the liberties of all citizens."" Mr Justice Mann awarded Sir Cliff Â£190,000 damages and an extra Â£20,000 in aggravated damages after the BBC submitted its coverage of the raid for an award. The BBC was told to pay 65% of the Â£190,000 and South Yorkshire Police 35%. The BBC also agreed to pay Sir Cliff Â£850,000 towards his legal costs. South Yorkshire Police had earlier agreed to pay Sir Cliff Â£400,000 after settling a claim he brought against the force.

"Misoprostol is sold under the brand name Cytotec among others Scottish women will still be allowed to take abortion pills at home after a legal challenge against the move was thrown out. Scotlandbecame the first part of the UKto let women take the drug misoprostol at home last year. The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) challenged the decision at the Court of Session. However, judge Lady Wisehas now ruled,externalthat the Scottish government's move was ""not unlawful"". SPUC said it was ""extremely disappointed"" with the decision and that it would appeal against the ruling. The vast majority of abortions in Scotland take place at less than nine weeks gestation, and are medical rather than surgical procedures. The medical treatment involves taking two different drugs - first misfepristone, which blocks hormones which maintain the pregnancy, and then misoprostol, which can be taken on the same or following days. Within an hour of taking the second tablet, women often experience heavy bleeding - usually on the way home from the clinic. Scottish ministers moved to let women take misoprostol at home, saying this would allow them to be ""in control of their treatment and as comfortable as possible during this procedure"". This already happens in other countries such as France and Sweden, and the British Pregnancy Advisory Service has been lobbying for the law in the UK to be changed. However, pro-life group SPUC challenged the decision in Scotland's highest court, arguing that such a move contravenes the 1967 Abortion Act. It said abortions could only legally be carried out in a medical facility, and argued that allowing women to take the tablet at home could put their health at risk. However, Lady Wise rejected this, saying: ""It seems to me that patients who self-administer medication at home may still be described as being treated by their medical practitioner, who remains in charge of that treatment."" Drawing an example to diabetics injecting themselves with insulin, she added: ""Regardless of place, there is no need for a doctor to hand the medication to the woman personally."" Dismissing the challenge, the judge wrote: ""I have concluded that the decision of the respondents to approve a woman's home as a place where one stage of the termination of pregnancy can be carried out is not unlawful on either of the grounds contended for by the petitioner."" John Deighan, chief executive of SPUC Scotland, said he was ""extremely disappointed"" with the verdict. He said: ""We maintain the belief that our arguments convincingly exposed the unlawfulness of the actions taken by the Scottish government, which are in contravention of the law. ""We will give thorough consideration of the judgement but at the forefront of our thoughts is the expectation that we will appeal the decision."" Prof Lesley Regan, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said the decision marked ""a very significant step forward"". She urged UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock to replicate the move south of the border, saying he should ""extend the same dignity and compassion to women in England"". She said: ""It will allow women to avoid the distress and embarrassment of bleeding and pain during their journey home from an unnecessary second visit to a clinic or hospital. ""Ultimately, it will help to improve women's access to safe and regulated abortion care and take pressure off NHS services.""

"The flight had been in the air for about an hour when the couple started arguing, the court heard A couple whose ""foul-mouthed"" argument led an aircraft to be diverted, carried on a holiday after sleeping a night on airport benches, a court heard. Ronald St Ville, 53, and Pauline Gordon, 66, were removed from Jet2's Stansted to Las Palmas flight in Faro after the mid-air row in July 2017, Chelmsford Crown Court was told. Jet2 has since sent letters demanding compensation, the jury was told. The couple, of Stewart Road, Stratford, deny endangering an aircraft. After the couple, who are still together, spent the night in the Portuguese airport, Ms Gordon called family members who helped her book a flight back to Gatwick and another out to Gran Canaria the next day, to continue with their holiday. The jury heard the couple began arguing after Mr St Ville refused to tell his partner who he had been texting. After the row Mr St Ville had asked for money to buy a drink from Ms Gordon and had then taken her handbag, leading to a struggle, when she said no. Ms Gordon, who paid for the all inclusive holiday as a birthday treat, told the court she had been annoyed when she found out Mr St Ville was texting another woman whom she had thought was just a friend. 'Arguing couple' diverted Jet2 flight She said: ""He told me she had his passport and when he went to collect it she said, 'Why are you going on holiday with your other woman?' which I thought was funny."" But she said neither of them had been aggressive during the argument and after she got her bag back following a brief tussle they both calmed down. Giving evidence Mr St Ville said he had made no threats of violence towards Ms Gordon and the argument had only lasted ""a few minutes"". ""I couldn't see any need to divert the flight,"" he told the court. Ms Gordon added: ""The holiday was okay, but Ronald kept texting that woman and he didn't want to go out anywhere.  He said it was too hot."" The trial continues.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Ireland correspondent Chris Page reports from a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the Omagh bombing A memorial bell has tolled in Omagh to mark the 20th anniversary of the Real IRA car bomb that killed 29 people in the County Tyrone town. The bell stopped ringing at 15:10 BST - the time of the explosion - and was followed by two minutes of silence. A woman pregnant with twins was among the peoplekilled in the dissident republican attack on 15 August 1998,external. Former police ombudsman Baroness Nuala O'Loan said on Wednesday that the bomb could have been prevented. In pictures: 20th anniversary of Omagh bomb This video can not be played The Omagh bombing: A timeline of events It was the greatest single loss of life in the Troubles. The bell was rung 32 times in memory of the victims - with the extra single peal for all who have lost their lives in atrocities around the world. It is part of a public vigil being held at the bottom of Market Street in the town. In the Republic of Ireland, President Michael D Higgins rang the peace bell at Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in - his official residence - in solidarity with the people of Omagh. The bell was designed to mark the 10th anniversary of the Good Friday peace agreement. Floral tributes were placed in Omagh's memorial garden on the 20th anniversary of the bombing Omagh's Market Street was busy with shoppers as it was on this date 20 years ago. Relatives who organised today's event said it is about remembrance, hope and moving forward, recognising the forgotten people of the Omagh bomb, such as the emergency services and the ordinary people who helped in the aftermath. For some the anniversary is too painful to join the public commemoration - they will remember their loved ones in their own way. On Wednesday morning one person came alone to lay a bunch of flowers at the memorial. Others spent the afternoon at the gravesides of their loved ones. Baroness O'Loan, whoinvestigated the police's actions in the lead up to the bombing,external, claimed the Omagh bomb could have been prevented if the security forces had acted differently. She said: ""When I reported on Omagh I said we didn't know whether the bomb could have been prevented."" ""It is now my very firm view that the bomb could have been prevented."" The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) rejected her claim and said her comments would further ""traumatise"" victims' families. The bombing was carried out by the Real IRA just months after the Good Friday Agreement was signed Baroness O'Loan said there was ""sufficient intelligence to take action"" and the ""taking of that action could have prevented"" the explosion. ""This wasn't just a random bomb - the police knew an awful lot about the activities of the IRA in this area,"" she added as she repeated her calls for a public inquiry into the atrocity. She said the intelligence services were tracking the movements of the car containing the bomb from the Republic of Ireland. PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said Baroness O'Loan had ""changed her position on that without real explanation"". Hundreds of people gathered in Omagh to remember those who died in the explosion ""If it is factually true and can be proven to any standard of proof whatsoever, why did she not say it in 2001 when she published her report?"" he said. ""When she had access to all the material she came to the conclusion that she could not know, based on all that information, if the bomb could have been prevented. Kevin Skelton, whose wife Philomena died in the blast, said that Baroness O'Loan's comments did not ""make any difference"". ""Telling us now that the bomb could have been prevented is a bit late - it should have been prevented at the time,"" he said. ""It won't bring my wife back."" Alan McQuillan, a former senior police officer in Northern Ireland, said that dissident republican groups could still carry out an attack like the Omagh bomb. ""They have fractured, they have broken up... [but] they remain a continual potential threat and we've got to deal with that,"" he added. The Omagh bombing was carried out bythe dissident republican Real IRA,externalseveral months after the signing of theGood Friday Agreement. The bomb, which was packed with 225kg (496lb) of explosives, detonated in a car parked in the middle of the town's main street. Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt was responsible for the Omagh bomb, a High Court judge found in a civil case in 2009. Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were also found liable for the attack. The four men were named by Mr Justice Morgan in a ruling made as part of a landmark case taken by some of the families of the victims. The 12 relatives were awarded more than Â£1.6m in damages for the attack but to date nothing has been paid. A warning had been called in 40 minutes earlier but the caller had said the car was at a different location. The dead included three generations of one family. No-one has been convicted over the bombing.

"Higher transport costs contributed to the rise in inflation last month UK inflation rose to 2.5% in July, after holding steady at 2.4% in the previous three months, as the cost of transport and computer games increased. It was the first jump in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure since November and was in line with forecasts. Meanwhile the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation fell to 3.2%. The Department for Transport uses the RPI figure to set the maximum annual increase for regulated rail fares. Despite the rise for CPI, wage growth is still outstripping inflation. On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics said that average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.7% for the three months to June. Wednesday's inflation figures show that increases in computer games and transport -  up 5.6% in the year ending July 2018 - were partially offset by falls in the price of clothing. For manufacturers, the cost of raw materials was 10.9% higher than in July 2017, the biggest rise in more than a year. Much of that cost pressure has been caused by oil price increases of more than 50% over the period. Regulated rail fares to rise 3.2% Unemployment at lowest since 1975 UK growth boosted by warmer weather The CPI figure had hit a five-year high of 3.1% in November, when the inflationary effect of the pound's fall following the June 2016 Brexit vote reached its peak. Earlier this month the Bank of England forecast inflation would rise to 2.6% in July before falling back. The Bank expects inflation will settle down to just above its 2% target in two years' time as it gradually increases interest rates. Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said the rise in inflation showed the cost of living squeeze was not yet a thing of the past. ""For households this isn't good news, as the already weak growth in their pay packets is being further eroded by high prices. This is likely to weigh down consumer spending, posing fresh problems for embattled high street businesses,"" he said. ""As the temporary factors pushing prices up fade away, inflation is expected to slowly fall back close to the target rate, but that will offer little respite for workers without a significant pickup to their salaries in tandem."" Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics added: ""Unless inflation in the services sector strengthens dramatically, CPI inflation will fall below the 2% target in the first half of next year.""

"Surgeons have warned about the health risks of Botox and fillers, after a High Street retailer said it would start offering the cosmetic treatments. Superdrug said it would provide the injections at one of its London branches, following feedback from nearly 10,000 customers. But surgeons warned that the procedures were not ""casual beauty treatments"". The injections could sometimes result in infection and potentially even paralysis in facial muscles, they said. Superdrug said it would be making Botox and dermal fillers available to people over the age of 25. The Skin Renew Service, which has launched in the retailer's London Strand store before being rolled out nationwide, is available only following a phone booking and a consultation with a qualified nurse. The treatments start at Â£99 and will be carried out in a private consultation room. Caris Newson, head of health and wellbeing services at Superdrug, said: ""We're listening to what people are telling us they would like, which is the reassurance that if they choose to have aesthetic treatments then it will be administered by highly qualified nurse practitioners in a private consultation room."" But the British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons warned that Botox and dermal fillers should not be seen as ""casual beauty treatments"" like eyebrow threading or waxing. Spokesman Gerard Lambe said: ""Administering an injection of any kind is a very serious procedure and requires an experienced and qualified health professional. ""All kinds of risks can arise, from infection to incorrectly applied needle placement over delicate facial muscles - which can lead to paralysis."" 'I'm swapping nursing for botox' Botox Bust: How some doctors are breaking the rules Beauticians banned from filler register It comes after it was announced last week thatbeauticians would be blocked from joining a new register designed to make getting injected with fillers safer. The voluntary register was opened by the Joint Council for Cosmetic Practitioners in April to everyone trained to a high standard. But it will now include only those with medical training, after doctors and nurses threatened to boycott it. Botulinum toxin injections, such as Botox and Dysport, are medical treatments that can also be used to help relax facial muscles This makes lines and wrinkles, such as crow's feet and frown lines, less obvious The effect isn't permanent There's no guarantee the desired effect will be achieved The ageing process will still happen elsewhere - for example, Botox will not fix sagging eyelids Take time to find a reputable practitioner who is properly qualified and practises in a clean, safe and appropriate environment You shouldn't have botulinum injections if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, since the effects on the baby aren't known Source:NHS Choices,external Beauticians banned from filler register New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war Visa row fuels anxiety for Indians eyeing American dream 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Teaching was under way when the bomb went off Forty-eight people have been killed and 67 injured in a bomb explosion at an education centre in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, officials say. Police say a suicide bomber walked into the centre while teaching was under way and detonated his bomb belt. Many of those killed were teenagers who were getting extra tuition as they prepared for university entrance exams. In the northern province of Baghlan, an attack killed at least nine policemen and 35 soldiers, officials say. Taliban militants denied involvement in the Kabul attack, in a mostly Shia Muslim area. The Shia community in Afghanistan has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni Muslim extremists of the Islamic State group, which views the Shia practice of Islam as heretical. On the same day,the Taliban said it could no longer guarantee safe passage for Red Cross staff working in Afghanistan, amid a row over the treatment of Taliban prisoners in a jail in Kabul. The attack on the education centre took place at about 16:00 local time (11:30 GMT). Video: The Afghan girls returning to school Tough school? War, illiteracy and hope in Afghanistan BBC reporter's terrifying days amid Taliban assault ""We can confirm the attack was caused by a suicide bomber on foot. The bomber detonated himself inside the education centre,"" police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. The bombing comes at a time of renewed unrest in Afghanistan ""Most of the boys at the educational centre have been killed,"" Sayed Ali, who witnessed the blast, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""It was horrific and many of the students were torn to pieces."" Another man, who gave his name as Assadullah, told AFP news agency how he had run toward the blast scene to try and rescue his 17-year-old brother inside. ""He was a smart and energetic boy, top of his class,"" he said. ""Now... I am not sure he will survive."" Relatives pictured next to the coffins of policeman who were killed in the Baghlan attack Afghanistan has seen a recent upsurge in militant violence, including a major Taliban assault on the eastern city of Ghazni. At least 100 members of the security forces were killed in the fighting at Ghazni, officials have said. The UN has warned that as many as 150 civilians may have also been killed. Tadamichi Yamamoto, the UN's Special Representative for Afghanistan, made an appeal on Wednesday for violence to end. ""The extreme human suffering caused by the fighting in Ghazni highlights the urgent need for the war in Afghanistan to end,"" he said in a statement. BBC Pashto journalist Assadullah Jalalzai wrote his account of living three days there under siegebefore he was able to escape.

"Andrew Mabbitt says it has been six weeks since the damage occurred Virgin Media has been accused of leaving holes in people's walls and not following up complaints to fix the damage. One customer said he has so far waited six weeks to havea 10in (25.4cm) crater-like hole,externalrepaired. Complaints left on social media often say that requests for calls or web chats with Virgin have gone unfulfilled. Virgin Media has apologised and said it will contact affected customers. Broadband engineers frequently have to drill or alter holes when installing cables in people's homes - but sometimes this can go wrong. ""The chap who did the installation was incredibly apologetic and it was a genuine accident,"" explained Andrew Mabbitt, director of cyber-security firm Fidus Information Security. He said that the engineer then called his manager to arrange a repair, but this never materialised. ""Got a call the next day from Virgin saying they'd be in touch soon to arrange a date and they never called back,"" Mr Mabbitt told the BBC. He added that he also tried to contact the firm via its online chat service - but it was not working. This drill bit was left in a wall by a Virgin Media engineer, according to customer Dom Valentine Another customer, Dom Valentine, complained that the company left a large drill bit stuck in his wall for more than a week.

He added that he is still waiting to have it dealt with and in the meantime he has been told to expect a sizeable bill from the army, which owns the property. Virgin Media offered him Â£20 credit but he said the firm has not followed up on providing a repair. ""I was told the area manager would get back to me, which he hasn't,"" added Mr Valentine. A spokeswoman for Ofcom told the BBC that since 1 June the regulator had received 10 complaints about damage to property left by Virgin Media workers and three relating to work done by Openreach. Virgin Media has responded to these queries via social media, but some customers say damage to their homes is still awaiting repair.

""We are now in the process of contacting the customers listed in this article so we can see if the issue still exists and, if so, try and resolve it as soon as possible."" Complaints have been left on social media reporting similar problems caused by other broadband firms, but Virgin Media teams often have to drill more holes in walls than BT or Sky, according to Andrew Ferguson at news site Thinkbroadband.

Virgin Media has responded to these queries via social media, but some customers say damage to their homes is still awaiting repair. ""Virgin Media apologises to any customer who has experienced issues when our services have been installed in their property, as we do our best to make sure the process is as smooth as possible,"" the firm said in a statement. ""We are now in the process of contacting the customers listed in this article so we can see if the issue still exists and, if so, try and resolve it as soon as possible."" Complaints have been left on social media reporting similar problems caused by other broadband firms, but Virgin Media teams often have to drill more holes in walls than BT or Sky, according to Andrew Ferguson at news site Thinkbroadband. This is in order to install its hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC)cables directly to people's homes. ""That's changing, there are more homes getting what's calledfull fibre[from various firms] - problems like this are probably going to increase, they're not going to go away,"" he told the BBC.

"This video can not be played The air ambulance was called after a horse bolted at Pembrokeshire County Show Five people, including a 12-year-old boy and 83-year old man, have been taken to hospital after a horse bolted during a farming show. The horse, which was in competition at the Pembrokeshire County Show, threw its rider and broke loose into the crowd before it went ""on a rampage"". Eight people were injured after being knocked to the ground at the show in Withybush, near Haverfordwest. Organisers said there would be a full review into the incident. The air ambulance was also sent to the scene but was not required. Parts of the showground were closed off as a result of the incident on the second day of this year's event. The horse has since been captured. Speaking soon after the emergency services arrived at the scene, Jonathan Twigg, who witnessed the event, said: ""A horse, presumably a show jumping horse, seemed to break free from the area it was being held and just went on a rampage. ""It bolted up the avenue through the crowds here and took maybe a dozen people out of the way as it just ran straight into them."" An air ambulance was called to the scene after the horse bolted The annual show, which attracts around 100,000 visitors a year, was first held in 1784. Mike Davies, chairman of the Pembrokeshire Agricultural Society's Trustees, which organisers the event, said: ""At the moment our thoughts are with those who were injured. ""We also want to thank the emergency services who were on the scene very quickly and assisted the injured."" Emergency services were sent to the scene One eyewitness, who did not want to be named, said: ""The horse was out of control, jumped out of the ring, through the crowd and in between some of the stands. ""I've been showing horses for 35 years, and I've never seen anything like this before. Everyone's in shock."" Another eyewitness said he was surprised more people were not hurt. ""The huge horse ran through a really crowded part of the show, and hit six people,"" he added. ""It was a show jumping horse, it ran through right past where I was standing. It was quite scary.""

"Campaigners say passengers have experienced a deteriorating service but will have to pay more Rail commuters in England's biggest cities are spending up to a fifth of their take-home pay on an annual season ticket, BBC analysis has found. It costs passengers up to 40p a mile to travel to work, with fares set to increase in January. The Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) said passengers were paying more for services that had ""deteriorated"". The Rail Delivery Group said 98p in every pound of fares went on ""running and improving"" the railway. Many long-distance commuters will see the annual cost of getting to work increase by more than Â£100 from next year. The CBT said passengers had been let down by a summer of chaos,after a rail timetable overhaul saw scores of cancellations and delays. ""Rail passengers have suffered deteriorating services this year, and are now being told they will have to pay even more in January,"" said Steve Chambers from CBT. ""Some commuters are spending a fifth of their take-home pay on commuting to work, which is shocking. ""Following the botched introduction of new timetables, the lack of improvements to services and the failure to quickly deliver compensation, the Government should agree to a fares freeze for January."" The group said it wanted to see fares frozen at their current level and for part-time workers to be given discounted season tickets. Many long-distance commuters will see the annual cost of getting to work increase by more than Â£100 July's Retail Price Index (RPI) was used to set January's 3.2% fare rises, which is lower than the 3.6% imposed in 2018. Based on someone commuting five days a week, they would use their ticket about 228 days a year. Rail fares to rise by up to 3.2% next year Passengers rail at fresh train disruption Rail timetable changes for winter scaled back Analysis by the BBC England Data Unit of more than 80 season tickets - based on a commuter using their ticket 228 days a year - covering journeys to London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Bristol and Liverpool, found: A full time worker on the median wage for one of these cities will spend an average of 11p in every Â£1 of their salary on an annual pass, after tax Commuters from St Albans, Sevenoaks and Harlow travelling to and from London 228 days a year can expect to pay more than 40p for every mile travelled Others travelling from East Didsbury and Macclesfield into Manchester and from Bath Spa into Bristol can expect to pay more than 32p per mile of their commute A season ticket from Southampton Central to London will cost Â£5,885, which is over a fifth of the average full-time take-home wage for London, Â£28,685 Someone living in Cambridge and working in London will pay more than Â£5,000 for an annual pass, up from Â£4,952 in 2018 Season tickets will have risen an average of 9% since 2016 Fare increases are based on the RPI measure of inflation, but transport secretary Chris Grayling has suggestedfuture fare increases could be pegged at the lower measureof inflation, the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, representing train companies, said: ""For every pound paid in fares, 98p goes back in to running and improving the railway. We are ready to work with all parts of the rail industry to improve value for money for our customers."" Almost half of rail fares are regulated and increases are set by the government.

"This video can not be played Nicola and Lisa Henton-Mitchell narrowly escaped the Genoa bridge collapse with their two children. In driving rain, brake lights suddenly illuminated an Italian motorway. Then the screaming started. ""Out, out now. Collapse."" A UK family have told the BBC of their terror, after being caught up in the collapse of a bridge in Genoa on Tuesday which killed at least 39 people. Nicola and Lisa Henton-Mitchell, from Bicester, Oxfordshire, were four days into a three-week holiday with their two children when they were forced to abandon their hire car and run for their lives. ""We had stopped at a service station to use the toilet,"" Lisa said. ""Thank God, or it could have been worse."" Rescuers search for survivors in Genoa Moment of bridge collapse Grief and anger over bridge collapse in Genoa Speaking from the hotel where they spent Tuesday night, she recalls the chaos as people fled to take shelter in a tunnel. ""I was driving. The rain was so severe you could only see a few cars in front of you,"" Lisa said. ""Something didn't feel right. We felt we were sliding to the right."" ""The car moved sideways and we shuddered,"" Nicola explains. ""We thought it was the wind but now we wonder if it was the road twisting."" Traffic suddenly came to a standstill. ""Everyone's red lights came on,"" Lisa said. ""Then it seemed like seconds later the reverse lights came on. ""The car in front reversed and crashed into us. Nobody could really move."" Drivers and passengers took shelter in a motorway tunnel after the deadly collapse of the bridge People closer to the site of the collapse ran towards them, shouting and screaming. The family ran back towards the tunnel through which they had recently driven. ""When we ran from the car my daughter didn't have her shoes on,"" Nicola told the BBC. The couple's daughter has a disability which affects her mobility, but it was not possible to carry her. ""My son grabbed a rucksack with a few bits in. Fortunately it had our passports and a phone in. Everyone just ran into the tunnel."" ""Car doors and lorry doors were being opened constantly,"" Lisa adds. ""When we got to the tunnel, everybody was crying, distraught."" Soaked and frightened, the family took shelter in the tunnel with other survivors. Few could speak English, so it was difficult to get information about what had happened. Fortunately, the family encountered a Belgian couple who could translate. ""They kindly gave the children some dry tops to put on,"" Lisa said. ""It went round that the bridge had collapsed."" Police officers pulled drivers to one side and started the process of recovering the vehicles they could reach. But Nicola and Lisa's car was too far away. ""We were just around the bend,"" Nicola said. ""They've cleared cars up to 250 metres from the tunnel but we were further in so our car is still there."" A bus transported the people sheltering in the tunnel to a civic centre in Genoa. The authorities provided people there with water, clothes and blankets, while a volunteer helped them to find a hotel. In the hotel, exhausted, the children were able to sleep. ""We've tried to shield them from how serious it was,"" Lisa said. The family asked their travel insurance company to fly them home but they have refused. They have little more than their money and passports, but are thankful to all the ""truly lovely, kind people"" who have helped them.

"For travellers on their summer holidays, where to stop for a toilet break can be a source of worry. Public toilet provision has been declining for a number of years and the BBC has learnt that some UK high streets and tourist hot spots now no longer have any council-run public toilets. At least 673 public toilets across the UK have stopped being maintained by major councils (unitary, borough, district and city) since 2010, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information law. In that time, the UK's population has been increasing. Has the number of public toilets maintained by your council gone up or down? Use our map below to find out. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Click to launch,externalthe interactive map if it is not displaying properly. Data supplied by 376 of the 430 councils contacted by the BBC showed that: UK councils stopped maintaining around 13% of public toilets between 2010 and 2018 But this masks big regional variations - Cornwall Council has stopped maintaining 94% of its toilets, on the Isle of Wight it was 92% and 80% in North Ayrshire In 2018 there were 4,486 toilets run by major councils in the UK, down from 5,159 in 2010 In 37 areas, major councils no longer run any public conveniences Highland Council maintains most public toilets (92), followed by Gwynedd (73) and Pembrokeshire (73) Local authorities are not legally required to provide toilets, meaning they are often closed as councils look to cut costs. A Local Government Association representative said that, while councils were doing everything they could to keep public toilets open, substantial reductions to their budgets have meant they have had to make ""tough choices"" about public facilities. The Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government says it encourages councils to keep toilets open to the public since they are a ""valuable community amenity"". These findings do not mean there are no toilets available at all, however - in many cases larger councils are shifting responsibility to smaller parish or town councils. Others have been handed to community groups and paid for through fundraising while some councils are relying on the goodwill of businesses to make their toilets available to the public. Andy McGuinness, campaign manager of charity Crohn's and Colitis UK, claims handing the running of facilities over to parish councils in England is only a short-term fix, because it simply passes on the financial pressure. ""It takes the upkeep off their books but it's not sustainable. Parish councils will run them for a couple of years and eventually they'll probably close anyway,"" he said. He added that, without action from government and local authorities, the increasing closures of public toilets in England posed a ""very real problem for the millions of people living with continence problems"". Local councils (such as town and parish councils) get their money from a share of council tax. Sue Baxter, who chairs the National Association of Local Councils, said smaller councils were increasingly taking over discretionary services such as toilets as budget pressures meant larger councils were finding them harder to provide. But, she said, they faced a dilemma - whether to allow toilets in their local area to close or take them on and face a hefty ""toilet tax"" in the form of business rates paid on the premises. There isno particular right to access a toilet in public,externaland local authorities do not have a duty to provide them Businesses that provide toilets for their customers have no legal duty to do so for non-customers Workplaces,externalmust provide suitable conveniences for their staff Anywhere that offers goods or services to the public mustmake sure disabled people have equal access,externalto their facilities, including toilets We asked the 50 councils with the biggest cuts how many had actually closed and how many had been handed over to smaller councils or other groups. Almost all of the 30 that responded had closed at least some, if not all, entirely. Only one council - East Northamptonshire - said its figures didn't translate to any toilets actually being closed. Several had also handed the running of some toilets to private companies or community groups. Raymond Martin, of the British Toilet Association, said providing toilets was a public health issue, but it was also about equality and social inclusion. He believes that, while councils have no legal requirement to provide access to public toilets, they do have a ""moral responsibility"". And charity Disability Rights UK says it has increasingly been receiving calls from disabled people reporting that accessible toilets are no longer available. With these significant reductions in facilities, you might reasonably assume some people will resort to using their wider environment when caught short. So the BBC also asked councils and police forces whether they enforced any laws against public urination, and what had happened to numbers of offences in the same time period. We found that around the country, very few local councils or police forces take action against public urination. Those that do, however, use a range of tools including by-laws, public order offences specifically tackling public urination, and broader offences including indecent exposure, outraging the public decency, littering and harassment. The London borough of Tower Hamlets, which had one of the biggest falls in the number of offences, said it has focused on ""better enforcement"" of the rules, which it said has acted as a deterrent. The council added that closures of pubs, clubs and bars had also contributed to the fall in offences. Data supplied by 388 of 430 major councils and 39 out of 42 police forces in the UK covering the years 2010-2017 revealed that: 233 councils and force areas don't have any by-laws prohibiting public urination Of the 180 forces and councils that had by-laws or public order offences against public urination, 112 said they hadn't enforced them at all during this time period For those that did enforce rules against public urination, the number of times they were enforced had fallen in almost all areas In total, police forces and councils responding to the request recorded 15,297 offences relating to public urination in 2018, more than halving from 32,668 in 2010 Where police forces did use public order offences, the numbers were small - fewer than 10 offences in any given year Cornwall's unitary council saw the number of public toilets it maintains drop over the past five years, from 253 in 2013 to only 14. Over the same time, overall expenditure on toilets was all but wiped out, falling from Â£4.3m to only Â£217,000. A council representative said: ""We recognise that public toilets are important to residents and visitors alike - but with huge cuts in funding by central government we have been forced, like other local authorities, to review the non-statutory services we provide. ""We have now successfully transferred the ownership or management of over 200 public toilets to local city, town and parish councils and local community organisations and businesses. ""Only 16 toilets have closed to date."" The council has also started charging for the remaining toilets it runs. Wiltshire Council now runs only one public toilet on its streets, and another five at park-and-ride sites, in comparison with 32 in 2010. The council saw its spending on toilets cut by more than Â£100,000 between the 2016 and 2017 financial years. It said 22 of the toilets were transferred to the control of town and parish councils, and the rest have closed. ""We carried out a public consultation exercise in 2015 and the overwhelming response was facilities should be offered to the town and parish councils to run if they felt it was appropriate."" One of the biggest spenders is the City of London Council. It spent Â£992,000 on running four public toilets in 2017. In 2010, it spent Â£1,029,000 on double the number of conveniences. When contacted by BBC News, the council did not comment on why expenditure had remained relatively flat. New Forest District Council followed, with an overall expenditure of Â£877,660 on 24 public toilets and refurbishment work in 2017. Bridgend County Borough Council in Wales now maintains only six public toilets, down from 16 in 2010. It said that three more toilets were likely to close in the next year, unless they are taken on by town councils, because of budget reductions. Meanwhile in North Ayrshire, there has been a fall from 45 in 2010 to nine in 2018. The council says five of these were transferred into community ownership and paid for through fundraising, while the rest closed outright. In Northern Ireland, eight local councils either increased or maintained the same number of public toilets between 2010 and 2018. Fermanagh and Omagh District Council had the highest number of council-run conveniences at 51 in 2018. Illustrations by Katie Horwich. Maps by Ed Lowther and Prina Shah.

"Alex Jones will not be able to post new messages or comment on others' posts for a week Twitter is blocking the right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from posting to its platform for a week. The InfoWars broadcaster's past tweets will, however, remain viewable to others while his account is locked in a ""read-only"" mode. The social network has not confirmed what prompted the action. But the New York Times reported Mr Jones had tweeted a link to a video inwhich he called on his followers,externalto ready their ""battle rifles"". The BBC understands that Twitter judged this to be a violation of its rules against abusive behaviour. The restriction was initially only effective against the @RealAlexJones account, which has 890,000 followers. Mr Jones subsequently posted a video in which he discusses the move to a separate @Infowars feed - with about 431,000 followers -  which he described as being a ""sub-account"". Twitter then locked that account in read-only mode too. Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey told NBC that Mr Jones had been put on a ""timeout"". NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt suggested to Mr Dorsey that the seven-day suspension was too lenient a punishment. Mr Dorsey said: ""Well, I feel, you know, any suspension, whether it be a permanent one or a temporary one, makes someone think about their actions and their behaviours."" The anchorman asked Mr Dorsey if he really believed Mr Jones would tone down the rhetoric after a one-week suspension. The Twitter boss said he did not know, but that was the company policy. Mr Jones has previously been widely criticised for repeating claims that the 9/11 attacks in New York were staged by the US government. He has also claimed that many of the children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre were actors. The parents of two children shot in that attack are suing him for defamation, saying he had made ""false, cruel, and dangerous assertions"". Twitter sent this message to Mr Jones complaining of abusive behaviour Apple's iTunes, Facebook and YouTube removed podcasts and other content by Mr Jones and InfoWars from their services last week.

"Christine Hallquist is the first transgender person to win a major party nomination for governor A former energy executive in Vermont has taken a major step towards becoming the first ever transgender governor of a US state. Christine Hallquist defeated three other candidates, including a 14-year-old boy, to win the Democratic Party nomination on Tuesday. She will now face the incumbent Republican Governor Phil Scott in the general election in November. Her nomination came on a night of firsts for primary elections. A former Somali refugee won her race in Minnesota, as did a celebrated teacher in Connecticut who could now become the state's first black Democrat in Congress. Democrats are hoping for a ""blue wave"" in the midterm elections to regain control of at least one chamber of Congress. Why US mid-term elections matter Truth-seeking scientists run for office Ms Hallquist's nomination comes in an election year already marked by record numbers of lesbian, gay and transgender candidates. There are also a record number of female candidates in elections for governor and for the House of Representatives. This year, 43 transgender candidates have run for political office at all levels in the US. But Ms Hallquist is the first transgender person to win a major party nomination for state governor. This video can not be played The ""Pink Wave"": How women are shaping the 2018 US elections ""I think Vermont is a beacon of hope for the rest of the country,"" she told Reuters news agency after the result was announced. ""This is what I call expanding our moral compass and that is what I think it represents."" She added: ""I love Vermont because we look beyond these surface issues. I just happen to be a leader who is transgender. Vermonters know that."" Ms Hallquist defeated Ethan Sonneborn, 14, a schoolboy who was allowed to stand because the state's constitution has no age requirement for the governor's job. She also beat a Navy veteran and the executive director of a dance festival to clinch victory. There were a number of other significant victories on Tuesday. Ilhan Omar, a refugee from Somalia who came to the US as a teenager, won her Democratic primary in the state's fifth district. Ilhan Omar beat six candidates to win her Minnesota primary The victory puts the 36-year-old in a strong position to become one of the first female Muslim members of Congress in November. ""Tonight, we are celebrating because we engaged and empowered our community and we won,"" she tweeted following her victory. Jahana Hayes, who was named national teacher of the year in 2016, won the Democratic nomination in a western district of Connecticut. She will now contest the seat vacated by Elizabeth Esty, who resigned after a sexual harassment and misconduct scandal came to light in her office. Ms Hayes's victory marks a significant step towards her becoming the state's first black Democrat in Congress. Ex-presidential candidate Bernie Sanders cruised to victory in Vermont's Democratic Senate primary, paving the way for him to serve a third term. The 76-year-old hasn't ruled out a second run for the presidency in 2020. Bernie Sanders is the longest-serving independent in US congressional history But he is expected to decline the Democratic nomination and run as an independent candidate with the party's backing, as he has done previously. If elected in November, Mr Sanders would extend his run as the longest-serving independent in US congressional history. In Minnesota, a key battleground state, Republicans opted for the party's county commissioner Jeff Johnson in the governor primary. He defeated former governor Tim Pawlenty, who was hoping to regain his old job. But Mr Pawlenty alienated the US president's supporters after once calling Mr Trump ""unhinged and unfit"". A Trump loyalist, Kris Kobach, was declared the winner of a Republican primary for Kansas state governor, a week after voters went to the polls. Kris Kobach ousted the current Republican Governor, Jeff Colyer, by just 345 votes. Mr Kobach, who is Kansas' secretary of state, has advised President Trump on illegal immigration policy, and served on his now-defunct voter fraud commission. Congressman Keith Ellison is a national figure in the Democratic party Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison won the Democratic primary for attorney general, after denying abuse claims that surfaced days before the vote. His ex-girlfriend alleged at the weekend that she had been assaulted and emotionally abused by the first-Muslim US congressman and deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He addressed the allegation in his victory speech. ""We had a very unexpected event at the end of this campaign that happened,"" he said. ""I want to assure you that it is not true.""

"Andrew Mabbitt says it has been six weeks since the damage occurred Virgin Media has been accused of leaving holes in people's walls and not following up complaints to fix the damage. One customer said he has so far waited six weeks to havea 10in (25.4cm) crater-like hole,externalrepaired. Complaints left on social media often say that requests for calls or web chats with Virgin have gone unfulfilled. Virgin Media has apologised and said it will contact affected customers. Broadband engineers frequently have to drill or alter holes when installing cables in people's homes - but sometimes this can go wrong. ""The chap who did the installation was incredibly apologetic and it was a genuine accident,"" explained Andrew Mabbitt, director of cyber-security firm Fidus Information Security. He said that the engineer then called his manager to arrange a repair, but this never materialised. ""Got a call the next day from Virgin saying they'd be in touch soon to arrange a date and they never called back,"" Mr Mabbitt told the BBC. He added that he also tried to contact the firm via its online chat service - but it was not working. This drill bit was left in a wall by a Virgin Media engineer, according to customer Dom Valentine Another customer, Dom Valentine, complained that the company left a large drill bit stuck in his wall for more than a week. Mr Valentine is a soldier in the British Army and said the damage occurred at military accommodation. ""I was there when it happened,"" he told the BBC. Eight-hundred jobs to go as Virgin to close Swansea call centre 'More than half' of UK households face broadband problems Virgin Media expands fibre network to rural areas He said the engineer drilled into a metal part inside the wall, which caused the drill bit to get stuck. An attempt to remove it from the outside of the building did not go well. ""He was hitting it with a hammer which has now cracked the bricks on the other side,"" said Mr Valentine. He added that he is still waiting to have it dealt with and in the meantime he has been told to expect a sizeable bill from the army, which owns the property. Virgin Media offered him Â£20 credit but he said the firm has not followed up on providing a repair. ""I was told the area manager would get back to me, which he hasn't,"" added Mr Valentine. A spokeswoman for Ofcom told the BBC that since 1 June the regulator had received 10 complaints about damage to property left by Virgin Media workers and three relating to work done by Openreach. Virgin Media has responded to these queries via social media, but some customers say damage to their homes is still awaiting repair. ""Virgin Media apologises to any customer who has experienced issues when our services have been installed in their property, as we do our best to make sure the process is as smooth as possible,"" the firm said in a statement. ""We are now in the process of contacting the customers listed in this article so we can see if the issue still exists and, if so, try and resolve it as soon as possible."" Complaints have been left on social media reporting similar problems caused by other broadband firms, but Virgin Media teams often have to drill more holes in walls than BT or Sky, according to Andrew Ferguson at news site Thinkbroadband. This is in order to install its hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC)cables directly to people's homes. ""That's changing, there are more homes getting what's calledfull fibre[from various firms] - problems like this are probably going to increase, they're not going to go away,"" he told the BBC.

"The BBC will not challenge a ruling over its coverage of a police raid at Sir Cliff Richard's home in 2014 at the Court of Appeal. A High Court judge ruled the BBC had infringed the singer's privacy,awarding him Â£210,000 in damages in July, and refused leave to appeal. The corporation will now seek advice from the attorney general over the ruling's impact on future reporting. ""There is a fundamental principle of press freedom at stake,"" the BBC said. A spokesperson for Sir Cliff said he welcomed the BBC's decision, adding that he ""hopes that outstanding issues can be resolved quickly"". David Jordan, the BBC's director of editorial policy and standards, said the full cost of the case to the BBC was not yet known, but Â£1.9m had so far been spent. Sir Cliff was never arrested or charged during the police investigation. It followed an allegation made by a man who claimed he was sexually assaulted as a child by Sir Cliff at an event at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane stadium in 1985. The BBC has apologised to Sir Cliff for the distress caused by its coverage, but originally wanted permission to appeal, arguing the court judgement could threaten press freedom. After considering the rejection of its High Court appeal application, the broadcaster has decided not to go directly to the Court of Appeal. The BBC said appealing would be ""an expensive legal cul-de-sac and one that would simply prolong Sir Cliff's distress"". However, it iswriting to ask the attorney general,externalto ""consider a review of the law in this important area to protect the right to properly and fairly report criminal investigations, and to name the person under investigation"". Reaction to the Sir Cliff case BBC bosses 'should carry the can' 'Tough questions' over BBC appeal decision In the letter, the BBC's director-general Tony Hall writes: ""The BBC has decided not to seek permission from the Court of Appeal to appeal against that judgment - even though we are advised and believe that the judge erred in law in finding that broadcasters and journalists, when reporting on matters in the public interest, normally have no right to publish the name of a person who is the subject of a criminal investigation."" Lord Hall added that it was his understanding the Court of Appeal would say that it was for Parliament, not the judiciary, to set out ""in detail the balance between competing public interests"". But the attorney general's office has since told BBC News that a legal review would not fall under its remit and that Mr Hall should re-direct his letter. A government spokesperson said it was aware of the BBC's concerns and would respond to the letter ""in due course"". This video can not be played Oliver Duff, editor of the i newspaper, says the ruling is a dangerous change to the law Last month, Mr Justice Mann ruled in favour of Sir Cliff, 77, following the trial in London. The judge's findings included that Sir Cliff had a right to privacy while he was a suspect in the South Yorkshire Police investigation - trumping the broadcaster's right to freedom of expression to publish his name and cover the raid. He concluded that the BBC's coverage - which involved a helicopter filming the search at Sir Cliff's Berkshire home - had been a ""very serious"" invasion of privacy. Oliver Duff, editor of the i newspaper, said this ruling tipped the balance toward secrecy. ""Yes, it will help innocent people like Sir Cliff, but it will also hurt countless victims of crime and it will make it much harder to get convictions in some cases,"" he told the BBC. ""There can be a domino effect when news of an investigation breaks and other witnesses come forward."" Analysis by BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman Many will ask why the BBC has decided not to seek permission to appeal against a judgment its director of news and current affairs felt represented a dramatic shift against press freedom and reduced scrutiny of the police. And why, if it was the right thing to do to run the original story, to vigorously contest Sir Cliff's legal action in court and to remain bullish about the possible justification for an appeal following the judgment, is it now the right thing not to try to appeal through the courts? The BBC's answer is that it has been told that it would not win an appeal. While many in the media felt strongly that the judgment restricted press freedom and the BBC received support among newspapers that are often critical of it, a significant section of the public did not agree with the BBC position. They supported Sir Cliff and did not like the way he had been treated by the BBC. The BBC's statement does not mention public opinion. However, in the battle between a national treasure and the national broadcaster, it is difficult not to conclude that the opinion of the public, who pay the licence fee that funds the BBC, may well have been a significant factor. Read more from Clive Coleman In an email sent to BBC staff on Wednesday, Lord Hall said: ""With hindsight, there are some things we could have done differently: the use of the helicopter; the tone of some emails, which were inappropriate; and, in retrospect the awards submission was insensitive."" ""We tried hard to explore a settlement before this came to court, but it would only have been possible to do so if we had conceded that it was unlawful to identify Sir Cliff in our reports. We couldn't do that,"" he added. Both the News Media Association and the Society of Editors have said they too will make representations to government. ""Parliament should now urgently consider whether such a step towards individual privacy against the protection of society's overall liberties is acceptable,"" said executive director of the society, Ian Murray. ""The society recognises that the sympathies of the public may well be strongly with Sir Cliff on this issue and in this particular case, but there are bigger issues at stake that, if unchallenged, will affect the liberties of all citizens."" Mr Justice Mann awarded Sir Cliff Â£190,000 damages and an extra Â£20,000 in aggravated damages after the BBC submitted its coverage of the raid for an award. The BBC was told to pay 65% of the Â£190,000 and South Yorkshire Police 35%. The BBC also agreed to pay Sir Cliff Â£850,000 towards his legal costs. South Yorkshire Police had earlier agreed to pay Sir Cliff Â£400,000 after settling a claim he brought against the force.

"Salih Khater has been named as the man being held by police The man arrested on suspicion of terror offences after a car crashed outside the Houses of Parliament has been named as Salih Khater by government sources. The 29-year-old British citizen, originally from Sudan, has also been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, Met Police said. He came to the UK as a refugee and was granted asylum, the BBC understands. His brother described him as a ""normal person"" with no fanatical ideas and no links to any religious group. Abdullah Khater also said his family - who are originally from Darfur in Sudan - were in ""a state of shock"". This video can not be played The car can be seen crashing into a barrier Police have been granted a warrant of further detention by Westminster Magistrates' Court enabling them to question Mr Khater until 20 August. Three people were injured when a silver Ford Fiesta hit cyclists and pedestrians during Tuesday morning's rush hour. The car then crashed into security barriers outside the Houses of Parliament just before 07:40 BST. A man and a woman were taken to hospital after the crash and later discharged, while another man was treated for minor injuries at the scene. Westminster crash: Who is Salih Khater? Raids after suspected terror attack What we know so far Westminster crash in pictures The suspect is not believed to have been known to MI5 or counter-terrorism police, but is understood to have been known to local police. He did not co-operate with officers after his arrest, Scotland Yard said. The investigation team's priority ""continues to be to understand the motivation behind this incident"", a spokesman added. Police have concluded searches of two properties in Birmingham and one in Nottingham, and are currently searching a third address in Birmingham. BBC News home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said the reasons for the crash remained ""very open"". He said while detectives were holding Mr Khater on suspicion of terror offences, they had not formally declared the crash a terrorist incident, suggesting they are yet to find anything to link him to extremism. Mr Khater came to Britain in 2010 and successfully applied for UK citizenship in the past two years. His brother said he had been planning a trip back home to see his family, having not seen them for some time. Mr Khater is believed to have lived in a first-floor flat above a parade of shops in the Sparkbrook area of Birmingham until four months ago, when he moved to the city's Highgate area. This video can not be played Ahmed Abdi used to visit the same shisha cafe as Salih Khater Neighbours called him a quiet man who frequently visited an internet cafe and a nearby shisha lounge, both on Stratford Road. Local resident Ahmed Abdi described him as a man who ""never spoke to anybody"", and added: ""I recognised his picture from the news and I was shocked."" Having completed his secondary education in Sudan, he studied electrical engineering at university there before moving to the UK. He studied English as a second or foreign language at City College from 2010 to 2011, later studying a diploma in science at South and City College in Birmingham from 2014 to 2017. More recently, Mr Khater studied accountancy at Coventry University from September 2017 to May this year, a spokesman for the university said. He is no longer enrolled there. People in Birmingham who know Mr Khater say they thought he travelled to London in order to renew his Sudanese visa at the Sudanese embassy. A source at the embassy told the BBC they could find no information about an appointment on Tuesday, but confirmed people were able to turn up without one. Birmingham Central Mosque said its inquiries with the community found he did not worship at the mosque and had showed no signs of radicalisation. In a CV seen by the BBC, Mr Khater described himself as a ""hardworking, honest and polite individual"" and ""mature and responsible, with the ability to stay calm in high pressured situations"". It says he worked in Libya for two years as a farm labourer before coming to the UK. The BBC understands Mr Khater did spend time in Libya before travelling to Britain, but has not confirmed the exact timeframe. The CV also suggests he spent time as a security guard in Nottingham. It is understood Mr Khater did obtain a licence from the Security Industry Authority (SIA), although the organisation said it could not comment due to the ""ongoing police investigation"". A number of witnesses said the car, which was travelling westbound in Parliament Square, appeared to deliberately hit members of the public as it swerved into the opposite lane. Footage released by the BBC showed the moment of the crash. A police officer can be seen jumping over a barrier to get out of the way. Cyclists were seen on the ground after the crash A passenger in the first car behind the cyclists said they had been ""thrown everywhere"" after being hit at what she estimated to be 25mph. The car was driven to London from Birmingham the night before, arriving just after midnight on Tuesday. It then spent nearly five hours in the Tottenham Court Road area before being driven around Westminster for more than 90 minutes before the crash. Police have been able to trace the route taken thanks to automatic number plate recognition cameras. They have released new images of the Fiesta and appealed to anyone who may have seen the car or its driver in the hours leading up to the crash to come forward. Police have asked anyone who saw the car before the crash to come forward The car was removed from the scene by police on Tuesday night Mr Khater was detained at the scene under the Terrorism Act and taken to a south London police station. No-one else was in the car when it crashed and no weapons were found in it. Police are treating it as a terror-related incident ""given that this appears to be a deliberate act, the method, and this being an iconic site"", Scotland Yard's head of counter-terrorism Neil Basu said. No other arrests have been made, Scotland Yard said. Britain's most senior police officer, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, said Westminster could be pedestrianised to stop vehicle attacks, calling them terrorists' ""weapon of choice"". This video can not be played Ex-counter terrorism chief Sir Mark Rowley told Today preventing attacks is a ""shared responsibility"" She said it was ""a matter that will be discussed no doubt between parliamentary authorities, us, the intelligence agencies and indeed the local authorities and the mayor"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was also in favour of more security measures being introduced in Parliament Square and around London. ""I'm an advocate of part-pedestrianising part of Parliament Square,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""Not only would it make Parliament Square more attractive, but there are clever technical ways to make Parliament and pedestrians and visitors safer as well. ""There are now very attractive small bollards in place which actually stop vehicles hitting pedestrians or buildings."" British Transport Police said it was increasing patrols in England, Scotland and Wales and that its officers would be ""highly visible on trains and at stations"". Specialist officers skilled in recognising if ""someone may be in an area for terrorist or other criminal purposes"" have been deployed in Westminster, with uniformed and plain-clothed officers patrolling. The prime minister's spokesman said, as of the end of June 2018, there were 676 live investigations into potential terrorist plots. Since March 2017, 13 Islamist plots and four far-right plots had been foiled, he added. Police raids after Westminster attack How the incident unfolded.

"Senator Fraser Anning says he will not apologise for his speech An Australian senator has been widely condemned for a speech that invoked the term ""final solution"" in a call for immigration restrictions based on race. Fraser Anning, from the conservative Katter's Australian Party, called for migration bans on Muslims and others in his maiden Senate speech on Tuesday. Political opponents denounced his speech as ""disgraceful"". Mr Anning said he did not need to apologise. ""Final solution"" was a term infamously used by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In his speech, Mr Anning said ""the final solution to the immigration problem is a popular vote"". On Wednesday, lawmakers across the political divide moved to pass parliamentary motions censuring Mr Anning for his ""racist hate speech"", noting in particular his use of the phrase ""final solution"", and his ""false, misleading and hurtful statements"" about Muslim Australians and other immigrant groups. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Mr Anning had made ""a shocking insult to the memory"" of those murdered in the Holocaust. Allow Twitter content?

The Holocaust was the Nazis' assault on Jewish people between 1933 and 1945. It culminated in what the Nazis called the ""Final Solution of the Jewish Question in Europe"", in which six million Jews were murdered. Mr Anning has denied that his words were a reference to the Holocaust, describing himself as an advocate for Jewish Australians. On Wednesday, he said: ""I don't regret anything. I am not going to apologise or regret anything that I say."" The senator, a former member of Pauline Hanson's anti-Islam One Nation Party, called for a return to the White Australia Policy - which restricted non-European immigrants from 1901 until the 1960s. First Muslim woman joins Australia senate Labor's Senate leader Penny Wong, who was born in Malaysia, said the White Australia Policy had been ""rightly consigned to the dustbin of history"". Meanwhile, Australia's first Muslim female senator, Mehreen Faruqi, who filled a vacant seat on Wednesday, said Mr Anning had ""spat in the face of millions of Australians, spewing hate and racism"". ""I'm a Muslim migrant, I'm about to be a Senator and there's not a damn thing Fraser Anning can do about it,""she wrote in a piece for website Junkee.,external TheSydney Morning Herald newspaper,externalreported that Mr Anning had given ""the most inflammatory maiden speech to an Australian parliament"" since Ms Hanson said in 1998 that Australia was ""in danger of being swamped by Asians"".

Anger over Mr Anning's speech extended beyond the parliament. Among those to speak out was Australia's first Muslim Test cricketer, Usman Khawaja. Allow Twitter content?

Nearly half of all Australians were born overseas or had one parent who was born overseas, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Mr Anning was elected last year after the disqualification of another senator, despite receiving only 19 votes in Australia's 2016 national poll. He quit the One Nation Party last year to join Katter's Australian Party, whose sole other parliamentary representative is leader Bob Katter. Mr Katter said he supported Mr Anning's speech ""1000%"" but suggested that his colleague did not know much about the Holocaust. ""He's smart, but he hasn't read all the history books,"" Mr Katter told reporters. First Muslim woman joins Australia senate Should new Australians face English tests?

"Scientists say they have discovered why some vegetables - including cabbage, broccoli and kale - can reduce the risk of bowel cancers. That cruciferous veg is good for the gut has never been in doubt but a detailed explanation has been elusive. The team at the Francis Crick Institute found anti-cancer chemicals were produced as the vegetables were digested. Cancer Research UK said there were plenty of reasons to eat more veg. The work focused on how vegetables alter the lining of the intestines, by studying mice and miniature bowels growing in the lab. Like the skin, the surface of the bowels is constantly being regenerated in a process that takes four to five days. But this constant renewal needs to be tightly controlled, otherwise it could lead to cancer or gut inflammation. And the work, published in the journal Immunity, showed chemicals in cruciferous vegetables were vital. Fruit and veg: For a longer life eat 10-a-day Fibre and whole grains 'reduce bowel cancer risk Bowel cancer screening to start earlier at age 50 in England The researchers investigated a chemical called indole-3-carbinol, which is produced by chewing such vegetables. ""Make sure they're not overcooked, no soggy broccoli,"" said researcher Dr Gitta Stockinger. The chemical is modified by stomach acid as it continues its journey through the digestive system. In the lower bowel, it can change the behaviour of stem cells, which regenerate the bowel lining, and of immune cells that control inflammation. The study showed diets high in indole-3-carbinol protected the mice from cancer, even those whose genes put them at very high risk of the disease. Without the protective diet, the gut cells divided uncontrollably. Dr Stockinger added: ""Even when the mice started developing tumours and we switched them to the appropriate diet, it halted tumour progression."" Signs of bowel cancer include persistent: blood in the stools changes in bowel habits, such as going to the toilet more often tummy pain, bloating or discomfort Dr Stockinger said the findings were a ""cause for optimism"". She has reduced the amount of meat she eats and now consumes a lot more vegetables. She told the BBC: ""A lot of dietary advice we're getting changes periodically  - it is very confusing and not clear cut what the causes and consequences are. ""Just telling me it's good for me without a reason will not make me eat it. ""With this study, we have the molecular mechanisms about how this system works."" Prof Tim Key, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""This study in mice suggests that it's not just the fibre contained in vegetables like broccoli and cabbage that help reduce the risk of bowel cancer, but also molecules found in these vegetables too. ""Further studies will help find out whether the molecules in these vegetables have the same effect in people, but in the meantime there are already plenty of good reasons to eat more vegetables.""

"This video can not be played Rail cost rises should be reduced, says transport secretary Rail passengers will see the price of regulated rail fares in much of the UK rise by as much as 3.2% in January. The rise, determined by the RPI inflation measure,could add more than Â£100 to annual season ticket prices. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has called forfuture rail fare and wage increases to be based onthe lower Consumer Prices Index - rather than the higher Retail Prices Index. The RMT union accused him of trying to impose a ""pay cap"" on its members. Commuters 'spend fifth of salary' on ticket Passengers rail at fresh train disruption Rail timetable changes for winter scaled back The cost of most train fares are set by train companies themselves but 40% of fares in England, Scotland and Wales are regulated so that they are only allowed to rise by an amount pegged to the RPI rate of inflation in July the previous year - currently 3.2%. These regulated fares include annual season tickets. The government's preferred measure of inflation, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), rose to 2.5% in July from 2.4% in June. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the increase in regulated fares as ""an insult to everyone who has suffered from the chaos on Britain's railways"". A Brighton to London ticket would have beenÂ£39 cheaper(Â£4,293 instead of Â£4,332) Gloucester to Birmingham:Â£37 cheaper(Â£4,071 instead of Â£4,108) Woking to London:Â£30 cheaper(Â£3,218 instead of Â£3,248) Liverpool to Manchester:Â£29 cheaper(Â£3,123 instead of Â£3,152) Maidenhead to London:Â£26 cheaper(Â£3,066 instead of Â£3,092) Mr Grayling said he wanted to see ""lower levels of increases for passengers in future"". If the lower CPI measure was used to calculate future ticket price increases then, he said, rail firms should also use it to set annual pay rises for staff. Mr Grayling told the BBC the lower inflation measure was ""used by pretty much the whole of the rest of the public sector and much of the rest of our economy"". He said he was ""very disappointed"" by the unions' immediate reaction. He acknowledged that - due to existing pay deals for rail workers - any changes would ""not happen overnight"". By BBC transport correspondent, Tom Burridge Trust in the railways, and the government's handle on them, has sunk pretty low after a woeful spring and summer for passengers on Northern and Govia Thameslink. We travelled in a rickety, crowded carriage from a village outside Wigan into Manchester early this morning and commuters were fuming. The government points out that the worst affected passengers are being offered compensation, which outstrips the rise in ticket fares which will take affect in January. However today's RPI figure, and what it means for ticket prices, will be viewed within the context of recent failings. It adds ammo to calls from Labour that fares should be frozen on parts of the network which are not performing. Chris Grayling's challenge to the rail unions to back a lower benchmark of inflation for both maximum ticket rises on regulated fares and annual wage increases for workers, is an attempt to steal some initiative. And this row feeds into the broader ideological divide between the Conservatives and Labour vis-a-vis the railways, which could hardly be starker. Everyone wants cheap rail fares, but there is little agreement on how it should be funded. In response to the transport secretary's suggestion, RMT head Mick Cash said: ""If Chris Grayling seriously thinks that front-line rail workers are going to pay the price for his gross incompetence and the greed of the private train companies he's got another thing coming."" He accused Mr Grayling of continuing an ""all-out war on staff and passengers alike"" and said the RMT would fight any attempt to impose a pay cap. The RMT is organising protests on Wednesday outside stations in London, Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds and Edinburgh against fare rises. Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union Aslef, argued that cutting staff pay would not reduce passenger fares, but only increase the profits made by railway bosses. Both RPI and CPI measure the rate at which the price of common items - such as bread, beer and cinema tickets - rise. But the two measurements use different formulas to calculate the rate of inflation. RPI, unlike CPI, also includes housing costs such as mortgage interest payments and council tax. It has been higher than CPI for years. CPI takes into account that when prices rise, some people will switch to products that have gone up by less. The Office for National Statistics describes RPI as ""a very poor measure of general inflation"". David O'Donnell, 37, from Glasgow, takes the train every day to Paisley. He supports Chris Grayling's proposal. ""I think railway workers should get a pay rise but it should be more in line with the rest of the UK,"" he says. ""But in general I don't think there should be any rail fare increases. It is a disgrace that rail fares continue to increase at a higher rate than the average worker's wage."" By BBC Reality Check How well paid are train drivers at the moment? If you look at ONS figures for average pay,externalfor train and tram drivers in the UK, the median worker (that's the one for whom half earn more and half earn less) was making Â£1,031.20 a week, which is Â£53,622 a year. It's been going up on average by about 4% a year for the last five years. That weekly average is more than double the Â£448.60 a week for all employees in all industries in the UK and indeed the Â£462.00 a week earned on average by bus and coach drivers. While other rail firm employees are on lower pay than drivers, they still earn considerably above average. For example, the median wage for a rail transport operative is Â£721.70 a week, while rail travel assistants are paid Â£647.60, and rail and rolling stock builders and repairers take home Â£902.10. Research has found the cost of rail travel has increased more than twice as fast as wages since 2008. The TUC said fares had risen by 42% over the past 10 years, while nominal weekly earnings have only grown by 18%. But the Rail Delivery Group - which represents railway companies - said passengers' fares were used wisely. ""For every pound paid in fares, 98p goes back in to running and improving the railway,"" said Paul Plummer, chief executive of the RDG.

"The building has been declared dangerous and demolition work is due to start later A fire has broken out at a converted mill near a Manchester prison. Greater Manchester Fire Service said 10 engines and two hydraulic platforms were called to Southall Street at about 04:45 BST. The fire is on the top floor of the four-storey building - understood to be a furniture warehouse - and part of the building has collapsed. Roads near the scene and HMP Manchester, formerly known as Strangeways, are closed. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said all prison visits had been cancelled for the day. Prisoners are also not being allowed to exercise outside because of the risk of fumes. The fire service and council have declared it a dangerous building and demolition work is due to start later. Drivers are advised to avoid the area. Inzy Rashid, BBC Radio Manchester Part of top half of the converted mill has been completely destroyed as the roof has collapsed. I can see flames through the windows rising through the top of the building, which is now office and business space. There is debris on Southall Street, with bricks scattered across the road. This is right opposite HMP Manchester, which is known locally as Strangeways prison. Its tower is a local landmark and you can't see it because of the billowing plume of smoke which is blowing across the road. This is close to one of the main roads into the city and traffic chaos is expected in the rush hour. Incident commander Tony Bryan, of GMFS, said firefighters had stopped the blaze from spreading to other properties. He said: ""The damage is considerable with heavy brick debris. ""We've had some close scrapes but thankfully we predicted where the building was likely to fall - thankfully we are all going home in one piece."" A staff member at a nearby Travelodge said she was concerned at one stage about the fire spreading. ""It just got bigger and bigger,"" she said.

He said he was ""very disappointed"" by the unions' immediate reaction. He acknowledged that - due to existing pay deals for rail workers - any changes would ""not happen overnight"". By BBC transport correspondent, Tom Burridge Trust in the railways, and the government's handle on them, has sunk pretty low after a woeful spring and summer for passengers on Northern and Govia Thameslink. We travelled in a rickety, crowded carriage from a village outside Wigan into Manchester early this morning and commuters were fuming. The government points out that the worst affected passengers are being offered compensation, which outstrips the rise in ticket fares which will take affect in January. However today's RPI figure, and what it means for ticket prices, will be viewed within the context of recent failings. It adds ammo to calls from Labour that fares should be frozen on parts of the network which are not performing. Chris Grayling's challenge to the rail unions to back a lower benchmark of inflation for both maximum ticket rises on regulated fares and annual wage increases for workers, is an attempt to steal some initiative. And this row feeds into the broader ideological divide between the Conservatives and Labour vis-a-vis the railways, which could hardly be starker. Everyone wants cheap rail fares, but there is little agreement on how it should be funded. In response to the transport secretary's suggestion, RMT head Mick Cash said: ""If Chris Grayling seriously thinks that front-line rail workers are going to pay the price for his gross incompetence and the greed of the private train companies he's got another thing coming."" He accused Mr Grayling of continuing an ""all-out war on staff and passengers alike"" and said the RMT would fight any attempt to impose a pay cap. The RMT is organising protests on Wednesday outside stations in London, Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds and Edinburgh against fare rises. Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union Aslef, argued that cutting staff pay would not reduce passenger fares, but only increase the profits made by railway bosses. Both RPI and CPI measure the rate at which the price of common items - such as bread, beer and cinema tickets - rise. But the two measurements use different formulas to calculate the rate of inflation. RPI, unlike CPI, also includes housing costs such as mortgage interest payments and council tax. It has been higher than CPI for years. CPI takes into account that when prices rise, some people will switch to products that have gone up by less. The Office for National Statistics describes RPI as ""a very poor measure of general inflation"". David O'Donnell, 37, from Glasgow, takes the train every day to Paisley. He supports Chris Grayling's proposal. ""I think railway workers should get a pay rise but it should be more in line with the rest of the UK,"" he says. ""But in general I don't think there should be any rail fare increases. It is a disgrace that rail fares continue to increase at a higher rate than the average worker's wage."" By BBC Reality Check How well paid are train drivers at the moment? If you look at ONS figures for average pay,externalfor train and tram drivers in the UK, the median worker (that's the one for whom half earn more and half earn less) was making Â£1,031.20 a week, which is Â£53,622 a year. It's been going up on average by about 4% a year for the last five years. That weekly average is more than double the Â£448.60 a week for all employees in all industries in the UK and indeed the Â£462.00 a week earned on average by bus and coach drivers. While other rail firm employees are on lower pay than drivers, they still earn considerably above average. For example, the median wage for a rail transport operative is Â£721.70 a week, while rail travel assistants are paid Â£647.60, and rail and rolling stock builders and repairers take home Â£902.10. Research has found the cost of rail travel has increased more than twice as fast as wages since 2008. The TUC said fares had risen by 42% over the past 10 years, while nominal weekly earnings have only grown by 18%. But the Rail Delivery Group - which represents railway companies - said passengers' fares were used wisely. ""For every pound paid in fares, 98p goes back in to running and improving the railway,"" said Paul Plummer, chief executive of the RDG.

"The building has been declared dangerous and demolition work is due to start later A fire has broken out at a converted mill near a Manchester prison. Greater Manchester Fire Service said 10 engines and two hydraulic platforms were called to Southall Street at about 04:45 BST. The fire is on the top floor of the four-storey building - understood to be a furniture warehouse - and part of the building has collapsed. Roads near the scene and HMP Manchester, formerly known as Strangeways, are closed. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said all prison visits had been cancelled for the day. Prisoners are also not being allowed to exercise outside because of the risk of fumes. The fire service and council have declared it a dangerous building and demolition work is due to start later. Drivers are advised to avoid the area. Inzy Rashid, BBC Radio Manchester Part of top half of the converted mill has been completely destroyed as the roof has collapsed. I can see flames through the windows rising through the top of the building, which is now office and business space. There is debris on Southall Street, with bricks scattered across the road. This is right opposite HMP Manchester, which is known locally as Strangeways prison. Its tower is a local landmark and you can't see it because of the billowing plume of smoke which is blowing across the road. This is close to one of the main roads into the city and traffic chaos is expected in the rush hour. Incident commander Tony Bryan, of GMFS, said firefighters had stopped the blaze from spreading to other properties. He said: ""The damage is considerable with heavy brick debris. ""We've had some close scrapes but thankfully we predicted where the building was likely to fall - thankfully we are all going home in one piece.""

"No mail in years? Maybe check with your local postman A postal worker in India has been suspended after he was found not to have delivered thousands of letters for more than 10 years. Ever wondered why you never heard back from that job offer, that ATM card application or why that person you really wanted to hear from never wrote? Well, if you're in the Odhanga village in India's Orissa state, there's a good chance that letter was in fact sent. It was just never delivered, piling up with countless other undelivered mail. The stash of old letters and packages was discovered by chance when a group of school children played in the recently abandoned post office after the branch had moved to a new location. Playing in the yard, they noticed large bags with letters sticking out, local media report. When they looked inside and discovered ATM cards and bank passbooks, they alerted their parents and soon the authorities were on the case. According to the Hindustan Times newspaper, it's thought there are some 6,000 letters and packages with the oldest dating back as far as 2004. Some 1,500 letters have been salvaged while many of the remaining items are soggy or damaged by termites. India Post is one of the most widely distributed postal systems in the world Son's war letter 98-year delivery Love letter from 1950s returned to couple The strangest things sent in the post The reluctant mailman is named as Jagannath Puhan, assistant branch post master, who for most of the past decade was alone in charge at the village office. And while he appeared to be lazy in delivering the mail, he was smart in how he went about it. Any registered mail or speed post was duly delivered as he knew the sender would likely track the delivery, officials said. Ordinary mail, however, had a good chance of ending up in the storeroom rather than with the intended recipient. It is not clear yet why the mailman so blatantly neglected his duties. According to the Hindustan Times he defended himself by saying that for several years he ""couldn't walk properly and was not in a condition to deliver these letters"". Authorities investigating the case are quoted as saying they are puzzled as to why over all those years no resident had raised complaints. Whatever mail will be able to be salvaged will now be delivered - albeit with that slight delay of several years. ""I personally noticed a letter from the Indian Navy dated 2011 for a local boy who had applied to them,"" one of the investigating post employees is quoted in the Indian Express. But many a letter might never reach its proper addressee - countless letters have been so damaged over the years that the names on them are indecipherable.

"President Erdogan has accused the US of seeking to ""stab [Turkey] in the back"" Turkey's move to increase tariffs on US imports has helped boost its weakened currency. A decree signed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan raised the tariffs on cars to 120%, on alcoholic drinks to 140% and on leaf tobacco to 60%. The US doubled tariffs last week over Turkey's refusal to free a US pastor who is imprisoned there. The lira rose 3%, also helped by measures aimed at deterring foreign investors speculating on the lira. Despite the rise, Turkey's currency has lost almost a third of its value against the dollar since January, pushing up the price of everyday items and raising fears that its weakness could infect other emerging market currencies. Explaining the new tariffs, Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said the rises were ordered ""within the framework of reciprocity in retaliation for the conscious attacks on our economy by the US administration"". Tariffs were also increased on cosmetics, rice and coal. Turkey had previously said it would boycott US electronic products. Turkish Trade Minister Ruhsar Pekcan told the state run Anadolu news agency that the doubling of tariffs on some imported US products would amount to $533m. The lira had plunged to record lows on Monday, but has since clawed back some of its losses, not only after the retaliation on tariffs, but also after the Turkish Central Bank announced banks would be given help to keep money moving around the system. Measures to restrict the amount of currency that can be exchanged with foreign banks were also said to be boosting the currency. President Erdogan said earlier this week that Turkey should not ""give in to the enemy"" by investing in foreign currencies. He has presided over soaring inflation and borrowing levels, but insists the lira's plight is the result of a ""campaign"" led by foreign powers. Is Turkey heading for an economic crisis? Turkey's lira slump explained Mr Erdogan has accused the US of trying to ""bring Turkey to its knees through threats over a pastor"". But the US insists Andrew Brunson, a long-time Turkish resident who ran the tiny Izmir Resurrection Church, is ""a victim of unfair and unjust detention"". US President Donald Trump has called pastor Andrew Brunson ""an innocent man of faith"" An evangelical from North Carolina, he has been held in Turkey for nearly two years over alleged links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a failed coup in 2016. On Wednesday, a Turkish court rejected his latest appeal to be released from house arrest. A higher court is still to rule, his lawyer told Reuters. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the US had seen ""no evidence that Pastor Brunson has done anything wrong"". Mr Brunson has denied charges of espionage, but faces up to 35 years in jail if found guilty. Turkey to boycott US electronic goods Turkey accuses US of 'stab in the back' Time to book a holiday?

"This video can not be played Parts of the bridge can be seen collapsing Rescuers in the north-western Italian city of Genoa continue to search for possible survivors after the dramatic collapse of a motorway bridge. The interior minister said at least 37 people were killed when dozens of vehicles fell 45m (148ft). About 16 people were injured in the collapse and the number missing ranges from four to 12. About 250 firefighters from across Italy are taking part in the search, using sniffer dogs and climbing gear. ""We're not giving up hope,"" fire official Emanuele Giffi told AFP news agency, vowing teams would work ""round the clock until the last victim is secured"". More than 400 people have been evacuated amid fears other parts of the bridge might fall. The cause of the disaster, which occurred during torrential rain, was not immediately clear but questions had been raised about the safety of the structure. What we know about Italy bridge collapse What could have made the bridge collapse? How the Genoa bridge disaster unfolded In pictures: Deadly Italy bridge collapse Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has vowed to bring anyone responsible for the collapse to book. The Morandi Bridge, built in the 1960s, stands on the A10 toll motorway, an important conduit for goods traffic from local ports, which also serves the Italian Riviera and southern coast of France. The BBC's James Reynolds at the scene says firefighters have been working their way into small cracks in an effort to find anyone who might still be trapped in a vehicle. Genoa police spokesperson Alessandra Bucci told Reuters it was thought that people were still alive. Floodlights guided the search overnight A section measuring 200 metres fell in At least three children were among the dead. The Italian fire service tweeted a video of one person being extracted and carefully lowered on cables from a shattered vehicle, which was suspended in the wreckage of the bridge, high above the ground.

Between 30 and 35 cars and three heavy vehicles were on the bridge at the time of the collapse. A huge tower and sections of the bridge collapsed on to railway lines, a river and a warehouse. The car of Davide Capello, 33, a former goalkeeper for Serie A side Cagliari, came down in the collapse but he survived. ""I was able to get out... I don't know how my car wasn't crushed. It seemed like a scene from a film, it was the apocalypse,"" he said. Marcello de Angelis, who is co-ordinating the Italian Red Cross rescue effort, told the BBC that rescuers were treating the disaster like an earthquake. Rescuers from all over northern Italy came to help Injured people were winched to safety ""There might be the possibility of some niches being created by the rubble itself, with people being protected by the rubble,"" he said. ""The units that we have sent we use during earthquakes. So it is the same sort of situation - and also the risk of other collapses, obviously, is the same."" A section measuring about 200 metres fell at around 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT). Police say there was a violent cloudburst at the time. An unnamed witness quoted by Italy's Ansa news agency said: ""We heard an incredible roar and first we thought it was thunder very close by. ""We live about 5km [three miles] from the bridge but we heard a crazy bang... We were very scared... Traffic went completely haywire and the city was paralysed."" The collapse of the bridge was an ""incident of vast proportions on a vital arterial road, not just for Genoa, but for the whole country"", said the governor of Liguria region, Giovanni Toti. ""The Morandi bridge connects three major ports in our country, used by tens, even hundreds of thousands of people. They depart from these ports on holiday. These docks receive most of our country's imported goods. It damages the very structure of the Italian logistics system. We are expecting a very fast response from the government."" Mr Borrelli said the authorities were trying to arrange help for those affected by the disaster, as well as setting up diversions for traffic. This was the fifth bridge collapse in Italy in five years,according to Corriere Della Sera,external. The new government has pledged to increase public investment. The country spent more than â¬14bn (Â£12.5bn; $16bn) on its roads in 2006 but that had dropped to less than â¬4bn after the 2008 financial crisis, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The figures cover spending on new transport construction and the improvement of the existing networks. Spending started to increase in 2013, when total spend was less than Spain, Germany, France and the UK.

"This video can not be played Nicola and Lisa Henton-Mitchell narrowly escaped the Genoa bridge collapse with their two children. Italian PM Giuseppe Conte has declared a 12-month state of emergency in the Liguria region in response to the motorway bridge collapse in Genoa. He also said he would make an initial â¬5m ($5.7m) available from central funds to the north-western region. The regional government had requested the action following Tuesday's disaster, which left 39 people dead. There has been anger and disbelief in Italy that such a vital structure could have simply given way. Rescuers have said there is little hope of finding more survivors underneath the Morandi bridge, where dozens of vehicles fell from a height of 45m (148ft) in Tuesday morning's collapse. What we know so far What could have made the bridge collapse? In pictures: Deadly Italy bridge collapse The cause is not yet known but there has been heavy criticism of the private company responsible for operating the bridge. Hundreds of firefighters worked overnight and throughout Wednesday with lifting gear, climbing equipment and sniffer dogs to try to locate survivors and bodies. More than 400 people have been evacuated from the area. Residents of housing blocks under one pillar were ready to move back, but were then told it was cracking and that their homes were at risk. This video can not be played Parts of the bridge can be seen collapsing There are 15 people being treated in hospital, nine of them in a serious condition, according to the local prefecture. Giovanni Toti, governor of Liguria, had asked the government in Rome to declare a state of emergency in the region. Following a cabinet meeting held in the city of Genoa, Prime Minister Conte said: ""We agreed to his request to declare a state of emergency in Ligura for 12 months due to the events of yesterday morning... and we decided to release â¬5m from the national emergency fund for immediate needs."" He announced a national day of mourning would take place, which the government wanted ""to coincide with the funerals of the victims"". He added: ""These are unacceptable tragedies that should not happen in a modern society. This government will do everything to prevent such tragedies from happening again."" Mr Conte confirmed the government's intention to begin proceedings to revoke the contract of private sector firm Autostrade per l'Italia, which was in charge of operating and maintaining the bridge and the A10 motorway it was part of. The highways firm defended its maintenance record, saying it had checked the bridge every three months using highly specialised techniques. They included families in their cars, people going to work, and people going on holiday. Most of them were Italians, but the French foreign ministry said four of its nationals had also died. Among the dead were a family of three - Roberto Robbiano, 44, Ersilia Piccinino, 41, and their young son Samuel. Read more:The victims of the Genoa Bridge collapse One of the most compelling testimonies came from Davide Capello, 33, a former goalkeeper for Serie A side Cagliari. His car fell 30m in the collapse, but came to rest in a pocket between the columns and he survived. ""I was able to get out... I don't know how my car wasn't crushed. It seemed like a scene from a film, it was the apocalypse,"" he said. Valentina Galbusera, 43, a doctor, told La Stampa,external: ""The bridge fell in front of me, not even 20m away, I avoided the collapse by only a couple of seconds. I felt the bridge was shaking and I tried to reverse. Then I got out of the car and started running."" It's not yet clear. There was torrential rainfall at the time. A huge tower and sections of the bridge - measuring about 200m - collapsed on to railway lines, a river and a warehouse. The motorway operator said work to shore up the bridge's foundation was being carried out at the time. Autostrade per l'Italia said in 2011 the bridge had been suffering from degradation due to heavy traffic. The Genoa Public Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation into possible negligent homicide. The head prosecutor blamed ""human error"". The state of the bridge and the responses to the collapse throw light on what has been a long-standing debate about Italian infrastructure. This was the fifth bridge collapse in Italy in five years,according to Corriere Della Sera,external. There have been previous reports and comments questioning how the Morandi bridge was built and how long it could last. In December 2012, the Genoa city council discussed the state of the bridge at a public hearing into how to expand the local transport infrastructure. A local industry confederation official spoke of the collapse of the Morandi bridge ""in 10 years"". In 2016, structural engineer Antonio Brencich spoke of ""errors in this bridge"". The issue of transport in the area is now critical, given that the bridge was a major arterial route for an important port city. The Morandi bridge, built in the 1960s, stands on the A10 toll motorway, an important conduit for goods traffic from local ports which also serves the Italian Riviera and south-east coast of France. The prime minister has said all infrastructure across the country will be double-checked in the wake of the collapse.

"This video can not be played Rail cost rises should be reduced, says transport secretary Rail passengers will see the price of regulated rail fares in much of the UK rise by as much as 3.2% in January. The rise, determined by the RPI inflation measure,could add more than Â£100 to annual season ticket prices. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has called forfuture rail fare and wage increases to be based onthe lower Consumer Prices Index - rather than the higher Retail Prices Index. The RMT union accused him of trying to impose a ""pay cap"" on its members. Commuters 'spend fifth of salary' on ticket Passengers rail at fresh train disruption Rail timetable changes for winter scaled back The cost of most train fares are set by train companies themselves but 40% of fares in England, Scotland and Wales are regulated so that they are only allowed to rise by an amount pegged to the RPI rate of inflation in July the previous year - currently 3.2%. These regulated fares include annual season tickets. The government's preferred measure of inflation, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), rose to 2.5% in July from 2.4% in June. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the increase in regulated fares as ""an insult to everyone who has suffered from the chaos on Britain's railways"". A Brighton to London ticket would have beenÂ£39 cheaper(Â£4,293 instead of Â£4,332) Gloucester to Birmingham:Â£37 cheaper(Â£4,071 instead of Â£4,108) Woking to London:Â£30 cheaper(Â£3,218 instead of Â£3,248) Liverpool to Manchester:Â£29 cheaper(Â£3,123 instead of Â£3,152) Maidenhead to London:Â£26 cheaper(Â£3,066 instead of Â£3,092) Mr Grayling said he wanted to see ""lower levels of increases for passengers in future"". If the lower CPI measure was used to calculate future ticket price increases then, he said, rail firms should also use it to set annual pay rises for staff. Mr Grayling told the BBC the lower inflation measure was ""used by pretty much the whole of the rest of the public sector and much of the rest of our economy"".

In response to the transport secretary's suggestion, RMT head Mick Cash said: ""If Chris Grayling seriously thinks that front-line rail workers are going to pay the price for his gross incompetence and the greed of the private train companies he's got another thing coming."" He accused Mr Grayling of continuing an ""all-out war on staff and passengers alike"" and said the RMT would fight any attempt to impose a pay cap. The RMT is organising protests on Wednesday outside stations in London, Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds and Edinburgh against fare rises. Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union Aslef, argued that cutting staff pay would not reduce passenger fares, but only increase the profits made by railway bosses. Both RPI and CPI measure the rate at which the price of common items - such as bread, beer and cinema tickets - rise. But the two measurements use different formulas to calculate the rate of inflation. RPI, unlike CPI, also includes housing costs such as mortgage interest payments and council tax. It has been higher than CPI for years. CPI takes into account that when prices rise, some people will switch to products that have gone up by less. The Office for National Statistics describes RPI as ""a very poor measure of general inflation"". David O'Donnell, 37, from Glasgow, takes the train every day to Paisley. He supports Chris Grayling's proposal. ""I think railway workers should get a pay rise but it should be more in line with the rest of the UK,"" he says. ""But in general I don't think there should be any rail fare increases. It is a disgrace that rail fares continue to increase at a higher rate than the average worker's wage."" By BBC Reality Check How well paid are train drivers at the moment? If you look at ONS figures for average pay,externalfor train and tram drivers in the UK, the median worker (that's the one for whom half earn more and half earn less) was making Â£1,031.20 a week, which is Â£53,622 a year. It's been going up on average by about 4% a year for the last five years. That weekly average is more than double the Â£448.60 a week for all employees in all industries in the UK and indeed the Â£462.00 a week earned on average by bus and coach drivers. While other rail firm employees are on lower pay than drivers, they still earn considerably above average. For example, the median wage for a rail transport operative is Â£721.70 a week, while rail travel assistants are paid Â£647.60, and rail and rolling stock builders and repairers take home Â£902.10. Research has found the cost of rail travel has increased more than twice as fast as wages since 2008. The TUC said fares had risen by 42% over the past 10 years, while nominal weekly earnings have only grown by 18%. But the Rail Delivery Group - which represents railway companies - said passengers' fares were used wisely. ""For every pound paid in fares, 98p goes back in to running and improving the railway,"" said Paul Plummer, chief executive of the RDG.

"Luis Walker wrote to the prime minister asking for her help to make the drug available An eight-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis has urged a pharmaceutical firm to lower the price of a drug so it can be made available on the NHS. Luis Walker, from Horam, East Sussex, told Vertex Pharmaceuticals Orkambi would make him ""feel much better"". The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said the price offered by Vertex was unsustainable. The Department of Health has called for a ""speedy solution"" to be found between NHS England and the firm. In a handwritten letter to Rebecca Hunt, Vertex vice-president for corporate affairs, Luis wrote: ""You have the medicine that can make me feel much better and not have to spend so much time in hospital please sell it to my country. ""If your son had cystic fibrosis I know you understand and lower the price of Orkambi."" Live: More news from across the South East His mother, Christina, said: ""It's a really simple message, please lower the price so the NHS can afford it. ""Our children deserve the chance that everyone else has and they actually have it now with this drug."" Orkambi was approved by the European Medicines Agency in November 2015 but an agreement on cost has not yet been reached with the NHS. Children beg PM for life-changing drug Life-changing drug cost 'should be lowered' Girl 'screaming' for cystic fibrosis help Ms Hunt said Vertex ""shared the frustration"" of Luis and the thousands of people in England waiting for access to the drug. ""We have spent every one of the thousand days since Orkambi was approved trying to get it to patients who need it; and again urge Simon Stevens (NHS England Chief Executive) to come to the table so patients in England don't have to wait any longer,"" she said. But last month, Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged Vertex to break the ""impasse"", telling the House of Commons NHS England had made a ""very generous final offer"" to the company. NHS England said it had proposed a five-year deal which provided the potential for Vertex to secure revenues from the NHS in the region of Â£500m over the next five years and in excess of Â£1bn over the next 10 years. In a letter to the Cystic Fibrosis Trust on 16 July, NHS England National Director John Stewart said he hoped ""Vertex chooses to act responsibly and accept this deal and take advantage of the significant flexibilities the NHS is offering"".

"Baby boxes can be used as beds An average of 1,000 baby boxes per week were delivered to parents of newborns in the first year of the programme. The Scottish government said 52,065 baby boxes had been gifted to date, with an 85% uptake by parents. The boxes contain items including clothing, a play mat, books, a towel and a sling carrier - and the box itself can be used as a sleeping space. The projected cost of the initiative was Â£8m for 2017-18, rising to Â£8.8m for each of the following three years. Midwives want UK-wide baby box scheme Do baby boxes save lives?

She said: ""The museum houses some extraordinary examples of childhood history from all sides of Scottish society. ""From real silver spoons, a popular gift with babies in Victorian Edinburgh, to makeshift dolls crafted with nothing more than a wooden spoon and some old cloth, by families who couldn't afford anything more. ""The modern baby box is the great equaliser. The same gifts for baby, available to all new mothers. It's a pleasure to welcome it into our collection."" Children and Early Years Minister Maree Todd said that they were having a real impact on the families receiving them, and demonstrated that ""as a society, we value each and every child"". Ms Todd said: ""I'm delighted to have reached this milestone. ""It's an honour for everyone involved - from the organisations providing the items to the box packers to the people delivering the boxes - to have been part of something that is having a real impact on the lives of babies and their carers across the country."" A parent survey revealed the most popular items were the room thermometer, followed by the ear thermometer and the sling. The majority of parents (62%) said they had used or planned to use the box as a bed. The Royal College of Midwives recentlybacked the introduction of a similar scheme for the whole of the UK.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Ireland correspondent Chris Page reports from a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the Omagh bombing A memorial bell has tolled in Omagh to mark the 20th anniversary of the Real IRA car bomb that killed 29 people in the County Tyrone town. The bell stopped ringing at 15:10 BST - the time of the explosion - and was followed by two minutes of silence. A woman pregnant with twins was among the peoplekilled in the dissident republican attack on 15 August 1998,external. Former police ombudsman Baroness Nuala O'Loan said on Wednesday that the bomb could have been prevented. In pictures: 20th anniversary of Omagh bomb This video can not be played The Omagh bombing: A timeline of events It was the greatest single loss of life in the Troubles. The bell was rung 32 times in memory of the victims - with the extra single peal for all who have lost their lives in atrocities around the world. It is part of a public vigil being held at the bottom of Market Street in the town. In the Republic of Ireland, President Michael D Higgins rang the peace bell at Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in - his official residence - in solidarity with the people of Omagh. The bell was designed to mark the 10th anniversary of the Good Friday peace agreement. Floral tributes were placed in Omagh's memorial garden on the 20th anniversary of the bombing Omagh's Market Street was busy with shoppers as it was on this date 20 years ago. Relatives who organised today's event said it is about remembrance, hope and moving forward, recognising the forgotten people of the Omagh bomb, such as the emergency services and the ordinary people who helped in the aftermath. For some the anniversary is too painful to join the public commemoration - they will remember their loved ones in their own way. On Wednesday morning one person came alone to lay a bunch of flowers at the memorial. Others spent the afternoon at the gravesides of their loved ones. Baroness O'Loan, whoinvestigated the police's actions in the lead up to the bombing,external, claimed the Omagh bomb could have been prevented if the security forces had acted differently. She said: ""When I reported on Omagh I said we didn't know whether the bomb could have been prevented."" ""It is now my very firm view that the bomb could have been prevented."" The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) rejected her claim and said her comments would further ""traumatise"" victims' families. The bombing was carried out by the Real IRA just months after the Good Friday Agreement was signed Baroness O'Loan said there was ""sufficient intelligence to take action"" and the ""taking of that action could have prevented"" the explosion. ""This wasn't just a random bomb - the police knew an awful lot about the activities of the IRA in this area,"" she added as she repeated her calls for a public inquiry into the atrocity. She said the intelligence services were tracking the movements of the car containing the bomb from the Republic of Ireland. PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said Baroness O'Loan had ""changed her position on that without real explanation"". Hundreds of people gathered in Omagh to remember those who died in the explosion ""If it is factually true and can be proven to any standard of proof whatsoever, why did she not say it in 2001 when she published her report?"" he said. ""When she had access to all the material she came to the conclusion that she could not know, based on all that information, if the bomb could have been prevented. Kevin Skelton, whose wife Philomena died in the blast, said that Baroness O'Loan's comments did not ""make any difference"". ""Telling us now that the bomb could have been prevented is a bit late - it should have been prevented at the time,"" he said. ""It won't bring my wife back."" Alan McQuillan, a former senior police officer in Northern Ireland, said that dissident republican groups could still carry out an attack like the Omagh bomb. ""They have fractured, they have broken up... [but] they remain a continual potential threat and we've got to deal with that,"" he added. The Omagh bombing was carried out bythe dissident republican Real IRA,externalseveral months after the signing of theGood Friday Agreement. The bomb, which was packed with 225kg (496lb) of explosives, detonated in a car parked in the middle of the town's main street. Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt was responsible for the Omagh bomb, a High Court judge found in a civil case in 2009. Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were also found liable for the attack. The four men were named by Mr Justice Morgan in a ruling made as part of a landmark case taken by some of the families of the victims. The 12 relatives were awarded more than Â£1.6m in damages for the attack but to date nothing has been paid. A warning had been called in 40 minutes earlier but the caller had said the car was at a different location. The dead included three generations of one family. No-one has been convicted over the bombing.

"Officers found 11 starving children at the remote compound, and the remains of a toddler A New Mexico judge has received death threats after granting bail to five adults arrested at a desert compound. Judge Sarah Backus said the prosecution had not convinced her the defendants were a threat to the community. Police had arrested the two men and three women at a remote compound raided in the search for a missing three-year-old boy, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj. Officers found 11 starving children and the buried remains of a toddler in a case that has shocked the country. US compound boy 'died during ritual' US children 'trained to attack schools' Judge Backus granted the five bail after a hearing on Monday, ordering that all five must wear ankle monitors and have weekly contact with their lawyers. The boy's father, Siraj Wahhaj, was one of the five arrested. But her decision has caused a storm of protest. A spokesperson for the New Mexico courts said a caller told the judge ""he wished her throat were slit"", with another saying he ""hoped someone would come and smash her head in"". An email to Ms Backus called her an ""Islamic terror sympathiser"". The Taos County court building was evacuated briefly on Tuesday after the threats. Suspects Siraj Wahhaj (L) and Lucas Morton Judge Backus said at the hearing that while what she had heard was ""troubling"", prosecutors did not prove that the defendants posed a threat to the wider community. ""The state alleges that there was a big plan afoot, but the state hasn't shown to my satisfaction, in clear and convincing evidence, what that plan was,"" she said. The prosecution argued that all five adults were dangerous and should not be granted bail, because they had trained the children to use weapons and carry out school shootings. They also said that the remains found at the site were those of Abdul-Ghani and that the other children said the boy had died during a ""religious ritual... intended to cast out demonic spirits"", where Siraj Wahhaj had put his hand to his son's forehead, and recited verses from the Koran. But defence lawyers accused the prosecution of treating the five suspects unfairly because they are Muslim - something prosecutors deny. Defence lawyer Thomas Clark said after the hearing that if the accused were Christian and white then ""nobody would bat an eye over the idea of faith healing"". ""But when black Muslims do it, there seems to be something nefarious, something evil,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Omarosa Manigault Newman: The audio tapes Donald Trump's election campaign has begun legal action against an ex-White House aide and reality TV star for allegedly breaching her contract. Donald J Trump for President, Inc has filed for arbitration against Omarosa Manigault Newman, claiming she violated a 2016 non-disclosure agreement. A feud between the two has escalated as Mrs Newman promotes a new book that is very critical of him. On Tuesday, Mr Trump angrily denied her claim he was taped using the N-word. He tweeted: ""I don't have that word in my vocabulary, and never have."" Mrs Newman - a former star of The Apprentice who was fired after a stint as a White House adviser - claimed that Mr Trump was recorded using the word while working on the show he hosted for 11 years. But she has not said she ever heard him using the word himself. Their war of words hit arguably a new low when the president called Mrs Newman, who had previously been one of his most prominent black supporters, a ""dog"". ""She made it up,"" he wrote, also calling her a ""lowlife,"" ""a loser"" and ""Wacky and Deranged"". The dos and don'ts of the Situation Room The White House revolving door: Who's gone?

In the latest development, a senior Trump campaign official sent a statement to US media confirming the legal action. ""Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. has filed an arbitration against Manigault-Newman with the American Arbitration Association in New York City, for breach of her 2016 confidentiality agreement with the Trump Campaign. ""President Trump is well known for giving people opportunities to advance in their careers and lives over the decades, but wrong is wrong, and a direct violation of an agreement must be addressed and the violator must be held accountable."" Mrs Newman has said in interviews that she never signed an agreement when she began working in the White House but it's unclear if she did when she joined the Trump campaign. ""I will not be silenced,"" she told the AP after the legal action was filed on Tuesday. ""I'm not going to be bullied by Donald Trump,"" she added. Mrs Newman has released several audio tapes of her discussions with White House staff and Mr Trump in recent days as part of a publicity tour to promote her tell-all book, Unhinged. The most explosive allegation in Unhinged is that there is a tape of Mr Trump using the N-word during filming for his reality show, The Apprentice. A new tape released on Tuesday to CBS News purports to document Trump campaign aides speaking during the election about how to deal with the potential fallout of the tape emerging. Former aide Omarosa taped 'Trump phone call' Trump campaign advisers Katrina Pierson and Lynne Patton - whom Mrs Newman identified as being on the new tape discussing the claim - have said in statements to US media that the conversation never took place. Analysis by Chris Buckler, BBC News, Washington There have already been showdowns between Donald Trump and Omarosa Manigault Newman. When she was a contestant on the reality television programme The Apprentice Mr Trump had what must now seem like the pleasure of firing her. But Omarosa's real-life dismissal from a job at the White House could see them (or at least their representatives) return to a boardroom. Arbitration is used as a way of trying to resolve rows without a court confrontation. That might sound more friendly but make no mistake; the Trump campaign team want Omarosa silenced. Perhaps more importantly they also want her to stop producing tapes of secretly-recorded conversations. We have already heard her being sacked by White House chief of staff John Kelly in the Situation Room and a phone call allegedly with the president himself. What perhaps worries the Trump team most is they can't be sure what else she surreptitiously recorded. However, her key accusation that the president used racist language has been made without evidence. And Omarosa's credibility hasn't been helped by some television interviews promoting her book Unhinged that have seemed frankly rather befitting of that title. In some ways the most surprising thing is that Mr Trump appears shocked by her behaviour. On The Apprentice Omarosa revelled in her portrayal as a scheming, dog-eat-dog character who played to win at all costs. But then again, maybe that is why his campaign team got her to sign a confidentiality agreement in the first place. In his tweets, Mr Trump said that he had spoken with the British producer of The Apprentice, Mark Burnett, who ""called to say that there are NO TAPES of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by Wacky and Deranged Omarosa"".

In another tweet he mused: ""When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn't work out. ""Good work by General [John] Kelly for quickly firing that dog!"" Mrs Newman has known Mr Trump for almost 15 years, and appeared on several seasons of The Apprentice, whereshe was known to viewers as the programme's ""villain"". When she was fired from the White House in December 2017, Mr Trump tweeted: ""Thank you Omarosa for your service! I wish you continued success."" On Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Mr Trump hired her because he ""wanted to give her a chance"". She added that Mrs Newman instigated the fight, and that Mr Trump is ""certainly voicing his frustration with the fact that this person has shown a complete lack of integrity"". When asked if she could guarantee that the American people will never hear Mr Trump speaking the N-word, she replied: ""I can't guarantee anything."" Mrs Newman's departure has highlighted the lack of diversity in senior roles at the White House, where only one black man - Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson - has a cabinet post.

"A large section of the Morandi bridge collapsed amid heavy rainfall on 14 August. Dozens of vehicles plunged 45m amid heavy traffic. Forty-three people were killed. What could have made the bridge collapse? In pictures: Deadly Italy bridge collapse Here is what we know so far about the disaster. The Morandi bridge carries a major road, the A10 toll motorway, which serves the Italian Riviera and links northern Italy to France. This video can not be played Parts of the bridge can be seen collapsing Part of the 1.2km (0.8 mile) long bridge spans the Polcevera waterway, with other portions reaching over railway lines and buildings. It was designed by Riccardo Morandi and completed in 1967, but restructuring work was done in 2016. Some major repairs were also done to the bridge in the 1990s. The motorway operator said work to shore up the bridge's foundation was being carried out at the time of the collapse, during which time it was being constantly monitored. A section measuring about 200m fell at around 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) on Tuesday. It is not yet clear what caused the disaster, but several explanations have been offered. Some experts have suggested that the ongoing maintenance work may have been a factor in the collapse. Others have suggested it may have been caused by a design flaw or heavy traffic. The bridge sees some 25 million vehicles every year, and a 2011 report by an Italian highways company said that the bridge had been suffering from degradation. Antonio Brencich, a structural engineer who lectures at Genoa University, wrote in 2016 that it may have been more economical to rebuild the bridge because of the ongoing maintenance costs. ""There are errors in this bridge. Sooner or later, it will have to be replaced. I don't know when,"" he warned. Rescuers from all over northern Italy came to help The victims include a young family of three, whose their car fell from the bridge. They have been identified as Roberto Robbiano, Ersilia Piccinino, and their seven-year-old son Samuel. The family were travelling to Sardinia via the port of Genoa, their car full of luggage and beach toys. Amateur footballer Andrea Cerulli was also killed as he was driving to work. His team in Genoa confirmed his death in a tribute posted to their Facebook page. The club said it was ""rallying round the family of Andrea"" and hundreds of people posted condolence messages in response. Read more about the victims of the Genoa Bridge collapse here. Some survivors have recounted dramatic stories of the disaster. This video can not be played Luciano Goccia: 'I was under the bridge when it collapsed' The car of Davide Capello, 33, a former goalkeeper for Serie A side Cagliari, went down with the collapsed bridge but he survived. ""I was driving along the bridge, and at a certain point I saw the road in front of me collapse, and I went down with the car,"" he told local media. ""I was able to get out... I don't know how my car wasn't crushed. It seemed like a scene from a film, it was the apocalypse,"" he said.

""[The debris] fell on top of me and I broke my arm,"" he said. ""I can't remember much because I lost consciousness when the windshield fell on me."" 'Miracle escape' stories emerge in Genoa Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said he was committed to finding those responsible On Wednesday, Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli called for resignations at the Italian highways agency which operated the bridge. ""The top management of Autostrade per l'Italia must step down first of all,"" he said in a Facebook post. Interior Minister Matteo Salvini had earlier said he would ""do everything to get the names and surnames of the managers responsible"". But an official from the company insisted the collapse was ""unexpected and unpredictable"". ""The bridge was constantly monitored and supervised well beyond what the law required,"" Stefano Marigliani told Reuters news agency. The company that operated the bridge says checks were regularly carried out by experts The company has been heavily criticisedsince the disaster and the government has accused it of prioritising profits over safety. ""A lot of money should have been invested in security, but instead it went towards dividends,"" Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said. On Thursday, the government threatened to terminate the company's contracts and impose heavy fines. Shares in its holding company, Atlantia, fell almost 30% from the previous close. Autostrade per l'Italia insists it has performed according to its contract and the law. It says checks were carried out quarterly by world-leading experts and these had shown no cause for alarm.

"This video can not be played The car can be seen crashing into a barrier Police are searching three addresses in the Midlands after a man was arrested on suspicion of terrorism following a car crash outside Parliament. The 29-year-old British suspect is not believed to be known to MI5 or counter-terrorism police. A vehicle swerved into cyclists and pedestrians shortly after 07:30 BST before crashing into a barrier outside the Houses of Parliament. Two people were treated in hospital but were later discharged. A third person with minor injuries was assessed at the scene. No-one else was in the car when it crashed and no weapons were found in it. This video can not be played Sham Khatun: ""They shouted 'Police!', they broke a couple of doors"" Searches took place at two addresses in Birmingham and a residential property in the Radford and Arboretum area of Nottingham. A woman who witnessed police arriving to search the Nottingham property told the BBC the raid took place between about 15:00 and 16:00 BST. She said other officers in plain clothes remained at the scene for a few hours. Sham Khatun said: ""A van parked up outside the house, they broke into the house.

A number of eyewitnesses have said the silver Ford Fiesta, which was travelling westbound in Parliament Square, appeared to deliberately hit members of the public as it swerved into the opposite lane. Footage released by the BBC shows the moment when the car then crosses over a traffic island in the middle of the road before crashing into the security barriers.

The immediate area around the incident remains taped off and screened by white temporary fencing. Parliament is not currently sitting. British Transport Police said it was increasing patrols in England, Scotland and Wales and that its officers would be ""highly visible on trains and at stations"". The prime minister paid tribute to the ""formidable courage"" and professionalism of the emergency services who ""ran towards a dangerous situation in order to protect the public"". Urging the public to remain vigilant but ""carry on as normal"", Theresa May added: ""For the second time in as many years the home of our democracy, which is a potent symbol of our precious values of tolerance and freedom, has witnessed terrible scenes just yards from its door."" The Houses of Parliament are surrounded with security barriers of steel and concrete. The measures were extended in the wake of the Westminster Bridge attack in March 2017 when Khalid Masood ploughed a car into crowds on Westminster Bridge, killing four people. By Dominic Casciani, BBC News home affairs correspondent Security arrangements at Parliament have progressively tightened since 2001. In the aftermath of the 7/7 attacks, new truck bomb-proof barriers were installed in an effort to ""target harden"" Westminster. These include the reinforced low black rampart-like walls that surround Parliament itself and a highly visible armed police presence. Visitors need to go through a chicane-like system designed to help armed officers spot suspects. The one significant weak spot was the main vehicle gates - as became apparent in March 2017's one-man attack. That triggered an internal security review that has led to changes that remain secret - although it's apparent to Londoners that there are now more armed police than ever before patrolling the area. The threat of terrorism is a constant concern for Parliamentarians - it's not new. Irish republican paramilitaries murdered Airey Neave MP in 1979 in a car bomb that exploded within the palace grounds. And the dilemma remains the same: how best to balance security with guaranteeing that the heart of British democracy remains open to the people. The prime minister's official spokesman said as of the end June 2018 there were 676 live investigations into potential terrorist plots. He said since March 2017, 13 Islamist plots and four far-right plots had been foiled. Scotland Yard is asking anyone with information on Tuesday's crash to call 0800 789 321.

"Scientists say they have discovered why some vegetables - including cabbage, broccoli and kale - can reduce the risk of bowel cancers. That cruciferous veg is good for the gut has never been in doubt but a detailed explanation has been elusive. The team at the Francis Crick Institute found anti-cancer chemicals were produced as the vegetables were digested. Cancer Research UK said there were plenty of reasons to eat more veg. The work focused on how vegetables alter the lining of the intestines, by studying mice and miniature bowels growing in the lab. Like the skin, the surface of the bowels is constantly being regenerated in a process that takes four to five days. But this constant renewal needs to be tightly controlled, otherwise it could lead to cancer or gut inflammation. And the work, published in the journal Immunity, showed chemicals in cruciferous vegetables were vital. Fruit and veg: For a longer life eat 10-a-day Fibre and whole grains 'reduce bowel cancer risk Bowel cancer screening to start earlier at age 50 in England The researchers investigated a chemical called indole-3-carbinol, which is produced by chewing such vegetables. ""Make sure they're not overcooked, no soggy broccoli,"" said researcher Dr Gitta Stockinger. The chemical is modified by stomach acid as it continues its journey through the digestive system. In the lower bowel, it can change the behaviour of stem cells, which regenerate the bowel lining, and of immune cells that control inflammation. The study showed diets high in indole-3-carbinol protected the mice from cancer, even those whose genes put them at very high risk of the disease. Without the protective diet, the gut cells divided uncontrollably. Dr Stockinger added: ""Even when the mice started developing tumours and we switched them to the appropriate diet, it halted tumour progression."" Signs of bowel cancer include persistent: blood in the stools changes in bowel habits, such as going to the toilet more often tummy pain, bloating or discomfort Dr Stockinger said the findings were a ""cause for optimism"". She has reduced the amount of meat she eats and now consumes a lot more vegetables. She told the BBC: ""A lot of dietary advice we're getting changes periodically  - it is very confusing and not clear cut what the causes and consequences are. ""Just telling me it's good for me without a reason will not make me eat it. ""With this study, we have the molecular mechanisms about how this system works."" Prof Tim Key, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""This study in mice suggests that it's not just the fibre contained in vegetables like broccoli and cabbage that help reduce the risk of bowel cancer, but also molecules found in these vegetables too. ""Further studies will help find out whether the molecules in these vegetables have the same effect in people, but in the meantime there are already plenty of good reasons to eat more vegetables.""

"Chief executive pay rose by 11% last year to almost Â£4m - much higher than rises for workers, a new report found. The rise came despite criticism from investors and government about excessive salaries, the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development (CIPD) said. The highest total payout was Â£47.1m for Jeff Fairburn, chief executive of housebuilder Persimmon. The GMB union called the findings a ""badge of national shame"". According to the CIPD, the median pay for FTSE 100 chief executives was Â£3.93m last year, up from Â£3.53m in 2016. That compared with a 2% increase for UK workers as a whole, it said. The HR industry group also found bosses were paid on average 145 times more than their employees - up from 128 times in 2016. Firms to be forced to justify pay gap 'Fat cat Thursday' for top bosses Royal Mail hit by investor revolt over pay John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said most workers' wages were still below 2010 levels and were barely keeping up with inflation. ""When they see the fattest cats get fatter yet again with an 11% pay rise, it's no wonder people question the fairness of our society,"" he said. Tim Roache, GMB general secretary, said the figures exposed the ""shocking excess"" in UK boardrooms. ""We live in a country where company fat cats get paid 400 times more than the dedicated, hard-working carers who look after our nearest and dearest - not to mention hundreds of times more than those who keep our streets clean, or ambulance workers who save lives."" In June, the government said all companies with more than 250 employees would be required to publish their pay ratios. Unions want ministers to go further, guaranteeing worker representatives on companies' executive pay committees. It follows concerns some bosses have been getting pay packages out of step with company performance. Shareholders have also become more critical, staging a rash of revolts at firms such asRoyal Mail,Persimmonand advertising giantWPP. A Department for Business spokesman said: ""While most companies get their responsible business practices right, we understand the anger of workers and shareholders when bosses' pay is out of step with company performance. ""That is why as part of our corporate governance reforms, the UK's largest companies now have to ensure employees' interests are represented in the boardroom and annually publish and explain the pay ratio between senior management and the workers.""

"No mail in years? Maybe check with your local postman A postal worker in India has been suspended after he was found not to have delivered thousands of letters for more than 10 years. Ever wondered why you never heard back from that job offer, that ATM card application or why that person you really wanted to hear from never wrote? Well, if you're in the Odhanga village in India's Orissa state, there's a good chance that letter was in fact sent. It was just never delivered, piling up with countless other undelivered mail. The stash of old letters and packages was discovered by chance when a group of school children played in the recently abandoned post office after the branch had moved to a new location. Playing in the yard, they noticed large bags with letters sticking out, local media report. When they looked inside and discovered ATM cards and bank passbooks, they alerted their parents and soon the authorities were on the case. According to the Hindustan Times newspaper, it's thought there are some 6,000 letters and packages with the oldest dating back as far as 2004. Some 1,500 letters have been salvaged while many of the remaining items are soggy or damaged by termites. India Post is one of the most widely distributed postal systems in the world Son's war letter 98-year delivery Love letter from 1950s returned to couple The strangest things sent in the post The reluctant mailman is named as Jagannath Puhan, assistant branch post master, who for most of the past decade was alone in charge at the village office. And while he appeared to be lazy in delivering the mail, he was smart in how he went about it. Any registered mail or speed post was duly delivered as he knew the sender would likely track the delivery, officials said. Ordinary mail, however, had a good chance of ending up in the storeroom rather than with the intended recipient. It is not clear yet why the mailman so blatantly neglected his duties. According to the Hindustan Times he defended himself by saying that for several years he ""couldn't walk properly and was not in a condition to deliver these letters"". Authorities investigating the case are quoted as saying they are puzzled as to why over all those years no resident had raised complaints. Whatever mail will be able to be salvaged will now be delivered - albeit with that slight delay of several years. ""I personally noticed a letter from the Indian Navy dated 2011 for a local boy who had applied to them,"" one of the investigating post employees is quoted in the Indian Express. But many a letter might never reach its proper addressee - countless letters have been so damaged over the years that the names on them are indecipherable.

It is part of a public vigil being held at the bottom of Market Street in the town. In the Republic of Ireland, President Michael D Higgins rang the peace bell at Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in - his official residence - in solidarity with the people of Omagh. The bell was designed to mark the 10th anniversary of the Good Friday peace agreement. Floral tributes were placed in Omagh's memorial garden on the 20th anniversary of the bombing Omagh's Market Street was busy with shoppers as it was on this date 20 years ago. Relatives who organised today's event said it is about remembrance, hope and moving forward, recognising the forgotten people of the Omagh bomb, such as the emergency services and the ordinary people who helped in the aftermath. For some the anniversary is too painful to join the public commemoration - they will remember their loved ones in their own way. On Wednesday morning one person came alone to lay a bunch of flowers at the memorial. Others spent the afternoon at the gravesides of their loved ones. Baroness O'Loan, whoinvestigated the police's actions in the lead up to the bombing,external, claimed the Omagh bomb could have been prevented if the security forces had acted differently. She said: ""When I reported on Omagh I said we didn't know whether the bomb could have been prevented."" ""It is now my very firm view that the bomb could have been prevented."" The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) rejected her claim and said her comments would further ""traumatise"" victims' families. The bombing was carried out by the Real IRA just months after the Good Friday Agreement was signed Baroness O'Loan said there was ""sufficient intelligence to take action"" and the ""taking of that action could have prevented"" the explosion. ""This wasn't just a random bomb - the police knew an awful lot about the activities of the IRA in this area,"" she added as she repeated her calls for a public inquiry into the atrocity. She said the intelligence services were tracking the movements of the car containing the bomb from the Republic of Ireland. PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said Baroness O'Loan had ""changed her position on that without real explanation"". Hundreds of people gathered in Omagh to remember those who died in the explosion ""If it is factually true and can be proven to any standard of proof whatsoever, why did she not say it in 2001 when she published her report?"" he said. ""When she had access to all the material she came to the conclusion that she could not know, based on all that information, if the bomb could have been prevented. Kevin Skelton, whose wife Philomena died in the blast, said that Baroness O'Loan's comments did not ""make any difference"". ""Telling us now that the bomb could have been prevented is a bit late - it should have been prevented at the time,"" he said. ""It won't bring my wife back."" Alan McQuillan, a former senior police officer in Northern Ireland, said that dissident republican groups could still carry out an attack like the Omagh bomb. ""They have fractured, they have broken up... [but] they remain a continual potential threat and we've got to deal with that,"" he added. The Omagh bombing was carried out bythe dissident republican Real IRA,externalseveral months after the signing of theGood Friday Agreement. The bomb, which was packed with 225kg (496lb) of explosives, detonated in a car parked in the middle of the town's main street. Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt was responsible for the Omagh bomb, a High Court judge found in a civil case in 2009. Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were also found liable for the attack. The four men were named by Mr Justice Morgan in a ruling made as part of a landmark case taken by some of the families of the victims. The 12 relatives were awarded more than Â£1.6m in damages for the attack but to date nothing has been paid. A warning had been called in 40 minutes earlier but the caller had said the car was at a different location. The dead included three generations of one family.

The bombing was carried out by the Real IRA just months after the Good Friday Agreement was signed Baroness O'Loan said there was ""sufficient intelligence to take action"" and the ""taking of that action could have prevented"" the explosion. ""This wasn't just a random bomb - the police knew an awful lot about the activities of the IRA in this area,"" she added as she repeated her calls for a public inquiry into the atrocity. She said the intelligence services were tracking the movements of the car containing the bomb from the Republic of Ireland. PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said Baroness O'Loan had ""changed her position on that without real explanation"". Hundreds of people gathered in Omagh to remember those who died in the explosion ""If it is factually true and can be proven to any standard of proof whatsoever, why did she not say it in 2001 when she published her report?"" he said. ""When she had access to all the material she came to the conclusion that she could not know, based on all that information, if the bomb could have been prevented. Kevin Skelton, whose wife Philomena died in the blast, said that Baroness O'Loan's comments did not ""make any difference"". ""Telling us now that the bomb could have been prevented is a bit late - it should have been prevented at the time,"" he said. ""It won't bring my wife back."" Alan McQuillan, a former senior police officer in Northern Ireland, said that dissident republican groups could still carry out an attack like the Omagh bomb. ""They have fractured, they have broken up... [but] they remain a continual potential threat and we've got to deal with that,"" he added. The Omagh bombing was carried out bythe dissident republican Real IRA,externalseveral months after the signing of theGood Friday Agreement. The bomb, which was packed with 225kg (496lb) of explosives, detonated in a car parked in the middle of the town's main street. Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt was responsible for the Omagh bomb, a High Court judge found in a civil case in 2009. Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were also found liable for the attack. The four men were named by Mr Justice Morgan in a ruling made as part of a landmark case taken by some of the families of the victims. The 12 relatives were awarded more than Â£1.6m in damages for the attack but to date nothing has been paid. A warning had been called in 40 minutes earlier but the caller had said the car was at a different location. The dead included three generations of one family. No-one has been convicted over the bombing.

"The flight had been in the air for about an hour when the couple started arguing, the court heard A flight from Stansted to Gran Canaria had to be diverted to Portugal after a couple started arguing in mid-air, a court has heard. The Boeing 737, flying to Las Palmas, was diverted to Faro on 6 July 2017. Ronald St Ville, 53, and Pauline Gordon, 66, both of Stewart Road, Stratford, east London, have been charged with endangering the safety of an aircraft. The couple denied the charges at Chelmsford Crown Court. Prosecutor Peter Gair said the pair were flying together when an expletive-riddled argument started over a text message. A fellow passenger told the jury he heard the couple arguing and swearing intermittently for over an hour and thought they were drunk. The witness, a former policeman, said Mr St Ville had threatened to hit Ms Gordon in what he described as an ""argument between a domestic couple"". The court heard the cabin crew and pilot made the decision to land the Jet2 plane in Portugal and remove the couple after separating them. The trial continues.

Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan says Trump Tower is ""violating the law"" Allegedly Trump Tower did not submit results of a study to the authorities as required in 2013.

"Chief executive pay rose by 11% last year to almost Â£4m - much higher than rises for workers, a new report found. The rise came despite criticism from investors and government about excessive salaries, the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development (CIPD) said. The highest total payout was Â£47.1m for Jeff Fairburn, chief executive of housebuilder Persimmon. The GMB union called the findings a ""badge of national shame"". According to the CIPD, the median pay for FTSE 100 chief executives was Â£3.93m last year, up from Â£3.53m in 2016. That compared with a 2% increase for UK workers as a whole, it said. The HR industry group also found bosses were paid on average 145 times more than their employees - up from 128 times in 2016. Firms to be forced to justify pay gap 'Fat cat Thursday' for top bosses Royal Mail hit by investor revolt over pay John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said most workers' wages were still below 2010 levels and were barely keeping up with inflation. ""When they see the fattest cats get fatter yet again with an 11% pay rise, it's no wonder people question the fairness of our society,"" he said. Tim Roache, GMB general secretary, said the figures exposed the ""shocking excess"" in UK boardrooms. ""We live in a country where company fat cats get paid 400 times more than the dedicated, hard-working carers who look after our nearest and dearest - not to mention hundreds of times more than those who keep our streets clean, or ambulance workers who save lives."" In June, the government said all companies with more than 250 employees would be required to publish their pay ratios. Unions want ministers to go further, guaranteeing worker representatives on companies' executive pay committees. It follows concerns some bosses have been getting pay packages out of step with company performance. Shareholders have also become more critical, staging a rash of revolts at firms such asRoyal Mail,Persimmonand advertising giantWPP. A Department for Business spokesman said: ""While most companies get their responsible business practices right, we understand the anger of workers and shareholders when bosses' pay is out of step with company performance. ""That is why as part of our corporate governance reforms, the UK's largest companies now have to ensure employees' interests are represented in the boardroom and annually publish and explain the pay ratio between senior management and the workers.""

"For travellers on their summer holidays, where to stop for a toilet break can be a source of worry. Public toilet provision has been declining for a number of years and the BBC has learnt that some UK high streets and tourist hot spots now no longer have any council-run public toilets. At least 673 public toilets across the UK have stopped being maintained by major councils (unitary, borough, district and city) since 2010, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information law. In that time, the UK's population has been increasing. Has the number of public toilets maintained by your council gone up or down? Use our map below to find out. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Click to launch,externalthe interactive map if it is not displaying properly. Data supplied by 376 of the 430 councils contacted by the BBC showed that: UK councils stopped maintaining around 13% of public toilets between 2010 and 2018 But this masks big regional variations - Cornwall Council has stopped maintaining 94% of its toilets, on the Isle of Wight it was 92% and 80% in North Ayrshire In 2018 there were 4,486 toilets run by major councils in the UK, down from 5,159 in 2010 In 37 areas, major councils no longer run any public conveniences Highland Council maintains most public toilets (92), followed by Gwynedd (73) and Pembrokeshire (73) Local authorities are not legally required to provide toilets, meaning they are often closed as councils look to cut costs. A Local Government Association representative said that, while councils were doing everything they could to keep public toilets open, substantial reductions to their budgets have meant they have had to make ""tough choices"" about public facilities. The Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government says it encourages councils to keep toilets open to the public since they are a ""valuable community amenity"". These findings do not mean there are no toilets available at all, however - in many cases larger councils are shifting responsibility to smaller parish or town councils. Others have been handed to community groups and paid for through fundraising while some councils are relying on the goodwill of businesses to make their toilets available to the public. Andy McGuinness, campaign manager of charity Crohn's and Colitis UK, claims handing the running of facilities over to parish councils in England is only a short-term fix, because it simply passes on the financial pressure. ""It takes the upkeep off their books but it's not sustainable. Parish councils will run them for a couple of years and eventually they'll probably close anyway,"" he said. He added that, without action from government and local authorities, the increasing closures of public toilets in England posed a ""very real problem for the millions of people living with continence problems"". Local councils (such as town and parish councils) get their money from a share of council tax. Sue Baxter, who chairs the National Association of Local Councils, said smaller councils were increasingly taking over discretionary services such as toilets as budget pressures meant larger councils were finding them harder to provide. But, she said, they faced a dilemma - whether to allow toilets in their local area to close or take them on and face a hefty ""toilet tax"" in the form of business rates paid on the premises. There isno particular right to access a toilet in public,externaland local authorities do not have a duty to provide them Businesses that provide toilets for their customers have no legal duty to do so for non-customers Workplaces,externalmust provide suitable conveniences for their staff Anywhere that offers goods or services to the public mustmake sure disabled people have equal access,externalto their facilities, including toilets We asked the 50 councils with the biggest cuts how many had actually closed and how many had been handed over to smaller councils or other groups. Almost all of the 30 that responded had closed at least some, if not all, entirely. Only one council - East Northamptonshire - said its figures didn't translate to any toilets actually being closed. Several had also handed the running of some toilets to private companies or community groups. Raymond Martin, of the British Toilet Association, said providing toilets was a public health issue, but it was also about equality and social inclusion. He believes that, while councils have no legal requirement to provide access to public toilets, they do have a ""moral responsibility"". And charity Disability Rights UK says it has increasingly been receiving calls from disabled people reporting that accessible toilets are no longer available. With these significant reductions in facilities, you might reasonably assume some people will resort to using their wider environment when caught short. So the BBC also asked councils and police forces whether they enforced any laws against public urination, and what had happened to numbers of offences in the same time period. We found that around the country, very few local councils or police forces take action against public urination. Those that do, however, use a range of tools including by-laws, public order offences specifically tackling public urination, and broader offences including indecent exposure, outraging the public decency, littering and harassment. The London borough of Tower Hamlets, which had one of the biggest falls in the number of offences, said it has focused on ""better enforcement"" of the rules, which it said has acted as a deterrent. The council added that closures of pubs, clubs and bars had also contributed to the fall in offences. Data supplied by 388 of 430 major councils and 39 out of 42 police forces in the UK covering the years 2010-2017 revealed that: 233 councils and force areas don't have any by-laws prohibiting public urination Of the 180 forces and councils that had by-laws or public order offences against public urination, 112 said they hadn't enforced them at all during this time period For those that did enforce rules against public urination, the number of times they were enforced had fallen in almost all areas In total, police forces and councils responding to the request recorded 15,297 offences relating to public urination in 2018, more than halving from 32,668 in 2010 Where police forces did use public order offences, the numbers were small - fewer than 10 offences in any given year Cornwall's unitary council saw the number of public toilets it maintains drop over the past five years, from 253 in 2013 to only 14. Over the same time, overall expenditure on toilets was all but wiped out, falling from Â£4.3m to only Â£217,000. A council representative said: ""We recognise that public toilets are important to residents and visitors alike - but with huge cuts in funding by central government we have been forced, like other local authorities, to review the non-statutory services we provide. ""We have now successfully transferred the ownership or management of over 200 public toilets to local city, town and parish councils and local community organisations and businesses. ""Only 16 toilets have closed to date."" The council has also started charging for the remaining toilets it runs. Wiltshire Council now runs only one public toilet on its streets, and another five at park-and-ride sites, in comparison with 32 in 2010. The council saw its spending on toilets cut by more than Â£100,000 between the 2016 and 2017 financial years. It said 22 of the toilets were transferred to the control of town and parish councils, and the rest have closed. ""We carried out a public consultation exercise in 2015 and the overwhelming response was facilities should be offered to the town and parish councils to run if they felt it was appropriate."" One of the biggest spenders is the City of London Council. It spent Â£992,000 on running four public toilets in 2017. In 2010, it spent Â£1,029,000 on double the number of conveniences. When contacted by BBC News, the council did not comment on why expenditure had remained relatively flat. New Forest District Council followed, with an overall expenditure of Â£877,660 on 24 public toilets and refurbishment work in 2017. Bridgend County Borough Council in Wales now maintains only six public toilets, down from 16 in 2010. It said that three more toilets were likely to close in the next year, unless they are taken on by town councils, because of budget reductions. Meanwhile in North Ayrshire, there has been a fall from 45 in 2010 to nine in 2018. The council says five of these were transferred into community ownership and paid for through fundraising, while the rest closed outright. In Northern Ireland, eight local councils either increased or maintained the same number of public toilets between 2010 and 2018. Fermanagh and Omagh District Council had the highest number of council-run conveniences at 51 in 2018. Illustrations by Katie Horwich. Maps by Ed Lowther and Prina Shah.

"Carey Dean Moore was sentenced to death for two 1979 murders Nebraska has become the first US state to use the opioid fentanyl to carry out the death penalty. Convicted criminal Carey Dean Moore, 60, who killed two cab drivers in 1979, was executed in the state's first lethal injection and first execution in 21 years. Amid two lawsuits from drug companies to stay the execution, Moore had told his lawyers he wanted to be executed. Fentanyl is a powerful narcotic drug at the heart of the US opioid crisis. According to the Omaha World-Herald newspaper, the state used an untried drug cocktail of diazepam, fentanyl, cisatracurium and potassium chloride to execute Moore. How US death penalty capital changed its mind Judge delays Nevada's opioid execution Why opioids are such an American problem Moore was convicted of killing cab drivers Reuel Van Ness and Maynard Helgeland in August 1979. Both men were 47-year-old Korean war veterans. He was pronounced dead approximately 23 minutes after the drugs were administered,the Washington Post reported,external. German pharmaceutical company Fresenius Kabi attempted to halt the execution with a federal lawsuit filed last week. The suit alleged that Nebraska had not legally obtained the potassium chloride, meant to stop Moore's heart, and the cisatracurium besylate, a muscle paralytic. State officials denied the allegations. In a court filing viewed by the Post, the Nebraska Attorney General's office said:  ""The people of Nebraska have chosen by a wide margin to retain capital punishment for Moore's crimes. ""Their government is prepared to carry out Moore's sentence and possesses the constitutional, lawfully-acquired means of doing so."" A federal judge rejected Fresenius Kabi's request to block the use of its drugs, and a circuit court denied an appeal. Another pharmaceutical company, Sandoz, requested last week that Nebraska reveal who made the drugs it would use to execute Moore. But a judge ruled he would not decide on the case until after the execution. Just three years ago, Nebraska had abolished the death penalty. A year later, it was restored after 60% of voters supported it. Nebraska is not the first state to consider using fentanyl in an execution - particularly as drug companies continue to resist their products being used for death sentences. In July,Nevada was set to use fentanylin a lethal injection until a lawsuit stalled the execution amid claims that the state illegitimately obtained one of the drugs it planned to use. Scott Frakes, director of Nebraska's Department of Correctional Services noted in an affidavit that lethal substances ""are difficult, if nearly impossible, to obtain"" in many death penalty states. This video can not be played ""My child died from it"": One mum on the prescription painkiller being taken to get a high But so far, the legal questions have not involved fentanyl, the opioid at the centre of America's opioid epidemic. In the US, it is approved as an anaesthetic and for pain relief, but because of its high profit margin for traffickers, it has become a large part of the US opioid crisis. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported that between 2015 and 2016, the rate of drug overdose deaths in the US involving synthetic opioids such as fentanyl had doubled. ""There's no particular reason why one would use fentanyl,"" said Robert Dunham, executive director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. ""No one has used it before, and we've had hundreds and hundreds of executions by injection. That suggests that the state is using fentanyl because it can get its hands on it,"" he told the Washington Post. According to theOmaha World-Herald,external, Nebraska has 11 remaining prisoners on death row. Before Moore, Nebraska's last execution was in 1997, using the electric chair.
