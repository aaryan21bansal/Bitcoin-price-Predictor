Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb in May 2017. Abedi's contacts were linked to al-Qaeda and ISIL, the inquiry was told. But there was no intelligence indicating he was planning an attack or posed a risk to national security, the legal team for the Home Office said. The inquiry, scheduled to last into next spring, is looking at events before, during and after the attack including the radicalisation of Abedi and what the security services knew about him. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? Delivering an opening statement on behalf of the Home Office and MI5, Cathryn McGahey QC said there were missed opportunities to investigate Abedi more closely in the months before the attack. But she said: ""MI5 did not identify any points where a different course of action would have been likely to lead to a different outcome."" Most evidence relating to MI5 will be heard in secret at the inquiry for ""national security"" reasons, but some new facts did emerge in the Security Service's opening statement, raising serious questions about both its judgement and internal processes. When MI5 closed its investigation into Abedi he was deemed so low risk he was not even referred to the counter extremism scheme Prevent, which receives thousands of referrals each year. MI5 linked Abedi to at least six people it was actively investigating. He was linked to two of these people in the early months of 2017 - precisely when the attack was being prepared. Information that did result in him being considered for further investigation was received in mid-2016, but did not generate a response from an internal ""priority indicator"" until 3 March 2017. It then took until 8 May to decide whether to have a further meeting - by which time he was in Libya - but it was not scheduled until 31 May. MI5 today admitted a ""missed opportunity"" for failing to request that Abedi be stopped when re-entering the UK, which he did five days before the attack itself on 22 May that year. Ms McGahey said despite Abedi coming to the attention of MI5 several times in the years before the bombing, ""there was no intelligence to indicate that he was engaged in attack planning or otherwise posed a risk to national security"". At the time of the attack, Abedi had been identified ""for further low-level investigation to identify whether he had re-engaged in Islamist extremist activity,"" she said. Ms McGahey said MI5 admitted it received intelligence on Abedi on two occasions in months before the attack. ""In retrospect this intelligence was highly relevant to the planned attack but the significance of it was not fully appreciated at the time,"" she said. Cathryn McGahey QC said at the time of the attack Abedi had been identified ""for further low-level investigation"" She told the inquiry at Manchester Magistrates' Court that MI5 cannot provide more details about this in an open hearing. ""There is no question of secrecy being used to conceal failure"", she said. ""MI5 has nothing to hide from this inquiry."" Ms McGahey said MI5 had provided unfettered access to the inquiry and information has been withheld from core participants only when necessary to protect national security. Earlier on Wednesday, Andrew Warnock QC, speaking for Greater Manchester Fire & Rescue Service (GMFRS), apologised for its inadequate and inefficient initial response. He told the public inquiry: ""It is unacceptable that it took over two hours for the fire and rescue service to arrive at the arena. ""We would like to say to the families and victims that we are sorry that this happened."" Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

"This video can not be played Odds of redundancy ""very frightening"" The countdown to the end of the furlough financial lifeline has begun, with employers facing increased costs amid a warning that millions of jobs now hang in the balance. From Thursday, the government's contribution to furloughed workers' wages falls. It is also the deadline for some firms to issue redundancy notices before the furlough scheme ends on 31 October. The current scheme is being replaced by a less generous jobs support package. Labour claims that as a result of the government's ""flawed"" support, almost three million people working for small businesses are at risk of losing their jobs. New analysis from the party says that at the start of September an estimated 2.8 million workers in small and medium size firms (SMEs) were furloughed under the current Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS). Since then new Covid restrictions have been imposed that mean 133,055 SMEs - including in the hospitality and events sectors - cannot operate or are trading at reduced capacity, it says. More than a million SMEs are still suffering a fall in turnover, with about 310,000 making less than half the amount they did over the same period last year, the analysis claims. Changes coming into effect on Thursday,along with other cost increases for employers, were announced in July.,external The government's contribution towards furlough wages is dropping from 70% to 60%, up to a cap of Â£1,875 a month. And employers have to pay a minimum of 20% of wages, bringing monthly earnings to at least 80% of salary. How is furlough changing? Sunak defends emergency jobs scheme 'We have next to no income. There is no help for us' In August, employers were required to meet the cost of pension contributions and National Insurance for employees placed on the scheme. There are also fears that the winding down of the furlough scheme could trigger a new wave of redundancies. Thursday is the deadline for employers to issue redundancy notices if they are planning to lay off between 20 and 99 workers before the scheme ends. The replacement jobs support scheme shifts more of the financial burden away from the taxpayer and on to employers. But the aim is to subsidise staff to work reduced hours so that employers resist mass redundancies. Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned last week he could not save every firm and every job Critics say it will be more expensive to bring back furloughed workers. Sonia Hawkins, who runs Disco Equipment Hire, a music and lightening rental service for the entertainment industry, told the BBC the numbers just do not add up. She said: ""We have next to no income. We've got people on furlough. We would have to bring them back and pay them just to get a subsidy. It's nuts."" Employment lawyer Merrill April, from CM Murray, acknowledged that the new jobs support scheme would not make much financial sense for some employers. She told the BBC: ""One of the condition is that employees have to work 33% of their normal hours so, in short, employers will have to pay at least 55% of an employees usual wage where the employee only works 33% of their usual hours."" However, she said that many firms supported the new scheme and would not rush to cut jobs. Redundancy is expensive, she said, adding that many firms would want to retain people and skills for as long as possible. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was a critical time for employers, with its members facing cash flow difficulties ahead of what was likely to be a challenging winter. BCC co-executive director Claire Walker said further support may be needed. ""As the Jobs Support Scheme replaces the furlough scheme, and employers are asked to pay more towards staffing costs, the government must stand ready to offer further support to businesses who may be unable to cover their contribution due to continued restrictions and reduced demand."" Christmas and New Year celebrations are an important time for the hospitality industry Events manager Lisa, on furlough since March, was optimistic about returning to work over the next few weeks as Christmas festivities are always good for business. But the further restrictions on hospitality and imminent changes to the furlough scheme give Lisa's employer no incentive to bring her back, she told the BBC. ""Work has all but vanished since Covid. We have gone through a consultation period for redundancies.  I've just no idea what is going to happen,"" said Lisa, who did not want to disclose her surname nor employer for fear of saying anything to jeopardise future work. ""The latest jobs support scheme does nothing to help those of us on furlough. I have been brought back one day a week, but what is happening now gives my employer no incentive to give me more days,"" Lisa adds. She has asked her employer to take unpaid leave until March, but there has been no decision. ""I have a lot of experience and have been applying for other jobs. I have searched and searched for different jobs since March. But there's nothing."" ""I can understand what Mr Sunak is trying to do [to help the economy]. But it is so difficult for us. He doesn't seem to have done anything that will help people like me."" Read more:'We have next to no income. There is no help.' ChancellorRishi Sunak's latest support measures announced this monthhave nevertheless received significant support, and were broadly welcomed by the CBI employers' group and union leaders at the TUC. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) singled out for praise the pay-as-you-go scheme that allows firms more time to repay loans, saying it should give confidence to invest and hire. Business leaders also welcomed new tax cuts and deferrals. However, FSB chairman Mike Cherry said: ""It's important to remember that small firms have already spent thousands on putting safety measures in place but received no funding to support their efforts to do the right thing."" The women who started businesses in lockdown Plea not to axe Â£20 a week benefits âlifelineâ New job support plans 'leave nightclubs behind' And Mr Cherry remains worried about the plight of the newly-self employed and company directors, who he said have received no income support whatsoever. He told the BBC: ""We are concerned that the chancellor had said nothing on support for those who were left out of the first round of support measures. The government urgently needs to come forward with an emergency relief package for these groups which have dutifully paid their taxes and deserve help too."" Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the government had a ""sink or swim"" mentality. ""Millions of jobs are at risk because he's forcing small businesses to choose which staff to keep and which to fire. These are viable businesses that just need support to cope with the restrictions the government has imposed on them."" Anneliese Dodds said viable businesses are going to the wall She said the chancellor's job support changes were ""pulling up the drawbridge at the worst possible time"". A Treasury spokesman said the support has reached, and continue to reach, millions of firms and people - citing loan schemes, VAT deferrals, business rates holidays, bans of tenant evictions, and sick pay rebates. ""The [new] Job Support Scheme is designed to protect jobs in businesses facing lower demand over the winter due to Covid, and is just one form of support on offer to employers during this difficult period. ""We're also continuing to innovate in supporting incomes and employment through our Plan for Jobs announced in July, helping employees get back to work through a Â£1,000 retention bonus and creating new roles for young people with our Kickstart scheme,"" he said.

"Google's hardware chief has said its new flagship smartphone was designed to go on sale during an economic downturn. As a result, the Pixel 5 has abandoned some of its predecessor's headline features and runs on a slower chip in order to be sold at a lower price. However, it does gain 5G connectivity and some new photography capabilities. Experts say it will face tough competition from other mid-range Android handsets, but the included bundle of Google services could help. ""To not bring to market a true flagship demonstrates Google is now thinking about the market in a very different way than it was last year,"" commented Ben Stanton from the tech consultancy Canalys. ""And on a price-specs basis alone, Google will probably lose to Samsung and Chinese competitors. ""Its key selling point, however, remains that it offers a stock Android experience with superfast updates."" This is a reference to the fact that many other Android device-makers layer their own proprietary user interfaces on top of Google's operating system, and typically take longer to offer software updates. The Pixel 5 will cost $699/Â£599, and has a 6in (15.2cm) display and 128 gigabytes of storage. That compares to the $999/Â£929 price of last year's top-end 6.3in Pixel 4XL. Google also unveiled a 5G-enabled version of its existing Pixel 4a, which will cost Â£499. Smartphone designs are typically locked in place many months before the products go on sale, in order to secure the required components and carry out tests. Google's senior vice president of devices and services acknowledged that the Pixel 5's features had been decided upon before the coronavirus pandemic began. But he said a deliberate choice had been taken to offer a 5G-capable phone at ""an affordable price"". The Pixel 5 can wirelessly charge some accessories placed on its back ""What the world doesn't seem like it needs right now is another $1,000 phone,"" said Rick Osterloh. ""Obviously nobody anticipated the pandemic, but we actually did think that the world was possibly headed for an economic downturn... and it only further emphasised our point of view that this is the right thing."" Tech jettisoned from the Pixel 4 includes the Soli radar chip, which Google had taken five years to develop. It automatically turned on the older phone's screen when its owner approached and allowed gesture controls. Last year's face-unlock sensors have also been ditched, with a return to the Pixel 3's fingerprint sensor on the back of the Pixel 5. ""These technologies will be used in the future, but they're very expensive,"" Mr Osterloh said. The Pixel 5's Snapdragon 765G chip is also rated as beingslower and having lower graphics-processing performance,externalthan last year's Snapdragon 855, although Mr Osterloh said he did not believe consumers would notice. Mr Osterloh has been Google's hardware chief since 2016 The device does benefit from some improvements, including being able to produce a shallow-focus effect in ""super low-light conditions"". One of its rear cameras now has a wider angle lens than before. And there are a choice of new video stabilisation modes. In addition, the RAM memory has been boosted to 8GB, which should help the phone switch from task-to-task more quickly. And Google is bundling some of its subscription services including three months of its games-streaming platform Stadia and 100 gigabytes of online storage. ""Bundling three months of Stadia Pro cloud gaming with 5G Pixel phones is smart, because gamers benefit in particular from the 5G experience,"" commented Ian Fogg from OpenSignal. ""But cloud gaming is still 'early' tech for mobile."" Google hopes the phone will help attract more users to its cloud gaming service Stadia The Pixel 5's competition will includeSamsung's Galaxy S20FE and the forthcoming OnePlus 8T,external- which are also being targeted at the ""mid-market"". Google shipped 4.6 million Pixel smartphones over the 12 months leading up to July 2020, according to research firm IDC. That marked a 37% drop over the same period a year earlier. However, a wider fall in demand for smartphones meant the brand still rose from being ranked 16th to 12th in terms of market share for the final quarter of each period. Other products unveiled at Google's virtual event included Nest Audio - a redesigned version of its Google Home smart speaker, which now promises more bass and louder volumes. The Google Nest Audio is covered in a fabric made out of recycled material Google is the second best-selling smart speaker brand in Western markets. But it is still forecast to sell about a third of the number of Amazon's Echo speakers in the UK this year, according to research firm eMarketer. Google also showed off a new version of its television-streaming dongle, which is now called Chromecast with Google TV. Unlike its predecessors, the device comes with its own remote control, which allows users to control their TV and soundbar via its buttons or voice commands as an alternative to using a smartphone app. The latest Chromecast dongle now comes with its own remote It also brings together movies and TV shows from the various apps each user subscribes to in order to make its own recommendations. The Apple TV set-top box and Amazon's latest Fire TV stick both offer similar functions.

"Some people without online access still use red button services, via their TV remote control The BBC has reversed its decision to bring an end to its Red Button TV text services. The corporation had planned to remove the service due to ""financial pressure"". However, following a campaign on behalf of people with disabilities, the elderly and those without online access, it has suspended the plan. Basic key news services will now remain, although the platform will be reduced from next year. In November 2019, the BBC announced its intention to remove the text and data element of the red button service. But in January, the corporation halted the planned closure, in order to learn about the potential impact on certain parts of its audience. BBC suspends Red Button text switch-off BBC red button protest ahead of switch-off ""Since then, we have been in contact and had extensive dialogue with a wide range of representative groups to build on our existing research into what elements of the service are most used and valued by different groups,"" wrote Dan Taylor-Watt, director of product for BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds,in a BBC blog. The BBC has hit the back button on its red button decision ""We have listened to this feedback - and I'm pleased to let you know that we have found a way to keep the most valued text and data elements of the red button service."" ""I would like to thank everyone who has got in touch to let us know what they value about the red button text service - and hope you continue enjoying using it,"" he added. Local, national and international news will now remain on the red button, along with the sports news headlines, fixtures and results; and weather forecast. Yet from mid-2021, features like the lottery results and in-depth sport stories, for example, will no longer feature. It's as the BBC aims to ""reduce cost and complexity elsewhere"", Taylor-Watt continued. BBC 'needs to make Â£125m savings this year' Red Button video streams though, for the likes of Wimbledon and Glastonbury, will remain in place.

"The man's lawyers told the High Court his parents ""nurtured his dependency"" A 41-year-old man has failed in a legal bid to force his wealthy parents to continue financially supporting him. A qualified solicitor with mental health disabilities, the man said his parents ""nurtured his dependency"" on them but reduced support as his relationship with them deteriorated. His lawyers said the judge had powers to order parents to provide support based on laws relating to marriage and children. But the judge ruled he had ""no case"". Sir James Munby said in a ruling following a remote family court hearing thatthe claim was ""most unusual"" and as far as he knew ""unprecedented"",external. Neither of the parties was named, but the judge said the man lived in London and his parents in Dubai. Although the man has a degree in modern history, is a qualified solicitor and has a master's degree in taxation, Sir James said he has ""various difficulties and mental health disabilities"" and has been unemployed since 2011. His parents have supported him, allowing him to live in a flat in central London that they own, and until recently paying the utility bills. But the judge said: ""The relationship between the applicant and his parents, in particular, it would appear, his father, has deteriorated and the financial support they are prepared to offer has significantly reduced."" The case appeared to be ""unprecedented"", Sir James Munby said The man's lawyer, Tim Amos, said his parents are ""very wealthy"" and could comfortably pay any support the court might reasonably order. Mr Amos characterised the parents as having ""nurtured his dependency on them for the last 20 years or so"" and now ""seek to cast that dependency onto the state"". Lawyers for the parents disputed this account. Sir James dismissed the case on legal grounds, saying the court had no jurisdiction to grant his claims under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, the Children Act 1989, or under human rights law. The man's lawyer had argued that the provisions in these laws allowing the court to order payments to support young children could also apply to adult children - if they were undergoing education and training, or if they had special circumstances such as a disability. But the judge pointed out that these provisions only applied when a court order for financial support has already been made when the child is young, and when the parents are not living with each other - which was not the case for this man. He said the law was clear that an adult child ""should not be able to take his parents to court to obtain finance"". The judge refused permission to appeal.

"This video can not be played Watch: Everton beat Birmingham 3-0 to reach Women's FA Cup final - highlights Everton produced another strong performance and continued their winning run by overcoming Birmingham City to reach the Women's FA Cup final. Northern Ireland forward Simone Magill lashed in just before half-time and Denmark's Nicoline Sorensen doubled the visitors' lead after the break. France striker Valerie Gauvin added a third late on for the dominant Toffees. Everton will face either holders Manchester City or 14-time winners Arsenal at Wembley on 1 November. The Merseyside club, who have won the cup twice, deservedly reached their first final since 2014 as they bid to lift the trophy for the first time since 2010. Birmingham, who won the cup in 2012 and had hoped to reach their third final, appeared low on energy after battling past Brighton on penalties after extra time on Sunday and rarely looked likely to mount a comeback in the second half. Relive Everton's win as it happened For Willie Kirk's Everton, Wednesday's victory was their fourth in four games since elite English women's football resumed action earlier in September. His side impressed once again, after a summer of eye-catching recruitment including the acquisition of France's Gauvin, who netted her third goal in four substitute appearances for the club. The Toffees had stunned league champions Chelsea with a 2-1 win in Sunday's quarter-final and will quietly fancy their chances of pulling off another upset in the final. Fit-again England midfielder Izzy Christiansen produced another fine display and neatly set up the opening goal with a through-ball for Magill to powerfully fire home. Northern Ireland forward Simone Magill's goal was her fourth in five games for club and country Norway right-back Ingrid Moe Wold then crossed perfectly for another summer signing in Sorensen to add the second from close range. This was her first goal since signing from Danish side Brondby. The hosts, who have a contrastingly thin squad and were only able to name five substitutes, were playing under new boss Carla Ward and will know their biggest task this season will be to stay in the Women's Super League. This Birmingham side were scarcely recognisable from the squad who reached the 2017 final with the likes of stars such as England striker Ellen White. It comes after consecutive summers which have seen large numbers of players leave the West Midlands while WSL sides backed by men's Premier League clubs have increased their investment. Thursday's second semi-final will be a meeting of two of the biggest spenders, as two-time winners Man City host a Gunners side who are bidding to extend their record of 14 FA Cup triumphs. The final on 1 November comes after the Football Association opted to complete the 2019-20 cup competition following the the start of the new league campaign. This is because of the postponement of the original quarter-final dates on 15 March because of coronavirus. Birmingham City manager Carla Ward told BBC Four: ""I think the way we've performed in the last few weeks and particularly in the quarter-final was exceptional, but from minute one tonight we looked flat. ""We looked tired and, I just said to them, the fact we're all so disappointed says how far we've come in that time. ""But I don't think we gave a good account of ourselves."" Everton midfielder Izzy Christiansen: ""There was so much belief coming off the back of our win against Chelsea. We had a very quick turnaround but the way we've recovered, applied ourselves in training and adapted to a new game plan - I think we were the stronger side on the day. ""We're all delighted, it's been a collective effort. ""When I signed for Everton in January the first objective was to get to Wembley. There's obviously a big, fat tick next to that now.""

"This video can not be played Police described video of the incident which shows a figure approach the officers' car, before opening fire Investigators in Los Angeles have charged a man with the attempted murder of two police officers who were shot as they sat in their patrol car. Deonte Lee Murray, 36, was already in custody for unrelated carjacking charges, prosecutors said. At a court appearance on Wednesday he pleaded not guilty to the charges in both cases, AP News reported. Widely shared video of the shooting showed a figure approach the police car, open fire and then run away. The officers were seriously injured but have since been released from hospital. Footage of the 12 September attack, described by police as an ambush, caused a national outcry and both candidates in the presidential race - President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden - called for the perpetrator to be severely dealt with. In a statement, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said Deonte Lee Murray had been charged with two counts of attempted murder and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He had been in custody since his arrest on 15 September for the carjacking charges, the statement said. Following Wednesday's court appearance, Mr Murray was remanded in prison with bail set at $6.15m (Â£4.7m) and is due back in court in November. Police guarded the hospital where the wounded officers were taken Prosecutors have not suggested a possible motive for the shooting of the officers, which happened in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton. They were not named but were described as a 31-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man. The female officer was shot in the jaw and arms while the male officer was hit in the forehead, an arm and a hand. It later emerged that, despite her injuries, the female deputy helped her partner to safety and applied a tourniquet to his wounded arm. With law and order a key issue in next month's presidential election, both candidates strongly condemned the attack at the time. President Donald Trump shared footage of the incident and tweeted: ""Animals that must be hit hard."" Mr Biden, meanwhile, said that the ""cold-blooded"" shooting was unconscionable and ""the perpetrator must be brought to justice"".

"Online grocer Ocado has overtaken Tesco in terms of stock market value as investors continue to bet on the firm. Ocado is now valued at Â£21.7bn, more than Tesco's Â£21.1bn, despite having only a fraction of the UK grocery market share. Analysts said a rise in online food shopping, plus Ocado's new tie up with Marks & Spencer, had encouraged investors. However, question marks remain as to whether Ocado is over-valued. According to analyst firm Kantar, Ocado has only 1.7% of the UK grocery market, compared with Tesco's 26.8% share - which far outstrips its nearest competitors, Sainsbury's and Asda. Ocado was launched 20 years ago but in most of those years struggled to make money. Ocado's share price, which had been healthy after striking a number of big deals with overseas grocery businesses, began to climb quite quickly after the UK coronavirus lockdown in March. A former Tesco chief executive once described the firm as a ""charity"" because of the losses it had racked up in its early years. The business started to flourish in 2017 after cutting deals with US group Kroger, Casino in France, Sobeys in Canada, and ICA Group in Sweden. It then signed a partnership agreement with Coles in Australia. Its stock market valuation has largely been driven by how investors view its technology, which provides retailers with the infrastructure and software to build their online service and compete with giants such as Amazon. That valuation picked up speed after the coronavirus crisis really started to bite in the UK and elsewhere in March as lockdown boosted demand for online groceries. Ocado's share price got a further boost recently after its switch to delivering M&S food and after it reported a 50% jump in third quarter sales. Ocado says M&S switchover 'successful' after rocky start Ocado halts staff deliveries temporarily amid order backlog This was despite some customers criticising Ocado when it launched its M&S range, saying orders made weeks earlier had been cancelled at the last minute. The retailer also halted orders from its staff as it tried to clear an order backlog. Despite its popularity with investors, Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, questioned its market valuation. ""Ocado holds enormous promise but whether it can deliver is quite another matter, the cash burn remains and the payback from all these overseas deals is taking a very long time,"" he said. One of the reasons for Ocado's valuation is the expected revenue from its overseas deals, but these ""have been slow to materialise"", he said. While Ocado's share price ""has rocketed this year thanks to the boom in online retail"", one of the problems for Ocado is that ""setting up fulfilment centres costs a lot and the returns are slow,"" Mr Wilson said. He added that ""investors put an enormous premium on growth so are prepared to pay a lot for any company that has a strong growth profile."" Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said the coronavirus pandemic had aided the firm: ""Where there is crisis, there is opportunity. These words have never been truer for logistics businesses at the moment, which is one of the reasons that Ocado appeals to investors."" However, she said the challenge for the business is now to retain the growth it has seen since the Covid-19 outbreak. ""There is an elephant in the room with Amazon, which could strike this sector hard with innovation through technology at any point,"" she said. ""This is a fact that must play on the mind of chief executive, Tim Steiner, and should make sure that he doesn't become complacent,"" Ms Palmer added. Amazon,which launched an online supermarket service in the UK in 2016,has been making further moves into selling groceries. These include a partnership with Morrisons, which said on Tuesday it would be taking on 1,000 permanent staff for its services on Amazon.

"Footage shared on social media showed a large group celebrating in a common room Up to 200 people gathered for a party at a university student hall, flouting coronavirus restrictions. Police said officers had attended accommodation at Coventry University in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Officers have worked with the management of Arundel House to close some communal areas and increase security, West Midlands Police said. The university is ""deeply concerned"" over a video of the party and condemned the ""blatant breaches"" of rules. Footage from private accommodation on Whitefriars Lane emerged on social media showing a large group of people who were apparently not adhering to social distancing rules. Current government guidance states only groups of six people or fewer are allowed to meet and students have been told they must limit socialising, staying within separate ""households"" and be taught in managed groups. The university said it ""strongly condemns the blatant breaches of the rule of six and other guidelines as they risk the health of our students, colleagues and the communities in which we are located"". Coventry University ""strongly condemned"" footage showing a party in a common room at a hall of residence Ian Dunn, the university's Provost, described the footage as ""outrageous and deeply unfair"". He told the BBC the university was taking the incident ""very seriously"" and he was confident its code of conduct had been breached. The university said most of its students were behaving ""so responsibly"" West Midlands Police said it would be examining CCTV and would take action if it came to light it had been a planned party. The university's vice-chancellor Prof John Latham said many students were ""not very happy with their peers"". ""We do know that some of the individuals involved in the party were students of the university, we know that many of them were also not students of the university,"" he added. Mr Latham said the university was working with the police on their investigation, and running its own investigation, to find the individuals involved. He added it would be enacting its disciplinary process to look at possible suspensions or expulsions. Universities: No parties and more online learning Being a fresher during Covid-19 Latest news and updates from the West Midlands The president of the National Union of Students Larissa Kennedy said the union was encouraging students to follow public health guidance, but more needed to be done to support them. ""What I think we're seeing is students in really vulnerable situations where they're often isolated, being encouraged to have no human contact, and this is a really difficult time,"" she said. ""So where there isn't the right kind of resources in place, a minority may be resorting to breaking the rules."" Police said officers were examining CCTV of the gathering and ""will take action if evidence comes to light that this was a planned party"". Nido, which runs the hall, said it had restricted visitors to the building and stepped up security following the gathering. ""We do not want the actions of a few to affect the experience of many,"" a spokesperson said. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?

"Boris Johnson has led a briefing, as latest UK coronavirus figures showed a further 7,108 cases and another 71 deaths The UK PM says his government ""will not hesitate"" to put further measures in place if needs be UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says wherever possible MPs will get a vote on Covid-19 regulations The number of new UK Covid-19 cases tops 7,000 for a second consecutive day Germany has announced measures to limit the size of gatherings and fine those who break tracking rules The world has seen more than 33.6m coronavirus cases and 1m deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Paul Gribben Many thanks for joining us today on our live page. It has been written by: Ashitha Nagesh, Paul Seddon, Penny Spiller, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Katie Wright. The editors were Helier Cheung and Paul Gribben. We will be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly. But before we do, here's a look back at the main headlines of the day.  As cases rise again across the world, doctors are sounding the alarm about working conditions in their hospitals. Hundreds of junior doctors are protesting in Barcelona, Spain, saying that their working hours are now twice as long as what's stated in their contracts, but their pay is low. Similar protests are being held on the other side of the globe in Lima, Peru, where more than 9,000 healthcare workers are staging a 48-hour walkout to demand higher pay and better conditions. The doctors' union in Peru says the government hasn't kept its promises to increase salaries or pay bonuses during the pandemic. In Barcelona, doctors lay on the ground in their scrubs They maintained social distancing at the protest at the Plaza de Espana In Lima, Peru, doctors say the government hasn't kept its promises to healthcare workers More than 9,000 healthcare workers are protesting in Lima It has been confirmed that more than 170 cases of coronavirus have been linked to a West Cornwall meat plant. Cornwall Council said its public health team was alerted to a single case of possible coronavirus at the Pilgrim's Pride food factory, via the NHS Test and Trace service. Nearly 500 workers at the site in Pool were tested - with more than 170 of them testing positive. The council says most of those were not displaying any symptoms, but they, and any close contacts, are all now isolating in line with government guidelines, A representative from Pilgrimâs Pride Ltd said they were the first positive cases experienced at their site, it has worked closely with authorities and is continuing to follow government guidelines. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent There were no big announcements in the briefing but several stark reminders about the spread of coronavirus in the UK. On more than one occasion, the scientists flanking the prime minister said things were ""heading in the wrong direction"". Boris Johnson again warned the UK was at ""a critical moment"". This was an attempt to reinforce the message that people need to stick to the rules - and a reminder that if things get worse, there could be more restrictions, even another national lockdown, to come. Everything rests on how far and how fast the virus spreads - both the level of disruption we'll continue to see in our daily lives and the relative success, or failure, of the government's response. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech government has declared a new state of emergency, which comes into effect next Monday. Health Minister Roman Prymula told parliament that the rate of infection in the country was ""among the worst in the world"", and that urgent action was needed to prevent a crisis in hospitals. The state of emergency will, among other things, allow officials to draft in final year medical students to help out in hospitals, and to swiftly introduce new restrictions - such as moving all secondary school lessons online, introducing a cap of six people per party in restaurants, and limiting all events - with exceptions for ballet and theatre - to 10 people indoors and 20 outdoors. The state of emergency will be in place for 30 days. Parliament will then have to approve an extension. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is now clear the second wave is here. Infections,
hospital cases and deaths are all rising. But what happens next is the big unknown. The doomsday scenario of a doubling of cases every week that
was put forward last week is not materialising. The increase in hospital admissions is even more gradual â
and the total numbers being admitted are more than 10 times lower than they
were at the peak. It points to a slower, less severe wave this time round. But it is still early days. We are just at the start of the autumn and winter period
when respiratory viruses circulate more. The situation could easily unravel. However, the UK, like other countries, is in a much stronger
position than we were when we literally walked blind into the first wave. Better treatments are in place, social distancing has become
routine and â despite the problems â there is much more testing available. The odds are certainly stacked in our favour more than they
were six months ago. Read more analysishere. South Africa is reopening its borders to all African countries from Thursday, although tourists from 50 places deemed to be high-risk - including the UK, the US, India, France and Russia - will be banned. The country closed its borders at the start of its national lockdown - one of the strictest in the world - on 27 March. Although restrictions on movement and business started to be eased from June, borders stayed shut to avoid cases of the virus coming in from abroad. Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor says the reopening of borders will be done ""gradually"". For now, although anyone from African countries is allowed, she says ""only business travellers with scarce and critical skills, diplomats, investors and professional sports people coming for events from the high-risk countries will be permitted into the country"". Those who can travel will have to show evidence of a negative coronavirus test taken fewer than 72 hours before departure. They will also be screened upon arrival, and will need to install a Covid-19 tracing app on their phones. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, responding to the briefing, said the number of cases was ""very concerning"". He said: ""I think everybody can see that and we've all got a duty to follow the government rules, and that's very clear that we stick to that. ""There's got to be - if you like - a national effort to prevent a second lockdown. ""But the government's side of the bargain here is to have a very clear strategy for keeping that infection rate down and we don't see that strategy. ""Very clear communications, and the byword for this week has been, yet again, confusion. ""And test, trace and isolate needs to be fixed urgently."" Lauren MossHealth correspondent, BBC News ""This whole briefing felt very much like a warning,"" says BBC health correspondent Lauren Moss, who notes that more than once, the scientific advisers said we were headed ""in the wrong direction"". She says: ""Prime Minister Boris Johnson said we may be seeing more of these briefings - a bit like we did when there were daily briefings. ""We are not at that point yet, but this is the second one in a week where we have seen the chief scientific officer and the chief medical officer."" While we are not in the same position we were in April or May, hospital admissions are on the rise - with cases rising especially in some areas of the country. But even though certain areas are seeing an increase in cases more than others, it is a national issue, she adds.   Here are the key points from this afternoonâs
press conference in Downing Street: Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson says
the government has over32 billion items of personal protective equipment(PPE) on orderand is building up a four-month stockpile of masks, gowns and
visors. He
also said that - by December - the government expects UK manufacturers to meet
70% of demand for PPE. These
figures come from theDepartment for Health and Social Care's PPE Strategy,external, published yesterday. The
document says that the government has already distributed 3.5 billion items of
PPE, so almost ten times that amount are now on order. Quoting a recent study during the briefing just ended, a journalist from the Times said only a low proportion of people are self-isolating after testing positive. Sir
Patrick Vallance said it was ""very, very important"" that people self-isolate, adding that if they don't it will increase circulation of the virus. He said the study quoted was about ""intent to self-isolate"" from a few months ago, and he believed that more recent data is better. He said isolation was not something that could be ""literally"" enforced upon people, and people have to take accountability. Boris Johnson is asked why it is someone in the North East can't see their parents outside - but they can see five friends in a pub beer garden. He says there are national and local rules and that people will pick upon discrepancies and complexities - but that they should check the guidance online and also use their own common sense. This means they should follow the basics of restricting the possibility of transmission to someone else. The PM also says it is ""vital"" to stress that tackling the pandemic remains a national effort and that ""we all have to fight it together"". ""We can't expect it to be solved"" in the areas under regional lockdowns, he adds, saying ""it's down to all of us"". That was the last question of the briefing - but we will continue to bring you more reaction on it here. Boris Johnson was asked about the number of people not wearing masks on public transport. He urges people to ""please follow the guidance"" and to bear in mind you are not just protecting your neighbour, but you also need to bear in mind that your loved ones could be infected. Fines are now ""considerable"" and ""they will be imposed"", he adds. She also asked if there were concerns the government was not going far, or fast enough. Sir Patrick Vallance said it was ""very clear"" rates are still going up and that ""we don't have this under control"". But he adds that the decisions that need to be made are ""clearly very difficult"" and ""none are risk free"" He says science can provide advice, but ministers need to make decisions. Also in response to Robert Peston, chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance says there is no room for complacency at all right now and that the situation is headed ""in the wrong direction"". He adds: ""This virus spreads because of close contacts in certain environments. We all need to make sure we reduce the number of contacts we have got."" He says it is ""going to be absolutely critical"" that people self-isolate if they have symptoms. Robert Peston from ITV asks why it is that infections seem to be rising more quickly in Scotland rather than in England - and in parts of northern England rather than the south. He also points out daily deaths are now at 71, the same number they were in March, two days before the nation went into lockdown. Boris Johnson says it's possible there is a difference now ""in the way the disease is expressing itself"" in the country. It is clear, he adds, that local peaks are being seen. It might be the case it is a ""more localised phenomenon this time around"" which is why it is a good idea to focus on local solutions. Prof Chris Whitty says that earlier in the pandemic, the UK was an outlier in having an epidemic that was ""almost uniform"" in shape across the country. It is possible that there will be more concentrated areas in the next stage of the pandemic. He stresses there is a ""long winter ahead"" and that ""a lot can happen in that time"". But if everyone works together and follows the guidance, ""we can contain it in those areas"". In the first wave, the speed of cases doubling was underestimated, he adds. Pressure on the NHS could happen ""sooner rather than later"" in parts of northern England, he adds.  The PM is asked if the government has a threshold above which it will replace local restrictions with nation-wide measures. Boris Johnson does not answer specifically, but says all data is kept under ""constant review"". Asked about differences in approach in the different UK nations, Prof
Chris Whitty says measures have had to bear in mind ""local traditions"" - but says similarities are often downplayed. Boris Johnson is asked what the chance is that the government will introduce further restrictions. In reply, the PM says the country has shown that the virus can be suppressed through observing the strict lockdown earlier this year. But he adds it is ""too early to tell"" what effect the latest measures will have on the transmission figures. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The dames are worried about the future of the UK's theatre industry Dozens of pantomime dames have marched on Westminster, as part of a day of action highlighting the plight of the live events industry. The parade was organised after the rise in coronavirus cases prompted the cancellation of the 2020 panto season. The impact ""will ripple through the entire theatre industry for a generation,"" said actor Gary Bridgens. Organisers are calling for an extension to the government's furlough scheme for theatre workers. ""If the Government don't support theatre in its hour of need, there won't be any - or worse, it will all need rebuilding after this disaster,"" said Mr Bridgens, who normally performs in pantomime, under the stage name Gacko, every year. The protest in London coincided with a day of global events reflecting the issues facing the live event industry. Under the slogan ""red alert"", the #WeMakeEvents campaign will see venues in 25 countries bathed in red light, to draw attention to the continued uncertainty over when concerts and shows can resume; and the precarious position actors, musicians and crew find themselves in. Pre-empting Wednesday's day of action, hundreds of people who normally work at concerts, festivals and theatres gathered in Parliament Square on Tuesday to hold a 30 minute silent protest at the government's handling of the situation.

While venues have been allowed to reopen with social distancing measures in place, there are scarcely any plays or concerts taking place compared with the start of 2020. Some musicians havealready started cancelling,externalshows planned for 2021 - and that has a knock-on effect on crew and support staff. ""We're aware of around 6,000 redundancies at the moment, but I think that's just the tip of the iceberg because also many people have been laid off,"" said Philippa Childs of the entertainment workers union, Bectu. The #WeMakeEventscampaign is calling for the introduction of a government-backed insurance scheme, which would ensure that organisers can recover costs if concerts are cancelled due to a local lockdown. The music venues opening despite the pandemic Elton John: 'It's vital that venues stay open' 'The rug can be pulled any time,' say indie stars Organisers also want government support for a Covid-19 testing scheme at venues; and a three-year extension on the reduced VAT rate on tickets. In common with the ""Panto Parade"", they are also calling for a job support scheme that is specifically tailored to the live events industry. The campaign has won the support of Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis, who said ""tens of thousands"" of people who work in the industry were currently out of work, with many receiving no financial support. ""We are part of a UK creative industry which contributes over Â£100 billion to the economy each year and which puts this country on the map,""she wrote in a statement which was published on social media,external. ""But as it stands, there is no sign of the live events industry returning in the coming months. We are an industry in crisis. ""If we don't speak up, many theatre companies, venues, promoters, artists and crew could struggle to such an extent that this industry is simply never able to return to the incredible force it was before this pandemic struck."" Although the government announceda Â£1.57 billion rescue package for the arts in July, it is going principally to museums, galleries and venues, rather than individuals. Many of those who work in the sector have not been covered by either the self-employed initiative or the furlough scheme. The government's new job support scheme, which was announced last week, also appears to exclude arts organisations. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the scheme would target ""viable jobs which provide genuine security"". The #WeMakeEvents campaign estimates that the live event industry is currently operating at between 1-5% of normal capacity, ruling it out of contention. ""Our furlough ends next month and we don't know when we're going to go back to work because apparently we're unviable,"" said Zoe Gale, a wigs, hair and make-up artist who has worked on West End productions of Hamilton, Dirty Dancing and Motown: The Musical. ""There's no support."" Last week, the Musicians' Union said one third of its members were considering giving up their careers due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. A survey of 2,000 members found that 34% were ""considering abandoning the industry completely"", because of the financial difficulties they faced, while almost half had already found work outside the industry.

"The government has considered building an asylum processing centre on a remote UK territory in the Atlantic Ocean. The idea of ""offshoring"" people is being looked at but finding a suitable location would be key, a source said. Home Secretary Priti Patel asked officials to look at asylum policies which had been successful in other countries, the BBC has been told. The Financial Times says,externalAscension Island, more than 4,000 miles (6,000km) from the UK, was a suggested location. What happens to migrants who reach the UK? More migrants arrive in September than all of 2019 Fleeing the Syrian war for Belfast The Foreign Office is understood to have carried out an assessment for Ascension - which included the practicalities of transferring migrants thousands of miles to the island - and decided not to proceed. However, a Home Office source said ministers were looking at ""every option that can stop small boat crossings and fix the asylum system"". ""The UK has a long and proud history of offering refuge to those who need protection. Tens of thousands of people have rebuilt their lives in the UK and we will continue to provide safe and legal routes in the future. ""As ministers have said we are developing plans to reform policies and laws around illegal migration and asylum to ensure we are able to provide protection to those who need it, while preventing abuse of the system and the criminality associated with it."" No final decisions have been made. Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""This ludicrous idea is inhumane, completely impractical and wildly expensive - so it seems entirely plausible this Tory government came up with it."" Alan Nicholls, a member of the Ascension Island council, said moving asylum seekers more than 4,000 miles to the British overseas territory would be a ""logistical nightmare"" and not well received by the islanders. He also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the presence of military bases on the island could make the concept ""prohibitive"" due to security concerns. Australia hascontroversially used offshore processing and detention centres for asylum seekerssince the 1980s. A United Nations refugee agency representative to the UK, Rossella Pagliuchi-Lor, said the proposal would breach the UK's obligations to asylum seekers and would ""change what the UK is - its history and its values"". Speaking to the UK Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee, she said the Australian model had ""brought about huge suffering for people, who are guilty of no more than seeking asylum, and it has also cost huge amounts of money"". The volcanic island has no indigenous population, and the people that live there - fewer than 1,000 - are the employees and families of the organisations operating on the island The military airbase is jointly operated by the RAF and the US, and has been used as a staging post to supply and defend the Falkland Islands Its first human inhabitants arrived in 1815, when the Royal Navy set up camp to keep watch on Napoleon, who was imprisoned on the island of St Helena some 800 miles away It is home to a BBC transmitter - the BBC Atlantic Relay station - which sends shortwave radio to Africa and South America The proposal comes amid record numbers of migrants makingthe journey across the English Channel to the UK in small boats this month,which Ms Patel has vowed to stop. Laura Trott, Conservative MP for Sevenoaks in Kent, said it was ""absolutely right"" that the government was looking at offshore asylum centres to ""reduce the pressure"" on Kent, which was ""unable to take any more children into care"". In order to be eligible for asylum in the UK, applicants must prove they cannot return to their home country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender identity or sexual orientation. Asylum seekers cannot work while their claims are being processed, so the government offers them a daily allowance of just over Â£5 and accommodation, often in hostels or shared flats. Delays in processing UK asylum applications increased significantly last year with four out of five applicants in the last three months of 2019 waiting six months or more for their cases to be processed. That compared with three in four during the same period in 2018. More migrants arrive in September than all of 2019 How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?

"Lord Frost (left) and EU negotiator Michel Barnier Britain's car industry risks losing out even if there is a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, according to documents seen by the BBC. Car parts from Japan and Turkey used in the UK will not be treated as British, so some exports may see higher tariffs. In a letter, Britain's chief Brexit negotiator says the UK has failed so far to get the car parts deal it wants, and ""obviously cannot insist on it"". Having enough parts sourced within the UK and EU is key to a free trade deal. In a letter to the car industry, seen by the BBC, chief negotiator Lord Frost says one of their key priorities - that parts and components from Japan and Turkey count as British in any deal - has been rejected by the European Commission. This risks some UK automotive production attracting taxes on trade, known as tariffs, when exported to the EU, even if there is a ""zero tariff"" trade deal struck with the EU. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? A separate draft legal text, also obtained by the BBC, lists the UK's request for manufacturing of electric cars, batteries, and bicycles to be treated leniently, and count as British, even if the majority of components come from elsewhere. The letter says: ""I am sorry to say that so far they [EU negotiators] have neither been willing to discuss these nor share any proposed text with us"". Both documents refer to the need, even in a deal, for UK manufacturers to prove that UK-exported goods are actually British-made, with a specified threshold of British parts, expected to be around a half. Under the terms of an anticipated deal with the EU, any components from EU countries can count as British - something known as ""cumulation"". But the letter reveals the requirement for that to be extended to other partners of the UK and EU, in particular Japan and Turkey, is being refused. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Much UK manufacturing is below the required threshold, although the reverse is not the case for the European Union. The problem is particularly acute for electric vehicles where an even larger proportion of the value of the car is contained in the battery. ""The commission has made clear that it will not agree third-country cumulation in any circumstances, which we regret, but obviously cannot insist upon,"" says Lord Frost's letter, written on 7 September. Senior figures in the car industry expressed the view that the government could have chosen to insist on a deal that did contain such measures. But discussions on such subjects have been stalled by the impasse over fishing rights and subsidy powers. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: ""Given its importance to the economy and livelihoods and the damaging consequences of tariffs we need the sector prioritised in negotiations, not traded off against other industries."" Nissan, the Japanese company with 7,000 UK workers and a large factory in Sunderland, urged UK and EU ""negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade"". There is particular concern in the motor industry about the risk around electric cars, as many key components, including batteries, are sourced outside the EU. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that the government would keep working with the sector, which employs some 800,000 people in Britain and has continually lobbied for free and unfettered trade with its biggest market to be kept. ""Rules of origin commitments exist in all free-trade agreements and as negotiations progress we remain committed to working with the automotive industry to try to ensure an outcome that reflects business interests across the UK."" he said. Lucy Powell, Labour's shadow minister for business and consumers, said: ""This is really worrying for our country's automotive industry. The government must listen to businesses and trade unions, and crack on to deliver the trade deal with the EU they promised during the election."" The original Brexit deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May contained a route to minimise checks on what are known as ""rules of origin"". That option was removed as part of the revision to the withdrawal agreement a year ago. But Lord Frost points out that the UK and EU27 car industries have jointly asked for such arrangements, including special consideration for electric vehicle exports.

"This video can not be played The Speaker calls on the government to start ârebuilding the trustâ after accusing it of showing âcontemptâ for the House. The government is treating Parliament with ""contempt"" by rushing through new powers to tackle coronavirus without debate, the Commons Speaker has said. Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he could not give MPs a vote on getting a bigger say on renewing emergency powers later. But it was not a decision he had ""taken lightly"" - and he issued a stern warning to the government to give MPs a chance to debate future policy changes. His ruling ends the prospect of a backbench Conservative rebellion. Dozens of Tory MPs were backing an amendment by senior Tory MP Sir Graham Brady calling for future regulations affecting the whole of England only to be introduced if Parliament has the opportunity to debate and vote on them in advance. Live: Prime Minister's Questions reaction Johnson blunders into the backbenches PM defends 'strong local action' to beat Covid In a statement before Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Lindsay said he was unable to select any amendments ahead of a vote on the renewal of the powers to avoid ""undermining the rule of law"". MPs are due to vote on a motion that will extend the Coronavirus Act, the emergency legislation passed in March, which grants extensive powers to the authorities to tackle Covid, such as closing schools and stopping mass gatherings. Sir Lindsay said any amendment to that motion risked creating uncertainty about the legality of the Act, and potentially opened it up to court challenge. But many of the coronavirus measures introduced since March, such as the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops and the ""rule of six"" limit on gatherings, have been introduced through regulations linked to an older piece of law. These regulations - known as statutory instruments - must be approved by Parliament but are often not debated. Sir Lindsay told MPs: ""The way in which the government has exercised its powers to make secondary legislation during this crisis has been totally unsatisfactory. ""All too often important statutory instruments have been published a matter of hours before they come into force and some explanations as to why important measures have come into effect before they can be laid before this House has been unconvincing and shows a total disregard for the House."" He said he was ""now looking to the government to rebuild trust with the House not treat it with the contempt it has shown"". He encouraged MPs to table more urgent questions and motions to challenge ministers and make them come to the Commons to explain their actions. Allow Twitter content?

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said ""all is not well between Downing Street and the Conservative Party backbenches"" but a compromise between the two sides was expected to be announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock in the Commons shortly. Speaking on Politics Live on BBC Two, she said it was ""fascinating"" that the Speaker is encouraging urgent questions and debates on Covid-19 restrictions, especially as Sir Lindsay Hoyle is not an ""activist speaker"" in the way that his predecessor John Bercow was. A Whitehall source told the BBC there has been ""constructive dialogue"" between the government and potential rebels over how to handle any future Covid-related regulations, and that ""both sides recognise the need to balance proper Parliamentary scrutiny with the government's ability to act swiftly when necessary"". Sir Graham, who is chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, said he remained hopeful that the government will make concessions. In a statement, he said: ""The Speaker set out his reasons for not selecting any amendments but he also made it clear that he expects the government to ensure proper and timely Parliamentary scrutiny. ""I am hopeful that the government will respond appropriately this afternoon."" Conservative MP Steve Baker, one of those seeking more checks over the government's powers, said he was satisfied with the Speaker's ruling. ""Mr Speaker's decision is entirely reasonable and his statement will reassure all MPs supporting Sir Graham. ""I hope and expect to reach a good compromise with the government shortly so we can advance as one team."" The Commons will vote on whether to renew coronavirus legislation passed at the start of the pandemic in March, which gives the government sweeping powers to act but has to be extended every six months. At least 16.6 million people in the UK - about one in four people - are subject to local lockdowns - and a growing number of MPs have expressed their concern that the measures are disproportionate even though they have often been requested by local leaders. MPs are concerned recent interventions - including Wednesday's tightening of restrictions on separate households in the North East of England mixing indoors in public places - have been announced with little warning or debate.

"TSB will close 164 of its branches and cut 960 jobs, blaming ""a significant shift in customer behaviour"" as more customers bank online. The figure is in addition to the 82 branches it said it would close in November, when it set out plans to save Â£100m by 2022. Alist of the affected branches,externaland their closure dates has now been published after staff were informed. Union Unite described the move as ""a dark day for the finance sector"". The bank said the closures were not an ""easy decision"" and had been accelerated by the pandemic. From the end of next year TSB will have 290 branches - down from 475 currently. The bank hopes most of the job cuts will come through voluntary redundancies, and said it would also create 120 new positions. Natwest to cut 550 jobs in branches Co-op Bank to shed 350 jobs and close branches It said branches with the lowest footfall would go. ""Our customers are banking differently - with a marked shift to digital banking,"" said boss Debbie Crosbie. ""This means having the right balance between branches on the high street and our digital platforms, enabling us to offer the very best experience for our personal and business customers across the UK."" Unite's national officer Dominic Hook said: ""Unite has argued for some time that the financial services industry has a social responsibility not to walk away from its local customers who continue to need access to banking in bank branches. ""It beggars belief that just seven years ago TSB had 631 local branches and this announcement will reduce that number to merely 290 branches. "" Today, TSB has 475 branches. By the end of 2021, it will have 290. They are stark numbers for a bank that has always promoted itself as a community service, and once attacked rivals for cutting branches. The closure plan will be a blow to staff, aware of the wider economic outlook as they consider whether to volunteer for redundancy. It will also be a blow to customers who still like to use a branch, and to small businesses that hope to keep travel times to a minimum when depositing cash. Partnerships with the Post Office and cash collection services aim to mitigate these problems. But, while customer behaviour is changing across the bank sector, some people are being forced to bank in a different way - and they may not feel comfortable doing so. TSB is the latest bank to announce closures during the pandemic. In August the Co-operative Bank has said it will cut 350 jobs and close 18 branches due to the current ""economic uncertainty"" and the shift to online banking. Natwest Group also said it would cut 550 jobs in branches and close one of its remaining offices in London. TSB, which is owned by Spanish lender Banco Sabadell, has been dogged by technical problems, with an IT failure in 2018 leaving up to 1.9 million customers unable to bank online for several weeks. Customers were moved on to a new system, but an investigation found it had not been tested properly before going live. It cost TSB a total of Â£330m for customer compensation, fraud losses and other expenses. Asrecently as last monthusers were unable to access online banking. And last year, a ""processing error"" meant wages and other payments were not paid into some TSB customers' accounts.

"British beef is back on US menus for the first time in more than 20 years as exports restart on Wednesday. The beef was banned after the BSE outbreak in 1996 when cattle were infected by what became commonly known as Mad Cow Disease. Some UK beef was cleared for export in March after US inspections in 2019, and shipments from Northern Ireland's Foyle Food Group will be the first to leave. Ministers said the US market will be worth Â£66m to the UK over five years. The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, a body funded by farmers and the supply chain, called the resumption of exports a ""historic moment"". Dr Phil Hadley, a director at the board, said: ""The US represents an important potential market for our red meat exports and today's first shipment is the result of the hard work and persistence of industry and government to bring about this crucial next step. ""This important milestone will bring a fantastic boost to the sector and we look forward to seeing more of our red meat served up on dinner tables across the US in the months and years to come."" In 2019, the US Food Safety Inspection Service undertook a series of audits at UK beef, pork and lamb facilities. Pork exports to the US continue as usual, while exports of lamb have yet to commence. ""This is great news for our food and farming industry, helping the sector go from strength to strength,"" said Environment Secretary George Eustice. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: ""This could be just the tip of the iceberg. The free trade deal we are negotiating with the US will create a host of export opportunities for British agriculture. We are seeking an ambitious and high standards agreement that benefits farmers and delivers for consumers."" However, those free trade talks remain controversial, with critics warning the government not to lower UK food standards in order to strike a deal. This week a group of celebrities and chefs, including Jamie Oliver and Joe Wicks, said post-Brexit trade deals should not open the floodgates to lower-quality food, citing chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-injected beef.

"This video can not be played ""Shut up, man"" and other insults and interruptions In a debate that was the political equivalent of a food fight, the winner was the man who emerged least covered in slop. On Tuesday night, on the basis of instant polls and betting markets, that man was Joe Biden - if only because his main goal was to prove to Americans that he could hold up under pressure, that he had not lost a step due to his advancing age. He had to show he could take a pie to the face, metaphorically speaking, and keep his cool. He mostly met that standard, although it was at least in part because Donald Trump, by his constant hectoring and interruptions, seldom gave the former vice-president a chance to say something truly damaging to his own cause. Twitter Trump - the unconventional, bombastic, insulting and rumour-mongering aspect of this president - was on full display throughout the hour-and-a-half event. Unfortunately for the president, many Americans, even his own supporters, find his social media persona one of his more unattractive attributes. Trump needed this debate to shake up a race that is tilting against him - and which has been remarkably stable, through economic, health and social adversity. Nothing about this free-for-all seems likely to alter the dynamics of this contest or change the minds of the one in 10 American voters who say they are still undecided (although perhaps they'll resolve never to watch another one of these). LIVE updates, analysis and reaction Trump and Biden clash angrily on Covid and race Fact-checking the candidates' claims It was clear early on what kind of ""debate"" this would be. Donald Trump's objective was to rattle Joe Biden - and he planned to do it by constantly interrupting the former vice-president. By CBS News's count, Trump cut in on Biden a total of 73 times. That made for a series of chaotic exchanges, which included Trump questioning Biden's intelligence and Biden calling Trump a clown, shushing him and asking, indignantly: ""Will you shut up, man?"" Time and time again, Trump would snipe at Biden, leaving the Democrat laughing and shaking his head. As moderator Chris Wallace announced that the coronavirus was the next topic and that both candidates would have two-and-a-half uninterrupted minutes to answer, Biden quipped: ""Good luck with that."" Moderating this prestigious primetime event may have been the worst job in America on Tuesday night. The coronavirus was always going to be difficult terrain for the president - and the topic came up early in the debate. Trump had to defend a pandemic response that has resulted in more than 200,000 American deaths. He did so by saying the steps he's taken prevented more deaths and suggesting Biden would have made things worse. Biden's reply was to talk directly at the camera, asking the viewers if they could believe Trump (polls indicate a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the pandemic). Brian Chellgren - an attorney and a conservative-leaning moderate:It was expected to be chaotic, and it was chaotic. Trump controlled the message with more interrupting, talking and controlling. Biden withstood it better than I thought he would. He got a little hot in the collar a few times. I didn't see any big eye-catching gaffes. I thought Biden had a good few periods where he aimed his message directly at the camera and to the public. Keirsten Greggs - a talent recruiter and a progressive voter:At the end of the day, the loser was really us, the American people. A lot of people were expecting this to go the way that it did. Joshua Roizman - a recent college graduate voting for Biden:Biden came out on top. He came out with a strong message and I can't tell you enough how much it mattered that he looked into the camera. Ariel Hedlund - right-leaning independent voting for Trump:I think Trump's strongest point was when he talked about what he accomplished and what he will accomplish. On the other hand, Biden did really well when he spoke directly to the American people but he never gave us details and facts. I must say Vice-President Biden did much better than I expected. Read the BBC voters' panel views in full here. ""A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker,"" said Biden. In one telling exchange, Trump boasted about the size of his campaign rallies, held outside because that's what the ""experts"" - with emphasis on that word - suggest. He then said Biden held smaller rallies because he couldn't attract larger crowds. ""People want their places open,"" Trump said. ""People want to be safe,"" Biden countered. That back-and-forth demonstrated a fundamental difference in the way the two candidates view the pandemic and whether the situation is getting better - or worse. A debate format that lumped together race issues and urban violence led to feisty exchanges that made clear Biden was more comfortable talking about the former, while Trump wanted to discuss the latter. Biden accused the president of fomenting racist divisions, while Trump swiped at Biden's support for a 1993 anti-crime bill that led to higher incarceration rates for black people. Biden would later go on the attack against Trump for saying Democratic-backed housing proposals meant to increase diversity were threatening to destroy the suburbs of American cities. ""This is not 1950, all these dog-whistles and racism don't work anymore,"" Biden said. ""The suburbs are by and large integrated."" He added that the real threat to the suburbs was Covid-19 and climate change. This video can not be played Trump: ""I don't know who the Proud Boys are"" Trump was offered the chance to directly renounce right-wing violence - from white supremacists and militias. He said he would, but then he didn't, instead telling one far-right group, the Proud Boys, to ""stand back and stand by"" (an answer the organisation has subsequently celebrated). Trump then pivoted to attack antifa, a loose collection of anti-fascist activists, and left-wing mobs. When Biden was asked about whether, as the self-professed leader of the Democratic Party, he had called on the mayor of Portland or the governor of Oregon to take steps to stop the unrest in that city, he demurred, saying he no longer held elective office. Wallace had given both candidates a chance to cut against their own bases, which can at times be a wise political strategy. Instead, they both dodged and danced. The death of George Floyd and resulting conversations about institutional racism and police violence led to mass demonstrations the likes of which the US has not seen in decades. Tuesday's debate shed little light on those history-making moments. A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Why we might not get a result on election night Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? What Joe Biden wants to do Full coverage of the US election If there's a message the Trump campaign wanted Americans to take away from this debate - a clip that was tweeted out from the president's account even as the debate was ongoing - it's that Joe Biden had almost half a century in public office to solve the problems facing the country, and those problems are still around. ""In 47 months, I've done more than you've done in 47 years,"" Trump told the vice-president. Biden's response came later in the debate. ""Under this president we've become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided and more violent,"" he said. In 2016, Trump successfully ran against Washington and the status quo. Doing so again after sitting in the Oval Office for three-and-a-half years was always going to be a challenge, but the way he might pull it off is by using Biden's longevity in public life against him. This video can not be played President Donald Trump clashes with moderator Chris Wallace. One of Trump's goals during this debate - and throughout the whole campaign - has been to paint Biden as beholden to the left wing of his party. Biden, in his very first exchange with the president, outlined his defence. The opening topic for tonight's debate was the Supreme Court, but Biden quickly turned the discussion to the Affordable Care Act - which is at risk because of a pending case before the high court. Trump tried to accuse Biden of supporting ""socialised medicine"" and pushing to do away with private insurance, prompting the Democrat to say that wasn't in his plan - and he's the one who won the Democratic presidential nomination. ""I am the Democratic Party right now,"" he said. ""The platform of the Democratic Party is what I approved."" The tactic re-emerged later on, during an exchange on climate change, when Trump tried to tie Biden to the massive spending and regulation proposals in the ""Green New Deal"" programme embraced by many on the left. ""I don't support the Green New Deal,"" Biden said. ""I support the Biden plan I put forward."" ""Oh, you don't?"" Trump asked. ""Well, that's a big statement."" Biden, in drawing distinction with progressives in his party, seemed confident that his left flank would hold when it was time to vote. When the New York Times story about Trump's taxes broke on Sunday night, it was viewed as a bombshell - the public was finally getting a look at information the president had, in a break with tradition, withheld for years. Political analysts and prognosticators wondered how Trump would handle this during the debate. When the topic came up, however, Donald Trump offered a similar defence to the one he provided in 2016, when he boasted how he knew the tax code better than any previous candidate - and his ability to avoid a larger tax bill was simply his taking advantage of the law. Biden, for his part, tried to turn the topic into a condemnation of Republican-passed tax reform. While he noted that Trump paid less in federal taxes than schoolteachers, that message - which could have been a powerful attack - got buried in an ensuing scuffle with the president. If Trump's tax returns have any legs as an issue in this campaign, it won't be because of this debate. The closing segment of the debate was on election security and concerns - presented by both the left and the right - that the election will not be free and fair. When it came to the details of the discussion, if you can call it that, they mostly revolved around Trump sharing a series of misleading anecdotes that he says demonstrated that mail-in voting, which millions of Americans will rely on this year, is fraught with corruption and incompetence. ""This will not end well,"" Trump said at one point - a sentiment that many Americans on both sides of the political aisle will agree with, albeit for different reasons. Biden, for his part, tried to take the high ground. He called for all the ballots to be counted and promised to respect the results of the election once a winner had been decided. It seemed he had a few more points to make in conclusion, but Trump interrupted him again and then Wallace announced the debate was over. It was a sudden end to a chaotic evening that can hardly be called a debate in any traditional sense of the word. These events rarely swing an election one way or another, and this one was such a muddled mess it seems unlikely minds were changed. That's probably bad news for Trump, given that one of his real weaknesses has been with suburban woman voters who say they're turned off by the president's sometimes coarse manner. Then again, if Trump's goal was to turn this campaign into an ugly scrum, leaving voters alienated from the process and uncertain about whether there will be any kind of clarity or resolution at the end, it was an evening's work well done.

"This video can not be played The Speaker calls on the government to start ârebuilding the trustâ after accusing it of showing âcontemptâ for the House. The government is treating Parliament with ""contempt"" by rushing through new powers to tackle coronavirus without debate, the Commons Speaker has said. Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he could not give MPs a vote on getting a bigger say on renewing emergency powers later. But it was not a decision he had ""taken lightly"" - and he issued a stern warning to the government to give MPs a chance to debate future policy changes. His ruling ends the prospect of a backbench Conservative rebellion. Dozens of Tory MPs were backing an amendment by senior Tory MP Sir Graham Brady calling for future regulations affecting the whole of England only to be introduced if Parliament has the opportunity to debate and vote on them in advance. Live: Prime Minister's Questions reaction Johnson blunders into the backbenches PM defends 'strong local action' to beat Covid In a statement before Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Lindsay said he was unable to select any amendments ahead of a vote on the renewal of the powers to avoid ""undermining the rule of law"". MPs are due to vote on a motion that will extend the Coronavirus Act, the emergency legislation passed in March, which grants extensive powers to the authorities to tackle Covid, such as closing schools and stopping mass gatherings. Sir Lindsay said any amendment to that motion risked creating uncertainty about the legality of the Act, and potentially opened it up to court challenge. But many of the coronavirus measures introduced since March, such as the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops and the ""rule of six"" limit on gatherings, have been introduced through regulations linked to an older piece of law. These regulations - known as statutory instruments - must be approved by Parliament but are often not debated. Sir Lindsay told MPs: ""The way in which the government has exercised its powers to make secondary legislation during this crisis has been totally unsatisfactory. ""All too often important statutory instruments have been published a matter of hours before they come into force and some explanations as to why important measures have come into effect before they can be laid before this House has been unconvincing and shows a total disregard for the House."" He said he was ""now looking to the government to rebuild trust with the House not treat it with the contempt it has shown"". He encouraged MPs to table more urgent questions and motions to challenge ministers and make them come to the Commons to explain their actions. Allow Twitter content?

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said ""all is not well between Downing Street and the Conservative Party backbenches"" but a compromise between the two sides was expected to be announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock in the Commons shortly. Speaking on Politics Live on BBC Two, she said it was ""fascinating"" that the Speaker is encouraging urgent questions and debates on Covid-19 restrictions, especially as Sir Lindsay Hoyle is not an ""activist speaker"" in the way that his predecessor John Bercow was. A Whitehall source told the BBC there has been ""constructive dialogue"" between the government and potential rebels over how to handle any future Covid-related regulations, and that ""both sides recognise the need to balance proper Parliamentary scrutiny with the government's ability to act swiftly when necessary"". Sir Graham, who is chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, said he remained hopeful that the government will make concessions. In a statement, he said: ""The Speaker set out his reasons for not selecting any amendments but he also made it clear that he expects the government to ensure proper and timely Parliamentary scrutiny. ""I am hopeful that the government will respond appropriately this afternoon."" Conservative MP Steve Baker, one of those seeking more checks over the government's powers, said he was satisfied with the Speaker's ruling. ""Mr Speaker's decision is entirely reasonable and his statement will reassure all MPs supporting Sir Graham. ""I hope and expect to reach a good compromise with the government shortly so we can advance as one team."" The Commons will vote on whether to renew coronavirus legislation passed at the start of the pandemic in March, which gives the government sweeping powers to act but has to be extended every six months. At least 16.6 million people in the UK - about one in four people - are subject to local lockdowns - and a growing number of MPs have expressed their concern that the measures are disproportionate even though they have often been requested by local leaders. MPs are concerned recent interventions - including Wednesday's tightening of restrictions on separate households in the North East of England mixing indoors in public places - have been announced with little warning or debate. Meanwhile, the Lib Dems said they would vote against extending the Coronavirus Act because of the power it gave ministers to ""reduce rights"" for carers.

Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Well, the Speaker often intervenes to call for order during
PMQs - and isnât afraid to put down the PM and Keir Starmer as well as backbench MPs. But today there is little doubt his own intervention
overshadowed the protagonists and provided the most memorable moment. Even before the PM took to his feet, Sir Lindsay Hoyle attacked
the government for a lack of scrutiny and called for âthe House to debate and
decide on the most significant measuresâ to tackle the virus. And he warns he will be  âvery sympatheticâ to those
who wish to drag ministers to the dispatch box through mechanisms such as urgent questions or emergency debates. He may have a different tone to his predecessor John Bercow
but he is signalling that he has some steel in his spine. A succession of Conservative MPs ask questions about local constituency matters, which the PM seeks to give assurances over. These include the future of A&E units in Shropshire, the contribution made by a local rotary club in Loughborough to eradicating wild polio in Africa and what Jerome Mayhew says is the ""inexplicable"" decision not to upgrade the A47 road between Great Yarmouth and Norwich. His question is the last at this week's PMQs. Also by video link, Labour's Janet Daby says the planned withdrawal of the furlough scheme next month puts hospitality jobs at risk. She accuses the government of having decided that some jobs ""just aren't worth saving"". But Boris Johnson insists ministers are ""doing everything we can"" to ""save every job,"" although he admits this will not be possible. He adds changes announced yesterday to adult education funding from next April will help people who lose their jobs to retrain. Allow Twitter content?

House of CommonsParliament Joinging by video link, Labour's Debbie Abrahams asks the PM what his ""biggest mistake"" has been during the pandemic - listing a litany of areas where she thinks the government has got it wrong. The PM says there will be a time when the UK can reflect on the decisions taken - this is a reference to his commitment to hold some kind of inquiry in the future. But, in the meantime, he urges Labour to row behind the government as it confronts the ""serious"" resurgence of the virus. Liberal Democrat MP Munira Wilson raises objections to the Coronavirus Act - her party will vote against the renewal of the legislation later today when it is debated by MPs. She says the ""draconian"" emergency legislation, introduced in the spring, ""watered down"" the rights of vulnerable people to care. In reply, Boris Johnson pledges that ministers will work to ensure everyone gets ""the protection they need"". ""That's what this government will do,"" he adds. We are onto questions from backbenchers now. Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts urges the UK government to ban people living in areas subject to lockdown in Englandfrom crossing the border into Walesfor holidays or other leisure activities. She says Welsh residents are subject to limits on travelling, including to England, and the lack of equivalence is unfair. The PM refuses to give such a commitment, saying in tackling a pandemic there will always be ""seeming illogicalities"". But he thanks the devolved government in Wales and says that largely the four nations of the UK are working in tandem. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says the Scottish social attitudes survey has shown that 15% of Scots trust the UK government to work in Scotland's best interests. He saysthe internal market billis the ""biggest attack on the Scottish Parliament in our history of devolution"". He asks why the people of Scotland will not trust the UK government. Boris Johnson responds to say ""he is completely wrong"" about what the internal market bill does. He says it ""actually devolves"" power back to Scotland. He says the UK government has managed to ""lift the ban"" on British beef in America, which is going to help Scottish farmers. Mr Blackford says the PM is ""yapping, bumbling, mumbling"" but not giving a straight answer. He asks if the bill will be ""forced through against our wishes"" even if Northern Island, Scotland and Wales do not give consent to it. Mr Johnson says that Ian Blackford is trying to ""ferment grievance"" where there is none. He says the bill gives powers back to Edinburgh from Brussels. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent We saw both the PM and the Opposition leader rehearse a
familiar battle. Keir Starmer tries to attack Boris Johnson on competence and
confusion over the details of his policy, while the PM hints that
Keir Starmer is adding to confusion by âsnipingâ about  regulations that
he actually endorses. Interesting, though, that the Labour leader didnât try a
âquiz showâ approach by asking him specifically to rehearse regulations on
other parts of the country. Itâs possible, though, that his advisers assumed the PM would be better prepared today and that line of attack might fall flat. For his final question, Sir Keir Starmer says the PM ""just doesn't get it"" on supporting jobs that would otherwise be viable. He says there is a ""gap"" between the new rules and the corresponding level of support to stop job losses, and accuses him of being ""tin eared"" when it comes to people's concerns. Turning to the issue of racial inequality, he calls for an investigation into statistics suggesting black women are more likely to die during childbirth. In response, Boris Johnson says the government haslaunched a reviewinto ""inequalities across the whole of society"". Turning to Labour, he says the opposition needs to decide whether to ""march side by side"" with ministers on new Covid-19 restrictions, or ""fire from the sidelines"". Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The PM has left announcing many of the good news âjob-savingâ measures
to his chancellor. So Labour are upping the attack on Boris Johnsonâs neighbour
at No 11 Downing St â part of this is the email from the owner of a wedding venue
Rishi Sunakâs own constituency saying his is a âforgotten industryâ. Keir Starmer says it is not a question of whether Labour supports the restrictions - which he says it does - but the lack of economic support for those who are affected by the restrictions. He says the chancellor made a ""political choice"" to reduce financial support as restrictions bit again - citing the example of an events company in Yorkshire that is in danger of folding. The PM says he feels for those running wedding and other events firms, saying life is tough for them. But he says the UK's furlough scheme was the most generous in Europe and the government will continue to ""put its arms"" around businesses and encourage the country to ""pull together"". Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent When many of Boris Johnsonâs own MPscomplain of lack of scrutiny, I am not sure that denouncing questions from the Opposition leader as âsnipingâ will strike a chord. Sir Keir rejects the idea that he is undermining the government, adding it is ""perfectly reasonable"" to question the effectiveness of rules. Turning to the economy, he says the government has given up on supporting jobs that would otherwise be viable. Boris Johnson says the government has taken measures to defend ""the whole of the UK economy"". He asks the Labour leader to ""make up his mind"" about whether he supports the latest coronavirus restrictions or not. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Keir Starmer seeks to remind people that the PM got the
lockdown rules wrong yesterday. I have spoken to Conservative MPs this morning â some
relieved the PM swiftly corrected himself. But others say âitâs a problemâ and ârules are confusing.â But though there is a patchwork of restrictions there is not
much support for the clarity of a tougher national lockdown on the PMâs side of
the House. Sir Keir Starmer brings up the PM's verbal stumble on Monday over the restrictions in the North East of England's and says he was ""not surprised"" that he had got the details wrong. He asks how if ministers cannot get them right, how can the public be expected to follow them - citing critical comments by the Conservative leader of Bolton Council. In response, the PM says he ""cleared up"" the misunderstanding over his comments as quickly as possible. He urges the Labour leader to show more consistency over the restrictions and ""instil more confidence"" in the public. Â© 2025 BBC.

Before we wrap up, here is a summary of some of the key moments before, during and after the debate in Cleveland, Ohio. For more on the first debate, you can read ournews story,analysisand trove of explainers - including those onhow the US election worksandthe latest polling data. Reality Check After polls close in the US presidential election, it could take days - or even weeks - to find out if Joe Biden or Donald Trump has won. Millions more Americans are expected to vote by post because of coronavirus, meaning a delay in counting all the votes is highly likely. Will the winner be announced on 3 November? It's very possible that it won't. Although the result
of a US presidential vote is usually known on the night of the election, this
year is very different with so many votes being cast by post. In 2016, nearly a quarter of votes were cast by post. It's estimated
that this time it could be more than double â around 80 million â as states
employ measures to limit the spread of coronavirus. There are also concerns that the US Postal Service,
responsible for delivering the postal ballots, will struggle to cope with the
demand. It has faced budget cutbacks and critics of Trump have
accused him of deliberately blocking additional funding. Most states only include ballots received by the time polls
close on election day. But some, like California, will accept them as long
as they are sent by the day of the election, even if they arrive a week later. Will Trump try to overturn
the results and ask for a recount of sorts? This is unknown. Trump has made clear his mistrust
of the postal voting system and says there will be ""tremendous"" fraud involved.
This could be the basis of a challenge to the result if he loses. When asked if he would commit to a peaceful transfer of
power if he loses the election, Trump said: ""We'll have to see what
happens"". He also said the election result could end up in the US Supreme
Court as a result of doubts over the integrity of postal voting. A recount of votes would certainly delay the outcome, but is
not unprecedented. In 2000, a dispute in Florida took more than a month to
resolve before George W Bush was ultimately declared the winner. There is no love lost between Trump and Biden With round one of debating over, Trump and Biden are approaching the final strait of the race for the White House. The presidential election is now just 34 days away, giving Trump and Biden little time to dust themselves down for their next head-to-head clash. Two presidential debates remain on the agenda:  Vice-President Mike Pence and Biden's running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, will also lock horns in a debate:  Like the first debate in Ohio, they will all take place from 21:00-22:30ET (02:00-03:30BST), with no commercial interruptions. Expect more sparks to fly. This year's US presidential election could come down to results in just a few key states.
Most states are tipped to vote one way or another - so we have already assigned 188 votes to Trump and 233 to Biden. Can Biden wrestle enough away to seize the presidency? Or will Trump romp home to a second term?
It's all about the race to 270 electoral votes - and this time you decide. Play our game to predict whether Trump or Biden will win,externalthe key states at the election. As the presidential election draws closer, you may be asking yourself: how does it all work? Well, we've put together areally simple guide to the election, which could shape the US and the world for years to come. By now, you probably know the candidates are incumbent Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden. When Americans go to the polls on 3 November, they will cast ballots for a group of officials who represent Trump and Biden in the electoral college. Each state gets a certain number of electoral-college votes partly based on its population. There are a total of 538 votes up for grabs, so the victor is the candidate that wins 270 or more. This means voters decide state-level contests rather than the national one, which is why it's possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally - in what is called the popular vote - but still be defeated by the electoral college. Got it? If not, you canread more about how the electoral college works here. Voters around the US tuned in to see President Donald Trump and former
Vice-President Joe Biden spar in the first presidential debate. As the exchange came to a close, we asked members of the BBC voter panel
how the candidates performed - and if their answers had swayed their vote. Keirsten,
undecided voter:""I definitely
think Biden won the debate, but I don't think that was hard to do because there
wasnât a lot that I was expecting from Donald Trump. At the end of the 'day the
loser was really us, the American people. A lot of people were expecting this
to go the way that it did."" Brian,
undecided voter:""I wouldn't
call anyone a winner. It was expected to be chaotic, [and] it was chaotic.
Trump controlled the message with more interrupting, talking and controlling.
Biden withstood it better than I thought he would. He got a little hot in the
collar a few times but I didnât see any big eye-catching gaffes. I thought Biden
had a good few moments where he looked directly at the camera and aimed his
message at the public. I think both sides will say they win, but itâs like
comparing apples to oranges."" Ariel, Trump voter:""I thought nobody won
the debate. I really understand that Trump is not a very seasoned politician.
When he did his best was when he was talking about his policies, what heâs done
and what heâs going to do. But there were other times Biden would say something
and heâd try to debunk it."" Josh, Biden
voter:""Biden came
out on top. He came out with a strong message and I can't tell you enough how
much it mattered that he looked into the camera. Trump was disrespecting Chris
Wallace. We already knew he's disrespectful but now America all watched him
disrespect Chris Wallace at the same time."" Meet the voters we watched the debate with. Peskov said Russia did not wish to intervene in US affairs The Russian government is watching the presidential campaign in the US closely, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman has said in the wake of the first debate. ""But we do not want to make any statements as this could be viewed as an attempt to intervene [into the election process],"" Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday,according to Reuters news agency,external. ""Russia has never, is not and is not going to intervene in US domestic affairs,"" he added. That statement contradicts US intelligence agencies, which accused Russia's government of interfering in the 2016 presidential election. Intelligence chiefs said Russia wanted to help boost Trump's campaign, including by spreading disinformation online, but the Kremlin has denied the allegations. In August, the head of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) saidRussia was among several countries seeking to influence the presidential election this year. Trump cut a confrontation figure in the first debate We can bring you some more reaction from Robin Wright, a foreign affairs analyst who has written extensively about the upcoming election. She has seen many debates in her time, yet none were more dispiriting than this one. It was, she said, ""one of the lowest points in presidential debate history"". She said the chaotic bust-up not only raised questions about the future of presidential debates, but the future of America's political system. ""It's hard to absorb what has just happened and I suspect that is even more true of people watching around the world who once thought that America had the kind of democracy, even if flawed, that they aspired to,"" Wright told the BBC. ""This was not just 90 minutes of chaos,"" she added. ""It was America, the history of America in 2020."" Both Democrat and Republican supporters have been having their say on the presidential debate. Naturally, the reaction has been partisan on both sides. Here's what some observers told the BBC and other news agencies. Republicans Randi Reed is a Republican and a Trump supporter from Nevada. She described the debate as a ""kindergarten cat fight"". She said the president's ""gunning for the jugular"" was ""exactly what we expected from Trump - the rude, crude interrupting"". ""We went in knowing who we were supporting,"" she said. Doug Miller has served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention, he told AFP news agency he ""thought the president performed very well"". ""But I feel for most of the evening, he was not only debating 'Sleepy Joe Biden', he was having to debate [moderator] Chris Wallace, who I think is a total fool,"" he said. Democrats Bilal Aksoy is a student and a registered Democrat voter in Pennsylvania. He said the debate only served to reinforce the views he held about both candidates. ""I knew that Trump didn't believe in science. He refuses to acknowledge climate change and he refuses to act on the global pandemic that we're living through,"" he said. Jamal Simmons is a Democratic Party strategist who has worked as an adviser to former President Barack Obama's campaign. He said Trump missed opportunities to reach out to undecided voters. ""I think Donald Trump went out for a boxing match, went out to just clinch it up for as many rounds as he could,"" he said. Reality Check During an exchange about Biden's eldest son Beau, who served in the US military and died of cancer in 2015, Trump brought up Biden's other son, Hunter. Trump: ""I don't know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the militaryâ¦ dishonourably dischargedâ¦ for cocaine use."" Biden replied that it was not true that his son had been dishonourably discharged. Hunter Biden was discharged from the US Navy in 2014, and media reports at the timesaid that a navy drug test had detected the presence of cocaine.,external However, he was not dishonourably discharged, which is the highest level of punishment the military can hand out. Readmore about the claims made throughout the debate here. ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by,"" Trump said in response to a question asking him to condemn white supremacist and militia groups. The Proud Boys is a far-right, anti-immigrant group witha history of street violence against its left-wing opponents. Trumpâs apparent refusal to denounce the group proved to be one of the most controversial and hotly debated moments of the first debate. In case you missed it, here's a video of the exchange with debate moderator Chris Wallace. This video can not be played 'Proud Boys, stand back and stand by' - Trump Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington Joe Biden makes a trip to China while serving as Barack Obama's vice-president Like Donald Trump, Joe Biden wants to end the forever wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but he would keep a small troop presence in both to help battle terrorism. On Russia, the relationship at the top would certainly look different, likely little else. President Trump often seemed ready to personally forgive Vladimir Putin for violating international norms. But his administration punished Russia with sanctions, and that would probably continue under a Biden presidency. On China there is rare bipartisan agreement to get tough with Beijing over trade and other issues, the question is about tactics. Biden would continue President Trump's policy of countering China's ""abusive economic practices"", but jointly with allies, as opposed to Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals. The sharp elbows of the Trump administration have been successful in winning global support for a boycott of Chinese communications technology. That's part of a serious escalation in US efforts to push back against Beijing on many fronts, anchored in accusations that it mishandled the Coronavirus. This campaign is led by Mr Trump's China hawks: strategic competition they call it; strategic confrontation, is how some analysts describe it. Mr Biden would more actively seek areas of cooperation with a rising China. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring This Channel One news ticker reads: ""The debate has been dubbed the most scandalous in US history."" The Trump-Biden
debate is a lead story on Russian TV this morning, with news bulletins focusing
on the chaotic nature of the event. State TV's Channel
One: ""A political theatre of the absurd. A verbal duel which has been dubbed
the most scandalous in the history of election campaigning in the USâ¦ The most
important political show in the presidential race has probably never been so
chaotic before."" Pro-Kremlin NTV
television: ""There was no constructive dialogue. The rivals kept interrupting
each other and instead of a balanced discussion they chose the path of mutual
insults."" Channel 5, St
Petersburg: ""The rivals have crossed all boundaries."" Pro-Kremlin Ren TV: ""The election debate between Biden and Trump has been called America's greatest
disgrace."" Presidential debates have captivated Americans for decades. They can be bruising, gruelling and sometimes explosive affairs - as last night's debate between Biden and Trump proved. Over the years, some debates have stood out more than others. The first ever televised debate in 1960 pitted young Democratic SenatorJohn F Kennedyagainst the sitting vice-president, RepublicanRichard Nixon. Kennedy's team made sure he looked fresh for the close-ups, while Nixon, who was recovering from an illness, donned an ill-fitting suit and was seen wiping sweat from his brow. Kennedy did see a jump in the polls after the debates, even though we can't say for certain it was due to his prowess. Nixon (L) and Kennedy locked horns in 1960 In 2000, Democratic candidateAl Gore's debate performance againstGeorge W Bushmay have cost him the presidency. His sighing and eye-rolling during his Republican counterpart's responses came across as condescending to many voters (and made it into a Saturday Night Live comedy sketch). The significance of the first Trump-Biden debate will become clearer when the dust settles. Now we turn to BBC Reality Check's examination of some of the claims made by Biden during the first debate. Biden: ""We have 4% of the world's population, [but] 20% of the [Covid-19] deaths."" Verdict:This is roughly correct. But looking at coronavirus deaths per capita, there are a number of countries which are worse than the US. Biden:""Manufacturing went into a hole"" before coronavirus. Verdict:That's not right, according to the figures. Prior to the outbreak, President Trump had added almost half a million manufacturing jobs during his first three years in office. Biden:""Trump hasn't lowered drug prices for anyone."" Verdict:The average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell slightly in the year to August 2019, although it then rose again. For a more detailed take on Bidenâs claims,see here. BBC Reality Check has been verifying some of the claims made by both Trump and Biden during the first debate. Firstly, let's look at some of the claims Trump made. Trump:""We built the greatest economy in history."" Verdict:That's not right - there have been times in US history when the economy was stronger, as the chart below shows. Trump:Postal ballots increase will cause ""a fraud like you've never seen"". Verdict:Studies have not found evidence of widespread fraud, although there have been isolated cases. Trump:""We're weeks away from a vaccine."" Verdict:There is a ""very, very low chance"" of an approved vaccine being ready by the end of October, the chief scientific adviser to the US vaccine programme has said. For more clarity on claims made in the debate,read BBC Reality Check's fuller analysis. Harris said Biden was prepared to engage with the Black Lives Matter movement Senator Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's vice-presidential running mate, has rebuked President Trump for failing to condemn white supremacists during the first debate. In one of the most talked about exchanges of the night, the president was asked by the moderator, Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, if he was prepared to condemn white supremacists. He initially said he would, but when asked to denounce the far-right Proud Boys group by name, he told those affiliated with it to ""stand back and stand by"". Those who support the group later expressed their allegiance to Trump on social media. In an interview with CNN,external, Harris said Trump's comments illustrated the contrast between him and Biden, who was ""not afraid to speak the phrase Black Lives Matter"". ""I heard what we all heard, the president of the United States, in the year of our Lord 2020, refuses to condemn white supremacists,"" Harris said. ""People talk about, 'is he dog whistling?',"" she added. ""Dog whistling through a bullhorn is what he's doing."" James RobbinsDiplomatic Correspondent If Donald Trump wins a second
term, the only safe prediction is that relations with Britain will remain
utterly unpredictable. Normally, Downing Street and
the Foreign Office would have a fair idea what to expect from a re-elected
American president and commander-in-chief. With Trump, however, all bets
are off. The certainties are that Joe
Biden's promise to take the US back into the Paris Climate Change accord will
most definitely not be the path Trump follows. So, British hopes for a
far more ambitious and more broadly based outcome from next year's United
Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow - with the US on board
again - will be dashed if it's still President Trump in the White House. More than that, a naturally
divisive Trump in his second term will surely not retreat from his open
scorn for the global institutions. The longer that
remains the case, the more other democracies, including Britain, think they
have to lose in competition with the rising power of autocrats and
protectionists of varying degree spread around the world. Publicly, of course, any
British prime minister will commit to working very closely with the leader of
the United States. But a second-term President
Trump, emboldened by a new mandate and also freed from any constraint imposed
by worry over a further electoral test, is hardly likely to be any easier an
adversary in the continuing tough negotiations over a new UK/US trade
agreement. Chlorinated chicken will remain firmly on the menu America would
like to serve up to the UK consumer. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Whenthe New York Times story,externalabout Donald Trump's taxes broke on Sunday night, it was viewed as a bombshell - the public was finally getting a look at information the president - in a break with tradition - had withheld for years. The Times said Trump paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. The records reveal ""chronic losses and years of tax avoidance"",the paper said. When the topic came up in the debate, Trump offered a similar defence to the one he provided in 2016 - that he had paid plenty of taxes and his ability to avoid a larger tax bill was simply his taking advantage of the law. Biden, for his part, tried to turn the topic into a condemnation of Republican-passed tax reform. While he noted that Trump paid less in federal taxes than schoolteachers, that message - which could have been a powerful attack - got buried in an ensuing scuffle with the president. If Trump's tax returns have any legs as an issue in this campaign, it won't be because of this debate.

Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says ""all is not well between Downing Street and the Conservative party backbenches"" in the debate over MPs voting on coronavirus restrictions. Speaking on Politics Live on BBC Two, Laura said it was ""fascinating"" that the Speaker is encouraging urgent questions and debates on Covid restrictions, especially as Lindsay Hoyle is not an ""activist speaker"" in the way that John Bercow was. She said, ""Things are not going well"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Well, the Speaker often intervenes to call for order during
PMQs - and isnât afraid to put down the PM and Keir Starmer as well as backbench MPs. But today there is little doubt his own intervention
overshadowed the protagonists and provided the most memorable moment. Even before the PM took to his feet, Sir Lindsay Hoyle attacked
the government for a lack of scrutiny and called for âthe House to debate and
decide on the most significant measuresâ to tackle the virus. And he warns he will be  âvery sympatheticâ to those
who wish to drag ministers to the dispatch box through mechanisms such as urgent questions or emergency debates. He may have a different tone to his predecessor John Bercow
but he is signalling that he has some steel in his spine. A succession of Conservative MPs ask questions about local constituency matters, which the PM seeks to give assurances over. These include the future of A&E units in Shropshire, the contribution made by a local rotary club in Loughborough to eradicating wild polio in Africa and what Jerome Mayhew says is the ""inexplicable"" decision not to upgrade the A47 road between Great Yarmouth and Norwich. His question is the last at this week's PMQs. Also by video link, Labour's Janet Daby says the planned withdrawal of the furlough scheme next month puts hospitality jobs at risk. She accuses the government of having decided that some jobs ""just aren't worth saving"". But Boris Johnson insists ministers are ""doing everything we can"" to ""save every job,"" although he admits this will not be possible. He adds changes announced yesterday to adult education funding from next April will help people who lose their jobs to retrain. Allow Twitter content?

House of CommonsParliament Joinging by video link, Labour's Debbie Abrahams asks the PM what his ""biggest mistake"" has been during the pandemic - listing a litany of areas where she thinks the government has got it wrong. The PM says there will be a time when the UK can reflect on the decisions taken - this is a reference to his commitment to hold some kind of inquiry in the future. But, in the meantime, he urges Labour to row behind the government as it confronts the ""serious"" resurgence of the virus. Liberal Democrat MP Munira Wilson raises objections to the Coronavirus Act - her party will vote against the renewal of the legislation later today when it is debated by MPs. She says the ""draconian"" emergency legislation, introduced in the spring, ""watered down"" the rights of vulnerable people to care. In reply, Boris Johnson pledges that ministers will work to ensure everyone gets ""the protection they need"". ""That's what this government will do,"" he adds. We are onto questions from backbenchers now. Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts urges the UK government to ban people living in areas subject to lockdown in Englandfrom crossing the border into Walesfor holidays or other leisure activities. She says Welsh residents are subject to limits on travelling, including to England, and the lack of equivalence is unfair. The PM refuses to give such a commitment, saying in tackling a pandemic there will always be ""seeming illogicalities"". But he thanks the devolved government in Wales and says that largely the four nations of the UK are working in tandem. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says the Scottish social attitudes survey has shown that 15% of Scots trust the UK government to work in Scotland's best interests. He saysthe internal market billis the ""biggest attack on the Scottish Parliament in our history of devolution"". He asks why the people of Scotland will not trust the UK government. Boris Johnson responds to say ""he is completely wrong"" about what the internal market bill does. He says it ""actually devolves"" power back to Scotland. He says the UK government has managed to ""lift the ban"" on British beef in America, which is going to help Scottish farmers. Mr Blackford says the PM is ""yapping, bumbling, mumbling"" but not giving a straight answer. He asks if the bill will be ""forced through against our wishes"" even if Northern Island, Scotland and Wales do not give consent to it. Mr Johnson says that Ian Blackford is trying to ""ferment grievance"" where there is none. He says the bill gives powers back to Edinburgh from Brussels. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent We saw both the PM and the Opposition leader rehearse a
familiar battle. Keir Starmer tries to attack Boris Johnson on competence and
confusion over the details of his policy, while the PM hints that
Keir Starmer is adding to confusion by âsnipingâ about  regulations that
he actually endorses. Interesting, though, that the Labour leader didnât try a
âquiz showâ approach by asking him specifically to rehearse regulations on
other parts of the country. Itâs possible, though, that his advisers assumed the PM would be better prepared today and that line of attack might fall flat. For his final question, Sir Keir Starmer says the PM ""just doesn't get it"" on supporting jobs that would otherwise be viable. He says there is a ""gap"" between the new rules and the corresponding level of support to stop job losses, and accuses him of being ""tin eared"" when it comes to people's concerns. Turning to the issue of racial inequality, he calls for an investigation into statistics suggesting black women are more likely to die during childbirth. In response, Boris Johnson says the government haslaunched a reviewinto ""inequalities across the whole of society"". Turning to Labour, he says the opposition needs to decide whether to ""march side by side"" with ministers on new Covid-19 restrictions, or ""fire from the sidelines"". Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The PM has left announcing many of the good news âjob-savingâ measures
to his chancellor. So Labour are upping the attack on Boris Johnsonâs neighbour
at No 11 Downing St â part of this is the email from the owner of a wedding venue
Rishi Sunakâs own constituency saying his is a âforgotten industryâ. Keir Starmer says it is not a question of whether Labour supports the restrictions - which he says it does - but the lack of economic support for those who are affected by the restrictions. He says the chancellor made a ""political choice"" to reduce financial support as restrictions bit again - citing the example of an events company in Yorkshire that is in danger of folding. The PM says he feels for those running wedding and other events firms, saying life is tough for them. But he says the UK's furlough scheme was the most generous in Europe and the government will continue to ""put its arms"" around businesses and encourage the country to ""pull together"". Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent When many of Boris Johnsonâs own MPscomplain of lack of scrutiny, I am not sure that denouncing questions from the Opposition leader as âsnipingâ will strike a chord. Sir Keir rejects the idea that he is undermining the government, adding it is ""perfectly reasonable"" to question the effectiveness of rules. Turning to the economy, he says the government has given up on supporting jobs that would otherwise be viable. Boris Johnson says the government has taken measures to defend ""the whole of the UK economy"". He asks the Labour leader to ""make up his mind"" about whether he supports the latest coronavirus restrictions or not. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Keir Starmer seeks to remind people that the PM got the
lockdown rules wrong yesterday. I have spoken to Conservative MPs this morning â some
relieved the PM swiftly corrected himself. But others say âitâs a problemâ and ârules are confusing.â But though there is a patchwork of restrictions there is not
much support for the clarity of a tougher national lockdown on the PMâs side of
the House. Sir Keir Starmer brings up the PM's verbal stumble on Monday over the restrictions in the North East of England's and says he was ""not surprised"" that he had got the details wrong. He asks how if ministers cannot get them right, how can the public be expected to follow them - citing critical comments by the Conservative leader of Bolton Council. In response, the PM says he ""cleared up"" the misunderstanding over his comments as quickly as possible. He urges the Labour leader to show more consistency over the restrictions and ""instil more confidence"" in the public. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played The Speaker calls on the government to start ârebuilding the trustâ after accusing it of showing âcontemptâ for the House. The government is treating Parliament with ""contempt"" by rushing through new powers to tackle coronavirus without debate, the Commons Speaker has said. Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he could not give MPs a vote on getting a bigger say on renewing emergency powers later. But it was not a decision he had ""taken lightly"" - and he issued a stern warning to the government to give MPs a chance to debate future policy changes. His ruling ends the prospect of a backbench Conservative rebellion. Dozens of Tory MPs were backing an amendment by senior Tory MP Sir Graham Brady calling for future regulations affecting the whole of England only to be introduced if Parliament has the opportunity to debate and vote on them in advance. Live: Prime Minister's Questions reaction Johnson blunders into the backbenches PM defends 'strong local action' to beat Covid In a statement before Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Lindsay said he was unable to select any amendments ahead of a vote on the renewal of the powers to avoid ""undermining the rule of law"". MPs are due to vote on a motion that will extend the Coronavirus Act, the emergency legislation passed in March, which grants extensive powers to the authorities to tackle Covid, such as closing schools and stopping mass gatherings. Sir Lindsay said any amendment to that motion risked creating uncertainty about the legality of the Act, and potentially opened it up to court challenge. But many of the coronavirus measures introduced since March, such as the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops and the ""rule of six"" limit on gatherings, have been introduced through regulations linked to an older piece of law. These regulations - known as statutory instruments - must be approved by Parliament but are often not debated. Sir Lindsay told MPs: ""The way in which the government has exercised its powers to make secondary legislation during this crisis has been totally unsatisfactory. ""All too often important statutory instruments have been published a matter of hours before they come into force and some explanations as to why important measures have come into effect before they can be laid before this House has been unconvincing and shows a total disregard for the House."" He said he was ""now looking to the government to rebuild trust with the House not treat it with the contempt it has shown"". He encouraged MPs to table more urgent questions and motions to challenge ministers and make them come to the Commons to explain their actions. Allow Twitter content?

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said ""all is not well between Downing Street and the Conservative Party backbenches"" but a compromise between the two sides was expected to be announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock in the Commons shortly. Speaking on Politics Live on BBC Two, she said it was ""fascinating"" that the Speaker is encouraging urgent questions and debates on Covid-19 restrictions, especially as Sir Lindsay Hoyle is not an ""activist speaker"" in the way that his predecessor John Bercow was. A Whitehall source told the BBC there has been ""constructive dialogue"" between the government and potential rebels over how to handle any future Covid-related regulations, and that ""both sides recognise the need to balance proper Parliamentary scrutiny with the government's ability to act swiftly when necessary"". Sir Graham, who is chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, said he remained hopeful that the government will make concessions. In a statement, he said: ""The Speaker set out his reasons for not selecting any amendments but he also made it clear that he expects the government to ensure proper and timely Parliamentary scrutiny. ""I am hopeful that the government will respond appropriately this afternoon."" Conservative MP Steve Baker, one of those seeking more checks over the government's powers, said he was satisfied with the Speaker's ruling. ""Mr Speaker's decision is entirely reasonable and his statement will reassure all MPs supporting Sir Graham. ""I hope and expect to reach a good compromise with the government shortly so we can advance as one team."" The Commons will vote on whether to renew coronavirus legislation passed at the start of the pandemic in March, which gives the government sweeping powers to act but has to be extended every six months. At least 16.6 million people in the UK - about one in four people - are subject to local lockdowns - and a growing number of MPs have expressed their concern that the measures are disproportionate even though they have often been requested by local leaders. MPs are concerned recent interventions - including Wednesday's tightening of restrictions on separate households in the North East of England mixing indoors in public places - have been announced with little warning or debate. Meanwhile, the Lib Dems said they would vote against extending the Coronavirus Act because of the power it gave ministers to ""reduce rights"" for carers.

"Footage shared on social media showed a large group celebrating in a common room Up to 200 people gathered for a party at a university student hall, flouting coronavirus restrictions. Police said officers had attended accommodation at Coventry University in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Officers have worked with the management of Arundel House to close some communal areas and increase security, West Midlands Police said. The university is ""deeply concerned"" over a video of the party and condemned the ""blatant breaches"" of rules. Footage from private accommodation on Whitefriars Lane emerged on social media showing a large group of people who were apparently not adhering to social distancing rules. Current government guidance states only groups of six people or fewer are allowed to meet and students have been told they must limit socialising, staying within separate ""households"" and be taught in managed groups. The university said it ""strongly condemns the blatant breaches of the rule of six and other guidelines as they risk the health of our students, colleagues and the communities in which we are located"". Coventry University ""strongly condemned"" footage showing a party in a common room at a hall of residence Ian Dunn, the university's Provost, described the footage as ""outrageous and deeply unfair"". He told the BBC the university was taking the incident ""very seriously"" and he was confident its code of conduct had been breached. The university said most of its students were behaving ""so responsibly"" West Midlands Police said it would be examining CCTV and would take action if it came to light it had been a planned party. The university's vice-chancellor Prof John Latham said many students were ""not very happy with their peers"". ""We do know that some of the individuals involved in the party were students of the university, we know that many of them were also not students of the university,"" he added. Mr Latham said the university was working with the police on their investigation, and running its own investigation, to find the individuals involved. He added it would be enacting its disciplinary process to look at possible suspensions or expulsions. Universities: No parties and more online learning Being a fresher during Covid-19 Latest news and updates from the West Midlands The president of the National Union of Students Larissa Kennedy said the union was encouraging students to follow public health guidance, but more needed to be done to support them. ""What I think we're seeing is students in really vulnerable situations where they're often isolated, being encouraged to have no human contact, and this is a really difficult time,"" she said. ""So where there isn't the right kind of resources in place, a minority may be resorting to breaking the rules."" Police said officers were examining CCTV of the gathering and ""will take action if evidence comes to light that this was a planned party"". Nido, which runs the hall, said it had restricted visitors to the building and stepped up security following the gathering. ""We do not want the actions of a few to affect the experience of many,"" a spokesperson said. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?

"Helen Reddy shot to fame in the 1970s Helen Reddy, the Australian singer behind feminist anthem I Am Woman, has died aged 78. Reddy died on Tuesday in Los Angeles, her family said in a statement on Facebook. Her children Traci Donat and Jordan Sommers described her as a ""wonderful mother, grandmother, and a truly formidable woman"". ""Our hearts are broken. But we take comfort in the knowledge that her voice will live on forever."" Reddy, who had Addison's disease and was diagnosed with dementia in 2015, spent the last years of her life in a celebrity care home in Los Angeles. She had a string of pop-rock hits in the 1970s, but is best known for the 1972 anthem I Am Woman - which became prominent in the women's liberation movement. Helen Reddy became a feminist icon for her trailblazing song A sleeper hit, it went on to sell millions of copies worldwide, making Reddy the biggest-selling female artist globally for two years running. In collecting her 1973 Grammy Award for best female vocalist, Reddy famously thanked ""God because she makes everything possible"". Born in Melbourne in 1941, Reddy grew up in a showbiz family with actor parents, and performed regularly as a child. After winning a talent contest in Australia, her prize ticket took her to New York City in the 1960s, where she auditioned for a recording contract. That opportunity fell through but the soprano decided to stay on in the US, later signing with Capitol Records. 'Hear me roar': Women march for equality Her first hit, I Don't Know How to Love Him, was followed by a succession of others including Crazy Love, Delta Dawn, and Angie Baby. But it was her second hit, I Am Woman, which catapulted her to international fame and became a defining song for a generation of women. Reddy said she had penned the lyrics - with lines such as ""I am woman, hear me roar"" and ""I am strong, I am invincible, I am woman"" - after struggling to find other songs which reflected her pride in being a woman. Among those to pay tribute on Wednesday was Unjoo Moon, who directed a biopic about Reddy - titled I Am Woman - which was released earlier this year. ""She paved the way for so many and the lyrics that she wrote for I Am Woman changed my life forever like they have done for so many other people and will continue to do for generations to come,"" Moon said. Actress Jamie Lee Curtis shared a clip of Reddy singing her anthem at a Women's March protest in Los Angeles in 2017, part of global rallies which directed anger at US President Donald Trump. Reddy with celebrities including Jamie Lee Curtis at a Women's March in 2017 ""Honor of my life. Introducing Helen at the Women's March,"",externalshe wrote, adding: ""Read the lyrics"". Fellow actresses Jane Lynch and Patricia Arquette and 1970s singing group The Pointer Sisters also posted tributes. At the height of her fame, Reddy toured internationally and was a regular guest on Hollywood showcase shows. She hosted a season of the Helen Reddy Show on NBC TV in 1973, and a year later was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Later in her career she also featured in a handful of films and stage musicals.

"Boris Johnson has led a briefing, as latest UK coronavirus figures showed a further 7,108 cases and another 71 deaths The UK PM says his government ""will not hesitate"" to put further measures in place if needs be UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says wherever possible MPs will get a vote on Covid-19 regulations The number of new UK Covid-19 cases tops 7,000 for a second consecutive day Germany has announced measures to limit the size of gatherings and fine those who break tracking rules The world has seen more than 33.6m coronavirus cases and 1m deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Paul Gribben Many thanks for joining us today on our live page. It has been written by: Ashitha Nagesh, Paul Seddon, Penny Spiller, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Katie Wright. The editors were Helier Cheung and Paul Gribben. We will be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly. But before we do, here's a look back at the main headlines of the day.  As cases rise again across the world, doctors are sounding the alarm about working conditions in their hospitals. Hundreds of junior doctors are protesting in Barcelona, Spain, saying that their working hours are now twice as long as what's stated in their contracts, but their pay is low. Similar protests are being held on the other side of the globe in Lima, Peru, where more than 9,000 healthcare workers are staging a 48-hour walkout to demand higher pay and better conditions. The doctors' union in Peru says the government hasn't kept its promises to increase salaries or pay bonuses during the pandemic. In Barcelona, doctors lay on the ground in their scrubs They maintained social distancing at the protest at the Plaza de Espana In Lima, Peru, doctors say the government hasn't kept its promises to healthcare workers More than 9,000 healthcare workers are protesting in Lima It has been confirmed that more than 170 cases of coronavirus have been linked to a West Cornwall meat plant. Cornwall Council said its public health team was alerted to a single case of possible coronavirus at the Pilgrim's Pride food factory, via the NHS Test and Trace service. Nearly 500 workers at the site in Pool were tested - with more than 170 of them testing positive. The council says most of those were not displaying any symptoms, but they, and any close contacts, are all now isolating in line with government guidelines, A representative from Pilgrimâs Pride Ltd said they were the first positive cases experienced at their site, it has worked closely with authorities and is continuing to follow government guidelines. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent There were no big announcements in the briefing but several stark reminders about the spread of coronavirus in the UK. On more than one occasion, the scientists flanking the prime minister said things were ""heading in the wrong direction"". Boris Johnson again warned the UK was at ""a critical moment"". This was an attempt to reinforce the message that people need to stick to the rules - and a reminder that if things get worse, there could be more restrictions, even another national lockdown, to come. Everything rests on how far and how fast the virus spreads - both the level of disruption we'll continue to see in our daily lives and the relative success, or failure, of the government's response. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech government has declared a new state of emergency, which comes into effect next Monday. Health Minister Roman Prymula told parliament that the rate of infection in the country was ""among the worst in the world"", and that urgent action was needed to prevent a crisis in hospitals. The state of emergency will, among other things, allow officials to draft in final year medical students to help out in hospitals, and to swiftly introduce new restrictions - such as moving all secondary school lessons online, introducing a cap of six people per party in restaurants, and limiting all events - with exceptions for ballet and theatre - to 10 people indoors and 20 outdoors. The state of emergency will be in place for 30 days. Parliament will then have to approve an extension. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is now clear the second wave is here. Infections,
hospital cases and deaths are all rising. But what happens next is the big unknown. The doomsday scenario of a doubling of cases every week that
was put forward last week is not materialising. The increase in hospital admissions is even more gradual â
and the total numbers being admitted are more than 10 times lower than they
were at the peak. It points to a slower, less severe wave this time round. But it is still early days. We are just at the start of the autumn and winter period
when respiratory viruses circulate more. The situation could easily unravel. However, the UK, like other countries, is in a much stronger
position than we were when we literally walked blind into the first wave. Better treatments are in place, social distancing has become
routine and â despite the problems â there is much more testing available. The odds are certainly stacked in our favour more than they
were six months ago. Read more analysishere. South Africa is reopening its borders to all African countries from Thursday, although tourists from 50 places deemed to be high-risk - including the UK, the US, India, France and Russia - will be banned. The country closed its borders at the start of its national lockdown - one of the strictest in the world - on 27 March. Although restrictions on movement and business started to be eased from June, borders stayed shut to avoid cases of the virus coming in from abroad. Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor says the reopening of borders will be done ""gradually"". For now, although anyone from African countries is allowed, she says ""only business travellers with scarce and critical skills, diplomats, investors and professional sports people coming for events from the high-risk countries will be permitted into the country"". Those who can travel will have to show evidence of a negative coronavirus test taken fewer than 72 hours before departure. They will also be screened upon arrival, and will need to install a Covid-19 tracing app on their phones. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, responding to the briefing, said the number of cases was ""very concerning"". He said: ""I think everybody can see that and we've all got a duty to follow the government rules, and that's very clear that we stick to that. ""There's got to be - if you like - a national effort to prevent a second lockdown. ""But the government's side of the bargain here is to have a very clear strategy for keeping that infection rate down and we don't see that strategy. ""Very clear communications, and the byword for this week has been, yet again, confusion. ""And test, trace and isolate needs to be fixed urgently."" Lauren MossHealth correspondent, BBC News ""This whole briefing felt very much like a warning,"" says BBC health correspondent Lauren Moss, who notes that more than once, the scientific advisers said we were headed ""in the wrong direction"". She says: ""Prime Minister Boris Johnson said we may be seeing more of these briefings - a bit like we did when there were daily briefings. ""We are not at that point yet, but this is the second one in a week where we have seen the chief scientific officer and the chief medical officer."" While we are not in the same position we were in April or May, hospital admissions are on the rise - with cases rising especially in some areas of the country. But even though certain areas are seeing an increase in cases more than others, it is a national issue, she adds.   Here are the key points from this afternoonâs
press conference in Downing Street: Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson says
the government has over32 billion items of personal protective equipment(PPE) on orderand is building up a four-month stockpile of masks, gowns and
visors. He
also said that - by December - the government expects UK manufacturers to meet
70% of demand for PPE. These
figures come from theDepartment for Health and Social Care's PPE Strategy,external, published yesterday. The
document says that the government has already distributed 3.5 billion items of
PPE, so almost ten times that amount are now on order. Quoting a recent study during the briefing just ended, a journalist from the Times said only a low proportion of people are self-isolating after testing positive. Sir
Patrick Vallance said it was ""very, very important"" that people self-isolate, adding that if they don't it will increase circulation of the virus. He said the study quoted was about ""intent to self-isolate"" from a few months ago, and he believed that more recent data is better. He said isolation was not something that could be ""literally"" enforced upon people, and people have to take accountability. Boris Johnson is asked why it is someone in the North East can't see their parents outside - but they can see five friends in a pub beer garden. He says there are national and local rules and that people will pick upon discrepancies and complexities - but that they should check the guidance online and also use their own common sense. This means they should follow the basics of restricting the possibility of transmission to someone else. The PM also says it is ""vital"" to stress that tackling the pandemic remains a national effort and that ""we all have to fight it together"". ""We can't expect it to be solved"" in the areas under regional lockdowns, he adds, saying ""it's down to all of us"". That was the last question of the briefing - but we will continue to bring you more reaction on it here. Boris Johnson was asked about the number of people not wearing masks on public transport. He urges people to ""please follow the guidance"" and to bear in mind you are not just protecting your neighbour, but you also need to bear in mind that your loved ones could be infected. Fines are now ""considerable"" and ""they will be imposed"", he adds. She also asked if there were concerns the government was not going far, or fast enough. Sir Patrick Vallance said it was ""very clear"" rates are still going up and that ""we don't have this under control"". But he adds that the decisions that need to be made are ""clearly very difficult"" and ""none are risk free"" He says science can provide advice, but ministers need to make decisions. Also in response to Robert Peston, chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance says there is no room for complacency at all right now and that the situation is headed ""in the wrong direction"". He adds: ""This virus spreads because of close contacts in certain environments. We all need to make sure we reduce the number of contacts we have got."" He says it is ""going to be absolutely critical"" that people self-isolate if they have symptoms. Robert Peston from ITV asks why it is that infections seem to be rising more quickly in Scotland rather than in England - and in parts of northern England rather than the south. He also points out daily deaths are now at 71, the same number they were in March, two days before the nation went into lockdown. Boris Johnson says it's possible there is a difference now ""in the way the disease is expressing itself"" in the country. It is clear, he adds, that local peaks are being seen. It might be the case it is a ""more localised phenomenon this time around"" which is why it is a good idea to focus on local solutions. Prof Chris Whitty says that earlier in the pandemic, the UK was an outlier in having an epidemic that was ""almost uniform"" in shape across the country. It is possible that there will be more concentrated areas in the next stage of the pandemic. He stresses there is a ""long winter ahead"" and that ""a lot can happen in that time"". But if everyone works together and follows the guidance, ""we can contain it in those areas"". In the first wave, the speed of cases doubling was underestimated, he adds. Pressure on the NHS could happen ""sooner rather than later"" in parts of northern England, he adds.  The PM is asked if the government has a threshold above which it will replace local restrictions with nation-wide measures. Boris Johnson does not answer specifically, but says all data is kept under ""constant review"". Asked about differences in approach in the different UK nations, Prof
Chris Whitty says measures have had to bear in mind ""local traditions"" - but says similarities are often downplayed. Boris Johnson is asked what the chance is that the government will introduce further restrictions. In reply, the PM says the country has shown that the virus can be suppressed through observing the strict lockdown earlier this year. But he adds it is ""too early to tell"" what effect the latest measures will have on the transmission figures. Â© 2025 BBC.

Robert Peston from ITV asks why it is that infections seem to be rising more quickly in Scotland rather than in England - and in parts of northern England rather than the south. He also points out daily deaths are now at 71, the same number they were in March, two days before the nation went into lockdown. Boris Johnson says it's possible there is a difference now ""in the way the disease is expressing itself"" in the country. It is clear, he adds, that local peaks are being seen. It might be the case it is a ""more localised phenomenon this time around"" which is why it is a good idea to focus on local solutions. Prof Chris Whitty says that earlier in the pandemic, the UK was an outlier in having an epidemic that was ""almost uniform"" in shape across the country. It is possible that there will be more concentrated areas in the next stage of the pandemic. He stresses there is a ""long winter ahead"" and that ""a lot can happen in that time"". But if everyone works together and follows the guidance, ""we can contain it in those areas"". In the first wave, the speed of cases doubling was underestimated, he adds. Pressure on the NHS could happen ""sooner rather than later"" in parts of northern England, he adds.  The PM is asked if the government has a threshold above which it will replace local restrictions with nation-wide measures. Boris Johnson does not answer specifically, but says all data is kept under ""constant review"". Asked about differences in approach in the different UK nations, Prof
Chris Whitty says measures have had to bear in mind ""local traditions"" - but says similarities are often downplayed. Boris Johnson is asked what the chance is that the government will introduce further restrictions. In reply, the PM says the country has shown that the virus can be suppressed through observing the strict lockdown earlier this year. But he adds it is ""too early to tell"" what effect the latest measures will have on the transmission figures. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Royal Dutch Shell has said it plans to cut 7,000 to 9,000 jobs as it responds to challenges including the slump in oil demand amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The oil giant said the cuts would be implemented by 2022 and included 1,500 people who were taking voluntary redundancy. It gave no indication of where the job losses would happen. The move comes five months afterit cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two. Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said the job cuts were ""the right thing to do for the future of the company"" as it strives to become a net-zero emissions energy business. Shell employs 83,000 people worldwide, including 6,000 in the UK. It has been hit by a substantial drop in profits since the pandemic struck. It saw a 46% fall in first-quarter net income to $2.9bn (Â£2.3bn), while second-quarter income fell 82% to $638m. The firm said third-quarter earnings were expected to be ""at the lower end of the $800m to $875m range"". Who wins and who loses when oil prices fall? Has the world started to take climate change fight seriously? Shell is in the midst of a cost-cutting drive that is expected to deliver annual savings of $2bn to $2.5bn by 2022. Other big oil firms are facing similar challenges.Rival BP has also cut its dividendand recently announcedit was cutting 10,000 jobsout of its global workforce of 70,000. ""We have had to act quickly and decisively and make some very tough financial decisions to ensure we remained resilient, including cutting the dividend,"" said Mr van Beurden. ""But as hard as they were, they were entirely the appropriate choices to make. And Covid-19 has hit us in another way. We have, very sadly, lost six employees and six contractor colleagues to the virus."" Mr van Beurden described the job-cutting programme as ""an extremely tough process"". ""It is very painful to know that you will end up saying goodbye to quite a few good people,"" he said. ""But we are doing this because we have to, because it is the right thing to do for the future of the company."" He said Shell had to be ""a simpler, more streamlined, more competitive organisation that is more nimble and able to respond to customers"". Mr van Beurden reiterated that Shell intended to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 or sooner. That meant the company had to change the type of products it sold, he said. ""We will have some oil and gas in the mix of energy we sell by 2050, but it will be predominantly low-carbon electricity, low-carbon biofuels, it will be hydrogen and it will be all sorts of other solutions too,"" he said.

"Walt Disney has announced it will lay off 28,000 employees, mostly at its US theme parks. Disney cited the parks' limited visitor capacity and uncertainty about how long the coronavirus pandemic would last as reasons for the layoffs. The company's theme parks have taken a major hit from the pandemic. Disney shut all its parks earlier this year as the virus spread, but only Disneyland in California remains closed. ""We have made the very difficult decision to begin the process of reducing our workforce at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment at all levels,"" Josh D'Amaro, chairman of the parks unit, said in a statement. The layoffs apply to ""domestic employees"" of which about 67% are part-time. Disney also has parks in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Paris, which are not affected by the announcement. Hong Kong Disney reopened last week after shutting down for a second time in July due to a spike in Covid-19 cases. Except for Disneyland in California, all of the company's parks have now reopened, although visitor numbers are limited to allow for social distancing. Disney focuses on streaming as it falls to a loss Walt Disney World reopens in Florida amid Covid-19 surge Disney lost $4.7bn (Â£3.6bn) in the three months to 27 June, with revenues for its Parks, Experiences and Products division plummeting 85% compared to the same quarter in 2019. Mr D'Amaro said the company's problems were ""exacerbated in California by the state's unwillingness to lift restrictions that would allow Disneyland to reopen."" Disney has been working to persuade California to allow the company to reopen Disneyland. Are you a Disney employee? Have you been affected by the issues raised here?

"Boris Johnson has led a briefing, as latest UK coronavirus figures showed a further 7,108 cases and another 71 deaths The UK PM says his government ""will not hesitate"" to put further measures in place if needs be UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says wherever possible MPs will get a vote on Covid-19 regulations The number of new UK Covid-19 cases tops 7,000 for a second consecutive day Germany has announced measures to limit the size of gatherings and fine those who break tracking rules The world has seen more than 33.6m coronavirus cases and 1m deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Paul Gribben Many thanks for joining us today on our live page. It has been written by: Ashitha Nagesh, Paul Seddon, Penny Spiller, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Katie Wright. The editors were Helier Cheung and Paul Gribben. We will be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly. But before we do, here's a look back at the main headlines of the day.  As cases rise again across the world, doctors are sounding the alarm about working conditions in their hospitals. Hundreds of junior doctors are protesting in Barcelona, Spain, saying that their working hours are now twice as long as what's stated in their contracts, but their pay is low. Similar protests are being held on the other side of the globe in Lima, Peru, where more than 9,000 healthcare workers are staging a 48-hour walkout to demand higher pay and better conditions. The doctors' union in Peru says the government hasn't kept its promises to increase salaries or pay bonuses during the pandemic. In Barcelona, doctors lay on the ground in their scrubs They maintained social distancing at the protest at the Plaza de Espana In Lima, Peru, doctors say the government hasn't kept its promises to healthcare workers More than 9,000 healthcare workers are protesting in Lima It has been confirmed that more than 170 cases of coronavirus have been linked to a West Cornwall meat plant. Cornwall Council said its public health team was alerted to a single case of possible coronavirus at the Pilgrim's Pride food factory, via the NHS Test and Trace service. Nearly 500 workers at the site in Pool were tested - with more than 170 of them testing positive. The council says most of those were not displaying any symptoms, but they, and any close contacts, are all now isolating in line with government guidelines, A representative from Pilgrimâs Pride Ltd said they were the first positive cases experienced at their site, it has worked closely with authorities and is continuing to follow government guidelines. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent There were no big announcements in the briefing but several stark reminders about the spread of coronavirus in the UK. On more than one occasion, the scientists flanking the prime minister said things were ""heading in the wrong direction"". Boris Johnson again warned the UK was at ""a critical moment"". This was an attempt to reinforce the message that people need to stick to the rules - and a reminder that if things get worse, there could be more restrictions, even another national lockdown, to come. Everything rests on how far and how fast the virus spreads - both the level of disruption we'll continue to see in our daily lives and the relative success, or failure, of the government's response. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech government has declared a new state of emergency, which comes into effect next Monday. Health Minister Roman Prymula told parliament that the rate of infection in the country was ""among the worst in the world"", and that urgent action was needed to prevent a crisis in hospitals. The state of emergency will, among other things, allow officials to draft in final year medical students to help out in hospitals, and to swiftly introduce new restrictions - such as moving all secondary school lessons online, introducing a cap of six people per party in restaurants, and limiting all events - with exceptions for ballet and theatre - to 10 people indoors and 20 outdoors. The state of emergency will be in place for 30 days. Parliament will then have to approve an extension. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is now clear the second wave is here. Infections,
hospital cases and deaths are all rising. But what happens next is the big unknown. The doomsday scenario of a doubling of cases every week that
was put forward last week is not materialising. The increase in hospital admissions is even more gradual â
and the total numbers being admitted are more than 10 times lower than they
were at the peak. It points to a slower, less severe wave this time round. But it is still early days. We are just at the start of the autumn and winter period
when respiratory viruses circulate more. The situation could easily unravel. However, the UK, like other countries, is in a much stronger
position than we were when we literally walked blind into the first wave. Better treatments are in place, social distancing has become
routine and â despite the problems â there is much more testing available. The odds are certainly stacked in our favour more than they
were six months ago. Read more analysishere. South Africa is reopening its borders to all African countries from Thursday, although tourists from 50 places deemed to be high-risk - including the UK, the US, India, France and Russia - will be banned. The country closed its borders at the start of its national lockdown - one of the strictest in the world - on 27 March. Although restrictions on movement and business started to be eased from June, borders stayed shut to avoid cases of the virus coming in from abroad. Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor says the reopening of borders will be done ""gradually"". For now, although anyone from African countries is allowed, she says ""only business travellers with scarce and critical skills, diplomats, investors and professional sports people coming for events from the high-risk countries will be permitted into the country"". Those who can travel will have to show evidence of a negative coronavirus test taken fewer than 72 hours before departure. They will also be screened upon arrival, and will need to install a Covid-19 tracing app on their phones. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, responding to the briefing, said the number of cases was ""very concerning"". He said: ""I think everybody can see that and we've all got a duty to follow the government rules, and that's very clear that we stick to that. ""There's got to be - if you like - a national effort to prevent a second lockdown. ""But the government's side of the bargain here is to have a very clear strategy for keeping that infection rate down and we don't see that strategy. ""Very clear communications, and the byword for this week has been, yet again, confusion. ""And test, trace and isolate needs to be fixed urgently."" Lauren MossHealth correspondent, BBC News ""This whole briefing felt very much like a warning,"" says BBC health correspondent Lauren Moss, who notes that more than once, the scientific advisers said we were headed ""in the wrong direction"". She says: ""Prime Minister Boris Johnson said we may be seeing more of these briefings - a bit like we did when there were daily briefings. ""We are not at that point yet, but this is the second one in a week where we have seen the chief scientific officer and the chief medical officer."" While we are not in the same position we were in April or May, hospital admissions are on the rise - with cases rising especially in some areas of the country. But even though certain areas are seeing an increase in cases more than others, it is a national issue, she adds.   Here are the key points from this afternoonâs
press conference in Downing Street: Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson says
the government has over32 billion items of personal protective equipment(PPE) on orderand is building up a four-month stockpile of masks, gowns and
visors. He
also said that - by December - the government expects UK manufacturers to meet
70% of demand for PPE. These
figures come from theDepartment for Health and Social Care's PPE Strategy,external, published yesterday. The
document says that the government has already distributed 3.5 billion items of
PPE, so almost ten times that amount are now on order. Quoting a recent study during the briefing just ended, a journalist from the Times said only a low proportion of people are self-isolating after testing positive. Sir
Patrick Vallance said it was ""very, very important"" that people self-isolate, adding that if they don't it will increase circulation of the virus. He said the study quoted was about ""intent to self-isolate"" from a few months ago, and he believed that more recent data is better. He said isolation was not something that could be ""literally"" enforced upon people, and people have to take accountability. Boris Johnson is asked why it is someone in the North East can't see their parents outside - but they can see five friends in a pub beer garden. He says there are national and local rules and that people will pick upon discrepancies and complexities - but that they should check the guidance online and also use their own common sense. This means they should follow the basics of restricting the possibility of transmission to someone else. The PM also says it is ""vital"" to stress that tackling the pandemic remains a national effort and that ""we all have to fight it together"". ""We can't expect it to be solved"" in the areas under regional lockdowns, he adds, saying ""it's down to all of us"". That was the last question of the briefing - but we will continue to bring you more reaction on it here. Boris Johnson was asked about the number of people not wearing masks on public transport. He urges people to ""please follow the guidance"" and to bear in mind you are not just protecting your neighbour, but you also need to bear in mind that your loved ones could be infected. Fines are now ""considerable"" and ""they will be imposed"", he adds. She also asked if there were concerns the government was not going far, or fast enough. Sir Patrick Vallance said it was ""very clear"" rates are still going up and that ""we don't have this under control"". But he adds that the decisions that need to be made are ""clearly very difficult"" and ""none are risk free"" He says science can provide advice, but ministers need to make decisions. Also in response to Robert Peston, chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance says there is no room for complacency at all right now and that the situation is headed ""in the wrong direction"". He adds: ""This virus spreads because of close contacts in certain environments. We all need to make sure we reduce the number of contacts we have got."" He says it is ""going to be absolutely critical"" that people self-isolate if they have symptoms. Robert Peston from ITV asks why it is that infections seem to be rising more quickly in Scotland rather than in England - and in parts of northern England rather than the south. He also points out daily deaths are now at 71, the same number they were in March, two days before the nation went into lockdown.

"Helen Reddy shot to fame in the 1970s Helen Reddy, the Australian singer behind feminist anthem I Am Woman, has died aged 78. Reddy died on Tuesday in Los Angeles, her family said in a statement on Facebook. Her children Traci Donat and Jordan Sommers described her as a ""wonderful mother, grandmother, and a truly formidable woman"". ""Our hearts are broken. But we take comfort in the knowledge that her voice will live on forever."" Reddy, who had Addison's disease and was diagnosed with dementia in 2015, spent the last years of her life in a celebrity care home in Los Angeles. She had a string of pop-rock hits in the 1970s, but is best known for the 1972 anthem I Am Woman - which became prominent in the women's liberation movement. Helen Reddy became a feminist icon for her trailblazing song A sleeper hit, it went on to sell millions of copies worldwide, making Reddy the biggest-selling female artist globally for two years running. In collecting her 1973 Grammy Award for best female vocalist, Reddy famously thanked ""God because she makes everything possible"". Born in Melbourne in 1941, Reddy grew up in a showbiz family with actor parents, and performed regularly as a child. After winning a talent contest in Australia, her prize ticket took her to New York City in the 1960s, where she auditioned for a recording contract. That opportunity fell through but the soprano decided to stay on in the US, later signing with Capitol Records. 'Hear me roar': Women march for equality Her first hit, I Don't Know How to Love Him, was followed by a succession of others including Crazy Love, Delta Dawn, and Angie Baby. But it was her second hit, I Am Woman, which catapulted her to international fame and became a defining song for a generation of women. Reddy said she had penned the lyrics - with lines such as ""I am woman, hear me roar"" and ""I am strong, I am invincible, I am woman"" - after struggling to find other songs which reflected her pride in being a woman. Among those to pay tribute on Wednesday was Unjoo Moon, who directed a biopic about Reddy - titled I Am Woman - which was released earlier this year. ""She paved the way for so many and the lyrics that she wrote for I Am Woman changed my life forever like they have done for so many other people and will continue to do for generations to come,"" Moon said. Actress Jamie Lee Curtis shared a clip of Reddy singing her anthem at a Women's March protest in Los Angeles in 2017, part of global rallies which directed anger at US President Donald Trump. Reddy with celebrities including Jamie Lee Curtis at a Women's March in 2017 ""Honor of my life. Introducing Helen at the Women's March,"",externalshe wrote, adding: ""Read the lyrics"". Fellow actresses Jane Lynch and Patricia Arquette and 1970s singing group The Pointer Sisters also posted tributes. At the height of her fame, Reddy toured internationally and was a regular guest on Hollywood showcase shows. She hosted a season of the Helen Reddy Show on NBC TV in 1973, and a year later was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Later in her career she also featured in a handful of films and stage musicals.

"Almost one million women in the UK have missed vital breast screening due to coronavirus, a leading charity has estimated. Breast screening programmes were paused in March as the NHS focused resources on tackling the pandemic. Breast Cancer Now calculates that around 8,600 women who have not had a scan have undetected breast cancer. The scanning programme is running again, but social distancing measures have reduced capacity. Combined with the significant backlog of women waiting for a scan, and more women starting to come forward with concerns about possible symptoms, the charity warns the service is under intense pressure. Coronavirus could lead to thousands more cancer deaths Breast screening women in their 40s 'could save lives' Breast cancer diagnosed at a later stage can be harder to treat. Breast Cancer Now estimates that a total of 986,000 women across the UK missed their mammograms due to breast screening programmes being paused. The estimate is based on the average number of women screened per month, and the approximate length of time the screening programme was suspended, in each part of the UK. This breaks down to almost 838,000 women in England, 78,000 in Scotland, 48,000 in Wales and 23,000 in Northern Ireland. Susan's breast cancer has been dealt with speedily after she missed her screening Susan Daniels, from Glynneath, is relieved that she took action when she found a lump in her breast. ""I missed my screening at the beginning of the year due to a house move. So I phoned the Breast Test Wales organisation in March to rebook the screening, but unfortunately the screening services were postponed because of the pandemic,"" she says. Susan then checked and found a small lump in her left breast. ""When I first discovered it, I hoped it would just go away after a couple weeks. I was worried about leaving the house because we were just at the beginning of lockdown. ""But when the lump didn't go away I knew I had to contact my GP, who immediately referred me to the rapid diagnosis, whereupon it was discovered I actually had breast cancer in both breasts. ""From there on in everything was brilliant. It was dealt with speedily. I have been through surgery, and now I am waiting for my course of radiotherapy. ""I urge anyone that has any concerns to contact their GP immediately. If I had left it, who knows where I would be now?"" The charity is calling for an action plan and new resources to tackle the problem. Baroness Delyth Morgan, Breast Cancer Now chief executive, said: ""That nearly one million women across the UK were caught up in the backlog waiting for breast screening is cause for grave concern. ""Mammograms are a key tool in the early detection of breast cancer, which is critical to stopping women dying from the disease. ""We understand that the breast screening programme was paused out of necessity due to the global Covid-19 pandemic, but we must now press play to ensure that all women can access breast screening, and we cannot afford for the programme to be paused again."" Screening typically diagnoses around 19,000 breast cancers a year in England. Mary Wilson, consultant breast radiologist at the Nightingale Centre, Wythenshawe Hospital, said: ""We desperately need more radiologists. You can't make a radiologist quickly, so a long-term investment plan is essential."" A spokesperson for the NHS in England said: ""The vast majority of cancers detected through screening programmes are at a very early stage and so any impact on patients who were due to be screened is extremely low. ""More than 200,000 people were treated for cancer during the peak of the pandemic, breast screening services are now fully up and running with over 400,000 women invited between June and August and thousands more invites are now being sent every month - we would encourage anyone who is invited to book an appointment.""

"This video can not be played The Speaker calls on the government to start ârebuilding the trustâ after accusing it of showing âcontemptâ for the House. The government is treating Parliament with ""contempt"" by rushing through new powers to tackle coronavirus without debate, the Commons Speaker has said. Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he could not give MPs a vote on getting a bigger say on renewing emergency powers later. But it was not a decision he had ""taken lightly"" - and he issued a stern warning to the government to give MPs a chance to debate future policy changes. His ruling ends the prospect of a backbench Conservative rebellion. Dozens of Tory MPs were backing an amendment by senior Tory MP Sir Graham Brady calling for future regulations affecting the whole of England only to be introduced if Parliament has the opportunity to debate and vote on them in advance. Live: Prime Minister's Questions reaction Johnson blunders into the backbenches PM defends 'strong local action' to beat Covid In a statement before Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Lindsay said he was unable to select any amendments ahead of a vote on the renewal of the powers to avoid ""undermining the rule of law"". MPs are due to vote on a motion that will extend the Coronavirus Act, the emergency legislation passed in March, which grants extensive powers to the authorities to tackle Covid, such as closing schools and stopping mass gatherings. Sir Lindsay said any amendment to that motion risked creating uncertainty about the legality of the Act, and potentially opened it up to court challenge. But many of the coronavirus measures introduced since March, such as the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops and the ""rule of six"" limit on gatherings, have been introduced through regulations linked to an older piece of law. These regulations - known as statutory instruments - must be approved by Parliament but are often not debated. Sir Lindsay told MPs: ""The way in which the government has exercised its powers to make secondary legislation during this crisis has been totally unsatisfactory. ""All too often important statutory instruments have been published a matter of hours before they come into force and some explanations as to why important measures have come into effect before they can be laid before this House has been unconvincing and shows a total disregard for the House."" He said he was ""now looking to the government to rebuild trust with the House not treat it with the contempt it has shown"". He encouraged MPs to table more urgent questions and motions to challenge ministers and make them come to the Commons to explain their actions. Allow Twitter content?

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said ""all is not well between Downing Street and the Conservative Party backbenches"" but a compromise between the two sides was expected to be announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock in the Commons shortly. Speaking on Politics Live on BBC Two, she said it was ""fascinating"" that the Speaker is encouraging urgent questions and debates on Covid-19 restrictions, especially as Sir Lindsay Hoyle is not an ""activist speaker"" in the way that his predecessor John Bercow was. A Whitehall source told the BBC there has been ""constructive dialogue"" between the government and potential rebels over how to handle any future Covid-related regulations, and that ""both sides recognise the need to balance proper Parliamentary scrutiny with the government's ability to act swiftly when necessary"". Sir Graham, who is chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, said he remained hopeful that the government will make concessions. In a statement, he said: ""The Speaker set out his reasons for not selecting any amendments but he also made it clear that he expects the government to ensure proper and timely Parliamentary scrutiny. ""I am hopeful that the government will respond appropriately this afternoon."" Conservative MP Steve Baker, one of those seeking more checks over the government's powers, said he was satisfied with the Speaker's ruling. ""Mr Speaker's decision is entirely reasonable and his statement will reassure all MPs supporting Sir Graham. ""I hope and expect to reach a good compromise with the government shortly so we can advance as one team."" The Commons will vote on whether to renew coronavirus legislation passed at the start of the pandemic in March, which gives the government sweeping powers to act but has to be extended every six months. At least 16.6 million people in the UK - about one in four people - are subject to local lockdowns - and a growing number of MPs have expressed their concern that the measures are disproportionate even though they have often been requested by local leaders. MPs are concerned recent interventions - including Wednesday's tightening of restrictions on separate households in the North East of England mixing indoors in public places - have been announced with little warning or debate. Meanwhile, the Lib Dems said they would vote against extending the Coronavirus Act because of the power it gave ministers to ""reduce rights"" for carers.

"Part of a London street is cleared of diners ahead of the 22:00 BST curfew Introducing further Covid restrictions without Parliament's direct approval would ""not be acceptable"", a group of senior MPs has told Boris Johnson. The Commons Liaison Committee says it is concerned about the continued use of emergency powers to curb freedoms. The government is already under pressure from some Tory MPs, who want to be given a vote before any new national measures are brought in. Ministers say they are trying to protect lives amid rising infections. Local lockdowns and tighter restrictions have often been imposed at the request of local leaders. Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the powerful 1922 committee of backbench Conservative MPs, has been holding talks with Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg over a possible ""compromise"" on Parliamentary oversight, ahead of a debate on the government's coronavirus powers later. Hancock pressured to give MPs say over Covid rules  BBC Political EditorLaura Kuenssberg said no resolution had been reached,externalbetween the government and the Tory rebels on Tuesday night. But a further meeting between Conservative MP Steve Baker, a critic of the government's approach, and Chief Whip Mark Spencer is due to take place on Wednesday, she added. BBC Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said it looked as though progress was being made towards an agreement that would allow MPs to vote on new restrictions outside of an emergency. He said MPs could possibly be given a retrospective vote after any new national restrictions were introduced. ""What that would mean is that restrictions would be made into law by a minister, but then you would set a future commencement date - and in between those two dates, MPs would have a vote,"" he said. The government is facing growing calls for more Parliamentary scrutiny of its Covid policies, amid concerns that recent interventions, such as the ""rule of six"" limit on social gatherings, the 22:00 BST closing time for pubs and local restrictions in the North East, have been announced with a few hours' notice and without being considered by MPs. ""He's making it too easy."" The prime minister rather made the case for some of the malcontents in his own party today, as one of the key rebels joked. One of the organisers behind backbench moves for more of a say over how the government is handling the pandemic claimed thatBoris Johnson's North East coronavirus restrictions blunderunderlined their contention - the rules are too complicated, too arbitrary, and haven't been put through the normal grinder of political logic. Mr Johnson said sorry for getting it wrong shortly after he ""misspoke"" (political speak for getting it wrong), but it gave more immediate ammunition to the opposition too, who accused the prime minister of ""gross incompetence"". It seems unlikely that his comments are going to help the public's sense that the rules are clear, firm, and important to follow. Read more from Laura here. Later, the Commons will vote on whether to renew coronavirus legislation passed at the start of the pandemic, which gives the government sweeping powers to act, amid talk of a possible rebellion by Tory MPs. Sir Graham has warned that the government is increasingly ""ruling by decree"" and multiple restrictions across different parts of England are causing confusion and potential long-term economic damage. He wants a commitment from ministers that future regulations affecting the whole of England or the UK can only be introduced if Parliament has the opportunity to debate and vote on them in advance. However, it is not clear whether his amendment, which reportedly has the backing of dozens of Conservatives, will be selected to be put to a vote by Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle. The Liaison Committee, made up of MPs who chair Commons select committees, has added to the growing pressure on the PM by urging him to accept a ""suitable amendment"" to the legislation before Wednesday's debate on it. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? In a letter to the PM, the committee's Conservative chairman Sir Bernard Jenkin said there had been ""minimal scrutiny"" of March's Coronavirus Act and there was growing concern about the government's ability to ""apply the most exceptional restrictions on individuals and families, with severe consequences for their livelihoods and quality of life"". ""At the outset of the crisis, such measures without Parliamentary scrutiny or control were more acceptable than now,"" he wrote. ""The idea that such restrictions can be applied without express Parliamentary approval, except in dire emergency, is not widely acceptable and indeed may be challenged in law. ""Various proposals are being made that would require the approval by a vote of the House of Commons before or immediately after new restrictions come into force. ""The majority of us support this principle and expect that the government will also wish to accept it."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the government is looking at further ways the Commons can be ""properly involved in the process in advance where possible"". In other key developments: New coronavirus restrictionshave come into force across the north east of England, with people no longer allowed to meet other households indoors - and discouraged from doing so outdoors Four council areas in north Wales will enter local lockdownsfrom Thursday evening, affecting half a million people.

"President Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden have gone head-to-head in the first of three televised debates before the US election in November. During a heated 90 minutes, the nominees clashed over everything from the state of the economy to the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Reality Check has unpicked some of their claims. Verdict: That's not right - there have been times in US history when the economy was stronger. Before the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump claimed to have generated historic economic growth. It's true the economy was doing well before the pandemic - continuing a trend that began during the Obama administration - but there have been periods when it was much stronger. The economy under Trump in six charts Verdict: This is roughly correct. But looking at coronavirus deaths per capita, there are a number of countries which are worse than the US. Mr Biden criticised President Trump's management of the coronavirus response. According to the figures, his claim is about right. The US population is around 328 million, which is just over 4% of the 7.7 billion global population. There have been 205,942 coronavirus deaths recorded in the US, according to the latest John Hopkins University data. The total number of deaths recorded worldwide is 1,004,808. On this metric, the US accounts for about 20% of Covid-19 deaths worldwide, although the way countries record their figures varies considerably. Here'smore fact-checking of President Trump's coronavirus claims. Who is ahead in the polls - Trump or Biden? Verdict: Studies have not found evidence of widespread fraud, although there have been isolated cases. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, a large proportion of US voters are expected to use postal voting in this year's election. The president has repeatedly warned that this will lead to widespread fraud. There have been isolated cases of fraud including recent examples in North Carolina and New Jersey. In September, the US Department of Justice released a statement about an incident in Pennsylvania in which ""nine military ballots were discarded"" and said seven of them ""were cast for presidential candidate Donald Trump"". But despite such incidents, numerous studies have not revealed evidence of major, widespread fraud. The rate of voting fraud overall in the US is between 0.00004% and 0.0009%, according to a2017 study,externalby the Brennan Center for Justice. Do postal ballots lead to voting fraud? Verdict: There is no definitive answer to this. The candidates clashed over how many people in the US have pre-existing medical conditions, which can stop some Americans from being covered by private medical insurers. Mr Biden said there were 100 million people with pre-existing conditions, but President Trump said that number was ""totally wrong"". So how many are there? There is no definitive answer. According to the US government's Department of Health and Human Services, between 50 and 129 million non-elderly Americans have some type of pre-existing health condition. Other organisations have different estimates.The Center for American Progress believes,externalit is higher, at 135 million people under age 65. Verdict: There is a ""very, very low chance"" of an approved vaccine being ready by the end of October, the chief scientific adviser to the US vaccine programme has said. Moncef Slaouimade this cautious assessment in early September,external. Meanwhile, Dr Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert, has predicted the US will know if it has a safe and effective jab by November or December this year. He told a Senate committee hearing this month there might be enough doses for every American by April. Verdict: That's not right, according to the figures. Democratic candidate Joe Biden suggested that even before Covid-19, ""manufacturing went into a hole"". The pandemic did have an impact on this sector. As of August,there were 237,000 fewer manufacturing jobs in the US than when Trump took office in 2017.,external But prior to the outbreak, President Trump had added almost half a million manufacturing jobs during his first three years in office. Verdict: That's not right. The sheriff of Multnomah County, which includes the city of Portland, says this is not true. In defending his approach to tackling protests in US cities, Mr Trump said he'd had widespread support from law enforcement groups. He claimed this included the sheriff in charge of law enforcement in Portland, which has become a flashpoint for demonstrations against police brutality and racism in recent months. Mike Reese, the sheriff for Multnomah Countryswiftly denied this on Twitter,external: ""I have never supported Donald Trump and will never support him."" Allow Twitter content?

He did use the word ""predators"" but did not use this to refer to African-Americans. In 1993 Mr Biden warned of ""predators on our streets,external"" during a speech before a vote on the key crime bill in Congress. There was no specific mention of African-Americans but the crime bill waslater criticised for increasing mass incarcerationwhich disproportionately affected African-American men. The term ""super-predator"" was used by Hillary Clinton in 1996 in support of the controversial bill. Ms Clinton said: ""We need to take these people on. They are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called super-predators - no conscience, no empathy."" Verdict: The average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell slightly in the year to August 2019, although it then rose again. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI) - which measures the cost of household items in the US - the average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell by 0.3% in the year to August 2019. This was the first price decrease over a 12-month period since 1973. While average drug prices rose by 1.5% over the following year, under President Trump the average rises have been lower than under President Obama. The CPI is not necessarily the most reliable way to measure drug prices, as it mainly includes widely used drugs, which are usually cheaper. It is less likely to include newer or less-prescribed drugs, which are more expensive and have higher price increases. Verdict:  Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's second son, was discharged from the navy after failing a drug test, but not dishonourably discharged. President Trump brought up Hunter during an exchange about Beau, Joe Biden's eldest son, who served in the US military and died of cancer in 2015. Mr Biden replied that it was not true that Hunter had been dishonourably discharged. Hunter Biden was discharged from the US Navy in 2014, and media reports at the timesaid that a navy drug test had detected the presence of cocaine.,external However, he was not dishonourably discharged, which is the highest level of punishment the military can hand out.

"Walt Disney has announced it will lay off 28,000 employees, mostly at its US theme parks. Disney cited the parks' limited visitor capacity and uncertainty about how long the coronavirus pandemic would last as reasons for the layoffs. The company's theme parks have taken a major hit from the pandemic. Disney shut all its parks earlier this year as the virus spread, but only Disneyland in California remains closed. ""We have made the very difficult decision to begin the process of reducing our workforce at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment at all levels,"" Josh D'Amaro, chairman of the parks unit, said in a statement. The layoffs apply to ""domestic employees"" of which about 67% are part-time. Disney also has parks in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Paris, which are not affected by the announcement. Hong Kong Disney reopened last week after shutting down for a second time in July due to a spike in Covid-19 cases. Except for Disneyland in California, all of the company's parks have now reopened, although visitor numbers are limited to allow for social distancing. Disney focuses on streaming as it falls to a loss Walt Disney World reopens in Florida amid Covid-19 surge Disney lost $4.7bn (Â£3.6bn) in the three months to 27 June, with revenues for its Parks, Experiences and Products division plummeting 85% compared to the same quarter in 2019. Mr D'Amaro said the company's problems were ""exacerbated in California by the state's unwillingness to lift restrictions that would allow Disneyland to reopen."" Disney has been working to persuade California to allow the company to reopen Disneyland. Are you a Disney employee? Have you been affected by the issues raised here?

"This video can not be played ""Shut up, man"" and other insults and interruptions In a debate that was the political equivalent of a food fight, the winner was the man who emerged least covered in slop. On Tuesday night, on the basis of instant polls and betting markets, that man was Joe Biden - if only because his main goal was to prove to Americans that he could hold up under pressure, that he had not lost a step due to his advancing age. He had to show he could take a pie to the face, metaphorically speaking, and keep his cool. He mostly met that standard, although it was at least in part because Donald Trump, by his constant hectoring and interruptions, seldom gave the former vice-president a chance to say something truly damaging to his own cause. Twitter Trump - the unconventional, bombastic, insulting and rumour-mongering aspect of this president - was on full display throughout the hour-and-a-half event. Unfortunately for the president, many Americans, even his own supporters, find his social media persona one of his more unattractive attributes. Trump needed this debate to shake up a race that is tilting against him - and which has been remarkably stable, through economic, health and social adversity. Nothing about this free-for-all seems likely to alter the dynamics of this contest or change the minds of the one in 10 American voters who say they are still undecided (although perhaps they'll resolve never to watch another one of these). LIVE updates, analysis and reaction Trump and Biden clash angrily on Covid and race Fact-checking the candidates' claims It was clear early on what kind of ""debate"" this would be. Donald Trump's objective was to rattle Joe Biden - and he planned to do it by constantly interrupting the former vice-president. By CBS News's count, Trump cut in on Biden a total of 73 times. That made for a series of chaotic exchanges, which included Trump questioning Biden's intelligence and Biden calling Trump a clown, shushing him and asking, indignantly: ""Will you shut up, man?"" Time and time again, Trump would snipe at Biden, leaving the Democrat laughing and shaking his head. As moderator Chris Wallace announced that the coronavirus was the next topic and that both candidates would have two-and-a-half uninterrupted minutes to answer, Biden quipped: ""Good luck with that."" Moderating this prestigious primetime event may have been the worst job in America on Tuesday night. The coronavirus was always going to be difficult terrain for the president - and the topic came up early in the debate. Trump had to defend a pandemic response that has resulted in more than 200,000 American deaths. He did so by saying the steps he's taken prevented more deaths and suggesting Biden would have made things worse. Biden's reply was to talk directly at the camera, asking the viewers if they could believe Trump (polls indicate a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the pandemic). Brian Chellgren - an attorney and a conservative-leaning moderate:It was expected to be chaotic, and it was chaotic. Trump controlled the message with more interrupting, talking and controlling. Biden withstood it better than I thought he would. He got a little hot in the collar a few times. I didn't see any big eye-catching gaffes. I thought Biden had a good few periods where he aimed his message directly at the camera and to the public. Keirsten Greggs - a talent recruiter and a progressive voter:At the end of the day, the loser was really us, the American people. A lot of people were expecting this to go the way that it did. Joshua Roizman - a recent college graduate voting for Biden:Biden came out on top. He came out with a strong message and I can't tell you enough how much it mattered that he looked into the camera. Ariel Hedlund - right-leaning independent voting for Trump:I think Trump's strongest point was when he talked about what he accomplished and what he will accomplish. On the other hand, Biden did really well when he spoke directly to the American people but he never gave us details and facts. I must say Vice-President Biden did much better than I expected. Read the BBC voters' panel views in full here. ""A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker,"" said Biden. In one telling exchange, Trump boasted about the size of his campaign rallies, held outside because that's what the ""experts"" - with emphasis on that word - suggest. He then said Biden held smaller rallies because he couldn't attract larger crowds. ""People want their places open,"" Trump said. ""People want to be safe,"" Biden countered. That back-and-forth demonstrated a fundamental difference in the way the two candidates view the pandemic and whether the situation is getting better - or worse. A debate format that lumped together race issues and urban violence led to feisty exchanges that made clear Biden was more comfortable talking about the former, while Trump wanted to discuss the latter. Biden accused the president of fomenting racist divisions, while Trump swiped at Biden's support for a 1993 anti-crime bill that led to higher incarceration rates for black people. Biden would later go on the attack against Trump for saying Democratic-backed housing proposals meant to increase diversity were threatening to destroy the suburbs of American cities. ""This is not 1950, all these dog-whistles and racism don't work anymore,"" Biden said. ""The suburbs are by and large integrated."" He added that the real threat to the suburbs was Covid-19 and climate change. This video can not be played Trump: ""I don't know who the Proud Boys are"" Trump was offered the chance to directly renounce right-wing violence - from white supremacists and militias. He said he would, but then he didn't, instead telling one far-right group, the Proud Boys, to ""stand back and stand by"" (an answer the organisation has subsequently celebrated). Trump then pivoted to attack antifa, a loose collection of anti-fascist activists, and left-wing mobs. When Biden was asked about whether, as the self-professed leader of the Democratic Party, he had called on the mayor of Portland or the governor of Oregon to take steps to stop the unrest in that city, he demurred, saying he no longer held elective office. Wallace had given both candidates a chance to cut against their own bases, which can at times be a wise political strategy. Instead, they both dodged and danced. The death of George Floyd and resulting conversations about institutional racism and police violence led to mass demonstrations the likes of which the US has not seen in decades. Tuesday's debate shed little light on those history-making moments. A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Why we might not get a result on election night Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? What Joe Biden wants to do Full coverage of the US election If there's a message the Trump campaign wanted Americans to take away from this debate - a clip that was tweeted out from the president's account even as the debate was ongoing - it's that Joe Biden had almost half a century in public office to solve the problems facing the country, and those problems are still around. ""In 47 months, I've done more than you've done in 47 years,"" Trump told the vice-president. Biden's response came later in the debate. ""Under this president we've become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided and more violent,"" he said. In 2016, Trump successfully ran against Washington and the status quo. Doing so again after sitting in the Oval Office for three-and-a-half years was always going to be a challenge, but the way he might pull it off is by using Biden's longevity in public life against him. This video can not be played President Donald Trump clashes with moderator Chris Wallace. One of Trump's goals during this debate - and throughout the whole campaign - has been to paint Biden as beholden to the left wing of his party. Biden, in his very first exchange with the president, outlined his defence. The opening topic for tonight's debate was the Supreme Court, but Biden quickly turned the discussion to the Affordable Care Act - which is at risk because of a pending case before the high court. Trump tried to accuse Biden of supporting ""socialised medicine"" and pushing to do away with private insurance, prompting the Democrat to say that wasn't in his plan - and he's the one who won the Democratic presidential nomination. ""I am the Democratic Party right now,"" he said. ""The platform of the Democratic Party is what I approved."" The tactic re-emerged later on, during an exchange on climate change, when Trump tried to tie Biden to the massive spending and regulation proposals in the ""Green New Deal"" programme embraced by many on the left. ""I don't support the Green New Deal,"" Biden said. ""I support the Biden plan I put forward."" ""Oh, you don't?"" Trump asked. ""Well, that's a big statement."" Biden, in drawing distinction with progressives in his party, seemed confident that his left flank would hold when it was time to vote. When the New York Times story about Trump's taxes broke on Sunday night, it was viewed as a bombshell - the public was finally getting a look at information the president had, in a break with tradition, withheld for years. Political analysts and prognosticators wondered how Trump would handle this during the debate. When the topic came up, however, Donald Trump offered a similar defence to the one he provided in 2016, when he boasted how he knew the tax code better than any previous candidate - and his ability to avoid a larger tax bill was simply his taking advantage of the law. Biden, for his part, tried to turn the topic into a condemnation of Republican-passed tax reform. While he noted that Trump paid less in federal taxes than schoolteachers, that message - which could have been a powerful attack - got buried in an ensuing scuffle with the president. If Trump's tax returns have any legs as an issue in this campaign, it won't be because of this debate. The closing segment of the debate was on election security and concerns - presented by both the left and the right - that the election will not be free and fair. When it came to the details of the discussion, if you can call it that, they mostly revolved around Trump sharing a series of misleading anecdotes that he says demonstrated that mail-in voting, which millions of Americans will rely on this year, is fraught with corruption and incompetence. ""This will not end well,"" Trump said at one point - a sentiment that many Americans on both sides of the political aisle will agree with, albeit for different reasons. Biden, for his part, tried to take the high ground. He called for all the ballots to be counted and promised to respect the results of the election once a winner had been decided. It seemed he had a few more points to make in conclusion, but Trump interrupted him again and then Wallace announced the debate was over. It was a sudden end to a chaotic evening that can hardly be called a debate in any traditional sense of the word. These events rarely swing an election one way or another, and this one was such a muddled mess it seems unlikely minds were changed. That's probably bad news for Trump, given that one of his real weaknesses has been with suburban woman voters who say they're turned off by the president's sometimes coarse manner. Then again, if Trump's goal was to turn this campaign into an ugly scrum, leaving voters alienated from the process and uncertain about whether there will be any kind of clarity or resolution at the end, it was an evening's work well done.

"The long-awaited battle between Donald Trump and Joe Biden was scrappy and acrimonious They clashed over Covid, crime, healthcare, their families - and even with the moderator Far-right group Proud Boys celebrated on social media after President Trump sidestepped condemning them by name Fox News anchor Chris Wallace had his hands full throughout as Biden and Trump interrupted each other Low points included Biden telling Trump to 'shut up' and Trump questioning his intelligence Tens of millions of US voters were expected to have tuned in to watch the event in Cleveland, Ohio Edited by Mal Siret That's all from us. Our live coverage has come to an end. We hope you tune in for the next election debate - the race for the White House could still go either way. This live page was brought to you by Ritu Prasad, Holly Honderich, Sam Proffitt, Marianna Brady, Max Matza, Boer Deng, Matt Davis, Joshua Nevett, Mal Siret, Anthony Zurcher, Georgina Rannard, Rebecca Seales, Vicky Baker, Jessica Murphy and Jessica Lussenhop. Many thanks for reading. We're ending our live coverage of the debate and its aftermath soon. Thanks for joining us for what proved to be an explosive encounter between two bitter rivals for the US presidency. Before we wrap up, here is a summary of some of the key moments before, during and after the debate in Cleveland, Ohio. For more on the first debate, you can read ournews story,analysisand trove of explainers - including those onhow the US election worksandthe latest polling data. Reality Check After polls close in the US presidential election, it could take days - or even weeks - to find out if Joe Biden or Donald Trump has won. Millions more Americans are expected to vote by post because of coronavirus, meaning a delay in counting all the votes is highly likely. Will the winner be announced on 3 November? It's very possible that it won't. Although the result
of a US presidential vote is usually known on the night of the election, this
year is very different with so many votes being cast by post. In 2016, nearly a quarter of votes were cast by post. It's estimated
that this time it could be more than double â around 80 million â as states
employ measures to limit the spread of coronavirus. There are also concerns that the US Postal Service,
responsible for delivering the postal ballots, will struggle to cope with the
demand. It has faced budget cutbacks and critics of Trump have
accused him of deliberately blocking additional funding. Most states only include ballots received by the time polls
close on election day. But some, like California, will accept them as long
as they are sent by the day of the election, even if they arrive a week later. Will Trump try to overturn
the results and ask for a recount of sorts? This is unknown. Trump has made clear his mistrust
of the postal voting system and says there will be ""tremendous"" fraud involved.
This could be the basis of a challenge to the result if he loses. When asked if he would commit to a peaceful transfer of
power if he loses the election, Trump said: ""We'll have to see what
happens"". He also said the election result could end up in the US Supreme
Court as a result of doubts over the integrity of postal voting. A recount of votes would certainly delay the outcome, but is
not unprecedented. In 2000, a dispute in Florida took more than a month to
resolve before George W Bush was ultimately declared the winner. There is no love lost between Trump and Biden With round one of debating over, Trump and Biden are approaching the final strait of the race for the White House. The presidential election is now just 34 days away, giving Trump and Biden little time to dust themselves down for their next head-to-head clash. Two presidential debates remain on the agenda:  Vice-President Mike Pence and Biden's running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, will also lock horns in a debate:  Like the first debate in Ohio, they will all take place from 21:00-22:30ET (02:00-03:30BST), with no commercial interruptions. Expect more sparks to fly. This year's US presidential election could come down to results in just a few key states.
Most states are tipped to vote one way or another - so we have already assigned 188 votes to Trump and 233 to Biden. Can Biden wrestle enough away to seize the presidency? Or will Trump romp home to a second term?
It's all about the race to 270 electoral votes - and this time you decide. Play our game to predict whether Trump or Biden will win,externalthe key states at the election. As the presidential election draws closer, you may be asking yourself: how does it all work? Well, we've put together areally simple guide to the election, which could shape the US and the world for years to come. By now, you probably know the candidates are incumbent Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden. When Americans go to the polls on 3 November, they will cast ballots for a group of officials who represent Trump and Biden in the electoral college. Each state gets a certain number of electoral-college votes partly based on its population. There are a total of 538 votes up for grabs, so the victor is the candidate that wins 270 or more. This means voters decide state-level contests rather than the national one, which is why it's possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally - in what is called the popular vote - but still be defeated by the electoral college. Got it? If not, you canread more about how the electoral college works here. Voters around the US tuned in to see President Donald Trump and former
Vice-President Joe Biden spar in the first presidential debate. As the exchange came to a close, we asked members of the BBC voter panel
how the candidates performed - and if their answers had swayed their vote. Keirsten,
undecided voter:""I definitely
think Biden won the debate, but I don't think that was hard to do because there
wasnât a lot that I was expecting from Donald Trump. At the end of the 'day the
loser was really us, the American people. A lot of people were expecting this
to go the way that it did."" Brian,
undecided voter:""I wouldn't
call anyone a winner. It was expected to be chaotic, [and] it was chaotic.
Trump controlled the message with more interrupting, talking and controlling.
Biden withstood it better than I thought he would. He got a little hot in the
collar a few times but I didnât see any big eye-catching gaffes. I thought Biden
had a good few moments where he looked directly at the camera and aimed his
message at the public. I think both sides will say they win, but itâs like
comparing apples to oranges."" Ariel, Trump voter:""I thought nobody won
the debate. I really understand that Trump is not a very seasoned politician.
When he did his best was when he was talking about his policies, what heâs done
and what heâs going to do. But there were other times Biden would say something
and heâd try to debunk it."" Josh, Biden
voter:""Biden came
out on top. He came out with a strong message and I can't tell you enough how
much it mattered that he looked into the camera. Trump was disrespecting Chris
Wallace. We already knew he's disrespectful but now America all watched him
disrespect Chris Wallace at the same time."" Meet the voters we watched the debate with. Peskov said Russia did not wish to intervene in US affairs The Russian government is watching the presidential campaign in the US closely, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman has said in the wake of the first debate. ""But we do not want to make any statements as this could be viewed as an attempt to intervene [into the election process],"" Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday,according to Reuters news agency,external. ""Russia has never, is not and is not going to intervene in US domestic affairs,"" he added. That statement contradicts US intelligence agencies, which accused Russia's government of interfering in the 2016 presidential election. Intelligence chiefs said Russia wanted to help boost Trump's campaign, including by spreading disinformation online, but the Kremlin has denied the allegations. In August, the head of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) saidRussia was among several countries seeking to influence the presidential election this year. Trump cut a confrontation figure in the first debate We can bring you some more reaction from Robin Wright, a foreign affairs analyst who has written extensively about the upcoming election. She has seen many debates in her time, yet none were more dispiriting than this one. It was, she said, ""one of the lowest points in presidential debate history"". She said the chaotic bust-up not only raised questions about the future of presidential debates, but the future of America's political system. ""It's hard to absorb what has just happened and I suspect that is even more true of people watching around the world who once thought that America had the kind of democracy, even if flawed, that they aspired to,"" Wright told the BBC. ""This was not just 90 minutes of chaos,"" she added. ""It was America, the history of America in 2020."" Both Democrat and Republican supporters have been having their say on the presidential debate. Naturally, the reaction has been partisan on both sides. Here's what some observers told the BBC and other news agencies. Republicans Randi Reed is a Republican and a Trump supporter from Nevada. She described the debate as a ""kindergarten cat fight"". She said the president's ""gunning for the jugular"" was ""exactly what we expected from Trump - the rude, crude interrupting"". ""We went in knowing who we were supporting,"" she said. Doug Miller has served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention, he told AFP news agency he ""thought the president performed very well"". ""But I feel for most of the evening, he was not only debating 'Sleepy Joe Biden', he was having to debate [moderator] Chris Wallace, who I think is a total fool,"" he said. Democrats Bilal Aksoy is a student and a registered Democrat voter in Pennsylvania. He said the debate only served to reinforce the views he held about both candidates. ""I knew that Trump didn't believe in science. He refuses to acknowledge climate change and he refuses to act on the global pandemic that we're living through,"" he said. Jamal Simmons is a Democratic Party strategist who has worked as an adviser to former President Barack Obama's campaign. He said Trump missed opportunities to reach out to undecided voters. ""I think Donald Trump went out for a boxing match, went out to just clinch it up for as many rounds as he could,"" he said. Reality Check During an exchange about Biden's eldest son Beau, who served in the US military and died of cancer in 2015, Trump brought up Biden's other son, Hunter. Trump: ""I don't know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the militaryâ¦ dishonourably dischargedâ¦ for cocaine use."" Biden replied that it was not true that his son had been dishonourably discharged. Hunter Biden was discharged from the US Navy in 2014, and media reports at the timesaid that a navy drug test had detected the presence of cocaine.,external However, he was not dishonourably discharged, which is the highest level of punishment the military can hand out. Readmore about the claims made throughout the debate here. ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by,"" Trump said in response to a question asking him to condemn white supremacist and militia groups. The Proud Boys is a far-right, anti-immigrant group witha history of street violence against its left-wing opponents. Trumpâs apparent refusal to denounce the group proved to be one of the most controversial and hotly debated moments of the first debate. In case you missed it, here's a video of the exchange with debate moderator Chris Wallace. This video can not be played 'Proud Boys, stand back and stand by' - Trump Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington Joe Biden makes a trip to China while serving as Barack Obama's vice-president Like Donald Trump, Joe Biden wants to end the forever wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but he would keep a small troop presence in both to help battle terrorism. On Russia, the relationship at the top would certainly look different, likely little else. President Trump often seemed ready to personally forgive Vladimir Putin for violating international norms. But his administration punished Russia with sanctions, and that would probably continue under a Biden presidency. On China there is rare bipartisan agreement to get tough with Beijing over trade and other issues, the question is about tactics. Biden would continue President Trump's policy of countering China's ""abusive economic practices"", but jointly with allies, as opposed to Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals. The sharp elbows of the Trump administration have been successful in winning global support for a boycott of Chinese communications technology. That's part of a serious escalation in US efforts to push back against Beijing on many fronts, anchored in accusations that it mishandled the Coronavirus. This campaign is led by Mr Trump's China hawks: strategic competition they call it; strategic confrontation, is how some analysts describe it. Mr Biden would more actively seek areas of cooperation with a rising China. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring This Channel One news ticker reads: ""The debate has been dubbed the most scandalous in US history."" The Trump-Biden
debate is a lead story on Russian TV this morning, with news bulletins focusing
on the chaotic nature of the event. State TV's Channel
One: ""A political theatre of the absurd. A verbal duel which has been dubbed
the most scandalous in the history of election campaigning in the USâ¦ The most
important political show in the presidential race has probably never been so
chaotic before."" Pro-Kremlin NTV
television: ""There was no constructive dialogue. The rivals kept interrupting
each other and instead of a balanced discussion they chose the path of mutual
insults."" Channel 5, St
Petersburg: ""The rivals have crossed all boundaries."" Pro-Kremlin Ren TV: ""The election debate between Biden and Trump has been called America's greatest
disgrace."" Presidential debates have captivated Americans for decades. They can be bruising, gruelling and sometimes explosive affairs - as last night's debate between Biden and Trump proved. Over the years, some debates have stood out more than others. The first ever televised debate in 1960 pitted young Democratic SenatorJohn F Kennedyagainst the sitting vice-president, RepublicanRichard Nixon. Kennedy's team made sure he looked fresh for the close-ups, while Nixon, who was recovering from an illness, donned an ill-fitting suit and was seen wiping sweat from his brow. Kennedy did see a jump in the polls after the debates, even though we can't say for certain it was due to his prowess. Nixon (L) and Kennedy locked horns in 1960 In 2000, Democratic candidateAl Gore's debate performance againstGeorge W Bushmay have cost him the presidency. His sighing and eye-rolling during his Republican counterpart's responses came across as condescending to many voters (and made it into a Saturday Night Live comedy sketch). The significance of the first Trump-Biden debate will become clearer when the dust settles. Now we turn to BBC Reality Check's examination of some of the claims made by Biden during the first debate. Biden: ""We have 4% of the world's population, [but] 20% of the [Covid-19] deaths."" Verdict:This is roughly correct. But looking at coronavirus deaths per capita, there are a number of countries which are worse than the US. Biden:""Manufacturing went into a hole"" before coronavirus. Verdict:That's not right, according to the figures. Prior to the outbreak, President Trump had added almost half a million manufacturing jobs during his first three years in office. Biden:""Trump hasn't lowered drug prices for anyone."" Verdict:The average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell slightly in the year to August 2019, although it then rose again. For a more detailed take on Bidenâs claims,see here. BBC Reality Check has been verifying some of the claims made by both Trump and Biden during the first debate. Firstly, let's look at some of the claims Trump made. Trump:""We built the greatest economy in history."" Verdict:That's not right - there have been times in US history when the economy was stronger, as the chart below shows. Trump:Postal ballots increase will cause ""a fraud like you've never seen"". Verdict:Studies have not found evidence of widespread fraud, although there have been isolated cases. Trump:""We're weeks away from a vaccine."" Verdict:There is a ""very, very low chance"" of an approved vaccine being ready by the end of October, the chief scientific adviser to the US vaccine programme has said. For more clarity on claims made in the debate,read BBC Reality Check's fuller analysis. Harris said Biden was prepared to engage with the Black Lives Matter movement Senator Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's vice-presidential running mate, has rebuked President Trump for failing to condemn white supremacists during the first debate. In one of the most talked about exchanges of the night, the president was asked by the moderator, Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, if he was prepared to condemn white supremacists. He initially said he would, but when asked to denounce the far-right Proud Boys group by name, he told those affiliated with it to ""stand back and stand by"". Those who support the group later expressed their allegiance to Trump on social media. In an interview with CNN,external, Harris said Trump's comments illustrated the contrast between him and Biden, who was ""not afraid to speak the phrase Black Lives Matter"". ""I heard what we all heard, the president of the United States, in the year of our Lord 2020, refuses to condemn white supremacists,"" Harris said. ""People talk about, 'is he dog whistling?',"" she added. ""Dog whistling through a bullhorn is what he's doing."" James RobbinsDiplomatic Correspondent If Donald Trump wins a second
term, the only safe prediction is that relations with Britain will remain
utterly unpredictable. Normally, Downing Street and
the Foreign Office would have a fair idea what to expect from a re-elected
American president and commander-in-chief. With Trump, however, all bets
are off. The certainties are that Joe
Biden's promise to take the US back into the Paris Climate Change accord will
most definitely not be the path Trump follows. So, British hopes for a
far more ambitious and more broadly based outcome from next year's United
Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow - with the US on board
again - will be dashed if it's still President Trump in the White House. More than that, a naturally
divisive Trump in his second term will surely not retreat from his open
scorn for the global institutions. The longer that
remains the case, the more other democracies, including Britain, think they
have to lose in competition with the rising power of autocrats and
protectionists of varying degree spread around the world. Publicly, of course, any
British prime minister will commit to working very closely with the leader of
the United States. But a second-term President
Trump, emboldened by a new mandate and also freed from any constraint imposed
by worry over a further electoral test, is hardly likely to be any easier an
adversary in the continuing tough negotiations over a new UK/US trade
agreement. Chlorinated chicken will remain firmly on the menu America would
like to serve up to the UK consumer. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Whenthe New York Times story,externalabout Donald Trump's taxes broke on Sunday night, it was viewed as a bombshell - the public was finally getting a look at information the president - in a break with tradition - had withheld for years. The Times said Trump paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. The records reveal ""chronic losses and years of tax avoidance"",the paper said.

"The government has considered building an asylum processing centre on a remote UK territory in the Atlantic Ocean. The idea of ""offshoring"" people is being looked at but finding a suitable location would be key, a source said. Home Secretary Priti Patel asked officials to look at asylum policies which had been successful in other countries, the BBC has been told. The Financial Times says,externalAscension Island, more than 4,000 miles (6,000km) from the UK, was a suggested location. What happens to migrants who reach the UK? More migrants arrive in September than all of 2019 Fleeing the Syrian war for Belfast The Foreign Office is understood to have carried out an assessment for Ascension - which included the practicalities of transferring migrants thousands of miles to the island - and decided not to proceed. However, a Home Office source said ministers were looking at ""every option that can stop small boat crossings and fix the asylum system"". ""The UK has a long and proud history of offering refuge to those who need protection. Tens of thousands of people have rebuilt their lives in the UK and we will continue to provide safe and legal routes in the future. ""As ministers have said we are developing plans to reform policies and laws around illegal migration and asylum to ensure we are able to provide protection to those who need it, while preventing abuse of the system and the criminality associated with it."" No final decisions have been made. Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""This ludicrous idea is inhumane, completely impractical and wildly expensive - so it seems entirely plausible this Tory government came up with it."" Alan Nicholls, a member of the Ascension Island council, said moving asylum seekers more than 4,000 miles to the British overseas territory would be a ""logistical nightmare"" and not well received by the islanders. He also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the presence of military bases on the island could make the concept ""prohibitive"" due to security concerns. Australia hascontroversially used offshore processing and detention centres for asylum seekerssince the 1980s. A United Nations refugee agency representative to the UK, Rossella Pagliuchi-Lor, said the proposal would breach the UK's obligations to asylum seekers and would ""change what the UK is - its history and its values"". Speaking to the UK Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee, she said the Australian model had ""brought about huge suffering for people, who are guilty of no more than seeking asylum, and it has also cost huge amounts of money"". The volcanic island has no indigenous population, and the people that live there - fewer than 1,000 - are the employees and families of the organisations operating on the island The military airbase is jointly operated by the RAF and the US, and has been used as a staging post to supply and defend the Falkland Islands Its first human inhabitants arrived in 1815, when the Royal Navy set up camp to keep watch on Napoleon, who was imprisoned on the island of St Helena some 800 miles away It is home to a BBC transmitter - the BBC Atlantic Relay station - which sends shortwave radio to Africa and South America The proposal comes amid record numbers of migrants makingthe journey across the English Channel to the UK in small boats this month,which Ms Patel has vowed to stop. Laura Trott, Conservative MP for Sevenoaks in Kent, said it was ""absolutely right"" that the government was looking at offshore asylum centres to ""reduce the pressure"" on Kent, which was ""unable to take any more children into care"". In order to be eligible for asylum in the UK, applicants must prove they cannot return to their home country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender identity or sexual orientation. Asylum seekers cannot work while their claims are being processed, so the government offers them a daily allowance of just over Â£5 and accommodation, often in hostels or shared flats. Delays in processing UK asylum applications increased significantly last year with four out of five applicants in the last three months of 2019 waiting six months or more for their cases to be processed.

"This video can not be played ""Shut up, man"" and other insults and interruptions In a debate that was the political equivalent of a food fight, the winner was the man who emerged least covered in slop. On Tuesday night, on the basis of instant polls and betting markets, that man was Joe Biden - if only because his main goal was to prove to Americans that he could hold up under pressure, that he had not lost a step due to his advancing age. He had to show he could take a pie to the face, metaphorically speaking, and keep his cool. He mostly met that standard, although it was at least in part because Donald Trump, by his constant hectoring and interruptions, seldom gave the former vice-president a chance to say something truly damaging to his own cause. Twitter Trump - the unconventional, bombastic, insulting and rumour-mongering aspect of this president - was on full display throughout the hour-and-a-half event. Unfortunately for the president, many Americans, even his own supporters, find his social media persona one of his more unattractive attributes. Trump needed this debate to shake up a race that is tilting against him - and which has been remarkably stable, through economic, health and social adversity. Nothing about this free-for-all seems likely to alter the dynamics of this contest or change the minds of the one in 10 American voters who say they are still undecided (although perhaps they'll resolve never to watch another one of these). LIVE updates, analysis and reaction Trump and Biden clash angrily on Covid and race Fact-checking the candidates' claims It was clear early on what kind of ""debate"" this would be. Donald Trump's objective was to rattle Joe Biden - and he planned to do it by constantly interrupting the former vice-president. By CBS News's count, Trump cut in on Biden a total of 73 times. That made for a series of chaotic exchanges, which included Trump questioning Biden's intelligence and Biden calling Trump a clown, shushing him and asking, indignantly: ""Will you shut up, man?"" Time and time again, Trump would snipe at Biden, leaving the Democrat laughing and shaking his head. As moderator Chris Wallace announced that the coronavirus was the next topic and that both candidates would have two-and-a-half uninterrupted minutes to answer, Biden quipped: ""Good luck with that."" Moderating this prestigious primetime event may have been the worst job in America on Tuesday night. The coronavirus was always going to be difficult terrain for the president - and the topic came up early in the debate. Trump had to defend a pandemic response that has resulted in more than 200,000 American deaths. He did so by saying the steps he's taken prevented more deaths and suggesting Biden would have made things worse. Biden's reply was to talk directly at the camera, asking the viewers if they could believe Trump (polls indicate a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the pandemic). Brian Chellgren - an attorney and a conservative-leaning moderate:It was expected to be chaotic, and it was chaotic. Trump controlled the message with more interrupting, talking and controlling. Biden withstood it better than I thought he would. He got a little hot in the collar a few times. I didn't see any big eye-catching gaffes. I thought Biden had a good few periods where he aimed his message directly at the camera and to the public. Keirsten Greggs - a talent recruiter and a progressive voter:At the end of the day, the loser was really us, the American people. A lot of people were expecting this to go the way that it did. Joshua Roizman - a recent college graduate voting for Biden:Biden came out on top. He came out with a strong message and I can't tell you enough how much it mattered that he looked into the camera. Ariel Hedlund - right-leaning independent voting for Trump:I think Trump's strongest point was when he talked about what he accomplished and what he will accomplish. On the other hand, Biden did really well when he spoke directly to the American people but he never gave us details and facts. I must say Vice-President Biden did much better than I expected. Read the BBC voters' panel views in full here. ""A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker,"" said Biden. In one telling exchange, Trump boasted about the size of his campaign rallies, held outside because that's what the ""experts"" - with emphasis on that word - suggest. He then said Biden held smaller rallies because he couldn't attract larger crowds. ""People want their places open,"" Trump said. ""People want to be safe,"" Biden countered. That back-and-forth demonstrated a fundamental difference in the way the two candidates view the pandemic and whether the situation is getting better - or worse. A debate format that lumped together race issues and urban violence led to feisty exchanges that made clear Biden was more comfortable talking about the former, while Trump wanted to discuss the latter. Biden accused the president of fomenting racist divisions, while Trump swiped at Biden's support for a 1993 anti-crime bill that led to higher incarceration rates for black people. Biden would later go on the attack against Trump for saying Democratic-backed housing proposals meant to increase diversity were threatening to destroy the suburbs of American cities. ""This is not 1950, all these dog-whistles and racism don't work anymore,"" Biden said. ""The suburbs are by and large integrated."" He added that the real threat to the suburbs was Covid-19 and climate change. This video can not be played Trump: ""I don't know who the Proud Boys are"" Trump was offered the chance to directly renounce right-wing violence - from white supremacists and militias. He said he would, but then he didn't, instead telling one far-right group, the Proud Boys, to ""stand back and stand by"" (an answer the organisation has subsequently celebrated). Trump then pivoted to attack antifa, a loose collection of anti-fascist activists, and left-wing mobs. When Biden was asked about whether, as the self-professed leader of the Democratic Party, he had called on the mayor of Portland or the governor of Oregon to take steps to stop the unrest in that city, he demurred, saying he no longer held elective office. Wallace had given both candidates a chance to cut against their own bases, which can at times be a wise political strategy. Instead, they both dodged and danced. The death of George Floyd and resulting conversations about institutional racism and police violence led to mass demonstrations the likes of which the US has not seen in decades. Tuesday's debate shed little light on those history-making moments. A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Why we might not get a result on election night Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? What Joe Biden wants to do Full coverage of the US election If there's a message the Trump campaign wanted Americans to take away from this debate - a clip that was tweeted out from the president's account even as the debate was ongoing - it's that Joe Biden had almost half a century in public office to solve the problems facing the country, and those problems are still around. ""In 47 months, I've done more than you've done in 47 years,"" Trump told the vice-president. Biden's response came later in the debate. ""Under this president we've become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided and more violent,"" he said. In 2016, Trump successfully ran against Washington and the status quo. Doing so again after sitting in the Oval Office for three-and-a-half years was always going to be a challenge, but the way he might pull it off is by using Biden's longevity in public life against him. This video can not be played President Donald Trump clashes with moderator Chris Wallace. One of Trump's goals during this debate - and throughout the whole campaign - has been to paint Biden as beholden to the left wing of his party. Biden, in his very first exchange with the president, outlined his defence. The opening topic for tonight's debate was the Supreme Court, but Biden quickly turned the discussion to the Affordable Care Act - which is at risk because of a pending case before the high court. Trump tried to accuse Biden of supporting ""socialised medicine"" and pushing to do away with private insurance, prompting the Democrat to say that wasn't in his plan - and he's the one who won the Democratic presidential nomination. ""I am the Democratic Party right now,"" he said. ""The platform of the Democratic Party is what I approved."" The tactic re-emerged later on, during an exchange on climate change, when Trump tried to tie Biden to the massive spending and regulation proposals in the ""Green New Deal"" programme embraced by many on the left. ""I don't support the Green New Deal,"" Biden said. ""I support the Biden plan I put forward."" ""Oh, you don't?"" Trump asked. ""Well, that's a big statement."" Biden, in drawing distinction with progressives in his party, seemed confident that his left flank would hold when it was time to vote. When the New York Times story about Trump's taxes broke on Sunday night, it was viewed as a bombshell - the public was finally getting a look at information the president had, in a break with tradition, withheld for years. Political analysts and prognosticators wondered how Trump would handle this during the debate. When the topic came up, however, Donald Trump offered a similar defence to the one he provided in 2016, when he boasted how he knew the tax code better than any previous candidate - and his ability to avoid a larger tax bill was simply his taking advantage of the law. Biden, for his part, tried to turn the topic into a condemnation of Republican-passed tax reform. While he noted that Trump paid less in federal taxes than schoolteachers, that message - which could have been a powerful attack - got buried in an ensuing scuffle with the president. If Trump's tax returns have any legs as an issue in this campaign, it won't be because of this debate. The closing segment of the debate was on election security and concerns - presented by both the left and the right - that the election will not be free and fair. When it came to the details of the discussion, if you can call it that, they mostly revolved around Trump sharing a series of misleading anecdotes that he says demonstrated that mail-in voting, which millions of Americans will rely on this year, is fraught with corruption and incompetence. ""This will not end well,"" Trump said at one point - a sentiment that many Americans on both sides of the political aisle will agree with, albeit for different reasons. Biden, for his part, tried to take the high ground. He called for all the ballots to be counted and promised to respect the results of the election once a winner had been decided. It seemed he had a few more points to make in conclusion, but Trump interrupted him again and then Wallace announced the debate was over. It was a sudden end to a chaotic evening that can hardly be called a debate in any traditional sense of the word. These events rarely swing an election one way or another, and this one was such a muddled mess it seems unlikely minds were changed. That's probably bad news for Trump, given that one of his real weaknesses has been with suburban woman voters who say they're turned off by the president's sometimes coarse manner. Then again, if Trump's goal was to turn this campaign into an ugly scrum, leaving voters alienated from the process and uncertain about whether there will be any kind of clarity or resolution at the end, it was an evening's work well done.
